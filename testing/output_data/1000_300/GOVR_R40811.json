    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to unnaturally high accumulations of biomass. Congress is urged to provide more funding and authority for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels and wildfire severity. Existing authorities for federal agencies to reduce biomass fuel are broad but indirect, with annual appropriations for hazardous fuels treatments and other management activities. Congress provides annual appropriations for hazardous fuels treatments and other management activities related to fuel reduction efforts. However, the reporting on funding and accomplishments for these activities is insufficient for assessing progress in reducing biomass fuels. Improved reporting on funding and accomplishments for prescribed burning, thinning, and other fuel reduction efforts by ecosystem or fire regime would enhance understanding of the results of appropriations for wildfire protection. Improved reporting on funding and accomplishments for prescribed burning, thinning, and other fuel reduction efforts by ecosystem or fire regime may help Congress in allocating appropriate funding among activities and agencies. In temperate ecosystems, wildfires are inevitable due to dry conditions and ignitions, with some fires burning surface fuels while others become high-intensity crown fires. All biomass is potential fuel for wildfires. Wildfires can vary in intensity, from low-intensity surface fires to high-intensity crown fires. The behavior of a wildfire depends on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Efforts to prevent or minimize damages caused by crown fires focus on altering fuel characteristics. Four key characteristics of biomass fuels that affect wildfire behavior are moisture content, size, distribution, and quantity. Moisture content is considered the most important property. Fuels significantly affect wildfire behavior and fire effects, with moisture content being the most important property. Green foliage and dead biomass have varying moisture levels, with ignition possible at 20%-30% moisture content. Once ignited, biomass with 100% moisture content can burn, especially in high winds. Time to describe potential wildfire fuels is based on how quickly they can ignite. Wildfire fuels are categorized based on their moisture content and time to ignite. Fine fuels like needles and leaves dry out in about an hour, while woody twigs and branches take around 10 hours. Larger fuels can take up to 1,000 hours to dry out. Fine fuels are crucial for spreading fires due to their ability to ignite quickly. The larger wildfire fuels, such as 100-hour and 1,000-hour time lag fuels, burn intensely and contribute significantly to the rate of spread. Fine fuels ignite quickly and are crucial for spreading fires, while 1-hour time lag fuels have little mass and burn rapidly. Firebrands can be carried by winds, starting spot fires ahead of the main fire. Fuel distribution plays a crucial role in wildfire behavior, with compact fuel beds being more resistant to burning due to reduced ventilation. Highly compact fuels slow moisture loss and restrict air flow to the fire, while less compact fuels allow for more air flow, drying out the fuels and feeding the fire. The larger fuels, such as 1,000-hour time lag fuels, burn intensely and contribute to the damage caused by fires, but do not significantly impact the rate of spread as they are slow to ignite and heavy to be carried aloft as firebrands. Fuel distribution is crucial in wildfire behavior. Compact fuel beds resist burning by reducing ventilation, while less compact fuels allow for more air flow, drying out the fuels and feeding the fire. The continuity of fuels is important for fire spread, with firelines breaking this continuity to control wildfires. Factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed affect the ease of ignition and flammability of the fuel. Steep slopes and high winds can reduce fuel moisture content and raise temperatures, making the fuel more flammable. Factors like slope and wind speed play a significant role in wildfire behavior by reducing fuel moisture content and raising temperatures, making the fuel more flammable. Steep slopes and high winds bring the fire's convection column closer to the fuel, while vertical continuity, especially fuel ladders, can spread fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire. Wind is crucial for initiating and sustaining a crown fire by pre-heating the green foliage and reducing its moisture content. When burning, pre-heating the green foliage of the canopy reduces fuel moisture content and raises temperatures. Wind is essential for initiating and sustaining a crown fire, as it can increase intensity and spread. Fuel loads vary widely, including dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees, ranging from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre. Fuel loads can range from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre, including grasses, forbs, shrubs, small trees, and undesirable trees. Live crown biomass in valuable trees plays a significant role in sustaining crown fires. Not all fuel is consumed in a wildfire, with smaller fuels being mostly consumed. In a wildfire, smaller fuels are largely consumed while larger fuels remain. The nature of fuel characteristics and resulting fires are influenced by different ecosystems, some adapted to low-intensity surface fires, others to high-intensity crown fires, and some to a mixed regime. Many ecosystems in the US are adapted to frequent wildfires. Many ecosystems in the United States are adapted to frequent wildfires, occurring at least every 30 years. These ecosystems have large amounts of fine fuels like grasses and needles, with open spaces due to frequent fires killing seedlings and shrubs. Examples include ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine ecosystems, where crown fires are rare. Surface-fire ecosystems make up about 34% of all U.S. wildlands. In yellow pine ecosystems, crown fires are rare due to the lack of small to mid-sized trees for fuel ladders. Surface-fire ecosystems in the U.S. historically had grasses, needles, and low-growing shrubs as primary fuels, but heavy grazing and logging practices altered fuel loads, leading to an increase in branches and smaller trees. Fire suppression further exacerbated fuel loads by eliminating low-intensity surface fires. In many Western ecosystems, fire suppression and altered fuel loads have increased the risk of catastrophic crown fires, threatening frequent surface fire ecosystems. Activities to reduce fuel loads can mitigate wildfire severity. Conversely, ecosystems adapted to high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels from previous fires. Ecosystems adapted to periodic, high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels with plants of the same size and age. Fires in these ecosystems can be relatively frequent, less than 50 years apart, or infrequent, with 200 years or more between fires. Examples include chaparral in southern California and lodgepole pine stands that regenerate after fires. Crown-fire ecosystems, such as lodgepole pine stands, have infrequent fires occurring every 200 years or more. These ecosystems contain dense, even-aged stands with serotinous cones that release seeds after being heated by fire. Human activities like grazing and logging have not significantly impacted fuel loads or fire behavior in these ecosystems. Fuel treatments have shown to be ineffective in reducing the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires in these ecosystems. Activities to reduce fuel loads and remove fuel ladders have shown to be ineffective in preventing catastrophic crown fires in ecosystems like southern California chaparral. Even in crown-fire ecosystems, wildfires are patchy and leave some areas lightly burned or unburned. For example, during the Yellowstone fires in 1988, 30% of the reported burned area was actually unburned, and another 15%-20% had only low-intensity burns. The Yellowstone fires in 1988 were largely in lodgepole pine and only about half of the reported acres burned severely. Some ecosystems consistently burn with crown fires mixed with low-intensity surface fires, like whitebark pine forests at high elevations. Whitebark pine forests at high elevations have often discontinuous crown canopies to prevent crown fires. The slow-growing whitebark pines moderate the micro-climate, allowing other species to grow. Mixed-intensity fires kill competing species, with Clark's nutcrackers spreading seeds for regeneration. Other ecosystems may have mixed-fire regimes under certain conditions. Mixed-fire-regime ecosystems, such as ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine forests, can have a combination of crown and surface fires. These ecosystems account for about 24% of U.S. wildlands, but the consequences of fuel reduction activities in these areas are not well understood. It is uncertain if fuel levels, sizes, and distributions are unnatural, leading to abnormal crown fire levels and intensities. The impact of fuel reduction activities on wildfire extent and severity in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems remains unclear. Reducing fuel loads in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems may not significantly alter wildfire extent or severity. While it can help suppress wildfires and reduce crown fire risk in some ecosystems, it may not be effective for all. Evidence from the Hayman Fire in 2002 questions the effectiveness of reducing fuel loads for protecting structures and communities from wildfires. Reducing fuel loads may not significantly alter wildfire extent or severity in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems. Evidence from the Hayman Fire in 2002 questions the effectiveness of reducing fuel loads for protecting structures and communities from wildfires. Of the 132 homes burned in the Hayman Fire, 70 were destroyed in association with crown fire, while 62 were destroyed by surface fire. Despite high-severity burns, 83% of homes within the fire perimeter survived relatively unscathed. Reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders may be necessary for safe low-intensity wildfire and prescribed fire use in surface-fire ecosystems. Proposed activities include prescribed burning, thinning, release, pruning, and salvage logging. However, some caution that these activities may not always reduce the risk of crown fires. Thinning and prescribed burning can alter microclimate, increasing surface fire intensity and the risk of crown fires. Prescribed burning involves deliberate use of fire under specific fuel and weather conditions. Prescribed burning is the intentional use of fire in specific areas under controlled conditions. It can lead to crown fires if overstory crowns ignite. Conditions must be carefully monitored to prevent fires from escaping control and causing extensive damage. Prescribed burning primarily eliminates fine and small fuels by converting biomass to smoke and ashes. However, it has limitations as it has little effect on large diameter fuels and is not effective in reducing tree density or crown density. Prescribed burning has limitations as it is not effective in reducing large diameter fuels, tree density, or crown density. It can also be risky, leading to notable wildfires and health hazards from smoke. Fire managers tend to err on the side of caution, resulting in high implementation costs. The federal land management agencies have policies in place to allow fire managers to use naturally-occurring fires for fire management objectives, known as wildland fire use. This practice involves allowing a wildfire to burn with monitoring, without aggressive suppression efforts, under appropriate conditions. The effects and risks are similar to prescribed burning, and the treated acres are counted as fuel reduction treatments. Thinning is the mechanical cutting and removing of trees in a stand, either for commercial use or precommercial purposes. The three basic approaches to thinning are low thinning, crown thinning, and uniform thinning. Thinning alters biomass fuels depending on the approach used and what is done with the biomass left on the site. Three basic approaches to thinning are low thinning, crown thinning, and selection thinning. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning for reducing fuels, such as being controlled and reducing crown density. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning for reducing fuels, such as creating targeted stand structure and reducing crown density. However, thinning leaves slash on the ground, increasing fuel load in the short run. Thinning has disadvantages compared to prescribed burning as it leaves slash on the ground, increasing fuel load. Slash must be treated to reduce fuel, but common treatments are labor-intensive and costly. Thinning can also increase fire hazards in the short run by concentrating biomass growth on fewer stems. Thinning of desired commercial trees can lead to larger, more valuable trees but may increase fire hazards in the short run. Thinning combined with prescribed burning is proposed to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires, but empirical evidence on its effectiveness is limited. The effectiveness of combining thinning with prescribed burning to reduce fire hazards is limited, with variable results and high costs. Logging, especially salvage logging of dead trees, is sometimes suggested but may not effectively reduce fuel loads or prevent canopy fires. Commercial logging can reduce crown density but leaves substantial slash, and its impact on fire incidence is untested in scientific literature. Logging reduces crown density, especially in clearcutting, but does little for fuel ladders and leaves slash. Commercial logging focuses on large trees and does not address crown base height, which contributes to the \"ladder effect\" in wildfires. Salvage of standing dead trees may reduce fuels, but standing dead trees with shed needles may contribute less to crown fires than live trees. Pruning trees by removing lower branches can reduce fuel ladders and crown density for wildfire protection. Pruning trees by removing lower branches can reduce fuel ladders and crown density for wildfire protection. Five federal agencies are responsible for wildfire protection of federal lands, but none are explicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels. Each agency is implicitly authorized to reduce fuels within its mandate to preserve and protect the lands. Since 1897, federal agencies like the Forest Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management have been implicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels for wildfire protection within their mandates to preserve and protect lands. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 further supports this authority by directing the management of public lands to protect various environmental qualities. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 provides implicit authority for federal agencies to manage public lands to protect various environmental qualities, including wildlife habitats and outdoor recreation. The Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs all have broad management directions for conservation and habitat preservation. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has explicit direction for Indian forest land management activities, including forest land development and protection against losses from wildfire. Despite general authority for biomass fuel reduction activities, agencies have specific funding programs for these activities. The Forest Service has accounts funding activities related to forest management. The Forest Service has funding programs for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels. The Hazardous Fuels sub-account is the primary source of funds for these activities, with funding increasing substantially in FY2001 and continuing to rise through FY2008. In FY2001, Hazardous Fuels funding increased significantly and continued to rise through FY2008. Funding jumped in FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation, then declined in recent years. Thinning activities, including fuel reduction and timber production, are funded within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account of the National Forest System line item. This account also covers reforestation, rangeland improvements, watershed protection, noxious weed control, and air quality management efforts. In FY2008, about 20% of appropriations to this account funded thinning and related activities. In FY2008, approximately 20% of appropriations to the Vegetation and Watershed Management account funded thinning and related activities. The Forest Service has three mandatory spending accounts that provide funds for activities to reduce biomass fuels, including Brush Disposal which collects deposits from timber purchasers for slash treatments like mechanical efforts, manual efforts, and prescribed burning. The Brush Disposal account collects funds from timber purchasers for slash treatments in national forests, including mechanical, manual, and prescribed burning methods. These activities aim to reduce fire hazards and are sometimes funded through the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund for reforestation and forest improvement following logging operations. The FS can use Knutson-Vandenberg funds for reforestation and forest improvement after logging, similar to Vegetation and Watershed Management Appropriations. Stewardship contracting allows for activities like thinning for fuel reduction in timber sale contracts. Funding details for thinning and wildfire protection improvements are not reported. The DOI agencies receive appropriations for fuel reduction activities, with the majority of funding coming from the Hazardous Fuels sub-account. The funds can be used for prescribed burning and other fuel reduction activities, but specific details on the amount used for each method and the ecosystems treated are not reported. Wildland Fire Management is now funded as a department-wide program, with funding increasing in FY2001. Wildland Fire Management was previously funded through the BLM, but is now funded as a department-wide program. DOI fuel reduction funding in the Hazardous Fuels sub-account increased in FY2001 and has remained stable. Other fuel reduction activities are funded through general land and resource management accounts for each DOI agency. The BLM receives funds from the Land Resources and Western Oregon Resources Management accounts, while the NPS has Park Protection and Resource Stewardship accounts for fuel reduction activities. Funds from various accounts within DOI agencies, such as the Western Oregon Resources Management account and Park Protection and Resource Stewardship accounts, could be used for fuel reduction activities to mitigate wildfire threats. Additionally, the FWS and BIA have accounts that could fund activities to reduce wildfire threats to wildlife habitats and Indian lands. The BLM and FS have accounts that can fund activities to reduce wildfire threats, including fuel reduction. However, the specific portion of funds allocated for these activities is unknown. Federal authorities for assisting fuel reduction on nonfederal lands are limited. The FS has two wildfire protection assistance programs that can include fuel reduction: State Fire Assistance and Volunteer Fire Assistance. State Fire Assistance provides technical and financial assistance to states for fire prevention, fire control, and prescribed burning. Allocation to states is discretionary, including the portion used for fuel reduction. Volunteer Fire Assistance is another program that offers assistance for wildfire protection activities. The FS has two wildfire protection assistance programs: State Fire Assistance and Volunteer Fire Assistance. State Fire Assistance provides technical and financial aid to states for fire prevention, control, and prescribed burning. Allocation to states is discretionary, including the portion for fuel reduction. Volunteer Fire Assistance offers assistance for wildfire protection activities, specifically for rural volunteer fire departments. The FS has a program created in the 2002 farm bill to support Community Wildfire Protection, including outreach, education, and establishing defensible space. Funding for fuel reduction is at the discretion of the agency, and the FS can assist in reducing biomass fuels on private lands with the landowner's consent. No funds have been appropriated for this program yet, but State Fire Assistance funding could be used. Other technical and financial assistance programs are available for forest stewardship on nonfederal lands. The FS has programs for Community Wildfire Protection, including fuel reduction and forest stewardship on private lands. State Fire Assistance funding could be used for implementing these programs, along with other technical and financial assistance programs available for forest health protection and emergency restoration. The specific allocation of funds for wildfire protection through biomass fuel reduction is currently unknown."
