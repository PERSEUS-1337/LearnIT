    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011, with restrictions on new programs. A detailed FY2011 DOD appropriations bill provided $659.9 billion, $18.2 billion less than requested by the President. H.R. 1473 provided $17.8 billion for DOD's military construction budget, a reduction of $2.2 billion from the President's request. The bill also included $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's request for broad categories of spending in DOD activities. The bill H.R. 1473 made significant cuts to various DOD programs, including $2.0 billion rescinded from prior fiscal years, $1.5 billion cut proportionately from various projects, $723 million from civilian pay, and $125 million from research and development corporations. It also reduced funding for major weapons programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, ground combat vehicle for the Army, and mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. These cuts partially offset the reductions in the President's DOD budget. The bill H.R. 1473 made significant cuts to various DOD programs, including $2.0 billion rescinded from prior fiscal years, $1.5 billion cut proportionately from various projects, $723 million from civilian pay, and $125 million from research and development corporations. It also reduced funding for major weapons programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, ground combat vehicle for the Army, and mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. The bill added funds to the budget request for various programs, including Navy strike fighters, equipment for the National Guard and reserve components, medical research programs, Israeli missile defense systems, and the Military Career Advancement Account program. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorized $725.9 billion for DOD and defense-related activities, $2.7 million less than requested. The Senate version reduced this to $725.7 billion. The bill did not allocate funds for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate did not act on the bill due to opposition to repealing a law barring openly homosexual individuals from military service. The Senate version of the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act reduced funding by $240.7 million from the Administration's request. The bill included a provision to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, but it was dropped in a compromise version (H.R. 6523) that was signed into law on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383). The bill H.R. 6523, signed into law on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383), supported President Obama's position by not adding funds for the C-17 cargo plane production. It authorized a 1.9% increase in military personnel pay and $485 million for an alternate F-35 jet engine, contrary to the President's requests. The enacted version of the FY2011 bill, H.R. 6523, authorized a 1.4% basic pay raise for military personnel and $485 million for the alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, in line with the President's requests. The President's FY2011 budget request included $738.7 billion for national defense, with the largest component being defense-related activities of the Department of Defense and Energy Department. The FY2011 budget for function 050, which includes military activities and defense-related activities, totals $733.3 billion in discretionary spending. This includes $548.9 billion for regular operations of the Department of Defense and $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Total DOD request for FY2011 is $708.3 billion. The FY2011 budget for the Department of Defense included $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, with a total request of $708.3 billion. An additional $33 billion was requested for war costs in FY2010 to cover the deployment of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. The FY2010 DOD appropriations bill enacted in December 2009 allocated $162.6 billion for war costs, with a shift in emphasis from Iraq to Afghanistan. An additional $655 million was requested for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the earthquake. The DOD allocated funds for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, including deploying Navy ships, cargo flights, and military personnel. The budget request for FY2011 includes a 3.4% increase for the DOD base budget and real growth in spending for other security agencies like the Department of State and Homeland Security. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for discretionary programs of security agencies, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. For non-security agencies, the request was $386.4 billion, a 1.5% decrease from FY2010. The $548.9 billion requested for the FY2011 DOD base budget is $18.2 billion higher than FY2010, providing a 3.4% increase in real purchasing power. The FY2011 DOD base budget request is $18.2 billion higher than FY2010, representing a 3.4% increase in real purchasing power. This continues the upward trend in DOD base budgets since FY1998. Adjusted for inflation, the FY2011 base budget would be the third largest since the end of the Korean War. The Administration projects annual increases in the DOD base budget for the following four years, exceeding inflation by 0.8% on average. The Administration projects annual increases in the DOD base budget for the four years following FY2011, falling short of the 2% real growth rate Defense Secretary Robert Gates deemed necessary. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap between sustaining the current force and future budgets. Secretary Gates proposed shifting funds within the budget to support combat forces by reducing spending on administrative and support activities, aiming to cut overhead costs and sustain the current force structure amidst challenging economic circumstances. Secretary Gates proposed increasing funds for combat forces by reducing spending on administrative and support activities, aiming to cut overhead costs and sustain the current force structure amidst challenging economic circumstances. Gates aims to convert \"tail\" to \"tooth\" to provide roughly two to three percent real growth, with a shift of about $10 billion from support functions to directly support combat units. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce costs in DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in service support contractors funding, cutting the number of generals, admirals, and senior DOD civilians, and eliminating certain departments. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce costs in DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in service support contractors funding, cutting the number of senior DOD civilians by 150 over the next two years, and eliminating certain departments like the Joint Forces Command and the Business Transformation Agency. Additionally, he introduced contracting and acquisition initiatives to increase efficiency in DOD's spending on goods and services, aiming to save costs in the department's annual budget. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement of new systems, contracting revisions to reward efficiency, and changes in contracting rules to reduce costs for DOD's services contracts. Some Members of Congress argue that the projected budget increases may be insufficient due to rising costs. Representative McKeon stated that a 1% real growth in the defense budget over five years would result in a net cut for investment and procurement accounts. The planned budgets would force DOD to scale back some acquisition programs, with some Members objecting to exempting DOD from the budget freeze. Representative Barney Frank has called for DOD budget reductions by terminating unnecessary weapons programs and reducing overseas military deployments. President Obama's exemption of the military budget from deficit reduction efforts may lead to failure or devastating cuts. President Obama's decision to exempt the military budget from deficit reduction efforts could result in failure or severe cuts to federal programs aimed at improving quality of life. The FY2011 DOD base budget request remains at 3.6% of GDP, showing a leveling off in the DOD's share of GDP since 9/11. While the FY2011 budget sustains previous initiatives, significant changes to major weapons programs are not as prevalent as in the FY2010 request. The FY2011 DOD budget request sustains previous initiatives and reflects the strategy outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review. There is a shift towards preparing U.S. forces for a diverse array of missions, moving away from Cold War-era strategies. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be ready for a diverse array of missions, moving away from Cold War-era strategies. The top priority is fighting and winning ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, requiring increased funding for capabilities like helicopters and UAVs. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends increased funding for capabilities like helicopters, UAVs, intelligence, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft for counterinsurgency, stability, and counter-terrorism operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade and potentially more in the future. The report assumes that no adversary in the next 10-20 years will directly confront U.S. conventional military capabilities. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review predicts that future global threats will challenge U.S. forces asymmetrically, using unconventional tactics and technologies. It challenges the idea of a conflict spectrum and suggests that both terrorist groups and near-peer competitors may use advanced technologies and guerrilla-like tactics. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review highlights the evolving nature of global threats, ranging from unsophisticated insurgents to sophisticated national armies. Emphasizing the importance of military operations in cyberspace, the report calls for strengthening capabilities to defend cyber-networks through various specific steps. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to DOD operations in cyberspace, greater cyber expertise within DOD, centralized command of cyber operations, and collaboration with other agencies for enhanced cyber security. It maintains the policy of being able to win two major regional wars simultaneously but also stresses the importance of flexibility in handling multiple missions globally. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review highlights the importance of preparing U.S. forces for various missions globally, including handling asymmetric threats like \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities developed by potential adversaries like China and Iran. This includes stabilizing countries, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency missions, and supporting civil authorities in times of disaster or terrorist attacks. China and other potential adversaries are developing technologies to target U.S. forward bases and naval forces, crucial for projecting power globally. These capabilities are expensive, leading to high defense spending. Overseas bases and naval forces, including aircraft carriers, are increasingly vulnerable to missile and bomber attacks. The U.S. power projection capabilities are becoming more vulnerable to various types of attacks, including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and submarines. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) suggests countering these threats by increasing reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines that are less susceptible to anti-access strategies. This may involve deploying a new manned or unmanned bomber armed with long-range cruise missiles for stand-off attacks. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for increased reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines to counter anti-access strategies. This may involve developing offensive electronic attack capabilities and missile defense measures to protect forward deployed forces. The budget also includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, a 4.7% increase over FY2000. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, a 4.7% increase over FY2000. This marks a rebound in active-duty manpower following reductions that began in the 1990s. The Army and Marine Corps have met their end-strength goals earlier than planned. In Afghanistan and Iraq, the Army and Marine Corps reached end-strength goals of 562,400 and 202,100 personnel, respectively, three years ahead of schedule. Congress authorized a temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength to 569,400 in FY2011. The budget included a $1 billion raise in basic pay for military personnel, matching private-sector pay increases. Additionally, the Basic Allowance for Housing was set to increase by 4.2% in FY2011. Housing, a non-taxable cash payment for service members not in government housing, was set to increase by 4.2% in FY2011. Congress typically approves military pay raises 0.5% higher than ECI increase to address past pay gaps. DOD argues service members are well-paid compared to private sector workers and prefer to allocate funds to reenlistment bonuses and special pays. Advocacy groups push for higher raises to close the pay gap between military and civilian peers. The FY2011 DOD funding bills provided a platform for legislative initiatives regarding President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations on openly homosexual individuals serving in the military. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness. Legislation has been introduced to repeal the 1993 law and replace it with a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. President Obama has called for repealing the law and adopting a policy of nondiscrimination against persons with a same-sex orientation. DOD is conducting a study on how such a change in law and policy would impact the military. In his January 27, 2010, State of the Union Address, President Obama called for repealing the 1993 legislation and adopting a policy of nondiscrimination against persons with a same-sex orientation. DOD launched a study on how this change would be implemented, with Secretary Gates opposing repeal until the study is completed. Changes were made to enforcement procedures, requiring allegations of homosexual conduct to be given under oath. Senators and a Representative proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 law in a letter to President Obama. In a letter to President Obama, Senators and a Representative proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service, contingent on completion of the current DOD review and certification from key officials. In response to proposed legislation to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military, the Administration supported the draft amendment despite preferring to wait for the completion of the current DOD study. Secretary Gates accepted the language in the proposed amendment after Congress indicated that waiting for the review was not possible. On September 9, 2010, Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the 1993 law unconstitutional. On October 12, 2010, Judge Phillips enjoined DOD from enforcing the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Act, which was ruled unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit temporarily stayed the injunction on October 19, 2010. Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley limited the authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior. The FY2011 budget requested $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system. The FY2011 budget included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system, serving 9.5 million beneficiaries through various medical facilities. The system's cost has more than doubled in the past decade and is projected to increase annually by 5-7% through FY2015. The DOD health care system's budget has steadily increased due to various factors, including more retirees using TRICARE, increased frequency of beneficiaries using services, legislative benefit increases, and unchanged fees since 1995. Proposed fee increases by the Bush Administration were blocked by Congress, and the Obama Administration did not propose any fee changes in the 2011 budget. In FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009, proposed fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries were blocked by Congress. The Obama Administration did not propose fee changes in the 2011 budget. Secretary Gates expressed a desire to work with Congress to control program costs. The FY2011 request aimed to increase funding for weapons and equipment procurement. The FY2011 budget aimed to increase funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a shift in budget allocation towards procurement and away from R&D. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program saw a slight increase in total budget request, with more funds allocated to procurement than R&D. In FY2010, $11.2 billion was appropriated, with $4.0 billion for R&D and $7.2 billion for procurement. The FY2011 budget request included $2.3 billion for R&D and $9.0 billion for procurement, with proposed cuts in major weapons programs. No funds were allocated for additional C-17 jets or an alternate F-35 engine. Congress added funding for these programs in 2009. In FY2010, Congress added $2.5 billion for 10 C-17s and $465 million for an alternate engine. Some Members of Congress questioned the Army's BCT Modernization program, which replaced the FCS program. The controversial element is the proposed new Ground Combat Vehicle. Secretary of Defense Gates recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle in 2009. In 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle component of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program due to design flaws and lack of adaptation to lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army then launched the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program to field a family of fighting vehicles based on mature technologies by 2015-2017. The Army launched the GCV program to replace the MGV component of the FCS program, aiming to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017. Congress may question if the Army is rushing the development of the GCV, potentially inviting undue risk. The Army cancelled the existing competition for the GCV development contract in August 2010, revising performance specifications before restarting the competition in November 2010. The Army restarted the GCV competition in November 2010 as part of the BCT Modernization program. The FCS components planned for deployment have not shown effectiveness in field exercises. The Navy's FY2011 budget included funding for nine new battle force ships. The FY2011 budget requested funding for nine new battle force ships, including submarines, destroyers, LCSs, and amphibious assault ships. The Navy's 5-year shipbuilding plan aims for 50 new ships, with half being LCSs or JHSVs. The 30-year plan projects a fleet growth to 315 ships by FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024 before declining below 313 ships in FY2027. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to grow the fleet from 284 ships in FY2011 to 315 ships in FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024. However, it is projected to drop below 313 ships in FY2027 and decline further in the latter years. The plan would require an average of $15.9 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars, but a Congressional Budget Office report estimates it would need about 18% more funding. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the Navy's shipbuilding plan would require an average of $19.0 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars, 18% more than Navy estimates. The plan includes development of 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines to replace the current Ohio-class submarines. The SSBN(X) program received $497.4 million in research and development funding in the Navy's FY2010 budget. The Navy plans to procure 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, known as SSBN(X)s, to replace the current Ohio-class submarines. The program received significant funding in the Navy's FY2010 budget and is estimated to cost $6 billion to $7 billion per submarine. Concerns have been raised about the program's impact on the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding program. The Navy plans to procure 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, known as SSBN(X)s, to replace the current Ohio-class submarines. Concerns have been raised about the program's impact on the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding program, with observers worried that procuring 12 SSBN(X)s could lead to reductions in procurement rates for other types of Navy ships. Options for reducing costs include procuring fewer than 12 SSBN(X)s or reducing the number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Options for reducing the cost of the SSBN(X) program or its impact on other Navy shipbuilding programs include procuring fewer submarines, reducing the number of ballistic missiles per submarine, stretching out the procurement schedule, using split funding, funding from a different DOD budget, and increasing the Navy's shipbuilding budget. The FY2010 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. The Navy's FY2010 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. Congress supported this proposal and the Navy's FY2011 budget called for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The Navy also proposed terminating the CG(X) cruiser program as unaffordable and instead plans to build an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version, starting in FY2016. Flight III DDG-51s are to carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar. The Navy plans to procure the Flight III version of the DDG-51 starting in FY2016. This version will carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar. The Aegis ballistic missile defense program aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. The Navy plans to increase the number of BMD-capable Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. Concerns arise over the growing demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships, potentially straining the Navy's ability to provide ships for non-BMD missions. The Aegis BMD program is mainly funded through MDA's budget, with additional funding from the Navy. MDA's proposed FY2011 budget requested $2,161.6 million for the Aegis BMD program. The Aegis BMD program is funded through MDA's budget and the Navy's budget. The proposed FY2011 budget requested $2,161.6 million for the Aegis BMD program and $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. FY2011 issues for Congress included decisions on the Flight III DDG-51 design, funding requests for the Aegis BMD program, and direction for MDA or the Navy. Additionally, $1.59 billion was requested for two Littoral Combat Ships. The FY2011 budget requested $1.59 billion for two Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) out of a planned force of 55. The LCS are small vessels designed for shallow water operations with interchangeable weapons modules for various missions. The Navy accelerated its timetable to choose between two different LCS designs by selecting one design for all future procurements, with the winning contractor building 10 LCSs over five years. The Navy accelerated its timetable for choosing between two LCS designs, selecting one design for all future procurements. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over five years, with a second competition for up to five additional LCSs. Navy officials later sought approval to buy 10 ships from each competing industry team. In early 2009, the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps faced a fighter aircraft shortage due to budget constraints. Air Force projected a shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy anticipated a shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Congress was concerned about the overall tactical aircraft situation. The Air Force and Navy are facing fighter aircraft shortages, with projections of up to 800 aircraft shortfall by 2024 for the Air Force and over 100 aircraft shortfall by 2018 for the Navy. Congress is concerned about the affordability of modernizing the tactical aircraft force, especially with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter being a key component in DOD's plans. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is crucial for the DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans, with a total estimated acquisition cost of over $300 billion. The program includes multiple versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, with hundreds more to be purchased by U.S. allies. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the F-35 program, raising concerns about its affordability as a strike fighter. The F-35 program requires over $10 billion annually for acquisition funding, raising concerns about affordability in the face of other budgetary challenges. Supporters argue that the F-35 is a cost-effective strategy for the DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans. The F-35, a relatively affordable aircraft, is being procured in different versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The British government plans to reduce their purchase of F-35s from 138 to as few as 40, excluding the vertical-takeoff \"B\" model. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the program for an alternative engine. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program includes the development of the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the F136 engine program despite the Administration's attempts to do so. Approximately $2.5 billion has been provided for the alternate engine program, with an estimated additional $2.9 billion needed for completion by 2017. Critics argue against terminating the F136 engine program. Critics argue that terminating the F136 alternate engine program for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was driven by immediate budget pressures rather than long-term considerations. They believe engine competition saved money and increased reliability, while proponents of termination argue for single-source engine production contracts for long-term affordability. Cancelling the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks and fleet grounding with a single engine design and supplier. Cancelling the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks, fleet grounding, impact on the defense industrial base, U.S. relations with allied countries, and cost control in a single-supplier environment. Continuing F136 development may affect the F-35 acquisition program and outyear costs. The development raises concerns about the impact on the F-35 acquisition program, including possible reduction in the number of F-35s acquired if program funds are used for the alternate engine. It also raises issues of outyear costs and operational concerns from supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget requested $863.9 million in Air Force research and development funding for the acquisition of a new fleet of mid-air refueling tankers, designated KC-X, to replace the aging fleet of KC-135 tankers. On February 24, 2010, the Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for a program to build 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, valued at $35 billion. Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS competed with tanker designs based on the 767 jetliner and Airbus A330, respectively. Bidding closed on July 9, 2010, with three offerors submitting bids, including a variant of the An-124 freighter by a team of Antonov and U.S. Aerospace, which was excluded for arriving after the deadline. The KC-X acquisition program involved a competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS to build 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force. Boeing ultimately won the contract, with EADS deciding not to challenge the decision. The program was of significant interest due to its value, job creation potential, and importance to U.S. military operations. The history of previous attempts to acquire a new tanker is important for the context of the proposed KC-X competition. The Obama Administration replaced the Bush Administration's plan for a land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic with the Phased Adaptive Approach, deploying BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. The Obama Administration replaced the Bush Administration's plan for a land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic with the Phased Adaptive Approach, deploying BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend Europe and the United States against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for PAA programs, including $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for Aegis ship-borne BMD system development and procurement. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing saw a 20% reduction from FY2010. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing saw a 20% reduction from FY2010, with most of the decrease attributed to BRAC-related construction and privatization of military family housing. The FY2011 DOD bills provided a vehicle for Members of Congress opposed to the Navy's plan to move a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to Mayport, FL. The DOD's final report on the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review endorses the Navy's desire to establish Mayport as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port. The Department of Defense's final report on the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review supports the Navy's plan to establish Mayport, FL as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port. This move is aimed at mitigating risks and would require the construction of new nuclear support facilities. Members of Congress from Florida have expressed support for this proposal. The proposal to homeport an aircraft carrier at Mayport, FL has sparked support from certain Members of Congress from Florida, citing economic benefits and risk mitigation for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet CVNs. However, Members of Congress from Virginia have expressed skepticism, questioning the costs and benefits associated with the move. The Administration's budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam for 8,000 Marines and their families moving from Okinawa. Additional military personnel will also be relocated to Guam from the U.S. mainland by 2014-2016. The Department of Defense plans to relocate military personnel to Guam from the U.S. mainland by 2014-2016. Guam's population is about 178,000, and estimates suggest a potential increase of up to 56,000 due to the influx of military personnel, families, and supporting contractors. Concerns have been raised about whether Guam's infrastructure can support this surge in population. The Administration's budget supported the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection and operation. The reorganization of cyber forces integrated responsibility for offensive and defensive cyber operations under one organization. The integration of offensive and defensive cyber operations under the U.S. Cyber Command marked a departure from historical segregation. The NSA director was nominated to lead the new command while retaining the NSA directorship, raising concerns about the militarization of cyberspace and privacy implications for civilian information systems. The U.S. Cyber Command integrates offensive and defensive cyber operations, with the NSA director nominated to lead the new command. Concerns about militarization of cyberspace and privacy implications for civilian information systems have been raised. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes funding for the Cyber Command's establishment at Ft. Meade, MD. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes $105 million for the Cyber Command's temporary facilities at Ft. Meade, MD. The budget also reflects a shift in roles between DOD and the State Department for foreign assistance. The FY2011 NDAA legislation excludes two programs previously funded by DOD, now requested in the State Department budget: the \"Section 1207\" program and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. The State Department/USAID Complex Crisis Fund and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund are up for funding. The State Department will take responsibility for Iraq police training in FY2012. The DOD budget request for FY2011 includes funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund. The Department of State aims to rebalance roles between DOD and State. In its FY2011 budget request, the Department of State aims to rebalance roles between DOD and State in security assistance. The Administration is conducting an interagency review on security assistance authorities, with the Senate Armed Services Committee welcoming this review for enhancing U.S. security assistance. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates highlighted the importance of advising and mentoring foreign security forces in a speech on February 24, 2010. In a February 24, 2010 speech, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates emphasized the importance of advising and mentoring foreign security forces, aligning with recommendations from the Quadrennial Defense Review Report. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen also stressed the significance of military power as a potential first option, not just a last resort. In a speech on March 3, 2010, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen emphasized the importance of military power as a potential first option, when combined with diplomacy and other national instruments. This new approach aims to strengthen civilian capabilities in assisting foreign governments in conflict prevention and recovery, highlighting the evolving relationship between defense and diplomacy. The Administration's FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for various security assistance programs, such as the \"Section 1206\" program, Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program, Defense Institution Reform Initiative, legal instruction for foreign military members, and the Stability Operations Fellowship Program. These programs aim to train and equip security forces of other countries threatened by terrorists and promote institutional development in foreign defense ministries. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for security assistance programs like legal instruction for foreign military members and the Stability Operations Fellowship Program. Secretary Gates emphasized the need for a modernized national security system, with roles of defense and diplomacy adapted to current threats. Congress has rejected the proposed Stability Operations Fellowship Program in the past. Some experts suggest a pooled fund for security assistance involving DOD, State, and USAID, awaiting the Administration's proposal. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act passed by the House authorizes $725.9 billion for DOD and defense-related activities, slightly less than the Administration's request. The Senate version of the bill would authorize $725.7 billion, with opposition to a provision repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The Senate version of the bill, S. 3454, was set aside after failing to invoke cloture on the motion to begin consideration. A compromise version, H.R. 6523, was negotiated without the provision related to the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. It was signed into law on January 7, 2011. The \"don't ask; don't tell\" policy was cleared for the President on December 22, 2010, and signed on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383). H.R. 6523 authorized lump-sum totals for appropriations in the DOD and Energy Department budgets. The defense authorization bill authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the active-duty components of the armed services, an increase of 7,400 over FY2010. The defense authorization bill (P.L. 111-383) authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the active-duty components of the armed services, an increase of 7,400 over FY2010. The bill also included a 1.4% increase in military basic pay, as requested by the Administration. The final bill did not include provisions for increased monthly allowances for married personnel separated by deployment or personnel at risk of hostile fire. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives for recruiting and retaining qualified individuals in essential specialties. They also directed a review of the process for determining housing allowance sizes for service members. The FY2011 defense authorization act did not include controversial provisions for increased monthly allowances for married personnel separated by deployment or personnel at risk of hostile fire. The final version of the FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. The House had adopted an amendment to repeal this legislation after the completion of a DOD review and certification by key officials. The FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. The Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate had voted on including a provision for repeal, but it was not included in the final version of the bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted on including a provision for repeal in the FY2011 defense authorization act, but it was not included in the final version of the bill. Senator John McCain argued that Senate action was premature as the DOD had not completed its review on the effects of repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The motion to invoke cloture failed, and the final bill did not include a provision to repeal the existing law prohibiting the use of military facilities for abortion. The final version of the bill did not include a provision to repeal the existing law prohibiting the use of military facilities for abortion. It also did not include a House-passed provision for a pilot program allowing officers to pursue varied mid-career educational programs and assignments outside of their service. The final version of the bill included provisions from a DOD commission on sexual assault, establishing the director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office. It also authorized a pilot program for officers to pursue mid-career educational programs and assignments outside of their service. The final version of the bill on sexual assault in the military establishes the director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, improves medical care protocols for victims, and ensures access to victim advocates. It does not include provisions for confidentiality of victim communications, legal assistance, or a hotline as in the original House-passed bill. The final version of the bill on sexual assault in the military, H.R. 6523, does not guarantee confidentiality of victim communications, legal assistance, or a hotline as in the original House-passed bill. It does require the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the feasibility of authorizing sexual assault victims to receive assistance from military legal counsel. The bill authorizes substantially all of the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program. The final version of the bill on military health care program, H.R. 6523, includes provisions prohibiting increases in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments, allowing coverage for dependent children up to age 26, and does not include a provision authorizing the President to establish. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) enacted in April 2010 did not include a House provision for a unified medical command under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. H.R. 6523 included a provision for training programs for officers in the services' medical corps in response to an incident at Fort Hood in November 2009. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions from H.R. 5136 related to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock. The House provision not included in the final bill would have provided special compensation for those targeted because of their affiliation with the U.S. military. The final bill included provisions for special compensation for individuals targeted because of their affiliation with the U.S. military, earmarking up to $100 million for recommendations from a panel analyzing the Fort Hood incident, and supporting ballistic missile defense activities. Both the House and Senate bills authorized slightly more than the $10.3 billion requested for missile defense. The final bill included provisions for special compensation for individuals targeted because of their affiliation with the U.S. military, earmarking up to $100 million for recommendations from a panel analyzing the Fort Hood incident, and supporting ballistic missile defense activities. Both bills authorized slightly more than the $10.3 billion requested for missile defense, with additional funding allocated for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system. The bill does not specify how the funds are allocated among specific programs. The bill does not specify how the funds are allocated among specific programs for the \"Iron Dome\" funding. The bill also includes provisions for special compensation for individuals targeted because of their affiliation with the U.S. military and supports ballistic missile defense activities. The Administration requested a total of $2.27 billion in FY2011 for programs. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for missile defense programs, including the Phased Adaptive Approach for Europe. The final authorization bill requires a DOD report on the PAA and places restrictions on its deployment in Europe. The authorization bill requires a DOD report on the Phased Adaptive Approach for Europe (PAA) and places restrictions on its deployment in Europe. It limits deployment of defenses against medium-range and long-range missiles until technology is proven effective, and restricts the use of funds for BMD deployments until necessary agreements are ratified. The bill allows the Secretary of Defense to waive restrictions for national security reasons. H.R. 6523 allows the Secretary of Defense to waive restrictions on the Phased Adaptive Approach for Europe in the interest of national security. It also authorizes the establishment of a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic. The final version of the bill includes statements endorsed by both the House-passed and Senate committee versions, such as the development of a future Standard missile to intercept Iranian ICBMs and the continuation of the two-stage ground-based interceptor program as a hedge against technical challenges. The final version of the authorization bill includes statements endorsing the development of a future Standard missile to intercept Iranian ICBMs and the continuation of the two-stage ground-based interceptor program as a hedge against technical challenges. It also does not include provisions from the House bill that would have restricted the reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons below New START Treaty limits until a detailed report is submitted to Congress. The final version of the authorization bill approved the $15.7 billion requested for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for specific programs such as two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two Littoral Combat Ships, and other vessels. Congress expressed concerns about the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review weakening U.S. security by ruling out the use of nuclear weapons in response to a catastrophic attack using chemical or biological weapons. The Navy shipbuilding authorization bill approved funding for various vessels, including two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two Littoral Combat Ships, and other ships. The request also included funding for a troop and cargo carrier, an oceanographic research ship, and increments for the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, an LHA-class helicopter carrier, and the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt carrier. Incremental funding is common for expensive ships, but unusual in the congressional appropriations process. Funding for very expensive ships, like aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, has become common in recent years. The congressional appropriations process typically requires full cost budgeting in one year, but there are exceptions for incremental funding. H.R. 6523 includes provisions for funding a helicopter carrier over two years and a report on the Navy's shipbuilding requirements in relation to the Administration's plan for regional missile defense deployments. The Administration's plan to use cruisers and destroyers equipped with the Aegis anti-missile system for regional missile defense deployments may impact shipbuilding requirements. The demand for Aegis missile-defense ships is expected to exceed supply, leading to concerns about the size of the fleet. The final authorization bill did not include provisions to prevent a decline in fleet size, such as blocking the retirement of large helicopter carriers without replacements or limiting ship retirements until the fleet reaches its goal of 313 ships. The Senate committee expressed concerns about the Navy's shipbuilding schedule and its impact on commercial shipyards. They directed assessments on how the Navy's plans would affect the Marine Corps's ability to conduct amphibious landings. Navy and Marine Corps leaders agreed on the need for 38 amphibious landing ships to support assault landings, but the Navy's plan only includes 33 ships. The Senate committee raised concerns about the Navy's shipbuilding schedule and its impact on commercial shipyards. They questioned the Navy's plan to replace Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with a new class of submarines, designated SSBN(X), which could potentially crowd out the construction of other planned ships due to their high cost. The new SSBN(X) submarines are expected to absorb a large share of the Navy's shipbuilding budgets after 2016, potentially crowding out the construction of other planned ships. The final version of the authorization bill approved a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without allocating specific program funds. The bill did not include a provision to limit Navy spending on the program until certain information is submitted by the Secretary of Defense. Neither the House-passed nor the Senate committee-reported bill authorized funds for the production of the C-17 cargo jet. The final authorization bill did not include a provision to limit Navy spending on the program until certain information is submitted by the Secretary of Defense. Congress had previously added funds to continue C-17 production despite objections from the Bush and Obama Administrations. The bill also addressed cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and included a provision for DOD to create a detailed progress assessment plan for the program. The final authorization bill for the F-35 program did not include a provision to limit Navy spending until certain information is submitted by the Secretary of Defense. It addressed cost overruns in the program and required DOD to create a detailed progress assessment plan. The bill authorized $11 billion for F-35 development and procurement of 42 planes, rejecting a request for an additional $205 million for a replacement fighter lost in combat operations. The House-passed bill rejected a request for an additional $205 million for a replacement fighter lost in combat operations. The bill also included $485 million for the development of an alternate jet engine for the F-35, which was not supported by the Senate committee. The final bill did not take a specific position on the additional funding for the second engine. The final bill did not include a Senate committee provision that would have barred the expenditure of any additional funds for the alternate engine unless the Secretary of Defense certified that the project would reduce costs and improve readiness of the F-35 fleet without disrupting the development program or reducing the number of planes purchased. Secretary Gates intended to recommend a veto on any defense bill funding the alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees argued against the Navy's planned aircraft procurement budgets leading to a drop in carrier-borne planes. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees are concerned about the impact of delays in the F-35 program on the number of carrier-borne fighters. To address the \"strike fighter gap,\" additional funding for F/A-18E/F model fighters was proposed in both the House-passed bill and the Senate committee-reported bill. The enacted bill does not specify the number of planes authorized but includes a provision for the Navy to report on the cost and risks of extending the service life of F/A-18s to address the projected gap. The enacted bill includes provisions for the Navy to address the projected strike fighter gap by extending the service life of F/A-18s or reducing the number of planes in certain squadrons. It also authorizes funding for the development of the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker, with a requirement for DOD to consider unfair competitive advantages in tanker bids. The amendment to H.R. 5136 requires DOD to consider unfair competitive advantages in tanker bids, specifically targeting EADS for receiving government subsidies. Despite support from various House Members, the provision was not included in the final bill. DOD ultimately selected Boeing's tanker design, the KC-46A. The DOD selected Boeing's tanker design, the KC-46A, over EADS. Both H.R. 5136 and S. 3454 would deny authorization for part of the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. This program is the successor to the terminated Future Combat Systems due to complexity and cost issues. The House and Senate committee recommended cutting funding for the Non-Line of Sight missile program and the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. The House bill made a larger cut of $347.4 million compared to the Senate committee's $29.7 million reduction. Both bills authorized $934.4 million for the development of a new family of Ground Combat Vehicles. The House Armed Services Committee recommended a less technologically ambitious approach for the new combat vehicle program in the BCT Modernization program. They urged the Army to focus on developing vehicles meeting basic requirements and consider upgrading current fleet vehicles. A provision in the bill allowed the Army to spend only half of the FY2011 GCV appropriation until providing detailed plans to the committee. DOD later reduced its FY2011 GCV funding request to $461 million. The House Armed Services Committee recommended a less ambitious approach for the new combat vehicle program, urging the Army to focus on basic requirements and consider upgrading current fleet vehicles. A provision in the bill allowed the Army to spend only half of the FY2011 GCV appropriation until providing detailed plans to the committee. DOD later reduced its FY2011 GCV funding request to $461 million. The enacted version of the authorization bill did not include a House provision barring funds for planning and designing structures at the Naval Station in Mayport, FL for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The House Armed Services Committee directed the GAO to assess the costs of homeporting a carrier in Mayport, FL. H.R. 6523 authorized $176.0 billion for military construction on Guam, with reductions from the planned redeployment of Marine Corps units from Okinawa. Funding was approved for improving access roads and wharves in Guam's harbor. The final bill approved funds for improving access roads and wharves in Guam's harbor but denied funding for construction of a Marine base and facilities for Marine aviation squadrons. It also did not authorize $70.0 million for replacing Guam's military hospital but did approve $50.3 million for Air Force projects related to global repositioning of forces and $19.0 million for a new National Guard Readiness Center. The final version of the bill did not include a House provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense to assist Guam with costs, transfer funds, and report on military facilities and civil infrastructure improvements needed for force redeployment. The bill also bars the use of funds to transfer or release into U.S. territory. The final version of H.R. 6523 prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. territory or foreign governments without meeting certain conditions. It also allows for waivers in cases where a court or military tribunal orders a detainee's transfer. Additionally, the bill prohibits the use of funds to build or modify facilities for detainees at any other location. The final version of H.R. 6523 waives restrictions on detainee transfers if ordered by a competent court or military tribunal. It also prohibits funds from being used to build or modify facilities for Guantanamo Bay detainees elsewhere. Additionally, the bill requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the costs and risks of transferring detainees to alternative sites. The House-passed version of the authorization bill would have increased the Section 1206 funding ceiling to $500 million and extended authorization for the program through FY2012. It also included a provision to transfer $75 million to the Secretary of State for building counterterrorism forces in Yemen, with conditions for certification by July 31, 2011. The House Armed Services Committee recognized Yemen as a \"strategic partner\" in combating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and proposed expanding the Section 1206 program to include police agencies. The Senate committee bill did not increase the funding cap but created a separate authority for the Secretary of Defense. The final version of the authorization bill does not increase the $350 million cap on Section 1206 funding as requested by the Administration. However, it authorizes an additional $75 million for Yemeni Interior Ministry units to conduct counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and its affiliates. The enacted version of the authorization bill includes an additional $75 million for Yemeni Interior Ministry units for counterterrorism operations. It also authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use up to $150 million of Army funds for economic activities in Afghanistan to reduce violence and enhance stability. The enacted version of H.R. 6523 includes provisions for strategic business and economic activities in Afghanistan, focusing on private investment, industrial development, banking, agriculture, and energy. It also includes cybersecurity measures such as a report on DoD's cyber warfare policy and continuous monitoring of DOD computer networks for security. The enacted version of H.R. 6523 includes provisions for strategic business and economic activities in Afghanistan, focusing on private investment, industrial development, banking, agriculture, and energy. It also includes cybersecurity measures such as requiring DOD to develop a tailored acquisition process for cyberspace, continuously monitor DOD computer networks for security, and provide annual reports to Congress on cyber attacks and cybersecurity progress. The final version did not include a provision for a National Office for Cyberspace. The final version of H.R. 6523 did not include a House provision for a National Office for Cyberspace with government-wide responsibilities. The House and Senate did not agree on a FY2011 budget resolution, leading to spending caps being adopted through other procedures. The House and Senate did not agree on a FY2011 budget resolution, leading to spending caps being adopted through other procedures. The House set discretionary spending caps, while the Senate did not adopt an overall ceiling on FY2011 discretionary spending. The Senate Appropriations Committee then adopted discretionary guidance for the amount that could be appropriated by each of its subcommittees. The Senate did not adopt an overall ceiling on FY2011 discretionary spending. The Senate Appropriations Committee set discretionary guidance for subcommittees, with the Defense Subcommittee's ceiling at $522.8 billion, $8.1 billion less than the President's request. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee approved a bill for consideration by the full committee, providing $671.0 billion for FY2011 DOD Appropriations, including $513.3 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. The Defense Subcommittee's bill for FY2011 DOD Appropriations totaled $513.3 billion, a reduction of $7.0 billion from the President's request. The bill also allocated $157.7 billion for war costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill with a total of $669.9 billion, including $512.2 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 DOD Appropriations bill (S. 3800) with a total of $669.9 billion, including $512.2 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. This bill would have reduced $8.10 billion from the President's base budget request and $254 million from the war costs request. The House later passed a bill (H.R. 1) to fund federal agencies through the rest of FY2011, including $505.2 billion for base budget programs covered by the annual defense budget. The Senate debated H.R. 1, a bill that would have funded federal agencies through the balance of FY2011 and included a detailed defense appropriations bill providing $505.2 billion for base budget programs. The bill was laid aside on March 9, 2011, after failing to secure enough votes. An alternative funding measure proposed by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye was also rejected. Ultimately, on April 15, 2011, the President signed an omnibus funding bill for the remainder of FY2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10). The Inouye amendment to H.R. 1 would have provided $503.1 billion for base budget programs funded by the defense appropriations bill. The omnibus funding bill signed by the President on April 15, 2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) allocated $502.4 billion for the base budget and $677.7 billion for all DOD funding, including military construction and war costs, representing a reduction of $20.1 billion from the President's requested amount for FY2011. The omnibus funding bill signed by the President allocated $502.4 billion for the base budget and $677.7 billion for all DOD funding, including military construction and war costs, representing a reduction of $20.1 billion from the President's requested amount for FY2011. The bill included $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's request, with cuts applied to various spending categories like DOD funds from prior fiscal years, Operations and Maintenance, Procurement, Research and Development, civilian pay, and federally funded research and development corporations. The omnibus funding bill for FY2011 allocated $502.4 billion for the base budget and $677.7 billion for all DOD funding, including military construction and war costs. It included $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's request, with cuts to various spending categories like Operations and Maintenance, Procurement, Research and Development, civilian pay, and federally funded research and development corporations. Additionally, the bill added funds to the request in some instances, totaling about one-eighth of the number of additions made by Congress in previous years. Notable additions included $495.0 million for nine F/A-18E/F Navy strike fighters and $1.38 billion for equipment for the National Guard and reserve. The defense appropriations bill for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 added significant amounts to the budget request, including funds for F/A-18E/F Navy strike fighters, National Guard equipment, medical research programs, and Israeli missile defense systems. It also allocated funds for innovative research projects but did not continue development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The bill did not have an explanatory statement, leaving only brief descriptions of the changes to the budget request. The defense appropriations bill for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 added funds for various programs, including F/A-18E/F Navy strike fighters and Israeli missile defense systems.

It also cut $425.0 million for THAAD missile deployment and added $205 million for the Israeli Iron Dome system. Planned THAAD production has been delayed for additional tests. The bill proposed adding $205 million for the Israeli Iron Dome system to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells. President Obama requested the funds for Iron Dome in May 2010. Additionally, the bill provided $15.4 billion for Navy shipbuilding, with minor reductions in requested amounts. The budget request for THAAD production was delayed for additional tests. The bill reduced funding for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and mid-air refueling tanker development, delaying the decision on the tanker project. Additional details on aircraft funds can be found in the tables in the Appendix. The bill in March 2011 cut funding for various military programs, including the Non-Line of Sight Missile and Ground Combat Vehicle programs. The Army cancelled the NLOS Missile program and restarted the GCV competition with revised specifications. The Army cancelled the ongoing competition for the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) in August 2010 and revised the performance specifications. The competition was restarted on November 30, 2010."
