    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prevention of Frivolous Ethanol Lawsuits Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to ethanol lawsuits. The Congress finds that ethanol is widely used in gasoline for vehicles but increasing the blending limit raises concerns about emission control device failure and engine performance. The Congress is concerned about the effects of increasing the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline on motor vehicle engines. Potential impacts include engine failures, decreased performance, consumer complaints, litigation, and harm to conventional vehicles. The Federal Trade Commission is considering labeling requirements for fuels exceeding the current ethanol blending limit. Federal testing is ongoing to assess the effects on newer vehicles. The executive branch is currently testing the effects of increasing the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline on newer vehicles. However, there is insufficient data on the impact on older vehicles and nonroad engines. Congress is urged to address any negative effects on interstate commerce. Congress is currently deciding on mitigating negative effects on interstate commerce from increasing the ethanol blending limit in gasoline. SEC. 3. Targeted liability protections for claims related to damages caused by ethanol in certain fuel. Liability Protections: Covered entities are immune from suit and liability under Federal and State law for claims related to loss caused by the use of renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10%, used in internal combustion engines. Loss includes death, injury, illness, disability, or fear of injury. The term \"loss\" in this section includes death, injury, illness, disability, fear of injury, and property damage. The immunity applies to any claim for loss related to the use of renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10%. The immunity under paragraph (1) applies to claims for loss related to the use of renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10% in internal combustion engines. Exceptions to this immunity are outlined in subsection (b). The sole exception to the immunity of covered persons is for a Federal cause of action for death or serious physical injury caused by willful misconduct. This action can be brought by any person who suffers such injury or their representative. An action for wrongful death or serious physical injury can be brought by any person who suffers such injury or their representative. The action must be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and governed by the law of the State where the misconduct occurred, unless inconsistent with Federal law. The complaint must plead with particularity. In an action under subsection (b), the complaint must plead with particularity each element of the plaintiff's claim, including acts of willful misconduct, facts proving causation of injury, and evidence of death or serious physical injury suffered. The complaint must also include a verification by affidavit of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff must verify the pleading under oath, stating its truth to the best of their knowledge, except for matters alleged on information and belief. The plaintiff in an action under subsection (b) must prove willful misconduct by each covered person sued with clear and convincing evidence. The case will be initially assigned to a three-judge panel for consideration of motions and related matters. In actions under subsection (b), a panel of three judges initially has jurisdiction over motions to dismiss and summary judgment. If motions are denied or time expires, the chief judge assigns further proceedings. No discovery is allowed before each defendant has a chance to file a motion to dismiss. In actions under subsection (b), civil discovery is restricted until each defendant has the opportunity to file a motion to dismiss, and the court rules on it. Discovery is limited to matters directly related to contested issues in the action. In actions under subsection (b), civil discovery is restricted to matters directly related to contested issues in the action. The court will compel a response to a discovery request only if it is necessary to prove or defend a material issue, and the benefits of the response outweigh the burden or cost for the responding party. In such actions, the amount of damages awarded to a plaintiff will be reduced by the amount of collateral source benefits received. In an action under subsection (b), damages awarded to a plaintiff are reduced by collateral source benefits. Noneconomic damages are awarded proportionally to the defendant's responsibility for harm, including physical and emotional losses. In an action under subsection (b), damages awarded to a plaintiff are reduced by collateral source benefits. Nonpecuniary losses such as disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, and injury to reputation are considered in awarding damages. Rule 11 sanctions may be imposed for violations of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to deter misconduct and compensate injured parties. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals related to immunity from suit or exclusion under subsection (h)(1). Manufacturers or distributors may be excluded from liability for acts related to covered countermeasures. Manufacturers or distributors may be excluded from liability for acts related to covered countermeasures if the act or omission is subject to regulation by the Clean Air Act and no enforcement action has been initiated or if the enforcement action has been terminated without a covered remedy. Any action under subsection (b) shall be stayed. Manufacturers or distributors may be exempt from liability for acts related to covered countermeasures if regulated by the Clean Air Act and no enforcement action has been initiated or if the action has been resolved without a covered remedy. Any legal action under subsection (b) will be paused. This section does not limit the rights or remedies of the United States or its agencies under other laws, including tort claims procedures. Definitions for this section are provided.
