The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) allows federal employees to contribute a percentage of their pay towards retirement savings. The maximum allowable employee contribution to the TSP will increase annually for five years, with percentage-of-pay limitations eventually being eliminated. Beginning in May 2001, federal employees covered by FERS can contribute up to 11% of pay to the TSP, while those under CSRS can contribute up to 6%. These limits will increase by 1% each year until reaching 15% for FERS and 10% for CSRS by fiscal year 2005. In fiscal year 2006, the percentage-of-pay limits on TSP contributions will be eliminated, and employees will be subject to contribution limits under IRC \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 402(g). In fiscal year 2006, the percent-of-pay limits on TSP contributions will be abolished, and employees will be subject only to the contribution limits then prevailing under IRC \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 402(g).
