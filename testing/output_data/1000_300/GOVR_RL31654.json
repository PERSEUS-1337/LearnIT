    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Species can be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on extinction risk assessments, leading to legal tools for recovery and habitat protection. Prohibitions include unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species and actions that may jeopardize listed species' existence. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species and requires agencies to ensure their actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. As of August 24, 2016, there were 2,266 listed species, with 1,593 in the US. The ESA was passed in 1973 and has been amended multiple times since then. Funding authorization expired in 1992. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 and has been amended several times since then. Funding authorization expired in 1992, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds. The ESA aims to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species. It can become a focal point in debates over resource allocation due to its strict provisions compared to other laws. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) focuses on allocating scarce resources, with economic interests on multiple sides of vanishing species issues. Examples include debates over hydropower development, timber harvest, and global climate change. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has sparked debates over various issues such as hydropower development, timber harvest, global climate change, and the protection of species like the polar bear. Tensions have risen as more species are added to the protected list, leading to conflicts between conservation efforts and economic development. Critics argue that the ESA does not do enough to accommodate other needs besides species conservation, while defenders believe it strikes a necessary balance. Critics of the ESA argue that it does not adequately address needs beyond species conservation, while defenders believe it balances development biases in other laws. Support for species conservation varies among demographic groups, with stronger support in urban and suburban areas and among coastal populations. Native Americans, often reliant on natural resources, tend to support the survival of listed species. Groups opposing strong protections for listed species often cite potential job losses. Native Americans, often dependent on natural resources like fish, are involved in ESA issues and support the survival of listed species. Debates on ESA often revolve around job loss concerns, ethical support, and involvement of religious groups. Industries like logging and land development view ESA as a problem, while others like commercial fishing see it as beneficial. The ESA provides statutory authority for actions but requires authorization of appropriations within the statute. The ESA contains statutory authority for certain activities and a provision authorizing appropriations. Section 15 (16 U.S.C. \u00a71542) authorizes appropriations through FY1992. Questions arise about the act's prohibitions and authorities, House and Senate rules on appropriations without current authorization, and the impact of failing to appropriate funds for agencies to carry out ESA responsibilities. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) does not require current authorization for agencies to carry out actions or enforce prohibitions, even if funds are not appropriated. The expiration of the authorization for appropriations in FY1992 does not negate the statutory obligations under the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) does not require current authorization for agencies to enforce prohibitions, even without appropriated funds. The expiration of the authorization for appropriations in FY1992 does not negate statutory obligations. Citizen suits can still be filed under Section 11(g) regardless of agency funding, potentially dissuading parties from violating the ESA. Citizen suits can still be filed under Section 11(g) of the ESA, potentially dissuading parties from violating the law, even if agencies lack funds for enforcement. House and Senate rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations but do not affect a measure's legal force. House Rule XXI prohibits unauthorized appropriations, while Rule XXII prohibits them in conference reports. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. These rules are enforced through points of order on the floor, but the House Rules Committee can set special rules to waive these prohibitions for specific amendments or measures. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. Special rules can waive points of order against provisions in a conference report on an appropriations measure. The Senate rules also distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, prohibiting unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments. The practical effects of a lapse in funding would have mixed impacts on supporters and critics of existing law. The practical effects of a funding lapse would impact various areas, such as interagency consultations, species listings, critical habitat designations, and issuance of permits. No critical habitat designated, potentially increasing lawsuits for missed deadlines; No issuance of permits for nonfederal actions; Reduced inspections for CITES violations; No fulfillment of CITES obligations; No monitoring of candidate species; No federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse habitat modification. The 104th Congress made efforts to end funding for the ESA, but it was abandoned due to potential negative effects such as prohibitions on taking listed species and habitat modification. The ESA aims for species recovery, but the impact depends on the measurement chosen. The ESA's goal is species recovery, but the success is measured differently. Only 34 species have been delisted due to recovery, while others have become extinct or delisted for various reasons. It can be challenging to prove the status of extremely rare species. Some species listed as endangered may actually be extinct, making it difficult to prove their status. Rare species are hard to find, and most listed species are very depleted before being listed. Some scientific studies suggest that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been effective in stabilizing or increasing populations of listed species, with 41% showing improvement. The ESA may have prevented extinctions of species like red wolves and California condors. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been effective in stabilizing or increasing populations of listed species, with 41% showing improvement. Some species might have declined further to extinction without ESA protection. Scientific information and analysis are crucial for ESA actions and enforcement, focusing on leading causes of extinction and comparing current extinction rates to background levels. The ESA has prevented extinctions of species like red wolves and California condors. During the 20th century, the focus of the extinction debate shifted to include habitat loss as a major factor in species decline. Habitats like tall-grass prairies, old growth forests, coral reefs, and others have been significantly reduced, putting many species at risk. Global climate change also contributes to habitat loss, along with other factors affecting population levels. The introduction of nonnative species is another significant factor in the decline of many species. Nonnative invasive species, such as disease vectors, predators, and competitors, contribute to the demise of many species. The homogenization of the world's flora and fauna has led to a decline in biodiversity. Some species are threatened by multiple factors, leading to their decline. The debate on extinction questions the need for government intervention to halt this natural process. The current rate of extinction is a concern as it exceeds background rates over time. Estimating total species numbers is challenging, ranging from 3.5 million to 100 million, with 10-30 million commonly accepted. Uncertainty in species numbers makes it difficult to determine extinction rates and if they surpass historical levels. Estimates of total species range from 3.5 million to 100 million, with 10-30 million commonly accepted. Scientists struggle to estimate extinction rates due to uncertainty in species numbers. Current extinction rates (e.g., 17,000 species per year) exceed background rates. Various methods show the same trend. Current extinction rates are estimated to be 100 to 10,000 times higher than background rates, which are typically 1 to 10 species per 10 million species per year. Critics question these calculations due to uncertainties, but most biologists argue that similar numbers are found in studies across different groups using various methods. Some scientists estimate that recovery to approximately equal numbers of different species after major extinction episodes took up to 25 million years. Some scientists estimate that recovery to equal numbers of species after major extinction events could take up to 25 million years. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA does not rely on a numerical standard. The Endangered Species Act defines threatened species as those likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The ESA provides protection for all species and subspecies of animals, with further protection for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species under the ESA, and no protection is afforded for organisms considered neither animal nor plant. The Endangered Species Act provides protection for all species and subspecies of animals, with further protection for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species under the ESA, and no protection is afforded for organisms considered neither animal nor plant. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions such as harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect wildlife. The Secretary of the Interior manages most listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish are under the Secretary's responsibility. The Endangered Species Act assigns the major role to the Secretary of the Interior for managing listed species through FWS. Marine species and anadromous fish fall under the responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce, acting through NMFS. Species can be listed based on scientific information and public participation, either by the Secretary or through petition. The Secretary must decide whether to list a species based on scientific information and public participation, without considering economic effects. The ESA designates species as endangered or threatened based on their decline and threats to survival. Economic considerations are forbidden in this decision-making process. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) designates species as either endangered or threatened based on the severity of their decline and threats to survival. An endangered species is at risk of extinction throughout its range, while a threatened species is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA allows for different levels of protection for species, subspecies, or distinct population segments. The interpretation of \"all or a significant portion of its range\" has varied, with some arguing that only species at risk of extinction throughout their entire range are truly endangered. The Department of the Interior's interpretation of the phrase \"all or a significant portion of its range\" under the Endangered Species Act was found to be in violation by multiple courts. In 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service issued a joint interpretation stating that a portion of a species' range is significant if its contribution to the species' viability is crucial for preventing extinction. The range of a species is crucial for preventing extinction, as determined by scientific factors under the Endangered Species Act. The determination must be based solely on the best available data, without historical range considerations. The Endangered Species Act requires listing determinations to be based solely on the best scientific and commercial data available, without considering economic impacts. The addition of the word \"solely\" in 1982 clarified this scientific approach. The purpose is to ensure decisions on listing species are made strictly on biological criteria, preventing non-biological factors from influencing the process. The amendments to Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act aim to base listing and delisting decisions solely on biological criteria, removing non-biological considerations. Economic factors are deemed irrelevant in determining the status of species, with the focus on whether a species should be listed as endangered, threatened, or not listed at all. The Endangered Species Act emphasizes that listing decisions should be based solely on biological criteria, excluding economic factors. Once a species is determined to be endangered or threatened, conservation methods can be chosen to lower costs without compromising conservation goals. Petitions often initiate species listings or status changes. The Endangered Species Act prioritizes biological criteria for listing decisions, excluding economic factors. Conservation methods can be chosen to reduce costs while still achieving conservation goals. Petitions often initiate species listings or status changes, with agencies required to make determinations within specific timeframes. The Endangered Species Act prioritizes biological criteria for listing decisions, excluding economic factors. Agencies have 12 months to conduct a status review of candidate species and determine if listing is warranted. Lawsuits have been filed for agencies failing to meet deadlines for listing determinations. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, with some requesting changes to listing or other actions. The federal government's responsibilities towards a species proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act include conferring with the appropriate Secretary on actions that could jeopardize the species. This is crucial as there can be a significant time gap between the proposal for listing and the actual listing, during which management decisions may need to be made by federal agencies. The conference process under the Endangered Species Act assists federal agencies and applicants in identifying and resolving conflicts early in the planning process for species proposed for listing. It is less formal than the consultation process for listed species and aims to minimize adverse effects. Agencies may choose to follow a more formal process to avoid duplication of effort later. The conference stage does not restrict irreversible commitment of resources by agency action. The Endangered Species Act conference process helps federal agencies and applicants resolve conflicts early in the planning stage for proposed species listing. It is less formal than consultation for listed species and aims to minimize adverse effects. Agencies may opt for a more formal process to prevent duplication of effort later. The ESA states that the conference stage does not limit irreversible commitment of resources by agency action. Once a species is listed, the agency has specific responsibilities and may choose to avoid actions that could harm a species or lead to liability for compensation. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent significant risks to their well-being. As of August 24, 2016, there were 58 candidate species being considered for listing as endangered or threatened. Federal agencies and landowners may enter into conservation agreements to improve the status of a species and avoid listing proposals in the future. Candidate conservation agreements (CCA) and candidate conservation agreements with assurances (CCAA) allow for specified actions to conserve species with assurances for landowners. Nonfederal landowners can enter into a candidate conservation agreement with assurances (CCAA) to improve species conservation. If a species is proposed for listing under the ESA, the Secretary must follow specific procedures, including notifying state agencies, counties, and foreign countries, publishing a summary locally, and holding a public hearing. The proposal includes notifying foreign countries and professional societies, publishing a local summary, and holding a public hearing. As of August 24, 2016, 73 species were proposed for listing. Federal agencies must confer with the Secretary on actions that may harm candidate species. Emergency listings may skip some steps in the normal process. Special regulations can be implemented for threatened species. The Endangered Species Act allows for emergency listings to address significant risks to species' well-being. Special regulations can be enacted for threatened species, tailoring protections and recovery measures as needed. A distinct population segment (DPS) refers to a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species, with specific criteria for designation. A DPS, or distinct population segment, is a genetically and geographically separate part of a listed species. Only vertebrates can be designated as a DPS, and specific criteria must be met for designation. Discreteness is based on separation from other groups, and significance is determined by the loss of genetic diversity. Once a DPS is identified, its protection status is determined using the same criteria as other listings. If threatened, special rules under the ESA may be applied. The gray wolf DPS designations have led to extensive litigation, with courts vacating DPS designations established since 2003 due to incorrect processes used by FWS. The gray wolf DPS designations have faced litigation due to incorrect processes used by FWS. NMFS developed ESUs to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA, with 28 ESUs of salmon and steelhead trout listed as endangered or threatened. The ESU concept has been criticized for not being scientifically based, but NMFS chose to use it for policy and scientific reasons. The ESU concept, developed by NMFS, is used to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA. It is chosen for policy and scientific reasons to address the impracticality of using stock level or full species level for conservation. Congress added experimental populations to the ESA in 1982 to reintroduce species without severe land use restrictions. The ESA added experimental populations in 1982 to reintroduce species without severe land use restrictions. To qualify as an experimental population, it must be geographically separate and authorized by the service. The protected status of an experimental population is determined based on its risk of extinction. Special regulations under Section 4 of the ESA apply to these populations. The ESA added experimental populations in 1982 to reintroduce species without severe land use restrictions. Experimental populations are designated as essential or nonessential, with special regulations under Section 4 of the ESA. Delisting, uplisting, or downlisting a species follows similar processes. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for delisting, uplisting, or downlisting of species based on scientific data without considering economic impacts. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate status changes or review petitions for listing changes every five years. Critical habitat includes occupied geographic areas. The Endangered Species Act allows for periodic reviews of listed species to determine status changes. Critical habitat includes occupied areas and may extend to essential conservation areas. Designation may be postponed if information is not determinable, but eventually, critical habitat must be designated. The Secretary may choose not to designate critical habitat, and can postpone designation for up to one year if information is not determinable. Critical habitat must eventually be designated for listed species, with exceptions for cases where it would not be prudent. As of July 25, 2016, critical habitat had been designated for 758 listed species, or 47.5% of the 1,596 listed domestic animal and plant species. Any area, whether federally owned or not, may be designated as critical habitat, impacting private land only if federal action is involved. Federal agencies must avoid \"destruction or adverse modification\" of critical habitat. The Secretary must base the designation on the best scientific data available and consider economic impacts. The Secretary must consider economic impacts when designating critical habitat for listed species, excluding areas if benefits outweigh inclusion unless extinction risk is high. The economic factors must be considered in designating critical habitat to prevent species extinction, even though they are not a factor in listing a species as endangered or threatened. Adverse modification of critical habitat is mainly a concern for federal agencies, not private landowners, whose restrictions primarily come from the ESA's prohibition on taking listed species. The ESA imposes restrictions on private landowners primarily through the prohibition on taking listed species, with fewer restrictions on plants than animals. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to exclude Defense Department lands with INRMPs from critical habitat designation, considering national security. The ESA restricts private landowners from taking listed species, with fewer restrictions on plants. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to exclude Defense Department lands with INRMPs from critical habitat designation, considering national security. Critical habitat designation is most beneficial when including unoccupied areas for connecting populations or reintroducing new ones. Restrictions on FWS's ability to designate critical habitat have been supported by Administrations and Congress for over 20 years. In October 1999, FWS announced that designation of critical habitat was a low priority due to budget constraints. Conservation groups criticized FWS for not requesting increased funds for critical habitat designation. FWS has faced numerous lawsuits for failing to designate critical habitat, consistently losing these suits. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has faced lawsuits for not designating critical habitat, losing consistently. FWS believes critical habitat adds little protection beyond listing a species, making it a poor use of resources. Designating critical habitat may offer extra protection for species in federal actions. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has faced lawsuits for not designating critical habitat, losing consistently. FWS believes critical habitat adds little protection beyond listing a species, making it a poor use of resources. Federal agencies must consider whether their actions are likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat under the Section 7 consultation provisions. According to FWS, designated critical habitat does not provide additional protection from federal actions because the jeopardy consideration would provide the necessary protection. The FWS regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" for critical habitat was changed in February 2016 after federal courts of appeal found it contrary to the ESA. The Services discontinued the use of the 1986 definition and began directly applying the definition of \"conservation\" in evaluating actions' effects on critical habitat. The Services discontinued the use of the 1986 definition for critical habitat and began directly applying the definition of \"conservation\" in evaluating actions' effects on critical habitat. The new definition in 50 C.F.R. 402.02 emphasizes the focus on recovery and states that destruction or adverse modification means an alteration that diminishes the value of critical habitat for the conservation of a listed species. Recovery plans are required for the conservation and survival of listed species. The appropriate Secretary must develop recovery plans for the conservation and survival of listed species, with a focus on recovery. Land may be acquired to conserve endangered and threatened species, with funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) derived from offshore oil and gas leases. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) provides funding for land acquisition to conserve endangered and threatened species. The fund is derived from offshore oil and gas leases and requires annual appropriation. States may receive federal funds for endangered species programs through cooperative agreements, with a minimum 25% matching amount required. The 1988 ESA amendments created a fund for state grants, including land acquisition and planning assistance. The 1988 ESA amendments established a fund for state grants, including land acquisition and planning assistance. Congress appropriated $53.5 million for cooperative activities with states and territories in FY2016. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment if their actions may adversely affect a listed species, to determine the need for formal consultation based on the best available data. Federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure their actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitats, known as Section 7 consultation. This is required for any activity authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency. If an action is found to be safe, a biological opinion is issued. When a federal action is mandated by statute, a Section 7 consultation is not needed. If the action won't harm a species or critical habitat, a biological opinion is issued with terms for the action to proceed safely. If the action poses a risk, alternatives to avoid harm must be suggested. The BiOp is expected to be based on the best available scientific and commercial data. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires a Biological Opinion (BiOp) to be based on the best scientific and commercial data available. Consultations usually result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives for projects to proceed. The relevant Secretary must complete consultation within 90 days for federal actions, with the option to extend to 150 days with reasons provided. The relevant Secretary must complete consultation within 90 days for federal actions, with the option to extend to 150 days with reasons provided. Formal consultation may take a year or more, and if no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or obtain an exemption. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for exemptions to proposed agency actions that may harm species. The high-level Endangered Species Committee (ESC) decides on exemptions, requiring at least five votes from specified federal officials and state representatives. The Endangered Species Act allows exemptions for proposed agency actions that may harm species. The ESC, consisting of six federal officials, including the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and the Army, decides on exemptions. The process includes rules, deadlines, and a full administrative hearing. The ESC must grant an exemption if the Secretary of Defense deems it necessary for national security. Additionally, the President may exempt projects for repairing or replacing facilities in disaster areas. To be eligible for an exemption under the Endangered Species Act, federal agencies must have conducted consultation processes in good faith, developed alternatives to the proposed action, and conducted biological assessments. Additionally, they must refrain from irreversible commitments before obtaining an exemption. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult, develop alternatives, and conduct biological assessments to be eligible for an exemption. The exemption process ensures consideration of issues and prevents preemptive actions. Additional requirements are outlined in relevant regulations. The ESC grants exemptions if no reasonable alternatives exist and the benefits outweigh the risks. The ESC grants exemptions for projects or activities if no reasonable alternatives exist, benefits outweigh risks, action is of regional or national significance, and no irreversible commitments have been made. Special provisions apply in certain instances such as international treaty obligations, national security, and presidential concerns. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) grants exemptions for projects or activities under specific conditions, such as when no reasonable alternatives exist and benefits outweigh risks. Special provisions apply in instances like international treaty obligations, national security, and presidential concerns. The exemption process is complex and could take 280 days, with the applicant responsible for funding mitigation measures for the life of the action. The exemption process under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is complex and challenging for potential applicants. Funding mitigation measures for the duration of the action is required, which could be a perpetual obligation. The exemption applies to the action, not the species, so conservation efforts must continue. This could shift the burden of conservation elsewhere, posing difficulties for governors balancing state interests. An exemption from the ESA may not be enough if other statutory obligations still apply, making it hard for actions to proceed. Many parties may be hesitant to support actions that could lead to species extinction. The consultation process under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) offers opportunities for federal agencies to modify actions to avoid harming species or their habitats. Agencies are prompted to consider ESA consequences early on to prevent conflicts and the need for exemptions, especially for private actions involving listed species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prompts agencies to consider consequences early on to prevent conflicts and exemptions. Private parties may obtain permits for incidental take of listed species. An incidental take permit (ITP) requires a habitat conservation plan (HCP) detailing impacts, mitigation steps, funding, alternatives considered, and other required measures. The use of ITPs expanded in the 1990s with streamlined procedures for minimal impact activities. Certain exemptions exist for raptors, and subsistence is regulated. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for streamlined procedures for activities with minimal impacts in the 1990s. It also specifies exemptions for raptors, regulates subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, prohibits interstate transport and sale of listed species and parts, controls trade in parts of endangered species, and establishes rules for experimental populations. The ESA enumerates prohibited acts such as taking endangered species, possessing or selling unlawfully taken species, and violating regulations by FWS or NMFS. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits various acts related to endangered or threatened species, including taking, possessing, selling, or transporting unlawfully taken species. Threatened species are subject to similar protections as endangered species. Violating ESA regulations, attempting to commit prohibited acts, or soliciting others to do so is also a violation. The prohibitions apply broadly to anyone under U.S. jurisdiction, with exceptions like incidental take permits. Good-faith belief can exempt individuals from civil penalties for ESA violations. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits various acts related to endangered or threatened species, with exceptions like incidental take permits. Section 11 of the ESA exempts individuals from civil penalties for violations if they acted in good faith to protect themselves or others from bodily harm. Violators of the ESA may face civil penalties, with higher fines for knowing violators and those involved in importing or exporting wildlife. Criminal violations may also apply for certain ESA provisions, and enforcement can involve lawsuits in federal district court. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits acts related to endangered species, with exceptions like incidental take permits. Violators may face civil penalties, and criminal violations may apply. Enforcement involves lawsuits in federal court, where citizens can sue to enforce ESA provisions and receive litigation costs and attorneys' fees. Citizen suits have driven efforts to conserve species. The citizen suit provisions of the ESA have been a driving force in conserving species, with citizen groups often pushing for listings of species at greater risk. These suits challenge delays in listing decisions and account for a significant number of lawsuits against FWS and NMFS. The ESA also implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for wildlife preservation. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for wildlife preservation in the United States. CITES categorizes listed species based on extinction risk and focuses on trade, while the ESA also considers habitat loss. Violations of CITES are violations of U.S. law within the country's jurisdiction. The Western Hemisphere Convention commits the U.S. to establishing nature reserves, controlling international wildlife trade, and protecting wildlife. The United States, through the Western Hemisphere Convention, committed to establishing nature reserves, controlling international wildlife trade, and protecting wildlife. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) under CITES, ensuring that international trade does not harm endangered species. The Secretary enforces these determinations through FWS, basing decisions on the best available biological information. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) under CITES, ensures that international trade does not harm endangered species. The Secretary enforces these determinations through FWS, basing decisions on the best available biological information. The ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species, with exceptions outlined in the legislation. The ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species, with exceptions outlined in the legislation to enhance enforcement of trade-related provisions. Importers and exporters of fish or wildlife must obtain permission, keep records, allow inspections, and use designated ports. An Endangered Species Committee (ESC) has reached decisions in three instances. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) granted an exemption for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir, which was deemed to jeopardize the habitat of whooping cranes on the Platte River. The decision was made with specified mitigation measures in place. The ESC granted an exemption for Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir on January 23, 1979, with specified mitigation measures including maintenance of whooping crane habitat. The Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition and legal challenges after the listing of the endangered snail darter, leading to the landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill clarifying the reach of the ESA. The Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill clarified the broad reach of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and its relationship to public works projects. Congress passed P.L. 95-632, which established an ESC process and provided an exemption for the dam if a decision was not reached within a specified time. Despite the ESC denying an exemption for the Tellico Dam, Congress directed its completion in P.L. 96-69. Additional snail darters were found, leading to the species being reclassified as threatened. In 1992, the ESC granted exemptions for 13 Oregon timber sales in the habitat of the threatened northern spotted owl. The controversy over these sales led to their withdrawal during the Clinton Administration. Additionally, the Pittston Company applied for an exemption to build a refinery in Eastport, ME, but further action on this application seems to have been discontinued. The Pittston Company applied for an exemption to build a refinery in Eastport, ME, due to concerns about threatened bald eagles and endangered whales. Another company sought an exemption to build a docking area for barges in Mound City, IL, but withdrew the application after a jeopardy opinion. The Suwanee River Authority's project to dredge Alligator Pass in Florida, habitat for endangered manatees, was denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers. The engineer of the Suwanee River Authority applied for a project exemption to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, a habitat for endangered manatees. The project was denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the engineer lacked the authority to apply on behalf of the Authority. The Authority refused to ratify his actions and withdrew the application in 1986, making the withdrawal effective."
