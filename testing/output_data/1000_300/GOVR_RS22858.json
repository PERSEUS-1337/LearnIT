    "content": "This report provides a cumulative history of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy compared with funding for other energy technologies over the past 71 years. The final amount of FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) set funding levels for DOE energy technologies. Figures and tables present funding totals and relative shares of spending for different energy sources since 1978. Table 2 converts spending data into percentage shares for different energy sources over the past 10, 41, and 71 years. Figures 2, 3, and 4 display pie charts showing the cumulative DOE spending for each period. Energy availability and R&D played crucial roles in World War II and post-war energy development. During World War II and post-war era, R&D was applied to energy sources for economic growth, focusing on fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and fusion. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for nuclear development. The AEC also researched civilian use of nuclear energy for electric power. The Federal Energy Administration was created in response to the 1973 oil embargo. The Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) was established in 1975, incorporating the AEC and various energy programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, consolidating all energy R&D programs under its administration, including fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency. Since its establishment in 1977, the Department of Energy (DOE) has administered energy R&D programs, including fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency. Federal government support for energy R&D focused on fossil energy and nuclear power technologies from FY1948 to FY1977, with significant spending on both. The energy crises of the 1970s led to the expansion of R&D programs to include renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. The federal government expanded R&D programs to include renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies in the 1970s. DOE has been the main funder of energy R&D since FY1978, with funding peaking at $8.6 billion in FY1979. Funding dropped to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s but gradually increased, reaching nearly $4.5 billion in FY2018."
