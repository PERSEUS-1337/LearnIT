    "content": "The President's gravest decision is directing the use of nuclear weapons through Nuclear Command and Control (NC2). NC2 involves the President's authority over nuclear weapon operations, government activities, and multinational actions. The infrastructure supporting this authority is the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS), which includes facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and personnel essential for planning and controlling operations. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is a combination of elements essential for nuclear weapon operations, supporting the President's authority and constitutional responsibilities. Congress oversees the Department of Defense's plans to sustain and modernize the NCCS. Congress oversees the Department of Defense's plans to sustain and modernize the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS), with a focus on potential changes to its structure in light of evolving nuclear threats from countries like China, North Korea, and Iran. The potential for nuclear challenges from China, North Korea, or Iran could drive a continued need for robust Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) with a different structure. The addition of non-nuclear responses and active defenses may lead to complex requirements. The NCCS serves in secondary roles, but recommendations to retire Cold War platforms need to be reconciled. Despite its strategic implications, the NCCS is not well understood and receives little attention outside the military establishment. The NCCS, despite its strategic implications, is often not well understood and receives little attention outside the military establishment. This report will describe NCCS platforms and functions, discuss its current role in light of past reviews, examine issues related to its role, and review proposed modernization initiatives. The lead elements of the NCCS form the National Military Command System (NMCS), providing command and control for the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The National Military Command System (NMCS) provides command and control for the National Command Authorities (NCA) and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), including nuclear and conventional forces. The NMCS includes command nodes such as the National Military Command Center (NMCC) which monitors nuclear forces and military operations on a daily basis. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) serves as a survivable airborne backup to the NMCC's command and control capabilities. It consists of modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft with hardened communications against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) and is based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska. The NAOC is always on alert and can include a crew of up to 114 people. The USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) at Offutt AFB in Nebraska serves as a backup command center for emergency actions and day-to-day management of forces. It is protected against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) and provides situational awareness for the USSTRATCOM Commander. The USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) at Offutt AFB in Nebraska serves as a backup command center for emergency actions and day-to-day management of forces. It is protected against EMP and has its own emergency power supply for extended operations. The facility is staffed 24/7, with each team led by a Senior Controller who is a full Colonel or Captain. In case the GOC is unable to fulfill its role, the USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) can serve as a survivable airborne backup, with a fleet of modified Boeing 707 aircraft carrying a crew of 22. The ABNCPs are modified Boeing 707 aircraft serving as a survivable airborne backup for USSTRATCOM. Each aircraft carries a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff personnel led by a General or Admiral. The aircraft can communicate launch codes to ICBM launch facilities and serve as a TACAMO relay for Navy ballistic missile submarines. It can deploy a trailing wire antenna for communication and use VLF/LF, UHF, or EHF satellite systems. The ABNCP aircraft can communicate directives to submarines using a trailing wire antenna and VLF/LF system. USSTRATCOM provides battlestaff personnel, while Navy's STRATCOMM Wing One provides aircraft and operators. The MCCC serves as a road-mobile backup to USSTRATCOM. The President has sole authority to direct the use of nuclear weapons, with the NCCS evolving to support this decision-making process. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) supports the President's authority to direct nuclear weapons use. It includes functions like situation monitoring for strategic intelligence and tactical warning. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) utilizes intelligence systems for situation monitoring, including tracking weather for aircraft operations. Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA) is crucial for quickly detecting and analyzing potential attacks, using dual phenomenology to verify attacks with satellites and radars. Decision making is guided by doctrine to shape responses based on attack origin, size, and potential targets. The Nuclear Command and Control System relies on dual phenomenology to verify attacks using satellites and radars. Decision making involves consulting with senior commanders and advisors, ensuring connectivity for continuous situation updates. Data on the readiness of nuclear deterrent forces is crucial for decision makers in both day-to-day operations and crisis situations. The force management process provides data on the readiness of nuclear deterrent forces for decision makers, including forces available, locations, and maintenance/supply status. Force direction involves nuclear surety to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons and positive control to ensure launch instructions reach forces. Nuclear surety controls prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons. Positive control ensures launch instructions reach forces. The National Military Command System must be survivable in extreme environments to maintain national leadership control during crises. The National Military Command System (NCCS) must fulfill key attributes such as survivability, reliability, and security. Survivability is achieved through hardening, mobility, redundancy, or concealment in extreme environments. Reliability ensures rapid connectivity without false alarms or inaccurate information. Security limits access to authorized personnel and protects against jamming or interception of communications. The National Military Command System (NCCS) must have protection against jamming or interference with communication links to ensure authenticity and prevent hostile listening. Security may face challenges from potential adversaries using asymmetric capabilities like computer attacks. Nuclear command and control was emphasized in the DOD's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, directed by Congress to include the role of nuclear forces in US military strategy, policy requirements for a credible deterrence posture, and the relationship with targeting strategy. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for maintaining a safe and credible nuclear deterrence posture in the United States, including the levels and composition of nuclear delivery systems, the nuclear weapons complex, and the nuclear weapons stockpile. Assistant Secretary of Defense J.D. Crouch addressed these issues on January 9, 2002. The Assistant Secretary of Defense J.D. Crouch discussed the need for changes in the U.S. nuclear posture due to evolving international relationships post-Cold War. This evolution aims to reduce reliance on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence and address emerging threats from multiple political opponents. The U.S. is considering reducing its dependence on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence in response to emerging threats from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. The Department of Defense advocates for a \"capabilities based approach\" to address these unpredictable threats, which includes a new triad of capabilities encompassing nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, as well as active and passive defensive measures. The NPR's new triad includes nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, active defenses, passive defensive forces, and a responsive weapons infrastructure. The Administration emphasizes command, control, intelligence, and planning to enhance precision, adaptability, deterrence, and operational effectiveness. The Administration aims to enhance command and control capabilities for strike and defense forces, improve planning adaptability, and integrate nuclear and non-nuclear forces for quicker response and increased flexibility in changing situations. This focus on NC2 capabilities in the NPR may lead to new systems initiatives being implemented by the Bush Administration and the Department of Defense. The Bush Administration and the Department of Defense have implemented the framework of the 2001 NPR, with USSTRATCOM assuming responsibility for additional missions such as global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and C4ISR. Organizational changes continued in January 2005 when USSTRATCOM was designated as the focal point for combating weapons of mass destruction, leading to the establishment of a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in September 2005. General James Cartwright established a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in partnership with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency in September 2005, as part of USSTRATCOM's expanded mission portfolio. The Department of Defense has begun incorporating the 2001 NPR thinking into its doctrinal guidance, with a focus on deterring and responding to the use of weapons of mass destruction. The Joint Staff is updating its \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" to emphasize crisis action planning and nuclear command and control. The new joint doctrine emphasizes deterring and responding to weapons of mass destruction, with a focus on crisis action planning and integrating nuclear and non-nuclear forces. Reports suggest rapid crisis action planning to address WMD threats, a concept carried over from the 2001 NPR. The need for rapid planning in joint operations in response to an imminent crisis includes compressing time for developing and disseminating nuclear plans. This requires enhanced computer workstation capability, communication capacity, and integration with other military operations. Networked collaborative planning systems are becoming more common in conventional military operations, potentially impacting nuclear planning as well. Air forces are adapting to the need for daily dissemination of the Air Tasking Order in combat theaters. Networked collaborative planning systems are becoming standard in military operations, including nuclear planning. Senior leaders are increasingly relying on video-teleconferencing for long-distance deliberations. Robust communications are crucial for coordination with intelligence providers for WMD targets. A 12-member commission was appointed by Congress to review the implementation of the 2001 NPR and study the programmatic requirements needed to achieve its goals. The FY2006 Defense Authorization Act chartered a 12-member commission to review the implementation of the 2001 NPR and study programmatic requirements to achieve its goals. The commission is required to submit its report to Congress by June 30, 2007. The NPR suggests using precision non-nuclear or \"non-kinetic\" weapons to fulfill missions previously allocated to nuclear weapons, potentially leading to a smaller arsenal. However, the continued presence of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal seems likely for the foreseeable future. An overarching approach to nuclear weapons policy could determine their role and uses. The continued presence of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal for the foreseeable future seems likely. An overarching approach to nuclear weapons policy could determine the shape of the required command and control architecture, with assumptions shaping the requirements for robustness and survivability. Today's nuclear command and control systems originated during the Cold War, with key facilities like the NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex, E-4 National Airborne Operations Center, and USSTRATCOM underground command post built in the late 20th century. The NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex, E-4 National Airborne Operations Center, and USSTRATCOM underground command post were built during the Cold War to manage a nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. The relevance of this infrastructure today is being questioned as new requirements may necessitate spending on new programs due to changes in the post-Cold War environment. The nature of the threat can shape challenges to the nuclear command and control infrastructure. During the Cold War, concerns over a \"decapitation attack\" targeting national and military leadership raised the need for a resilient nuclear command and control system to ensure government control of weapons. The threat of losing political control of conflict escalation was a major worry, emphasizing the importance of maintaining functionality through an attack. The nuclear command and control system was upgraded in the 1980s to ensure government control of weapons during an attack. The threat of a nuclear strike from Russia has decreased since the Cold War, with the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty reducing deployed nuclear weapons to lower levels. The Moscow Treaty, signed in 2002 by Presidents Bush and Putin, aimed to reduce deployed nuclear weapons to 1,700-2,200 levels. Despite the decrease in arms from the Cold War, the question arises if the costly command and control architecture for a major nuclear exchange is still necessary. Analysts suggest potential future challenges, including a nuclear threat from China, with their military expenditures possibly tripling by 2025. The Chinese military expenditures could triple by 2025, with a focus on acquiring more survivable systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM. General Zhu Chenghu's threat of nuclear attack on U.S. cities if aid is given to Taiwan was widely reported. Analysts debate China's intentions in the Pacific Rim, with some arguing the threat is overstated. Some analysts believe China is striving for preeminence in the Pacific Rim and East Asia, while others argue that the China threat is overstated. The relationship with China is not a clear confrontation like the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and there are areas of cooperation. Highlighting a \"China threat\" may be a search for a great power peer competitor, similar to past warnings about a \"coming war with Japan.\" This could justify the development of major weapons systems. Some analysts warn of a potential threat from China as a major power peer competitor, similar to past concerns about a \"coming war with Japan.\" This could lead to the development of significant weapons systems. Additionally, the pursuit of nuclear weapons by rogue states like Iran and North Korea reinforces the need for a robust nuclear command and control system. North Korea has actively sought nuclear weapons since the 1960s, with A.Q. Khan possibly aiding Kim Jong Il's efforts. In 2005, North Korea claimed to have nuclear weapons, but this is unverified. Estimates suggest they may have around ten bombs, along with various missile capabilities. North Korea is believed to have around ten nuclear bombs and possesses various missile capabilities, including SCUD, NoDong, and TaepoDong missiles. There is uncertainty about their ability to attach nuclear warheads to these missiles. Reliable information from inside North Korea is scarce, and experts are hesitant to provide public estimates due to past intelligence failures. Some analysts suggest that North Korea's claims of having nuclear weapons may be a bluff. The Iranian nuclear program also presents challenges for threat analysts, with the current administration claiming Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, projecting they are about ten years away from achieving them. The Iranian nuclear program poses dilemmas for threat analysts as there are varying predictions on when Iran could have nuclear weapons. Some suggest it could be within two years, while others project they could have the capability by 2009. Iran's activities at Natanz and other nuclear sites have raised suspicions due to secrecy and concealment. Iran's engagement in nuclear fuel cycle research is permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but their intentions for long-range nuclear delivery capabilities are unclear. The secrecy surrounding Iran's activities at Natanz and other nuclear sites has raised suspicions about their nuclear intentions. Iran's development of long-range delivery systems, such as the Shahab-3 missile, and their study of high explosives for nuclear weapons construction have heightened concerns. Additionally, Iran's hostile rhetoric towards Israel and the United States further exacerbates worries about their nuclear capabilities. Iran's hostile rhetoric towards Israel and the United States raises concerns about their nuclear intentions. Small nuclear arsenals could pose a threat to U.S. infrastructure through an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from a high-altitude nuclear explosion, causing widespread damage to electronic components and critical infrastructure elements. The EMP Commission was chartered by Congress to assess the threat of an electromagnetic pulse attack on the United States. Some analysts suggest that China could use a high altitude nuclear burst to generate EMP as a way to target US critical infrastructure. William Graham, the chair of the EMP Commission, highlighted China's interest in EMP attacks as reflected in their military literature. China could potentially use its nuclear capability to target US critical infrastructure through an EMP attack, as indicated by Chinese military literature. North Korea and Iran's missile programs may also be preparing for similar strategies. There is speculation about the development of technology that could generate localized EMP bursts without the need for a nuclear detonation. However, some analysts are skeptical about the extent of the EMP threat. Some analysts are skeptical about the extent of the EMP threat, suggesting that military and commercial systems may withstand an EMP burst with minimal adverse effects. Key infrastructure is believed to continue functioning, with many military systems having EMP protection. The motivation for China to use EMP against the US mainland is unclear, but using it against US forces aiding Taiwan is more conceivable. Some analysts are skeptical about the EMP threat, noting that key infrastructure and military systems have protection. The motivation for China to use EMP against the US mainland is unclear, but using it against US forces aiding Taiwan is more conceivable. Concerns exist about the decline in EMP hardening and practice in the military since the 1990s. The EMPCommission found that EMP hardening and practice in the military may have declined since the 1990s. Congress directed reestablishment of the EMPCommission to assess the vulnerability of military systems to EMP. The EMP threat may require capabilities to operate in an EMP environment, posing challenges for the nuclear command and control system. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, including non-nuclear responses and active defenses, presents challenges for the nuclear command and control system. Integration of nuclear, non-nuclear, and defensive forces may require system improvements, expanded participation in decision-making, and increased capacity for simultaneous key conferences. Implementation of NPR recommendations could also demand greater speed and responsiveness, especially in missile defense scenarios. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review poses challenges for the nuclear command and control system, requiring system improvements and increased capacity for key conferences. Non-nuclear responses, including precision weapons and non-kinetic options, may necessitate a need for additional speed and responsiveness in missile defense scenarios. The process for directing release of non-nuclear strikes needs further development, including determining \"release authority\" for these options. The President's involvement in directing non-nuclear or non-kinetic options for military operations is questioned, as historically Presidents have not been heavily involved in planning specific conventional missions. USSTRATCOM targets may require strategic consideration, but the President's level of detail in military operations is typically limited. The President's involvement in directing non-nuclear or non-kinetic military operations is questioned, as historically Presidents have not been heavily involved in planning specific conventional missions. USSTRATCOM targets may require strategic consideration, but the President's level of detail in military operations is typically limited. The process of requiring Presidential authorization for strikes poses technical and operational challenges, especially when conventional weapons are mixed with nuclear weapons on the same platform. Nuclear weapons have permissive action link codes for Presidential authorization, while conventional weapons do not. The complexity increases when conventional and nuclear weapons are mixed on the same platform. Non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks could have strategic impacts, potentially equivalent to a WMD strike. Some express concern that cyber-attacks could have strategic impacts like shutting down a nation's power grid, similar to a WMD strike. There are challenges in enforcing control over non-kinetic responses, as it involves additional participants in the command and control process. The merging of active defenses, particularly missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will require further adaptation. Decision-making processes may need to be revised to prevent delays in reaching critical targets. Presidential involvement may be necessary for grave decisions regarding defensive capabilities and locations to defend. Some analysts recommend delegating missile defense release authority to the unified combatant commander, supported by standing Presidential guidance. Decision-making on defensive launches or offensive strikes may require Presidential consideration, with choreographed conversations needed to accommodate limited time frames for decision-making. The national response to a potential attack will involve tradeoffs between offensive and defensive strategies, requiring Presidential consideration. Choreographed conversations are essential to facilitate decision-making within limited time frames. Regional combatant commanders will be responsible for defense in their areas of responsibility, adding participants to the decision-making process. The detection of a potential attack will involve multiple command centers, including regional combatant commanders responsible for defense in their areas. USSTRATCOM leads missile defense efforts but must coordinate with regional commands like USCENTCOM and USNORTHCOM. General Cartwright has directed personnel to ensure interoperable missile defense command and control systems. Bandwidth demands will increase as more participants are added to decision conferences for missile defense or non-nuclear offensive responses. The missile defense command and control systems must be interoperable with common technical standards and protocols. Bandwidth demands will increase as more participants are added to decision conferences. The system must present choices for Presidential decision in an easily understandable manner and facilitate the Commander-in-Chief's interactions with advisers. The nuclear command and control systems must support the civilian and military leadership in nuclear operations, while also being useful for other military and government functions. These systems serve multiple missions in non-nuclear roles and provide tight security, robust decision-making, and communication capabilities. The nuclear command and control systems have value beyond nuclear operations, serving multiple missions in non-nuclear roles. These platforms offer tight security, robust decision-making, and communication capabilities, making them versatile national assets. One such mission they support is non-nuclear military forces direction and status monitoring, including aiding in crises, conflicts, and peacetime contingencies like natural disasters. Response cells or crisis action teams can be formed from various agencies to prepare orders, monitor forces, and deliver briefings in response to developing situations. A response cell or crisis action team (CAT) can be formed from various agencies to prepare orders, monitor forces, and deliver briefings in response to developing situations. Command and control assets, such as NORAD and NMCC, played a crucial role in coordinating the restoration of normal air traffic after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, showing their importance for continuity of operations during domestic contingencies or natural disasters. President Bush visited USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska on September 11, 2001, highlighting the significance of these assets in times of crisis. During domestic contingencies or natural disasters, continuity of operations (COOP) and continuity of government (COG) are crucial. President Bush utilized command and control assets at USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska on September 11, 2001, and at U.S. Northern Command during Hurricane Rita in September 2005. Nuclear command and control assets can also support civil authorities for consequence mitigation after disasters. FEMA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have a memorandum of agreement for the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) to assist in such situations. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), a modified Boeing 747-200 command and control aircraft, is available for FEMA support during disasters and emergencies. Senior government leadership values these systems for versatile situation monitoring, communications, and tele-conferencing capabilities. The NMCC is easily accessible to the Secretary of Defense and other DOD leadership, with Secretary Rumsfeld relying on the NAOC for support during official travel. The NMCC in the Pentagon is easily accessible to DOD leadership, with Secretary Rumsfeld relying on the NAOC for support during official travel. Using NC2 assets for missions beyond nuclear forces requires balancing tradeoffs and could lead to competition for access in a crisis, potentially creating shortfalls in response plans. Tying these systems to other agency functions adds to organizations with equities in system viability, forcing costs to sustain systems no longer desired. The DOD chartered a committee in 2001 to review the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System, led by former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft. The changing nature of threats and recommendations from the Nuclear Posture Review raise questions about the requirements for today's systems. Maintaining outdated systems can impose costs on the military and strain manpower resources, impacting readiness for primary missions. The DOD chartered a committee in 2001 to review the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System, led by former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft. The committee examined the architecture from national command authority to individual weapons, focusing on survivability and the maintenance of system hardness. The End-to-End Review highlighted concerns about the degradation of maintenance and procedural discipline for system hardness since the Cold War. It also recommended shifting NC2 systems life cycle management to operators to ensure operator requirements for new capabilities are met. The End-to-End Review proposed a model for NC2 systems involving operators and logistics experts. Operator-generated requirements for new capabilities may not always align with acquisition programs due to unrealistic expectations or high costs. The focus on technical capability sometimes overlooks the total costs of sustainment and operation over a system's lifetime. The interaction between meeting operator needs and managing acquisition is a debated issue. The decline in NC2 expertise post-Cold War has led to a brain drain in the military services, with fewer skilled personnel and a revolving door of specialists. This has resulted in on-the-job learning and challenges in maintaining \"zero defects\" disciplines. The decline in NC2 expertise post-Cold War has led to a brain drain in the military services, resulting in on-the-job learning and challenges in maintaining \"zero defects\" disciplines. The legacy NC2 architecture may face challenges from the Defense Department's military transformation towards more network-oriented, distributed operations. US Strategic Command has established subordinate functional component commands for specific mission aspects like global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and combating WMD. In 2004, USSTRATCOM established functional component commands for global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and combating WMD. These organizations are geographically separated, promoting decentralization from headquarters. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review suggests retiring legacy mobile platforms like E-4B NAOC aircraft in favor of C-32 aircraft for distributed command and control capabilities. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends retiring legacy mobile platforms like E-4B NAOC aircraft and USSTRATCOM's move to distributed command and control capabilities. The QDR emphasizes the need for survivable command and control capabilities in the event of WMD, electronic, or cyber-warfare attacks. The new architecture must also be tailored for WMD elimination missions. The Department of Defense (DOD) proposes survivable systems for WMD, electronic, or cyber-warfare attacks, tailored for WMD elimination missions. USSTRATCOM is exploring an IP-based communications architecture for integration, but concerns exist about rapid message transmission and priority for nuclear force direction messages. The required communications bandwidth is already limited in the military. The military's communications bandwidth is limited, with a 500% growth in capacity requirements over the past decade. The need for satellite communications has increased by 1000% since 9/11 and may grow by another 2500% in the next 10 years. The nuclear community will compete for command and control links, and new systems like missile defense need to be integrated into the network. The level of certification and configuration management required is still undetermined. The integration of new centers and systems, such as missile defense or conventional strike, into the NC2 network requires certification and configuration management. The level of requirements is yet to be determined, with a focus on compatibility and avoiding chaos in a distributed architecture. Procurement programs in DOD's budget requests mainly involve upgrades and enhancements to existing systems within the NC2 architecture. The procurement programs tied to the nuclear command and control system in DOD's budget requests involve upgrades and enhancements to existing systems. The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) is being modernized with funding for procurement and research and development. The FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act funded $49 million for R&D and no money for procurement. The FY2007 budget request includes $3.4 million for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D. Modernization efforts for MEECN include upgrades for data rate terminals, secure computer terminals, and satellite communications for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers. The installation of VLF/LF and EHF satellite communications for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers in the upper Midwest United States is part of the Minuteman MEECN Program. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is personally involved in directing upgrades to the National Military Command System, including consolidating separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon. The Pentagon is consolidating separate command centers into two new centers, a Unified Command Center and a Resources and Situation Awareness Center. These new facilities will focus on tracking global crises and providing military advice to the President. The consolidation aims to create efficiencies, reduce manpower, and enhance survivability against various threats. The Defense Department is allocating funds for planning and system engineering for this effort. The Defense Department is consolidating command centers to create efficiencies and reduce manpower. Funding is allocated for planning and system engineering. Additionally, funds are requested for developing a future missile warning system. Congress has authorized the requested budgets for these efforts. The Defense Department is requesting funds to upgrade capabilities at NORAD and USSTRATCOM, as well as for further TW/AA research and development. They are also seeking funds to enhance their airborne nuclear command and control platforms. Congress has authorized the requested budgets for these efforts. The Defense Department is requesting funds for NAOC modifications in FY2006 and FY2007. The FY2006 appropriations bill funded the full amount of the DOD request. The FY2007 budget request includes funds for E-4B modifications for improvements to aircraft structures, propulsion, fuel systems, and flight safety. Specific aspects include updates to audio distribution equipment, development of an \"office in the sky\" for senior leaders, improvements to the aircraft's LAN, and transition from analog to digital UHF radio. The FY2006 budget includes funds for upgrades to the E-6B aircraft, costing $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. The modifications include improved cockpit displays, enhanced navigation systems, and a service life assessment of the airframe. The FY2006 budget includes funds for upgrades to the E-6B aircraft, costing $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. Congress fully supported the Navy's request for the E-6 in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act, matching the DOD request for procurement and funding R&D at $35.5 million. For FY2007, the Defense Department is requesting $99.2 million for E-6 modifications procurement and $37.4 million for research and development. The Defense Department is requesting $99.2 million for E-6 modifications procurement and $37.4 million for research and development in FY2007. The Advanced EHF communications satellite is a key aspect of nuclear command and control modernization programs, providing secure, anti-jam communications capabilities at higher data rates than the existing MILSTAR constellation. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are the contractors for the satellite integration and communications payload. The AEHF system, launched in 1994, provides secure, anti-jam communications capabilities with higher data rates than MILSTAR. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are contractors for the program. The Air Force requested funds in FY2006 and Congress fully funded the budget. In FY2007, DOD did not request procurement funds but the Air Force sought funds for R&D. However, the program has faced schedule delays and cost overruns. The AEHF program, facing schedule delays and cost overruns, is seeking $633 million for R&D in FY2007. Technical issues with communications encryption equipment have caused delays, pushing the first launch to 2008. The program's estimated cost has grown to over $7 billion, prompting a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. AEHF aims to bridge MILSTAR and the TSAT program. The AEHF program's estimated cost has grown to over $7 billion, prompting a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. It is hoped to serve as a bridge between MILSTAR and the TSAT program, which is facing delays and budget cuts. Some propose testing advanced technologies on AEHF satellites first to reduce risk on the TSAT program. Congress considered but did not direct the Air Force to buy an additional AEHF satellite for FY2006. In FY2006, Congress reduced funding for TSAT by $400 million and directed the Air Force to focus on technology development. They also approved $436-plus million, reserving $120 million for either a fourth AEHF satellite or continued TSAT systems development based on an analysis of alternatives study. The increased demands on the nuclear command and control system will pose challenges for the NCCS in the future. The increased demands on the nuclear command and control system driven by the 2001 NPR and subsequent DOD policy will pose challenges for the NCCS in the future. The system's legacy Cold War architecture will compete for budgetary priority against conventional systems that may seem to some to be more immediately relevant to today's threat environment and the war on terror. Whether the threat that should shape the NCCS comes from China, rogue states, or terrorism, some suggest there is continued value in this robust system. The key functions performed by the NCCS will likely remain requirements as long as the United States maintains a nuclear deterrent. The NCCS continues to fulfill missions beyond traditional DOD purview, with key functions necessary for the US nuclear deterrent. Despite budget constraints, modernization efforts are ongoing. USSTRATCOM's actions and the 2006 QDR may signal a shift in direction. Congress faces questions about the nature of the threat, with differing views on China's role in the global military landscape. The 2006 QDR may indicate a change in direction for US nuclear strategy. Congress is debating the nature of threats from China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations, including the role of nuclear weapons in US strategy and command and control systems. There is a divide between reducing nuclear weapons for non-proliferation efforts and increasing their utility to confront proliferators. The debate surrounds the role of nuclear weapons in US strategy and command and control systems, with a focus on reducing weapons for non-proliferation efforts or increasing their utility to confront proliferators. The current centralized NCCS architecture developed during the Cold War is being questioned, with a possible need for revisions to incorporate new command and control requirements. USSTRATCOM proposes a more dispersed approach that may better fit the current threat environment. Release authorities may need to be debated before making architectural decisions. The debate surrounds the role of nuclear weapons in US strategy and command and control systems, with a focus on reducing weapons for non-proliferation efforts or increasing their utility to confront proliferators. USSTRATCOM proposes a more dispersed approach for the current threat environment, which may convey manpower and budget economies in the long run. The level of investment in modernization or new procurement for the NCCS is being questioned, with ongoing initiatives projected for years into the future. The retirement of certain equipment may offer short term savings as services look to recapitalize after duty in Iraq. The 2006 QDR findings may adjust requirements, with potential short-term savings from retiring the E-4B NAOC and MCCC. The NCCS faces competition for recapitalization against immediate service needs. Questions arise about the adequacy and necessity of existing NCCS platforms, as well as the value of their secondary uses. The taxpayer may benefit from utilizing NCCS capabilities for ancillary functions, especially in homeland security and disaster response. Considerations include justifying continued investment in platforms with superseded primary missions and potentially transferring procurement and operation to civilian entities. Some platforms with potential for greater utility may need continued investment even if their primary mission requirements are superseded. Consider transferring procurement and operation of these systems to civilian agencies."
