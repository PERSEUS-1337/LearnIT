The Congress finds that the greater Southern California metropolitan region, the second largest urban concentration in the US, lacks sufficient park and recreation lands. This deficiency deprives residents of health benefits and increases the risk of crime. The Rim of the Valley Corridor surrounding the San Fernando and La Crescenta valleys provides various benefits like scenic, environmental, recreational, educational, scientific, and economic assets to the Southern California metropolitan region. These assets deserve increased protection for public benefit in the future. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, including parts of various mountain ranges, contains endangered habitats and unique ecotones indigenous to the area, deserving increased protection for public benefit in the future. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, with its unique Mediterranean chaparral ecosystem and separate ecotones, includes the escarpment of the San Gabriel Mountains within the Angeles National Forest. The national forest is managed for watershed, recreational, and habitat values, not for commercial exploitation. Privately owned lands in the corridor are crucial for scenic, environmental, and recreational values and should be protected through voluntary incentives while respecting private property rights. The State of California has adopted the Rim of the Valley Master Plan to protect the unique natural and recreational resources in the area. However, financial resources, technical assistance, and resource management expertise from the Federal Government are needed to support these efforts. The Rim of the Valley Master Plan in California aims to protect natural and recreational resources, requiring Federal support for financial resources and expertise. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a special resource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California to evaluate its national significance and feasibility of becoming part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The study will follow criteria for potential inclusion in the National Park System. The Secretary will use criteria from Public Law 91-383 for the study. Consultation with the Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee is required. Establishment of an advisory committee is required for consultation with the Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee is established to advise the Secretary of the Interior on a study and recommend boundaries for a new recreation area. The boundaries should reflect those of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Committee will recommend boundaries for a new recreation area that reflect the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and include the Rim of the Valley Corridor. They must submit their recommendation to the Secretary of the Interior within 365 days of their first meeting. The Committee, consisting of 24 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, will submit a recommendation with maps depicting proposed boundaries for a Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area within 365 days of their first meeting. Public participation in and comment on the recommendation of boundaries will be provided. The Secretary of the Interior will appoint 17 representatives of local governments for the Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area, nominated by various city councils and boards of supervisors. The city councils and boards of supervisors of various cities in the Santa Monica Mountains area will appoint representatives to represent unincorporated communities within the jurisdiction of the East Rim of the Valley Trail. Representatives from the city council of Moorpark, the board of supervisors of Los Angeles county, and other relevant authorities will be appointed to represent unincorporated communities within the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor. This includes consultation with the Town Council of Altadena and the Crescenta Valley Town Council. The Committee consists of representatives from various districts and agencies, including the Angeles District of the State of California Department of Parks and Recreation, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, Conejo Recreation and Park District, and Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District. The Committee will select a chairperson and vice chairperson from its members. Members will receive compensation and expenses. The Committee, consisting of representatives from various districts and agencies, will select a chairperson and vice chairperson from its members. Members will serve without compensation but will be reimbursed for necessary expenses. A quorum of 13 members is required for conducting business, and the Committee will terminate upon the submission of the special resources study to Congress."
