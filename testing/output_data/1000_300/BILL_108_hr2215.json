    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act.\" It includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the US annually, caused by inadequately treated sewage containing harmful pathogens. Swimming in contaminated waters leads to millions of Americans falling ill each year, resulting in significant economic losses. Swimming in contaminated waters leads to significant economic losses, with beach closings valued at $1-2 billion annually and swimming-related illnesses costing $28 billion annually. Better monitoring and reporting of sewer overflows could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick each year. Public health authorities are not routinely notified of sewer overflows that threaten public health. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section heading that likely introduces definitions of terms related to the topic discussed in the previous paragraph about the economic and health impacts of swimming in contaminated waters. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. This definition includes overflows or releases of wastewater reaching waters of the United States, those that do not reach waters of the United States, and backups caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer other than a building lateral. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require owners or operators of treatment works to implement measures for timely detection and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows that may impact human health. Owners or operators of treatment works must notify the public of sanitary sewer overflows that could affect human health within 24 hours of becoming aware of the issue. They must also immediately inform public health authorities and other affected entities of any overflow that poses a significant health risk. Additionally, they are required to report the overflow to the appropriate regulatory authorities within 24 hours of detection. Owners or operators must report sanitary sewer overflows to regulatory authorities within 24 hours of detection. They must provide oral or electronic reports within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow, followed by a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, mitigation steps, and plans to prevent recurrence. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows to regulatory authorities within 24 hours. They must provide details on the overflow's impact, steps taken to mitigate it, and the total number of overflows in a calendar year, including release amount, duration, and location. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows to regulatory authorities within 24 hours, detailing the impact, mitigation steps, and total number of overflows in a year. States must report to the EPA annually on sanitary sewer overflows within their jurisdiction. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nIncreases funding to $2.2 billion for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008 under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act."
