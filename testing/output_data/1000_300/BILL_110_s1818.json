    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act\". Congress recognizes the toxicity of mercury and its compounds to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. It highlights the risks posed to pregnant women and unborn babies from mercury exposure. The main source of mercury exposure in the US is contaminated fish. The focus is on reducing global mercury use to lower contamination levels in the environment, rather than reducing fish consumption. To minimize global mercury use and releases, focus on reducing contamination levels in the environment. An estimated 24,000 to 30,000 tons of mercury are used at chlor-alkali plants worldwide. Mercury pollution is a transboundary issue affecting bodies of water globally. In the US, only 8 out of 30 chlorine plants use the outdated \"mercury cell\" technology. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States has limited mercury use, with only 8 out of 30 plants using the obsolete \"mercury cell\" process. Cost-effective alternatives are available for the remaining 90% of chlorine production, and other countries like Japan have already banned the mercury cell technology. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States has limited mercury use, with only 8 out of 30 plants using the obsolete \"mercury cell\" process. Other countries, including Japan, have banned this process due to the contamination of products and direct/indirect release of mercury. Despite known mercury usage, neither the industry nor the EPA can account for its disposition or accurately estimate current emissions. The EPA must account for mercury use and emissions at facilities to minimize domestic and international mercury supply and demand. Congress declares the need to develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions in the United States, including reducing exposures to mercury for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, a new section is added to the Toxic Substances Control Act regarding the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States starting January 1, 2012. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must submit annual reports to the Administrator and the State identifying certain information. Annually starting January 1, 2012, chlor-alkali facility owners must report types and quantities of mercury-containing waste generated, mercury content, waste management details, and mercury releases into air or water. Starting January 1, 2012, chlor-alkali facility owners must report the volume of mercury released into the air or water, mercury accumulation in equipment, and forms of mercury in products for sale to avoid duplication. Starting January 1, 2012, chlor-alkali facility owners must report the volume of mercury released into the air or water, mercury accumulation in equipment, and forms of mercury in products for sale to avoid duplication. The Administrator may allow combining this report with other required reports under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. For facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, a comprehensive mercury inventory must be conducted within a year of cessation. After ceasing operations on or after July 1, 2008, the Administrator, in consultation with the State, will conduct a comprehensive mercury inventory for chlor-alkali facilities within a year. This inventory will cover mercury purchased, remaining in equipment at closure, and estimated quantities in waste and products generated during operation. The Administrator will conduct a comprehensive mercury inventory for chlor-alkali facilities post-closure, including estimated mercury quantities in waste and products generated during operation. This will involve obtaining mercury purchase records and other necessary information to determine mercury releases into the environment. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee is established with 9 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader, including a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Administrator, Secretary of Defense, representative of State environmental agencies, and representative of State attorneys general. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee includes members representing State environmental agencies, State attorneys general, the chlorine industry, the mercury waste treatment industry, and a nonprofit environmental organization. The Administrator appoints these members within 45 days of the section's enactment. The Administrator appoints members of the Committee within 45 days of enactment. The Committee must hold its initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed, meet as called by the Chairperson, with a majority constituting a quorum. A report is due within 1 year of enactment. The Committee, appointed by the Administrator, must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of enactment. The report will include findings and recommendations on environmental, health, and safety requirements to prevent mercury release and worker exposure, estimated storage costs, and a 40-year cost analysis. The report to Congress will include details on elemental mercury storage costs, optimal Federal facilities for storage, estimated quantities of mercury from chlor-alkali facilities, and other supplies needed for implementation. The report to Congress will also cover legal, technical, economic, and other barriers that may hinder the private sector from storing elemental mercury produced during a 40-year period. The report will address barriers to private sector storage of elemental mercury, advantages/disadvantages of consolidating storage, optimal storage plan for excess mercury, and additional research needed for long-term disposal options. Compensation of committee members will also be discussed. The Committee will discuss compensation for non-federal members at a rate equal to the annual pay for level V of the Executive Schedule. Members of the Committee are entitled to compensation under title 5, United States Code, for each day engaged in Committee duties. Federal employees on the Committee serve without additional compensation. Travel expenses, including per diem, are allowed for Committee members. The Committee members are entitled to travel expenses and per diem while performing their duties. The Administrator must provide necessary funding and personnel for the Committee. The Committee will terminate 180 days after submitting its report. Regulations for transfer to storage must be in place by July 1, 2008. The Committee will terminate 180 days after submitting its report. Regulations for transferring elemental mercury from closed chlor-alkali facilities to storage must be established by July 1, 2008. The regulations require transferring elemental mercury from closed chlor-alkali facilities to a storage facility by July 1, 2008. Health assessments for operating facilities must be conducted by July 1, 2009. Additional regulations may be promulgated as needed. The Administrator may promulgate regulations, including reporting forms, to implement this section of the Toxic Substances Control Act. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents. Use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing is regulated under Sec. 6A of the Toxic Substances Control Act."
