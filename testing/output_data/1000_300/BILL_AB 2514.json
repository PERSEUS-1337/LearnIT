Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is defined as the maximum amount of administrative costs that can be paid from the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund. It is set at 5% of property tax allocated for the period January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2012, and up to 3% for each fiscal year ending on June 30, 2016.

Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies regardless of whether the costs are paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but excludes costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds.

From July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018, the \"housing entity administrative cost allowance\" is up to 1% of property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund. The housing entity administrative cost allowance is remitted by the successor agency to the local housing authority that assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency on January 2 and July 1, as listed on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule.
