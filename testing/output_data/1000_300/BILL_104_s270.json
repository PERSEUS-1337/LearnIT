The \"Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995\" defines key terms and procedures for the removal of alien terrorists, including the use of classified information and special removal hearings. The Attorney General must certify to a special court for these procedures to apply. The \"Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995\" outlines procedures for special removal hearings for alien terrorists when deportation proceedings would risk national security by disclosing classified information. The Attorney General must certify to a special court for these procedures to be used. The \"Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995\" establishes a Special Court with up to seven judges to hear cases involving classified information. The Chief Justice designates judges for this court, and a single judge considers applications in camera and ex parte. When the Attorney General applies for special court procedures, a single judge will review the application in private if there is probable cause to believe that the identified alien poses a national security risk due to classified information and immediate physical harm. The special removal hearing for an alien involves a public hearing where the alien has the right to be present, be represented by counsel, and introduce evidence on their behalf. If there is probable cause that the alien poses a national security risk or immediate physical harm, the proceedings may disclose classified information. The alien in a special removal hearing has the right to be represented by counsel, introduce evidence, and cross-examine witnesses. The judge can allow classified evidence to be presented in camera if it poses a national security risk. In a special removal hearing, the judge may disclose classified information to the alien under certain conditions, including providing a summary or substitution of the evidence if necessary to protect individuals from harm. In a special removal hearing, the judge may disclose classified information to the alien under certain conditions, including providing a summary or substitution of the evidence if necessary to protect individuals from harm. If the judge determines that the substituted evidence will provide the alien with the ability to make his defense or that disclosure would create a risk of harm, deportation may be determined accordingly. In a special removal hearing, the judge may disclose classified information to the alien under certain conditions, including providing a summary or substitution of the evidence if necessary to protect individuals from harm. If the determination in subsection (e)(6)(A) or (e)(6)(B) has been made, the judge shall require deportation if the Attorney General proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is subject to deportation as described in section 241(a)(4)(B). Appeals can be made pursuant to this section. The alien may appeal a determination under subsection (f) to the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit within twenty days. The Attorney General can also appeal a determination under subsection (d), (e), or (f) to the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit within twenty days. The entire record of the proceeding under this section shall be provided when requested by the Attorney General. The Federal Circuit allows appeals by the alien or the Attorney General within twenty days of a determination under subsections (d), (e), or (f). The entire record can be transmitted to the court of appeals under seal upon request by the Attorney General for an appeal to be considered in camera and ex parte."
