    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB within the Federal Reserve System, consolidating regulatory authority over various consumer financial products and services. The Bureau will supervise institutions offering deposit taking, mortgage lending, credit card lending, loan servicing, and other financial services. The CFPB, established under the Dodd-Frank Act, oversees consumer financial products and services such as debt collection, real estate settlement, and money transmitting. It enforces federal consumer laws like TILA and RESPA to protect consumers. The Bureau's authorities came into effect at different times, with most becoming effective on the designated transfer date. The CFPB's powers became effective at different times, with most set to go into effect on the designated transfer date. The appointment of a Director is crucial for the Bureau to exercise its powers under the CFP Act, but as of now, no Director has been appointed. The CFP Act grants the Secretary interim authority over the Bureau until a Director is appointed. Section 1066 outlines the Secretary's powers, with subsection 1066(b) allowing the Treasury Department to provide administrative support to the Bureau. Section 1066 grants the Treasury Department the authority to provide administrative services to support the Bureau before the designated transfer date. The specific services are not defined, but could include human resources and technology support. These powers expire on the transfer date. The Treasury Department is authorized to provide administrative support services, including human resources and technology support, to the Bureau until the Director is confirmed by the Senate. This authority expires on the designated transfer date. The Secretary's authority under subsection 1066(a) is limited to the functions of the Bureau under subtitle F, which do not expire until a Director is appointed. Subtitle F transfers consumer financial protection functions to the Bureau from seven \"transferor agencies.\" The Secretary, under interim authority, will transfer consumer financial protection functions from seven agencies to the Bureau on a designated date. This includes rulemaking authority under 18 consumer laws previously held by the transferor agencies. The Bureau will receive all authority to prescribe rules or issue orders under Federal consumer financial laws, including rulemaking authority under 18 consumer laws held by various agencies. This includes supervisory authority over larger depository institutions and coordination of employee transfers to the CFPB. The CFPB has the authority to coordinate the transfer of employees from transferor agencies to perform transferred authorities. Identified personnel must be transferred to the Bureau within 90 days. Most authorities under subtitle F will go into effect on the designated transfer date. The Secretary can exercise all transferred authorities until a CFPB Director is appointed. The CFP Act subsection 1066(a) gives the Secretary the power to exercise the Bureau's transferred authorities until a CFPB Director is appointed. These authorities include consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers over larger depository institutions, as well as the power to issue rules to implement consumer laws. The Secretary can also provide necessary administrative support functions until the designated transfer date. The powers under subtitle F are expansive but do not cover all of the CFPB's powers. The CFPB's powers under subtitle F are broad but do not encompass all of its authorities. The Bureau's newly established powers include enhanced supervisory powers over non-depository financial institutions, new rulemaking powers, and limited enforcement powers over smaller depository institutions. These powers are provided for in CFP Act section 1024. The CFPB has supervisory powers over smaller depository institutions and certain non-depository financial institutions like payday loan providers, mortgage brokers, and student loan providers. The Bureau can also identify other institutions for supervision and prescribe regulations for larger participants in consumer financial markets. The CFPB, in consultation with the FTC, can identify larger participants in consumer financial markets for supervision. This includes conducting examinations, imposing reporting requirements, and ensuring compliance with consumer laws. Covered non-depository financial institutions must register with the Bureau and meet eligibility standards to participate in certain markets. The CFPB has the authority to supervise covered non-depository financial institutions by requiring registration, background checks, and bond requirements. Section 1024 grants the Bureau consumer compliance enforcement powers over these institutions, with rulemaking powers provided in subtitle C and section 1022 of the CFP Act. The CFPB has the authority to prescribe regulations, issue orders, and provide guidance to administer consumer financial laws. Subtitle C grants the Bureau the power to issue specific regulations, including declaring acts or practices as unfair, deceptive, or abusive. Subtitle B provides rulemaking authority for disclosures on consumer financial products and services. Subtitle C grants the Bureau rulemaking authority for disclosures on consumer financial products and services, including establishing model disclosure forms. The Bureau's enforcement powers over smaller depository institutions are limited, with a back-up role to their banking regulators. The CFP Act allows the Bureau to refer potential enforcement actions against smaller depository institutions to their banking regulators and participate in examinations on a sampling basis. The Bureau may refer enforcement actions against smaller depository institutions to their banking regulators and participate in examinations on a sampling basis. The CFPB will have access to examination reports prepared by the banking regulators of these institutions and can require them to submit reports directly. Limited supervisory and enforcement authority over smaller depository institutions will take effect on the designated transfer date. Newly established powers are provided for by provisions other than subtitle F. The Bureau's limited supervisory and enforcement authority over smaller depository institutions will take effect on the designated transfer date. These newly established powers are not considered \"administrative services\" under the CFP Act and may not be exercised until a Bureau Director is appointed. Actions taken by the Bureau so far have been administrative functions or in preparation for substantive authorities to be implemented on the transfer date. The Bureau has not yet prescribed regulations, proposed regulations, entered into binding enforcement actions, or exercised supervisory powers over financial institutions. Instead, actions taken include talking to interested parties, collecting information on consumer financial products and services, complaints, coordinating personnel transfers, conducting planning meetings, and hiring new personnel. The Bureau has taken administrative and preparatory steps such as collecting information on consumer complaints, coordinating personnel transfers, conducting planning meetings, hiring new personnel, securing office space, and websites. These actions align with the Treasury Department's CFPB responsibilities and the Bureau's planned activities. The Bureau has taken administrative steps in preparation for acquiring its consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers over larger depository institutions, as well as rulemaking authority under various consumer laws. The Secretary's interim Bureau powers may expand after the designated transfer date if a Bureau Director has not yet been appointed. The Secretary's interim Bureau powers may expand after the designated transfer date if a Bureau Director has not yet been appointed, potentially leading to substantive actions impacting financial institutions participating in consumer financial markets. For example, the FRB proposed regulations under TILA authority, including origination standards for certain mortgage lenders. The 474-page proposal was issued on April 19, 2011, open for comments until July 22, 2011, one day after the transfer date of authority to the Bureau. The authority to prescribe regulations under TILA will transfer to the Bureau on July 21, 2011. Final regulations imposing mortgage origination standards must be prescribed by the Bureau, not the FRB. The Secretary may also have the authority to issue these regulations until a Bureau Director is appointed. The Secretary may have the authority to issue final regulations until a Bureau Director is appointed under the CFP Act. However, the limits of the Secretary's authorities may not always be clear, leading to potential lawsuits claiming actions exceed authority. Predicting outcomes of such lawsuits is difficult due to various facts and circumstances."
