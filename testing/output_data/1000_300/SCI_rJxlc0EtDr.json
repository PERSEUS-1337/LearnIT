A study employed an associative inference task from human neuroscience to assess reasoning capacity in memory-augmented architectures. Current models struggle with long-distance associations, prompting the development of a new architecture, MEMO, capable of reasoning over longer distances. This was achieved through the addition of two novel components. MEMO is a novel architecture designed to reason over longer distances by introducing a separation between memories and facts stored in external memory. It utilizes an adaptive retrieval mechanism for solving reasoning tasks and is capable of handling complex judgments that require connecting facts acquired at different points in time. Inferential reasoning involves combining separate experiences to infer relationships, supported by the hippocampus. Memories are stored independently to minimize interference. The hippocampus stores memories independently through pattern separation to minimize interference. Recent research shows that integration of separated experiences occurs at retrieval, allowing for inference. The integration of separated experiences at retrieval allows for inference, as shown by recent research. Neural networks with external memory, such as the Differential Neural Computer (DNC) and end-to-end memory networks (EMN), have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities. Enhanced attention mechanisms and context utilization have also enabled traditional neural networks to tackle similar tasks. The introduction of a new task, Paired Associative Inference (PAI), aims to capture inferential reasoning by forcing neural networks to learn abstractions to solve unseen associations. Derived from neuroscientific literature, PAI involves appreciating distant relationships among elements distributed across multiple facts or memories. This task challenges neural networks to overcome degenerate solutions by learning to make connections between disparate pieces of information. The PAI task challenges neural networks to learn abstractions for inferential reasoning by appreciating distant relationships among elements distributed across multiple facts or memories. Our approach, called MEMO, retains the full set of facts into memory and utilizes a linear projection paired with a powerful recurrent attention mechanism to support memory-based reasoning. Our approach, MEMO, retains all facts in memory and uses a linear projection with a recurrent attention mechanism for flexible weighting of individual elements. This addresses the issue of prohibitive computation time in standard neural networks. Our approach, MEMO, uses a linear projection with a recurrent attention mechanism to adapt the amount of compute time to the complexity of the task. This is inspired by a model of human associative memory called REMERGE. In our MEMO approach, inspired by REMERGE, a neural network uses a halting policy to determine when to stop computing and querying memory, similar to adaptive computation time. The network learns the termination criteria of a fixed point operator and adjusts weights using reinforcement learning. The network in the MEMO approach learns the termination criteria of a fixed point operator and uses reinforcement learning to adjust weights based on the optimal number of computation steps. By adding an extra term to the REINFORCE loss, the network minimizes the expected number of computation steps, encouraging representations and computation that require less computation. The contributions of the study include a new task emphasizing reasoning, an investigation of memory representation for inferential reasoning, an extension of memory architectures, and empirical results on tasks like paired associative inference and shortest path finding. The network in the approach learns termination criteria and uses reinforcement learning to minimize computation steps. The study introduces a new task focusing on reasoning and explores memory representation for inferential reasoning. It extends memory architectures and presents empirical results on tasks like paired associative inference and shortest path finding. The network learns termination criteria and utilizes reinforcement learning to reduce computation steps.

The network learns termination criteria and utilizes reinforcement learning to reduce computation steps. In the model, the input sequence length is represented by I, and the length of each input sentence is represented by S. Each word is embedded and summed using embedding matrices for key, values, and query. Positional encoding and element-wise multiplication are used, with weights calculated over memory elements to produce the output.

EMN and MEMO are two models discussed, with EMN using weights over memory slots and trained via cross entropy loss, while MEMO embeds input differently by deriving a common embedding for each input matrix. MEMO introduces a new approach for memory representation in inferential reasoning tasks. It utilizes multiple heads to attend to memory, allowing flexibility in capturing different parts of input sentences. Each head has a unique view of the common inputs, enhancing the model's ability to reason and make inferences effectively.

Each head has a unique view of the common inputs, enhancing the model's ability to reason and make inferences effectively. In the model, embedding matrices for key, values, and query are used, along with operations like flattening and vector-to-matrix conversions. The attention mechanism in MEMO differs from previous methods by using multi-head attention, DropOut, and LayerNorm for improved generalization and learning dynamics. The attention mechanism in MEMO is adapted to use multi-head attention, DropOut, and LayerNorm for improved generalization and learning dynamics. It involves matrices for transforming logits and queries, as well as an output MLP for producing answers. Unlike previous methods, MEMO preserves the query separated from the keys and values in the attention mechanism. MEMO's attention mechanism differs from Vaswani et al. (2017) by preserving query separation from keys and values, leading to linear complexity compared to quadratic in methods like self-attention. The process involves learning the number of computational steps required for effective answers through observations processed by GRUs and an MLP defining a binary policy. The process involves learning the number of computational steps required for effective answers through observations processed by GRUs and an MLP defining a binary policy. The input to the network is formed by the Bhattacharyya distance between attention weights of current and previous time steps, and the number of steps taken so far. The network is trained using REINFORCE. The network is trained using REINFORCE to adjust parameters with a n-step look ahead values. A new term, L Hop, is introduced in the loss function to minimize the expected number of hops in the binary policy. The introduction of the new term L Hop in the loss function aims to minimize the expected number of hops in the binary policy, encouraging the network to prefer representations that minimize required computation. The variance when training discrete random variables is a concern, but for a binary halting random variable, the variance is bounded by 1/4, allowing for successful learning. The reward structure is defined by the target answer and the prediction from the network. The final layer of M LP R was initialized with bias init to increase the chances of producing a probability of 1. A maximum number of hops, N, was set for the network, with no gradient sharing between the hop network and the main MEMO network. Model hyperparameters are reported in appendix D. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in memory-augmented networks for abstract and relational reasoning tasks. The Differential Neural Computer (DNC) is an influential model that operates sequentially on inputs, learning to read and write to a memory store. While the DNC struggled with scalability, incorporating sparsity improved its performance on larger tasks. Several alternative memory-augmented architectures have since been developed. Several alternative memory-augmented architectures have been developed since the publication of initial models in 2016. These include the Dynamic Memory Network, Recurrent Entity Network, Working Memory Network, and RelationNet, each showing strong performance on various tasks like the bAbI task suite. The curr_chunk discusses new models incorporating working memory buffer and RelationNet for relational reasoning. These models perform well on tasks like the bAbI task suite. Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) and Adaptive Early Exit Networks are approaches to adapt computational budget based on task complexity. The curr_chunk discusses different approaches to conditional computation, such as Adaptive Early Exit Networks and the use of REINFORCE to adjust the number of computation steps dynamically. These techniques have been applied to recurrent neural networks to optimize processing efficiency. The curr_chunk introduces a method that uses the distance between attention weights at different time steps as a proxy to determine if more information needs to be retrieved from memory in neural networks augmented with external memory. This approach differs from others in the use of REINFORCE loss and the concept of introducing additional hops for information retrieval. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) involve iterative message passing to propagate embeddings in a graph, using neural networks for tasks like supervised learning. Unlike GNNs, the method discussed here does not rely on recurrent components but instead uses a different approach for information retrieval. Our method differs from GNNs by performing adaptive computation for message passing steps and direct input queries to memory slots. It introduces a task to probe neural network reasoning capacity, derived from neuroscience. One contribution of this paper is to introduce a task, derived from neuroscience, to probe the reasoning capacity of neural networks. The task involves paired associative inference (PAI), where two images are randomly associated together to test the appreciation of distant relationships among elements. In the PAI task, the agent is presented with pairs of images to test memory and inference abilities. Direct queries test episodic memory, while indirect queries require inference across multiple episodes. The task aims to probe the reasoning capacity of neural networks. The PAI task tests memory and inference abilities by presenting pairs of images. Indirect queries require inference across episodes to determine the relationship between images.

Table 1 shows the results of our model (MEMO) and other baselines on the hardest inference query for each PAI task. MEMO achieved the highest accuracy on the A-B-C set and successfully answered the most complex inference queries on longer sequences. Further analysis was conducted on the length 3 PAI task to understand these results. MEMO outperformed other memory-augmented architectures like EMN, DNC, and UT in solving complex inference queries, especially on longer sequences. Further analysis on the length 3 PAI task revealed that MEMO achieved high accuracy with fewer steps compared to DNC. The attention weights of an inference query showed how MEMO associated cues with matches and avoided interference. MEMO outperformed other memory-augmented architectures in solving complex inference queries, especially on longer sequences. In a sequence A \u2212 B \u2212 C, MEMO retrieved memories in slots 10 and 25, correctly assigning probability masses to support a correct inference decision. This activation sequence was reminiscent of the one predicted. In the second hop, ID 943 had mass associated with it. MEMO assigned probability masses to slots for correct inference, confirmed in the last hop. Different patterns of memories activation were observed in another instance of MEMO using 7 hops. The algorithm used to solve the inference problem depends on the number of hops taken. This could be related to knowledge distillation in neural networks. The inference problem depends on the number of hops taken in the network. Knowledge distillation in neural networks may play a role in this process. Ablation experiments on MEMO confirmed that specific memory representations and recurrent attention mechanisms are crucial for successful inference. Direct queries test episodic memory and can be solved with a single memory look-up. The study compared adaptive computation mechanism with ACT and found the former more data efficient for inference queries.

In the 10k training regime, MEMO achieved high accuracy on bAbI tasks, matching other models but with lower error. Ablation experiments highlighted the importance of memory representations and recurrent attention. Layernorm in the attention mechanism improved stability and performance. In this paper, an in-depth investigation of memory representations supporting inferential reasoning was conducted. MEMO, an extension to existing memory architectures, showed state-of-the-art results in a new proposed task called paired associative inference.

Three sets were created with sequences of length three, four, and five items. Each dataset contained a large number of training, evaluation, and testing images. Each batch entry consisted of a memory, a query, and a target, with N sequences selected to create a single entry. For batch construction, sequences of length 3 were used with N=16 sequences selected. Memory content was created with pairwise associations between items in the sequence, resulting in a memory with 32 rows. Queries consisted of a cue, match, and lure image, with direct and indirect query types.

For the Universal Transformer, the query and graph description are embedded, concatenated, and used as input for the encoder. The output is used as the answer, with the previous answer serving as the initial query for the next round of hops. The Universal Transformer architecture concatenates query and graph description embeddings to generate answers, with each answer serving as the initial query for the next round. For DNC, the graph description tuples are presented first, followed by the query tuple, and pondering steps are used to output the shortest path nodes.
