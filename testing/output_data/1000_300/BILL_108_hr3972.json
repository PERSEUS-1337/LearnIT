The \"Protecting Our Children from Violence Act of 2004\" grants state social services officers online access to federal criminal databases for conducting criminal history records checks on individuals who resided with a minor during incidents of abuse or neglect. The \"Protecting Our Children from Violence Act of 2004\" allows state social services officers access to federal criminal databases to check the history of individuals involved in incidents of abuse or neglect of minors. This access is granted during or after incidents of abuse or neglect, as determined by the State agency head, and is limited to \"read only\" electronic access through the officer's State control terminal agency. The Attorney General ensures state social services officers have \"read only\" electronic access to FBI databases for missing persons checks. Officers must use this access only for missing child investigations and share information with law enforcement agencies. An individual becomes a covered officer if the head of a state social services agency submits a request to the Attorney General. Covered State social services officers must meet specific criteria and be certified by the head of a State agency responsible for social services to have access to FBI databases for missing child investigations. The certification includes verifying the officer's role, authority, and compliance with Federal standards. In this section, a control terminal agency is defined as a criminal justice agency with access to the National Crime Information Center network. The term \"State\" includes various territories and possessions of the United States. SEC. 3. Access to III by National Center for Missing and Exploited Children includes Case Analysis Division, Missing Children's Division, and Exploited Child Unit. Access is granted based on meeting Federal standards for training, certification, and background screening. SEC. 4. Privacy Protections are also ensured. Information obtained from checks or access under sections 2 and 3 must not be altered except for national security reasons. It can only be shared with authorized individuals or entities as required by law. Violating this rule may result in criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly releases information obtained from checks or access under sections 2 and 3 in violation of the law may face imprisonment for up to 1 year or fines under title 18, United States Code."
