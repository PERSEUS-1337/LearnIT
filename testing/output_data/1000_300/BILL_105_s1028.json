    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group Proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal is an agreement by a coalition in northern California to develop a resource management program for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. It includes a map dated June 1993. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to implement a pilot project for the forests mentioned in the Act. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a pilot project on Federal lands in California to demonstrate resource management activities as recommended in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The Secretary will conduct a pilot project on Federal lands in California within designated areas, excluding spotted owl habitats and protected activity centers for resource management activities. During the pilot project on Federal lands in California, all spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers will be deferred from resource management activities and timber harvesting. The Regional Forester for region 5 will direct that no resource management activities, road building, or timber harvesting be conducted on designated Federal lands in the State of California during the pilot project. During the pilot project in California, certain areas in Lassen National Forest and Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest are designated as \"Off Base\" or \"Deferred\" for resource management activities and timber harvesting. Riparian protection guidelines apply to all activities in the pilot project area. The guidelines for resource management activities in late-successional and old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest are outlined in a Forest Service research document co-authored by Dr. Jack Ward Thomas. Compliance with applicable Federal law and conservation standards for the California spotted owl is required for all activities. During the pilot project, the Secretary will implement resource management activities on Federal lands, including fuelbreak construction on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year. During the pilot project, the Secretary will implement vegetation management activities on Federal lands, including group selection and individual tree selection to achieve fire resilient forests. Group selection will be done on an average of .57 percent of the pilot project area each year, while individual tree selection may also be utilized. During the pilot project, vegetation management activities will be implemented on Federal lands, including group selection and individual tree selection. The total acreage for resource management activities shall not exceed 70,000 acres each year. Riparian management, cost-effectiveness, and funding are also key components of the project. During the pilot project, the Secretary will use cost-effective means to implement resource management activities on Federal lands. Funding will come from specific funds provided to the Forest Service and excess funds allocated for the administration of certain national forests. During the pilot project, the Secretary will use excess funds allocated for the administration and management of specific national forests, including Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest. The Secretary is prohibited from using funds appropriated for any other unit of the National Forest System. Forest supervisors have flexibility to allocate and use excess funds for the project. The Secretary and Tahoe National Forest can use excess funds for managing specific forests like Plumas National Forest and Lassen National Forest. Restrictions apply to prevent limiting other activities, and overhead costs are capped at 12 percent. The Secretary can use excess funds for managing specific forests like Plumas National Forest and Lassen National Forest, with overhead costs capped at 12 percent. At least 88 percent of funds must be used for required activities, and additional funds may be appropriated as necessary. Baseline funding levels must be maintained for resource management activities authorized under subsection (d). The pilot project will run from the enactment of the Act until a specified date. The pilot project will be conducted for a minimum of five years, starting from the enactment of the Act. The Secretary must consult with the Quincy Library Group for each required statement and may use private contracts for project requirements. The Forest Service may use private contracts to carry out requirements in consultation with the Quincy Library Group. Within 180 days, the Regional Forester will start amending forest plans to incorporate the pilot project and other proposed changes. The Forest Service will implement resource management activities outlined in the Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal and make necessary changes based on environmental analyses. The Secretary will provide annual reports to Congress on the pilot project's progress and fund usage. The Quincy Library Group, in consultation with Congress, will submit a report on the pilot project's status. The report will include a complete accounting of fund usage, a description of treated acres for resource management activities, forest health improvements, and fire risk. The report on the pilot project's status will include a description of total acres treated for resource management activities, forest health improvements, fire risk reductions, water yield increases, economic benefits to local communities, and a comparison of revenues and costs incurred in the implementation of the activities on Federal lands. The final report for the pilot project will include a comparison of revenues and costs for resource management activities on Federal lands, a schedule for activities in the upcoming year, any adverse environmental impacts, and a limitation on annual expenditures not exceeding $50,000. The final report for the pilot project will assess the effectiveness of meeting goals, including watershed monitoring for water quality, timing of water releases, and water yield changes. Federal funds for annual reports are limited to $50,000. The final report for the pilot project will assess the timing of water releases, water quality changes, and water yield changes over the short and long term. It will also include an analysis of adverse environmental impacts and be compiled in consultation with the Quincy Library Group. The report must be submitted to Congress by July 1, 2002. Federal funds for the assessment and report are limited to $150,000, with an additional $75,000 allocated for watershed monitoring annually from 2000 to 2002. The subsection limits Federal funds for watershed monitoring to $150,000, with an additional $75,000 allocated annually for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. The pilot project is not exempt from any Federal environmental laws."
