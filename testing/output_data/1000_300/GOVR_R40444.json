    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms, including children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under 19 without health insurance and not eligible for Medicaid before March 31, 1997. States can set the income level for these children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. States have the authority to expand eligibility for all children under 19, with CMS approval required for certain expansions. Under current statutory and regulatory authority, states can expand eligibility for children under 19 to any level they choose. CHIPRA reduces federal payments for higher-income CHIP children, using the regular Medicaid FMAP for those with family incomes over 300% of poverty. States can assist qualifying children through their Medicaid programs or other means. States can provide assistance to qualifying children through their Medicaid programs or separate CHIP programs. Medicaid rules apply when covering low-income children under Medicaid, while Title XXI rules apply for separate CHIP programs. Federal CHIP funds cover the program costs, and states with approved CHIP plans receive federal allotments based on a distribution formula. Title XXI does not establish individual entitlement to benefits. Title XXI does not establish individual entitlement to benefits for low-income children covered under separate CHIP programs. States can cover these children by expanding Medicaid programs through new eligibility groups or liberalizing financial rules. Many states with Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs chose this approach. States have the option to cover targeted low-income children under existing Medicaid eligibility pathways or by establishing a separate CHIP program. This strategy reduces administrative burden and allows states to define eligibility based on factors such as geography, age, income, and resources. States can determine eligibility for separate CHIP programs based on factors like geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP eligibility. Before CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women through waivers or by providing prenatal care and delivery services to unborn children through a CHIP state plan amendment. States can extend coverage to pregnant women through Section 1115 waivers or CHIP state plan amendments. As of October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services to adults using CHIP funds, with some states extending coverage to unborn children as well. In FY2008, 364,161 unborn children were enrolled in CHIP, with nearly half in California. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with certain conditions to be met by states. Pregnant women must meet income requirements and have no pre-existing conditions to be eligible for CHIP coverage. Coverage includes prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, with infants born to these women also eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. States can provide temporary coverage for up to two months through presumptive eligibility. Benefits for pregnant women under CHIP include all services available to CHIP children, prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care. Infants born to these women are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one, with eligibility subject to redetermination. States may also offer postpartum services and coverage for legal immigrants after a five-year bar. The law requires sponsor's income and resources to be considered for legal immigrants, not refugees or asylees, in determining eligibility for federally means-tested programs. CHIPRA allowed states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and eligible children. The CHIP state plan option is available to states that elect this provision. The CHIPRA law allows states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and eligible children who are lawfully residing in the United States. States that elect this provision can provide assistance for pregnant women under the CHIP state plan option. The provision ensures that the cost of care will not be counted against an individual's sponsor, and individuals must provide further documentation if their initial legal residence documentation expires during redetermination processes. Under current law, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act grants the Secretary of Health and Human Services broad authority to modify aspects of CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to populations not typically eligible. States can use waivers to cover adults with CHIP funds, subject to renewal every three years. Individuals eligible under this provision must provide further documentation if their initial legal residence documentation expires during redetermination processes. Certain states have covered adults with CHIP funds through waivers, initially effective for five years and subject to renewal every three years. Prior to 2007, waiver renewals were approved even for states facing federal CHIP shortfalls. However, since 2007, some waiver renewals have not been approved or states have begun transitioning adult populations out of CHIP coverage. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to use CHIP funds to extend coverage to childless adult populations, and 7 states have authority to cover parent populations. CHIPRA terminates CHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing childless adult waivers are affected. CHIPRA terminates CHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing childless adult waivers can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage, tied to budget neutrality standards. Coverage of parents is permitted for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers, but spending will be subject to set-aside amounts starting in 2012. CHIPRA allows coverage of parents under CHIP parent coverage waivers, with spending subject to set-aside amounts starting in FY2012. States must meet coverage benchmarks to receive enhanced FMAP for parents in FY2013. Waiver spending is prohibited for parents with family income exceeding eligibility thresholds set in 2009. CHIPRA also includes provisions for access and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, with $100 million authorized for outreach. CHIPRA authorizes $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for Medicaid and CHIP, with a focus on rural areas and underserved populations. Grant funds will target proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. CHIPRA authorizes $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for Medicaid and CHIP, focusing on rural areas and underserved populations. Grant funds target proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment, with provisions to reduce administrative barriers and facilitate enrollment through \"Express Lane\" agencies. Under CHIPRA, states can use programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid, CHIP, and Food Stamps to determine a child's eligibility for medical assistance. States have the option for automatic enrollment through Express Lane eligibility determination with family consent. States can rely on reported income from state tax records. CHIPRA requires states to inform families about potential lower premiums or better coverage under Medicaid. Under CHIPRA, states are required to inform families about potential lower premium payments or more comprehensive health coverage under Medicaid. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) mandated proof of citizenship and identity for citizens and nationals applying for Medicaid. CHIPRA provided an alternative using Social Security Numbers verified by the SSA for citizenship verification. CHIPRA allows states to use Social Security Numbers verified by the SSA for citizenship verification in CHIP. Table 1 displays each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility, and enrollment data. New Jersey has the highest income eligibility limit at 350% of the FPL. Some states have CHIP coverage above 250% FPL, while others have income thresholds between 200% and 250% FPL. Twenty-two states have upper income limits at 200% FPL. In FY2008, CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million children, with about 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million under Medicaid. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adult populations, with 12 states reporting enrollment of about 335,000 adults in FY2008, mostly parents. In FY2008, 12 states reported enrollment of about 335,000 adults in CHIP, with most being parents. The number of CHIP-enrolled adults decreased from FY2006 and FY2007 due to changes in adult-coverage waivers. Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota had more adult CHIP enrollees than children in FY2008. States have the flexibility to cover low-income children under Medicaid, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both approaches. States have the option to cover low-income children under Medicaid, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both approaches. Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must provide mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to enroll children in new benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefit plans. These plans are similar to separate CHIP programs. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to enroll children in new benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefit plans, similar to separate CHIP programs. Under EPSDT, children receive well-child care, immunizations, and other screening services, as well as necessary medical care. States with separate CHIP programs can choose from three benefit options. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to enroll children in new benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefit plans under separate CHIP programs. States can choose from three benefit options: benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or any other health benefits plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Benchmark benefit package includes plans like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, state employee health coverage, or HMO with the largest commercial enrollment in the state. Benchmark-equivalent coverage has the same actuarial value as the benchmark benefit package. Benchmark-equivalent coverage under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 must include basic benefits like hospital services, physician services, lab services, and well-child care. It should also cover at least 75% of the actuarial value for additional services such as prescription drugs, vision, and hearing services. States are encouraged to provide this coverage for children in separate CHIP programs. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage must include at least 75% of the actuarial value for additional services like prescription drugs, vision, and hearing services. Abortions are only covered in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have CHIP programs with different approaches. CHIP programs in states use a combination approach, with benchmark plans based on state employees' health plans and secretary-approved plans modeled after Medicaid. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations for these benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. State CHIP plans must adhere to mental health parity requirements, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health and substance abuse disorder benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. Dental services are now a required benefit under separate CHIP programs, including services to prevent disease, promote oral health, restore oral structures, and treat emergency conditions. States have the option to provide dental services through \"benchmark dental\" plans. The new law requires dental services for children under CHIP programs, including preventive care, oral health promotion, and treatment for emergencies. States can offer dental benefits through benchmark plans, and parents of newborns will receive dental education. Detailed information on children's dental care must be reported annually, and data on providers and services will be accessible to the public. The federal Insure Kids Now website and hotline will provide information on dental providers and covered services for children. A study by GAO will assess children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for addressing barriers and using mid-level providers. CHIPRA allowed CHIP funds to be used for premium assistance programs, including dental-only supplemental coverage for children in employer-sponsored plans. CHIPRA provided states with the option to offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children enrolled in group or employer coverage who meet CHIP eligibility criteria. States can provide dental coverage consistent with new dental benchmark benefits plans or cost-sharing protections under CHIP, setting the income level for this benefit up to their separate CHIP programs' limit. States must meet certain conditions, including implementing the highest income eligibility permitted in federal CHIP statute as of January 1, 2009, and not imposing any enrollment limitations under CHIP. States must meet certain conditions to offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children enrolled in group or employer coverage who meet CHIP eligibility criteria, including implementing the highest income eligibility permitted in federal CHIP statute as of January 1, 2009, and not imposing any enrollment limitations under CHIP. Additionally, states may not provide more favorable dental coverage or related cost-sharing protections for children provided dental-only supplemental coverage than for CHIP children eligible for the full range of benefits. States can offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children in group or employer plans meeting CHIP eligibility criteria without an eligibility waiting period. Medicaid expansion CHIP programs may implement premium assistance if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective. Under Medicaid, states can implement premium assistance programs for individuals enrolled in employer plans if they are comprehensive and cost-effective. This includes providing \"wrap-around\" benefit coverage for services not included in private plans. Many states use waivers to navigate the requirements due to the prohibitive nature of meeting all criteria. States can offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance, under certain conditions. This includes providing outreach, education, and enrollment assistance as required by CHIPRA. States often use waivers to navigate the prohibitive requirements for comprehensive and cost-effective coverage. Under CHIPRA, states can provide premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance, under specific conditions. The assistance subsidy is typically the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for covering the child(ren) versus just the employee. If employer plans do not meet CHIP benefit requirements, a wrap-around coverage is necessary. Individuals eligible for both CHIP and employment-based coverage can choose regular CHIP over the premium assistance program. The subsidy under CHIPRA covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for child(ren) in employer plans. A wrap-around is required if the plan does not meet CHIP benefits. No cost-effectiveness test is needed for child coverage. A separate test is established for family coverage. States offering premium assistance must conduct outreach. States can create an employer-family premium assistance pool for small employers. Under CHIPRA, states can establish employer-family premium assistance pools for small employers with CHIP-eligible employees. The law also streamlines coordination between public and private coverage, making loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a qualifying event for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. The provision in CHIPRA allows states to establish employer-family premium assistance pools for small employers with CHIP-eligible employees, making loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a qualifying event for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Cost-sharing refers to out-of-pocket payments made by beneficiaries of a health insurance plan, including monthly premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. States can impose cost-sharing for some beneficiaries and services under CHIP, following nominal cost-sharing rules for targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Children aged 18 in Medicaid expansions under CHIP may be subject to service-related cost-sharing. Children under Medicaid must follow nominal cost-sharing rules, with exemptions for the majority. Those aged 18 in Medicaid expansions under CHIP may face service-related cost-sharing. DRA provided states with new options for premiums and cost-sharing for low-income children under CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs based on family income levels. Premiums are not allowed for families under 100% FPL, while service-related cost-sharing is limited. Families with income between 100%-150% FPL may have service-related cost-sharing up to 10%, and those above 150% FPL may have premiums and cost-sharing up to 20%. The DRA allows for cost-sharing up to 10% for children in families with income between 100%-150% FPL, and up to 20% for those above 150% FPL. Total cost-sharing cannot exceed 5% of family income. Preventive services for children are exempt from cost-sharing, and Medicaid cost-sharing amounts will be indexed by medical care inflation. States can condition Medicaid eligibility on premium payments and providers may deny care for non-payment. The DRA allows states to condition Medicaid eligibility on premium payments and providers may deny care for non-payment. CHIP programs may impose premiums or enrollment fees based on family income, with cost-sharing limited to nominal amounts for lower income families and slightly higher amounts for families with income between 100%-150% FPL. Cost-sharing in CHIP programs is limited to nominal amounts for lower-income families and slightly higher amounts for families with income between 100%-150% FPL. For families above 150% FPL, cost-sharing can be imposed in any amount, with a 5% out-of-pocket limit. States must inform families of these limits and provide a way to stop payments once the limit is reached. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families. The CHIP program provides preventive services for all families regardless of income, including newborn visits, physical exams, immunizations, dental services, and more. CHIPRA 2009 aimed to improve data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid, including developing child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. The CHIPRA 2009 law directed the Secretary of HHS to develop child health quality measures and reporting formats for CHIP and Medicaid. It also added reporting requirements to states' annual CHIP reports, including data on eligibility criteria and access to care. A study on children's access to care under Medicaid and CHIP was mandated, and a new federal commission called MACPAC was established to review policies affecting children's benefits. The CHIPRA 2009 law mandated the establishment of a new federal commission, MACPAC, to review policies affecting children's benefits under Medicaid and CHIP. The commission will provide regular reports to Congress with recommendations for improving access and quality of care for children. Additionally, the law required the Secretary of HHS to conduct a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans to assess effectiveness of outreach and enrollment. The federal evaluation of CHIP coverage will assess outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, disenrollment factors, and retention of children. Federal financing for CHIP includes appropriations for states' annual allotments, reallocation of funds, and other factors like matching rates and administrative expense caps. BBA 97 allocated around $40 billion for CHIP from FY1998 to FY2007, with funding levels varying annually. The BBA 97 allocated approximately $40 billion for CHIP from FY1998 to FY2007, with funding levels varying annually. The funding dropped from over $4.2 billion in FY1998-FY2001 to under $3.2 billion in FY2002-FY2004, then increased to about $4.1 billion for FY2005 and FY2006, and further to roughly $5.0 billion in FY2007. The \"CHIP dip\" in funding for FY2002-FY2004 was due to budgetary constraints. The 110th Congress passed bills to reauthorize CHIP for FY2008-FY2012, but they were vetoed by President George W. The 110th Congress passed bills to reauthorize CHIP for FY2008-FY2012, but they were vetoed by President George W. Bush due to budgetary constraints. In lieu of reauthorization, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 appropriated funds for CHIP allotments for FY2008 and FY2009. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation totaling $68.9 billion from FY2009 to FY2013 for CHIP allotments. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation for CHIP allotments totaling $68.9 billion from FY2009 to FY2013. The allotment of the annual federal CHIP appropriation among the states is determined by a formula set in law, based on the number of low-income children in the state and the number of uninsured children. Prior to CHIPRA, the territories received 0.25% of the national appropriation, with the remainder divided among the states based on a formula using survey estimates. The CHIP allotments from FY2008 and FY2009 were divided among states based on a formula using survey estimates of low-income and uninsured children. Allotments were adjusted by a geographic factor and limited by floors and ceilings to ensure consistency. Allotments are separate funding accounts available for a certain period, with prior allotments available for three years. The CHIP allotments are separate funding accounts available for a certain period, with FY2009 allotments only available for two years. States can draw from the earliest active account until fully expended, then move to the next available allotment. FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are based on a formula using growth factors and state projections of federal CHIP spending. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are calculated based on a formula using growth factors and state projections of federal CHIP spending. The largest of three amounts will be increased by 10% to determine the state's FY2009 federal CHIP allotment, with adjustments made if the national appropriation is insufficient. For FY2010, the allotment will be calculated based on four amounts, including the FY2009 CHIP allotment and spending from various sources in FY2009. For FY2009, FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013, federal CHIP allotments for states are calculated based on growth factors and state projections of federal CHIP spending. Allotments are rebased or calculated based on prior year spending, with unspent allotments redistributed to other states at the end of the period. Rules vary by fiscal year. In FY2006, unspent funds from states with exhausted allotments were redistributed, but additional funds were needed to cover projected shortfalls in 12 states. Illinois and Massachusetts had higher CHIP spending than expected, resulting in shortfalls totaling around $100 million, mostly from Illinois. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent FY2004 allotments was available for redistribution. In FY2006, Illinois and Massachusetts had higher CHIP spending than expected, resulting in shortfalls totaling around $100 million, mostly from Illinois. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent FY2004 allotments was available for redistribution, with a bill passed to specify how those funds would be redistributed based on states facing monthly funding shortfalls. The NIHRA provisions aimed to delay shortfalls in federal CHIP funds by redistributing unspent FY2005 allotments, with a cap of $20 million per state. States were required to have double their projected FY2007 CHIP balances to forgo unspent funds, providing an additional $138 million for shortfall states. This was projected to delay shortfalls until May 2007, with remaining shortfalls estimated at over $600 million in 12 states. In FY2007, additional funding of $138 million was provided for shortfall states, delaying any state facing a shortfall of federal CHIP funds until May 2007. P.L. 110-28 appropriated up to $650 million to cover shortfalls in 10 states for the remainder of FY2007. For FY2008, unspent FY2005 allotments were redistributed to shortfall states on a monthly basis, with an additional $1.6 billion appropriated for remaining shortfalls. In FY2008, unspent FY2005 allotments were redistributed to states with shortfalls on a monthly basis. MMSEA appropriated up to $1.6 billion for remaining shortfalls, providing just under $1 billion in actual funding. For FY2009, unspent FY2006 allotments were redistributed to states projected to face shortfalls before March 31, 2009. MMSEA also allocated up to $275 million for remaining shortfalls through March 31, 2009. The increased FY2009 allotments from CHIPRA should prevent federal funding shortfalls for the second half of FY2009. Any unspent funds under CHIPRA would first go to shortfall states. The creation of a Child Enrollment Contingency Fund under CHIPRA prevents states from facing federal funding shortfalls. This fund receives a separate appropriation and can provide direct payments to states for CHIP children above a target enrollment level. Payments cannot exceed 20% of the national allotment amount and are to be reduced proportionally if necessary. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund under CHIPRA prevents federal funding shortfalls for CHIP children above target enrollment. Payments from the fund are capped at 20% of the national allotment and are reduced proportionally if needed. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP lowers state expenditures by 30% compared to the regular FMAP, excluding temporary Medicaid FMAP increases from ARRA. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. Federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses is capped, with a 10% limit on state non-benefit expenses. Under CHIP, a 10% cap applies to state non-benefit expenses for federal matching purposes. This cap is tied to the dollar amount that a state draws down from its annual allotment to cover benefits and non-benefit costs. Federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach and enrollment activities. Funding for these payments comes from an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009."
