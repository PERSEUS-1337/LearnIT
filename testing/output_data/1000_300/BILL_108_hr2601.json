    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" is the short title of the Act. It includes findings related to the public domain. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the US Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times. This serves to provide economic incentives for authors to create new works and promotes society's interest in the free flow of ideas and commerce. The copyright clause in the US Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times. This serves to provide economic incentives for authors to create new works and promotes society's interest in the free flow of ideas and commerce.

Under current copyright law, works published as early as 1923 are protected, but the majority of older works are no longer commercially available. Only 2 percent of works between 55 and 75 years old retain commercial value. Despite this, abandoned works will not enter the public domain for many years, hindering entities from building upon them. Older works may not have commercial value but can be useful for historians, artists, and teachers. The existing copyright system does not align with the original intent of the Constitution and the Copyright Act, as it hinders the public from accessing abandoned works that hold historical and educational value. It is necessary to establish a mechanism for abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE FEE FOR PUBLISHED UNITED STATES WORKS.
