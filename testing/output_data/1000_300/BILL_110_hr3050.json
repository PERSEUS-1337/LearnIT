    "content": "The consent of Congress is given to an interstate forest fire protection compact known as \"THE GREAT PLAINS WILDLAND FIRE PROTECTION AGREEMENT\" between State, Provincial, and Territorial wildland fire protection agencies. The Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement aims to prevent and control forest fires in the region by maintaining adequate firefighting services and providing reciprocal aid among member states like South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. The compact becomes effective once ratified by any two or more member states. The Great Plains Wildland Fire Protection Agreement becomes operative immediately upon ratification by two or more member states. Each state appoints a compact administrator responsible for forest fire control and can collaborate with other member states to prevent and control forest fires. Member states can coordinate services and implement forest fire plans. \"Member states can request aid from each other for combating forest fires, with the condition of maintaining protection at home.\" \"If member states provide outside aid as requested, their employees will have similar powers, duties, and immunities as employees of the state receiving aid. There is no liability for acts or omissions during the aid, except as specified in the compact.\" The requesting state assumes liability for any issues arising from aid requests under this compact. The aiding state will be reimbursed for expenses related to providing aid, including equipment, materials, transportation, and employee costs. Assisting states can choose to waive costs or donate services without charge. The compact ensures that assisting member states can be reimbursed for expenses related to providing aid, including equipment and employee costs. Workers compensation benefits must be available to all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers or auxiliaries within the forest fire fighting forces of the aiding state. Compact administrators may establish procedures for claims and reimbursement in accordance with state laws. \"ARTICLE VI outlines procedures for reimbursement of expenses related to providing aid, including equipment and employee costs. Workers compensation benefits must be available to all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state.\" The compact does not allow any member state to reduce their forest fire fighting forces, equipment, services, or facilities. Each state must maintain adequate resources for forest fire protection as if the compact was not in place. States are still empowered to enact laws and regulations for fire prevention and control. The compact allows states to work together to prevent, control, and extinguish forest fires without affecting existing relationships with the US Forest Service. \"Representatives of the United States Forest Service may attend meetings of the compact administrators. The provisions of Articles IV and V of this compact regarding reciprocal aid in combating forest fires apply between states party to this compact and other states that have given assent to mutual aid provisions.\" The compact remains in force until a state takes action to withdraw, with a six-month notice period required."
