Understanding the congressional environment requires attention to party organization and decision-making processes. The rules of the House are not aimed at achieving specific legislative outcomes but are accessible to all Members regardless of party control.

Changes in House rules, such as the Corrections Calendar, have had significant impacts over the years. The procedure of legislation under suspension of the rules has evolved from being minor and infrequent to a regular occurrence. The House rules have evolved over time, with motions to suspend the rules now being a regular occurrence. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 called for two budget resolutions each year but was impractical and time-consuming, leading to its abandonment. The rules are essential for governance and are meant to be used by all Members, regardless of party affiliation."
