    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing different approaches to controlling this pollution, including market-oriented mechanisms. The Administration's \"Clear Skies\" proposal was compared to bills by Senators Jeffords and Carper, with the Administration initially reluctant to conduct the study due to cost and difficulty. The Administration initially resisted conducting a cost-benefit analysis of the Clear Skies bill and other Senate bills proposed by Senators Jeffords and Carper. However, after facing opposition and concerns about the lack of comparison between the bills, the analysis was eventually conducted and released. Electric utility generating facilities are highlighted as significant sources of air pollution. The EPA Administrator conducted a cost-benefit analysis of Clear Skies and other Senate bills, revealing that electric utility generating facilities are major sources of air pollution due to the combustion of fossil fuels. Emissions include pollutants like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, with regulations in place for some gases. Carbon dioxide poses indirect risks, such as contributing to global warming. Emissions of SO2 and NOx have decreased over time. The EPA has finalized rules to regulate mercury emissions from electric generating facilities. SO2 and NOx emissions have decreased due to regulations, but CO2 emissions continue to rise. Fossil-fuel-fired plants account for a significant portion of the country's emissions, with uncertainty surrounding Hg emissions. Current estimates show that 45 tons of emissions, over 40% of the country's total, come from electric generating units. Air pollution controls have evolved over time, with a focus on reducing NOx, SO2, and Hg emissions. The US has voluntary limits on CO2 emissions but rejected mandatory limits under the Kyoto Protocol. The US has voluntary limits on CO2 emissions but rejected mandatory limits under the Kyoto Protocol. The Senate passed a resolution calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases without significant harm to the economy. Efforts are being made to simplify the air quality control regime through a \"multi-pollutant\" approach targeting SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 emissions from utility sources. The \"four-pollutant\" approach aims to regulate utility emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 through a mix of regulatory and economic mechanisms. This approach seeks to balance environmental goals with industry stability and has already been integrated into existing laws through finalized rules like CAIR, CAMR, and CAVR. More reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions are expected in the future. The Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) focuses on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions that impair visibility around national parks and wilderness areas. Mercury emissions are also a concern, with 44 states issuing fish consumption advisories. Mercury enters water bodies from air emissions, affecting millions of acres of lakes and rivers. Mercury enters water bodies from air emissions, affecting millions of acres of lakes and rivers. Legislation addressing power plant pollution could achieve health and environmental goals in a cost-effective way. Bills in the 109th Congress aim to impose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. The proposed legislation, known as \"Clear Skies,\" would rely on a system of tradeable allowances similar to the acid rain program. The legislative proposals in the 109th Congress aim to impose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. The Clear Skies bill would implement national or regional caps on emissions through a system of tradeable allowances, with deadlines set for 2018 for a 70%-90% reduction in emissions. The Clear Skies bill (S. 131) would require reductions of 70%-90% in SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions by 2018, with a phased approach and banking provisions allowing utilities to overcomply early and use credits for future reductions. The Clear Skies bill aims for significant emissions reductions by 2018, allowing banking of allowances for future use. However, full compliance may be delayed until 2026 or later. In contrast, the Jeffords and Carper bills have earlier and stricter emission caps, leading to compliance at least a decade sooner. Clear Skies does not address carbon dioxide emissions, while the other bills do, potentially impacting compliance strategies and the coal market. The Clear Skies bill does not regulate carbon dioxide emissions, unlike the Jeffords and Carper bills. The EPA's cost-benefit analysis compared various options, showing little difference between the Clear Skies options. Senator Carper's Clean Air Planning Act and Senator Jeffords' Clean Power Act were also considered in the analysis. The EPA's analysis compared Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords bills, showing little difference between the options. The chosen Clear Skies version was the Managers' Mark offered in March 2005. The baseline assumes no additional action on emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004. The EPA's baseline assumes no additional action on emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004, despite recent rules by EPA on SO2, NOx, and Hg. The uncertainty surrounding these rules is compared to the uncertainty of multi-pollutant legislation. The uncertainty surrounding clean air regulations, such as S. 843 introduced in the 108th Congress, highlights the evolving nature of legislation and regulations. EPA's cost analysis emphasizes the importance of updated baseline projections and assumptions for controlling air pollution effectively. The EPA's cost analysis focuses on key parameters like Electric Demand Price Elasticity and Short-term Construction Constraints to control air pollution effectively. The EPA's cost analysis considers factors like electricity demand growth, natural gas prices, and construction constraints in controlling air pollution. EPA developed scenarios based on different assumptions to assess the impact of proposed legislation on prices. The EPA developed four scenarios to assess the impact of proposed legislation on prices, each based on different assumptions. The scenarios include variations in price elasticity, construction constraints, electricity demand growth, and natural gas supply assumptions. This report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as the benchmark analysis. The report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as a benchmark analysis, which includes variations in price elasticity, construction constraints, electricity demand growth, and natural gas supply assumptions. The strongest case is made for including a short-term demand response function in the modeling, as it aligns with established short-term price elasticities in the literature. EPA's decision to only include this refinement in one scenario raises questions about why it was not incorporated into all scenarios. The EPA's Four Scenarios were used in the Demand Response Scenario, with the demand function included in only one scenario. The assumption about limited boilermaker labor until 2010 in three scenarios has been questioned by some, including the Institute of Clean Air Companies. EPA's decision to include this constraint in its regulatory rulemaking on the Clean Air Interstate Rule has raised concerns. The Institute of Clean Air Companies questioned the assumption of limited boilermaker labor until 2010 in the EPA's regulatory rulemaking on the Clean Air Interstate Rule. They demonstrated the industry's ability to install air pollution control equipment quickly, citing examples from recent installations in Germany and Japan. Labor availability for construction was found not to be a constraint, even with a 2015 deadline for the rule. The installation of air pollution control equipment has been demonstrated to be efficient, with examples from Germany and Japan. The resources required for projected installations are expected to be sufficient, with factors like modular construction methods reducing demand for union boilermakers. In case of a shortage, additional boilermaker labor can be sourced from Canadian unions, ship builders, and iron workers. Overall, there will be more than enough capacity to carry out the installations. The installation of air pollution control equipment is expected to have sufficient boilermaker capacity, with additional labor available from Canadian unions, ship builders, and iron workers if needed. The projected requirements for 2010 and 2015 can be met, with the possibility of completing the 2015 requirements by 2010. The assumption of limited boilermaker availability only affects certain scenarios analyzed by the EPA. The analysis focuses on the demand elasticity assumption and the future natural gas supply. EPA's demand response scenario is chosen as the base case, and sensitivity analysis is crucial for understanding cost estimates due to uncertainties in natural gas supply projections. EPA's model projects more natural gas availability at lower prices compared to EIA's supply curves. The analysis highlights the importance of understanding cost estimates and the differences between EPA's and EIA's natural gas supply curves. While EIA's curves may be more representative of future supplies, the volatility of the natural gas market and the 15-year timeframe leave room for debate. The Demand Response Scenario is used as the basis for discussion, considering the feasibility constraints and historic market volatility. Based on the analysis using the Demand Response Scenario, Clear Skies bill has the lowest cost compared to other bills, with minimal costs and benefits. It has less stringent requirements and later deadlines, resulting in lower annual costs in the early years. However, it lacks provisions for CO2 and has weak provisions for Hg compared to other bills. In the early years, Clear Skies bill has lower annual costs compared to other bills, with weak provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2. Its benefits are substantially less than the Carper and Jeffords bills, with benefits almost merging with baseline increase in later years. The Clear Skies bill has lower annual costs in the early years compared to other bills, with weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2. Its benefits lag behind the Carper and Jeffords bills due to less stringent pollution caps and a more relaxed implementation schedule. When compared to current Clean Air Act requirements, Clear Skies has minimal incremental costs and relatively small benefits, suggesting EPA's success in incorporating its market-based regulatory scheme. The EPA has successfully incorporated a market-based regulatory scheme into its new regulations, as shown by the minimal incremental costs and relatively small benefits of the Clear Skies bill compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills. Senator Jeffords' bill is projected to have the greatest benefits, exceeding those of the other bills in both 2010 and 2020. In 2020, the benefits of S. 150 exceed those of the Carper bill and Clear Skies, estimated at $66 billion annually. S. 150 is also projected to be the most costly bill, with limitations on scrubber installations due to skilled labor shortages. EPA's cost and benefit estimates for the three multi-pollutant proposals are compared with existing law. The Jeffords bill, S. 150, is projected to be the most costly among the three multi-pollutant proposals. EPA states that skilled labor shortages will limit scrubber installations, leading to a 40% reduction in coal production and coal-fired electric generation. The bill would require a significant increase in renewable fuel generators and oil- and gas-fired capacity. In contrast, coal use would increase under Clear Skies or the Carper bill. The Jeffords bill, S. 150, is projected to be the most costly among the three multi-pollutant proposals. It would require a significant increase in renewable fuel generators and oil- and gas-fired capacity, while coal use would increase under Clear Skies or the Carper bill. The net benefits of S. 150 far exceed those of Clear Skies and S. 843, with higher benefits and costs compared to Clear Skies but lower than S. 150. S. 843 aims for substantial emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act, with a phased-in schedule to mitigate short-term price increases. S. 843 aims for substantial emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act with a phased-in schedule to mitigate short-term price increases. EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on various bills, highlighting price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth. These variables were not isolated but examined in selected combinations. The analysis assumes limited short-term price elasticity, construction constraints, and EPA's electricity growth and natural gas supply. The EPA analyzed different scenarios with varying price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth assumptions. These scenarios include the No Construction Constraint Scenario, EPA Base Case Scenario, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. Each scenario has different assumptions regarding short-term constraints and electricity supply curves. The Natural Gas Scenario assumes zero price elasticity and short-term constraints. The No Construction Constraint Scenario removes short-term construction constraints but includes zero demand price elasticity. The impact on costs varies for different bills, with S. 150 seeing a substantial increase due to the removal of price elasticity. The removal of price elasticity in the scenario has a significant impact on the cost of S. 150, with increases of 36% in the short term and 157% in the long term. This results in no demand-side reaction from consumers, leading to substantial compliance costs. The EPA Base Case Scenario confirms the dramatic effect of removing price elasticity on the costs of S. 150, with increases of 63% in 2010 and 147% in 2020 compared to the benchmark analysis. The removal of any short-term price elasticity has a significant impact on the costs of S. 150, with increases of 63% in 2010 and 147% in 2020 compared to the benchmark analysis. This also affects the cost estimates for S. 843, with a cost estimate 86% higher than the benchmark estimate for 2010. Demand response and short-term construction constraint assumptions heavily influence EPA's 2010 cost estimates for S. 843. EPA's assumptions have little effect on S. 843 cost estimates in the long-term or for the Managers' Mark. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario increases costs, especially for S. 150, due to zero demand response, higher electricity growth, and tighter natural gas supply. This scenario removes demand price elasticity and maintains short-term construction constraints, leading to significant cost increases compared to the EPA Base Case assumptions. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario results in higher costs, particularly for S. 150, due to zero demand response and tighter natural gas supply. The impact is more pronounced for S. 150 compared to S. 843 and the Managers' Mark. A more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability is needed to determine appropriate targets for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity significantly affects short and long-term cost estimates for S. 150, especially when higher electricity growth and natural gas assumptions are considered. EPA's assumptions of zero demand price elasticity and short-term construction constraints have a significant impact on cost estimates for S. 150, especially in the short term. However, these effects decrease over the long term, even with higher cost assumptions. The Managers' Mark cost estimates are minimally affected by EPA's assumptions due to their alignment with EPA's model. The Managers' Mark has minimal impact on cost estimates for existing laws and regulations, including provisions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in bills like S. 150 and S. 843. S. 150 sets an emissions cap of 2.05 billion tons annually starting in 2010, while S. 843 sets a cap of 2.655 billion tons in 2009, decreasing to 2.454 billion tons in 2013. S. 843 would set an emissions cap of about 2.655 billion tons in 2009, decreasing to 2.454 billion tons in 2013. The reduction requirement and schedule of S. 150 are more representative of the Kyoto Protocol than S. 843, resulting in lower costs for CO2 allowances. Adjusting S. 150's carbon dioxide reduction costs for 2005 dollars and metric tons shows costs of $19 a metric ton in 2010 and $33 a metric ton in 2020, similar to current EU market prices. The EPA estimates for carbon dioxide allowance prices in 2010 and 2020 are based on assumptions from previous analyses conducted in 2005. The analysis may overstate the cost of emission controls for mercury due to advancements in control technology since 2003. The effectiveness of mercury control technology has advanced rapidly since 2003, leading to lower costs for emission controls. The air pollution control industry states that the cost of activated carbon injection (ACI) controls is now only one-fourth of what it would have been in 2003. EPA's analysis shows benefits outweighing costs for both S. 150 and S. 843, mainly from reducing human health effects like mortality. The EPA's analysis and CRS's reanalysis show benefits outweighing costs for bills S. 150 and S. 843, with the main benefits being reduced mortality from emissions reductions. The analysis does not attempt to monetize environmental benefits, such as the significant impact of sulfur dioxide emissions on acid deposition and its harm to aquatic life, forest growth, and building materials. The analysis does not monetize environmental benefits of sulfur dioxide and mercury controls, which have significant impacts on acid deposition, aquatic life, forest growth, and building materials. Reductions in emissions could have substantial environmental benefits not estimated in the analysis. Additionally, the analysis does not model mercury health effects, which have economic impacts and range from a few million to several billion dollars per year. The analysis did not model mercury health effects, which could have significant economic impacts ranging from a few million to several billion dollars per year. The omission of these benefits would have the greatest effect on bills with more aggressive mercury control schemes. Additionally, the analysis did not estimate the potential benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, which could understate the benefits of certain bills. The Jeffords and Carper bills set more stringent standards than the promulgated rules, with benefits outweighing additional costs. Carbon dioxide costs depend on proposed reductions. The Jeffords and Carper bills set more stringent standards than the promulgated rules, with benefits outweighing additional costs. Carbon dioxide costs depend on the amount and schedule of proposed reductions, while mercury control costs are dependent on the timeliness of data. EPA's benefit analysis is limited and incomplete, favoring alternatives with more stringent standards. EPA's analysis, although a step towards understanding legislative impacts, is not as useful as hoped. The EPA's analysis of alternatives to Clear Skies is criticized for overstating costs and not adequately considering factors like natural gas price volatility. Some argue that the analysis, based on 2003 assumptions, is outdated and may not contribute substantially to congressional debate."
