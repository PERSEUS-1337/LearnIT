    "content": "The report highlights DOD's alternative fuel initiatives, including testing, evaluation, and certification of alternative fuels for service fleets. The Navy plans to promote domestic biofuel production with a $170 million investment. The services have spent $48 million on alternative fuels and continue to invest in testing and demonstrations. The Department of Defense (DOD) has invested $48 million in alternative fuels, with the Navy proposing a $170 million investment in biofuel production capacity. DOD's purchases of petroleum fuels totaled $17.3 billion in FY2011. The report provides an overview of DOD's alternative fuels policy, purchases, testing platforms, and legislative actions related to alternative fuels efforts. The Navy's biofuel production initiative under the Defense Production Act, in collaboration with the Department of Energy and Agriculture, is also discussed. The Navy's biofuel production initiative under the Defense Production Act, in collaboration with the Department of Energy and Agriculture, includes appropriated funding and recent legislative actions related to DOD alternative fuels efforts. Section 314 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act gave responsibility for and oversight of DOD's alternative fuels initiatives and policy to the Assistant Secretary of Defense. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act assigned oversight of DOD's alternative fuels initiatives to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs, streamlining investments and encouraging collaboration with the Department of Energy. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs oversees DOD's alternative fuels initiatives, issuing guidelines to streamline investments and promote collaboration with other federal agencies. The goals of DOD's alternative fuels policy include ensuring military readiness, improving battlespace effectiveness, and increasing fuel source options for operational commanders. Specific considerations for DOD investments in alternative fuels initiatives include resilience against supply disruptions, mitigating petroleum price volatility, and enhancing expeditionary capabilities. DOD investments in alternative fuels initiatives aim to increase resilience against supply disruptions, mitigate petroleum price volatility, and enhance expeditionary capabilities. Alternative fuels must be \"drop-in,\" cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities, with desirable characteristics such as production from non-food crop feedstock and lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. DOD investments in alternative fuel activities must be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget certification process. The DOD invests in alternative fuels to increase resilience, mitigate price volatility, and enhance capabilities. Investments must be certified in the annual energy budget process. Future investments will undergo a rigorous evaluation. Alternative fuels development follows three phases: Certification, Field. DOD alternative fuels development initiatives involve three phases: Certification, Field Demonstration, and Ongoing Purchases. Certification requires a fuels working group to identify promising alternative fuels. Field Demonstration proposals are reviewed by various offices. Ongoing Purchases involve competition between alternative fuels and petroleum products based on meeting requirements at best value. The Army aims to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy sources, with goals including having at least 25% of energy for tactical power generation from alternative sources by 2028. The Air Force aims to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy sources by setting goals for power generation and fuel requirements. They aim to have 25% of energy from alternative sources by 2028 and 50% of fuel for the tactical mobility fleet from alternative fuel blends. Additionally, they aim to acquire 50% of domestic aviation fuel requirements from alternative sources by 2016 and test all aircraft on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012. The Air Force aims to test and certify all aircraft on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012. The Navy has set ambitious goals for alternative fuels, including deploying a \"Great Green Fleet\" by 2016 and meeting 50% of energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. The Navy aims to meet 50% of its energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020, with plans to reduce liquid fuel usage afloat and replace 8 million barrels of petroleum with unblended alternative fuels. DLA Energy has procured 1.9 million gallons of alternative fuels for the military since 2007, with DOD spending $48 million on testing and certifying alternative fuels for service fleets. The Army, Navy, and Air Force have purchased 1.9 million gallons of alternative fuels using $48 million in funds for testing engine performance and certifying fuels. Various types of alternative fuels, including Fischer-Tropsch fuels and biofuels, have been purchased by the services. The Air Force and Navy have purchased various types of alternative fuels, including hydrotreated jet and diesel biofuels, alcohol-to-jet fuels, direct-sugar-to-hydrocarbons fuel, and fuels from the Fischer-Tropsch process. DOD is prohibited from purchasing alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions under Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Department of Defense (DOD) has been testing alternative fuel blends for fleet-wide use, including Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and hydrotreated renewable jet. DOD's purchases of alternative fuels are not subject to EISA section 526 if the fuel source is not specified in the contract. The Army is testing 50:50 blends of Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and hydrotreated renewable jet with JP-8 for fleet-wide use. They aim to certify these fuels by 2014 and are working on Air Force certification for H-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The Army plans to complete testing of tactical ground equipment systems for alternative fuels by the end of FY2014. The Air Force has already certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel. The Army and Air Force are testing alternative fuels for their aviation systems. The Air Force has certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel blends and is testing biofuels and alcohol-to-jet fuels. The Navy has also tested biofuel blends for its aircraft. The Navy has tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for use in all manned and unmanned aircraft, with certification anticipated in early 2013. Testing of Fischer-Tropsch fuels is expected to be completed by the end of 2013. Other alternative fuels like alcohol-to-jet and pyrolysis oils will continue to be tested. In June 2011, the Departments of the Navy, Energy, and Agriculture signed a Memorandum of Understanding to support the development of a sustainable biofuels industry. The Navy, Energy, and Agriculture signed a Memorandum of Understanding in June 2011 to support the development of a sustainable commercial biofuels industry. The MOU aims to assist in the production of advanced drop-in biofuels that meet military specifications, are price competitive with petroleum, and have no significant impact on the food supply. The Navy, Energy, and Agriculture plan to fund the development of sustainable biofuels meeting military specs, price competitive with petroleum, and not impacting food supply. $510 million in government funding over three years, with $340 million from the Navy and Department of Energy, and $171 million from the Department of Agriculture. Total cost-sharing from industry is expected. The Navy, Energy, and Agriculture plan to fund sustainable biofuels development with $510 million in government funding over three years. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA-12-15-PKM) for this biofuels production initiative under this MOU was initially released on June 27, 2012, with an announced government funding amount of $210 million. Awards for biofuels production facilities are planned to occur in two phases: Phase 1: approximately five awards of up to $6 million each for planning and preliminary designs for biofuel production facilities. Phase 2: up to three awards of up to $70 million each for construction, commissioning, and performance testing of biofuel production facilities. Phase 2 of the biofuels production initiative involves up to three awards of $70 million each for constructing, commissioning, and testing biofuel production facilities. Successful proposals must have a 50% cost share, use domestic feedstocks, comply with regulations, use renewable feedstock, produce drop-in fuel, be cost-competitive with petroleum-based fuels, and have a production capacity of at least 10 million gallons per year. The funding level includes $100 million from DOD and $70 million for the Navy's drop-in fuel program. The FOA funding level of $210 million for Phase 2 of the biofuels production initiative includes $100 million from DOD, $70 million for the Navy's drop-in biofuels production, and $40 million from DOE. It does not include $171 million of USDA funding for bio-based jet fuel production. The USDA provided $171 million in funding through the Commodity Credit Corporation to subsidize bio-based jet fuel production. The Corporation can borrow up to $30 billion to increase the use of agricultural commodities without specific congressional appropriations. Legislative activity in 2012 focused on DOD's alternative fuels efforts and appropriations for the Navy's biofuel production under the DPA. H.R. 4310 and S. 3254 had provisions regarding DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels. H.R. 4310 exempted DOD from Section 526 of EISA and limited its ability to purchase more expensive alternative fuels. S. 3254 did not contain any restrictions on DOD's alternative fuel purchases. Amendments added during the Senate Armed Services Committee markup included restrictive provisions on alternative fuel purchases. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act did not contain provisions restricting DOD's purchase of alternative fuels. Amendments adding restrictive provisions were removed during floor debate. Amounts for biofuels production require matching contributions from DOE and USDA for a biofuel refinery construction. The Department of Defense is waiting for matching contributions from the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture to build a biofuel refinery. The Navy and Department of Energy have requested $70 million and $40 million in appropriations for a joint biofuels production initiative in FY2013. The Navy also requested $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuels production. The Navy requested $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuels production in FY2013, part of the $89 million total requested appropriations to the Defense Production Act Fund. The House Appropriations Committee report on FY2013 Department of Defense Appropriations Act declined to fund the $70 million requested for the joint biofuel production initiative. H.R. 5856 contains $63.5 million in DPA funding, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommends funding the DPA Fund at $100 million over the budget submission. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6) increased the Defense Production Act Fund by $134.3 million to $223,531,000. However, funding for advanced drop-in biofuels production was reduced by $10 million to $60 million. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for research on reducing emissions from coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6) increased the Defense Production Act Fund by $134.3 million to $223,531,000. However, funding for advanced drop-in biofuels production was reduced by $10 million to $60 million. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for research on reducing emissions from coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development. The conferees provided $20 million for research to improve emissions of coal to liquid fuel, aiming to make it a competitive alternative energy resource. The Department of Energy requested to transfer $40 million from its Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy appropriations into the Defense Production Act Fund for FY2013. The House-passed version of the FY2013 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act does not include this transfer authorization, while the Senate version allows up to $100 million transfer. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to inform congressional defense committees prior to any fund obligation. The House-passed H.R. 5325 does not authorize the Department of Energy to transfer funds into the Defense Production Act Fund, while the Senate's S. 2465 allows up to $100 million transfer. The Department of Energy's funding in H.R. 933 was appropriated under a continuing resolution, with Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funded at approximately $1.8 billion. The DOD and services' alternative fuels initiatives raise oversight questions for Congress regarding benefits over conventional petroleum fuels, funding investment, coordination efforts, and impact on the biofuel industry. The Navy's $510 million investment in domestic advanced biofuels is supported by analysis from the Navy, DOE, and USDA. Questions arise about whether biofuel investment should be left to private industry or government agencies like the DOE or USDA. The DOD's efforts to jumpstart the biofuels industry are led by the Navy, raising concerns about coordination and oversight by the ASD(OEPP). ASD(OEPP) oversees military services' investments in alternative fuels testing and certification. Coordination activities and guidance may impact military services' fuel goals. Potential overlap with other federal agencies' initiatives. Lack of clarity on coordination process for alternative fuel and energy initiatives across federal agencies. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act included $150 million for DPA Title III funding, supporting DOD biofuels initiatives and encouraging longer contract terms for biofuels procurement. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act included $150 million for DPA Title III funding to support DOD biofuels initiatives. Reports from the Senate and House Appropriations Committees encouraged longer contract terms for biofuels procurement, suggesting multi-year contracts with purchase periods up to 15 years to maximize efficiencies of scale for the best purchase price. The House Appropriations Committee report emphasized the importance of long-term contracts for biofuels procurement by the Department of Defense to maximize efficiencies and purchase price. The Department of Energy requested authority to transfer funds to support a Memorandum of Understanding with the technical. The Department of Energy requested funds to transfer to the DPA Fund for pilot-scale demonstration projects. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund this initiative for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the Department of Energy's portion of the joint initiative for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D, citing lack of justification for funding a Defense initiative and uncertainty about lowering production costs. The Department of Energy has not adequately justified funding for a Defense initiative to develop commercial diesel and jet biofuels production capacity. The recommendation includes no funding for the proposed initiative and does not include the requested legislative language. In FY2013, the Senate Appropriations Committee Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act provides for potential funding transfer to the Defense Production Act Fund for Department of Energy activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee provides for potential funding transfer to the Defense Production Act Fund for Department of Energy activities, supporting collaboration between the Navy, Department of Agriculture, and DOE for biofuel production initiatives. The Committee supports collaboration between the Navy, Department of Agriculture, and DOE to develop innovative technologies for military jet and diesel fuels. The Department of Defense's early adoption of alternative fuels is expected to influence the wider marketplace. Provisions in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act exempt the Department of Defense from alternative fuel procurement requirements and impose limitations on funds for alternative fuel procurement. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to exclude the Department of Defense from its provisions. Section 314 limits funds for the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013, prohibiting the use of funds for alternative fuels if they are more expensive than traditional fossil fuels, with an exception for fleet certification. The Secretary of Defense may purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for fleet certification. S. 3254 does not restrict the Department of Defense's procurement or production of biofuels. Amendments affecting biofuel procurement were removed from the Senate-passed version of S. 3254. The Senate passed amendments that removed provisions limiting the Department of Defense's ability to purchase alternative fuels with higher costs than traditional fossil fuels. Senator Mark Udall sponsored one amendment, while Senator Hagan sponsored another, both of which were supported by multiple co-sponsors. The Senate passed amendments removing restrictions on the Department of Defense's purchase of biofuels infrastructure. Sponsored by Senators Johnson, Murray, Shaheen, Collins, Schumer, Stabenow, Whitehouse, Coons, Udall, and Tester, the amendments struck Section 2823 from S. 3254, which had been proposed by Senators Inhofe and McCain. Another amendment by Senator Inhofe failed to exempt the Department of Defense from Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The amendment sponsored by Senator Inhofe, which aimed to exempt the Department of Defense from purchasing alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions, failed in the Senate Armed Services Committee on a tie vote of 13-13. This was similar to a section in H.R. 4310 passed by the House but was struck down in the version of S. 3254 reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee. SEC. 313 of the Act limits funds for the Department of Defense to purchase alternative fuels if their cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuels, except for limited quantities needed for certification purposes. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from constructing biofuel refineries without specific authorization by law. Competitive procedures are used to purchase alternative fuels for engine certification, ensuring the best price. The committee recommends a provision to limit funds for procurement of alternative fuel if the cost exceeds traditional fossil fuels, except for testing purposes. The Department of Defense made a significant biofuel purchase in 2011 to demonstrate the capability of using alternative fuels. The Department of the Navy made the single largest purchase of biofuel in government history at $26.66 a gallon to demonstrate the Carrier Strike Group's ability to burn alternative fuels. Despite using operation and maintenance funds, the purchase is considered a research initiative. The Vice Chief of Naval Operations highlighted the impact of fuel price increases on readiness accounts, with every $1 increase per barrel resulting in $31M of additional costs annually. The committee supports DoD initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies but is concerned about using operation and maintenance funds for high biofuel costs in RDTE efforts. They direct the Secretary of Defense to provide guidance on using alternative fuels for operations versus RDTE. The committee supports DoD initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies but is concerned about high biofuel costs in RDTE efforts. The Secretary of Defense is directed to develop guidance on the operational use of alternative fuels versus continued RDTE initiatives. H.R. 4310 / P.L. 113-6 Section 315 limits the obligation of Department of Defense funds for biofuel refinery construction until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. For fiscal year 2013, funds for biofuels production cannot be used for building a biofuel refinery until matching contributions are received from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuel production in domestic plants. The Committee recommends no funding for the construction or retrofit of advanced drop-in biofuel plants in fiscal year 2013, urging the Secretary of Defense to request funding in future years when it can be executed in a timely manner. The Senate Appropriations Committee provides an additional $100 million for this effort in their report. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends an additional $100 million for the Defense Production Act (DPA) fund in FY2013, stating that the funding increase is crucial for strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base. The Committee directs that the extra funds be competitively awarded to new initiatives, with priority given to completing DPA projects from previous years. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends an additional $100 million for the Defense Production Act (DPA) fund in FY2013, with priority given to completing DPA projects from previous years. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933/P.L. 113-6) appropriates $223,531,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund, an increase of about $134.3 million over the amount requested. However, funding for production of advanced drop-in biofuels was reduced by $10 million. The House and Senate reduced funding for advanced drop-in biofuels by $10 million in H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6, allocating $60 million for production. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for research on reducing emissions from coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development. The conferees did not include a provision from the House on the Energy Independence and Security Act but provided $20 million for research to improve coal to liquid fuel emissions. The conferees allocated $20 million in Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Air Force for research to improve emissions of coal to liquid fuel as an alternative energy resource. The Secretary of the Air Force must inform congressional defense committees prior to any expenditure of these funds. Under the H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6, the Department of Energy received funding through a continuing resolution, with approximately $1.8 billion allocated to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy."
