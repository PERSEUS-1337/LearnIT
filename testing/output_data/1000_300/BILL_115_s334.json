    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges the effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during oil and gas activities, as highlighted in reports by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Environmental Protection Agency. The effectiveness of state regulations in protecting water resources during oil and gas activities is highlighted in various reports, including a 2004 study by the Environmental Protection Agency and a 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council. These reports found no evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, a resolution by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission in January 2009 emphasized the role of states in regulating these activities. Hydraulic fracturing in deep and shallow formations poses a risk to groundwater. State regulations aim to ensure safe operations and protect drinking water, with no confirmed cases of contamination linked to fracking. Testimonies from EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson and Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey support the safety of the fracking process. The EPA Administrator and Bureau of Land Management Director testified that there is no proven case of water contamination from the fracking process. Federal regulations already cover activities related to hydraulic fracturing, including surface discharges, wastewater disposal, and air emissions. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing. The Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin's 2012 study found no evidence of hydraulic fracturing chemicals in aquifers. The Ground Water Protection Council and State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange's 2014 report highlighted improved state regulations for groundwater protection in oil and gas production. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF FEDERAL LAND. The term \"Federal land\" includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. SEC. 4. STATE AUTHORITY. State authority is granted to regulate the treatment of wells using fluids under pressure with propping agents to enhance oil, gas, or geothermal production on state land. Federal land follows the laws of the state where it is located for the same well treatment activities."
