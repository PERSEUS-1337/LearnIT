    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. Evaluating compositionality in these representations is important, but the machine learning literature lacks tools for this. A procedure is described for measuring compositionality by approximating the true representation-producing model with a model that composes inferred representational primitives. This approach provides formal and empirical characterizations of compositional structure in various settings. The procedure described measures compositionality by approximating the true representation-producing model with a model that composes inferred representational primitives. It explores the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The success of representation learning techniques has sparked interest in understanding the structure of learned representations, particularly compositionality. While many approaches use human-designed compositional analyses, it is important to explore how compositionality arises in learning problems without built-in structure. For example, a character-based encoding scheme learned for a communication task illustrates this concept. The need for a standard, formal, automatable, and quantitative technique for analyzing compositional structure in learning problems arises, as existing solutions rely on manual or subjective analysis, making comparisons and systematic application difficult. The present work aims to address the need for a standardized and quantitative technique to evaluate compositional structure in learned representations. The focus is on an oracle setting where the structure of model inputs is known, and the goal is to determine if this structure is reflected in model outputs. The paper introduces a formal framework for measuring how well representations align with the oracle compositional analysis, proposing an evaluation metric called TRE. The paper introduces a formal framework called TRE to measure compositionality in representations. It aims to find a model that reflects the true compositional structure of inputs by optimizing over primitive meaning representations. The paper introduces a formal framework called TRE to measure compositionality in representations. It aims to find a model that reflects the true compositional structure of inputs by optimizing over primitive meaning representations. The paper discusses how to search for attribute vectors and value vectors that sum together to produce observed object representations, as well as the relationship between compositionality and learning in various applications. The paper discusses the compositionality of representations and its relation to human judgments, distances between representations, and generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. It also explores the debate between distributed and non-symbolic representations in modeling compositional phenomena. The discussion revolves around the connectionist-classicist debates on compositional representation learning, focusing on the emergence of compositionality in models without explicit composition operations. Various approaches have been proposed, with the main question being how and when compositionality arises in these models. Existing proposals mainly come from linguistics and philosophy, offering evaluations of compositionality targeted at formal and natural languages. Techniques from this literature are specialized in linguistic representations, particularly the algebraic structure of grammars. Machine learning research has responded to the absence of procedures for answering questions about compositionality in general cases. One class of evaluations derives judgments from manual analyses of representation spaces, providing insight but being time-consuming and non-reproducible. Another class exploits task-specific structure. Our work aims to provide a standard and scalable alternative to model-and task-specific evaluations of compositionality. Instead of measuring compositionality directly, some authors base their analysis on related phenomena, such as correlation between representation similarity and oracle compositional analyses, and generalization to structurally novel inputs. Our approach examines the circumstances under which these surrogate measures track stricter notions of compositionality. Our approach aims to provide a scalable alternative to model-specific evaluations of compositionality in natural language processing. It focuses on the correlation between representation similarity and oracle compositional analyses, as well as generalization to structurally novel inputs. This approach is complementary to existing work on compositional representation learning in NLP. The approach presented focuses on compositional representation learning in NLP, agnostic to specific composition functions. It demonstrates the ability to adapt existing NLP techniques for compositional representation learning to different models, even in non-linguistic settings. The communication task involves a speaker model sending a message to a listener model for downstream tasks. The speaker model observes a target object and sends a message to a listener model for downstream tasks. The representations produced by the speaker model serve as input object representations, and an automated procedure is proposed to determine if these representations are compositional. The section proposes an automated procedure for analyzing the compositional structure of input representations in a dataset. It assumes prior knowledge of the compositional structure of inputs and aims to determine if the representations computed are compositional based on the structure of the inputs.

It assumes prior knowledge of the compositional structure of inputs and aims to determine if the representations computed are compositional based on the structure of the inputs. The representations computed by f are compositional if each f(x) is determined by the structure of D(x). Discussions of compositionality define a composition operation in the space of representations, making the model f compositional if it is a homomorphism from inputs to representations. The curr_chunk discusses the process of learning grammars and lexicons from data for semantic parsing in language understanding tasks. It highlights the challenges in identifying lexicon entries without a clearly-defined syntax. The section proposes an automated procedure for analyzing the compositional structure of input representations in a dataset, aiming to determine if the computed representations are compositional based on the input structure. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of identifying lexicon entries and composing representations without a clearly-defined syntax. It questions how to handle languages with irregular structures and emphasizes the importance of assigning representations to primitives for compositional speaker models. The speaker model is compositional as long as there is an assignment of representations to primitives that reproduces the speaker's prediction. Predictions can be reproduced approximately, indicating the compositionality of the true predictor. The evaluation procedure involves measuring compositionality by searching for representations that allow a compositional model to approximate the true predictor closely. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) is used as an evaluation metric to capture the intuition behind the compositionality of the model. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) is an evaluation metric used to measure how well a compositional model approximates the true predictor. It involves optimizing over parts to construct representations, with the choice of composition function left to the evaluator. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) evaluates how well a compositional model approximates the true predictor by optimizing over parts to construct representations. The choice of composition function is crucial to avoid trivial solutions, with some pre-commitment to a restricted composition function being inevitable. The Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) evaluates compositional models by optimizing over parts to construct representations. Pre-commitment to a restricted composition function is crucial to avoid trivial solutions. Experiments feature fixed and learned parametric forms. Implementation details include differentiability for continuous parameters and the use of gradient descent for optimization. An SGD-based TRE solver is provided in the accompanying software release. The paper discusses the use of Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) to evaluate compositional models and provides an implementation of an SGD-based TRE solver. It also explores the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, focusing on the information bottleneck theory of representation learning. The paper explores the compression phase in deep models, which involves finding a compositional representation of the input distribution by isolating decision-relevant attributes and discarding irrelevant information. It investigates this hypothesis through a meta-learning framework for predicting classifiers. The model is trained to minimize logistic loss between logits and ground-truth labels. Visual concepts used are single attributes or conjunctions of attributes like background color, digit color, digit identity, and stroke type. The composition function is addition and the distance is measured using cosine similarity. The training dataset consists of 9000 image triplets with a validation set of 500 examples, achieving a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average. The training dataset consists of 9000 image triplets, evenly balanced between positive and negative classes, with a validation set of 500 examples. The model achieves a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average over ten training runs. The relationship between the information bottleneck and compositionality is explored by comparing TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) between representations and inputs during training. FIG2 illustrates this relationship. The relationship between TRE(X) and mutual information I(\u03b8; X) is explored during training. Both values initially low, increase, and then decrease together after mutual information peaks. This pattern suggests that compression in the information bottleneck framework leads to the discovery of compositional representations. The results suggest that compression in the information bottleneck framework leads to the discovery of compositional representations. The focus is on exploring the compositional nature of individual phrase representations in high-dimensional embeddings of words and phrases for natural language processing applications. The hypothesis is that bigrams with low reconstruction error have essentially compositional meanings, while those with high error correspond to non-compositional multi-word expressions. In natural language processing, the analysis focuses on discovering compositional representations of words and bigrams using the information bottleneck framework. The goal is to validate this approach and show how it fits into the existing work on compositionality. Word and bigram embeddings are trained using the CBOW objective with 100-dimensional vectors, and the Gigaword dataset is used for estimation. The paper proposes a framework for training word and bigram embeddings using the CBOW objective with 100-dimensional vectors. The composition function involves vector addition and cosine distance. Bigram-level compositionality judgments are compared with human judgments on noun-noun compounds. The paper explores bigram-level compositionality judgments using cosine distance. Human judgments on noun-noun compounds are compared, showing an anticorrelation between TRE and human ratings. High compositional bigrams include application form and research project, while low compositional ones include fine line and lip service. The next section discusses the relationship between TRE and topographic similarity in representations, aiming to provide a formal characterization. BID7 introduces the concept of topographic similarity, suggesting that a learned representation captures domain structure if distances between representations are correlated with distances between their derivations. This weakly supports compositionality, as edit distance is expected to correlate with derivational similarity. The section clarifies the connection between the two evaluations. The section aims to clarify the relationship between edit distance and derivational similarity in representations. It introduces a tree edit distance function to measure the distance between derivations. Proposition 1 states that the tree edit distance is an approximate upper bound on any distance metric satisfying certain properties. The section discusses the relationship between edit distance and derivational similarity in representations. It introduces a tree edit distance function to measure the distance between derivations, which is an approximate upper bound on any distance metric satisfying certain properties. The text emphasizes that small tree edit distance is not enough for topographic similarity, but it does show that compositionality imposes constraints on similarity judgments between representations. The text discusses the relationship between compositionality and generalization in communication games. It evaluates the claim that agents need compositional communication protocols to generalize to unseen referents by training agents from random initial conditions and measuring the compositional structure of the language that emerges. The experiment focuses on a reference game BID20 where two policies, a speaker and a listener, are trained to communicate about target objects using discrete codes. The listener reconstructs the targets based on the speaker's message, with rewards given for correct predictions. The experiment involves training a speaker and listener to communicate about target objects using discrete codes. The listener reconstructs the targets based on the speaker's message, with rewards given for correct predictions. The communication protocol is discrete, and policies are jointly trained using a policy gradient objective. The speaker and listener are implemented with RNNs, and the target referents consist of two objects with two attributes each. A subset of object pairs is held out at training time to evaluate generalization. The experiment involves training a speaker and listener to communicate about target objects using discrete codes. A subset of object pairs is held out at training time to evaluate generalization. Representations are fixed-length discrete codes with a more complicated semantics. Agent messages are represented as one-hot vectors, with a composition function involving free parameters. The composition function involves free parameters that redistribute tokens in the input string. Compositional languages show lower absolute performance, even in successful training runs. Two multiagent training runs result in different languages. The composition function involves redistributing tokens in the input string. Two multiagent training runs result in languages with different TRE but similar listener performance. Training 100 speaker-listener pairs with random initial parameters shows a nuanced relationship between compositionality and performance. Results from training 100 speaker-listener pairs show a nuanced relationship between compositionality and generalization. The Total Reward Error (TRE) is correlated with generalization error and model reward, indicating that \"compositional\" languages often result from poor communication strategies. Low TRE is associated with trivial strategies that lead to poor overall performance.
