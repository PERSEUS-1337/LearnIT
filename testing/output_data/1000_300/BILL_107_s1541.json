    "content": "The title of the act is the \"Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2001\". This act pertains to federal-state agreements. Any State may enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Labor to provide temporary emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular compensation. The agreement can be terminated with a 30-day notice to the Secretary. Individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under a State law are not entitled to any further compensation under State or Federal laws, including extended compensation. They must also not be receiving compensation under the unemployment compensation law of Canada. Exhaustion of benefits occurs when all regular compensation available based on employment or wages during the base period has been received. No further payments can be made if an individual has received all available regular compensation during their base period or if their rights to compensation have expired. The weekly benefit amount for emergency unemployment compensation is equal to the regular compensation payable under the State law for a week of total unemployment. The weekly benefit amount for emergency unemployment compensation is equal to the regular compensation payable under the State law for a week of total unemployment. State law terms and conditions apply to claims for temporary emergency unemployment compensation, with a maximum amount payable to individuals with established accounts. The maximum amount of temporary emergency unemployment compensation payable to individuals with established accounts shall not exceed the amount in the account. States can elect to trigger off an extended compensation period for those who have exhausted regular compensation rights. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACCOUNT. Any agreement under this title shall establish a temporary emergency unemployment compensation account for eligible individuals, with the amount in the account equal to 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. The account may be reduced by any extended compensation received under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. The individual's weekly benefit amount is determined by the regular compensation under the State law for total unemployment in a benefit year. SEC. 4. PAYMENTS TO STATES WITH AGREEMENTS FOR TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. Payments to states with agreements for temporary emergency unemployment compensation shall be equal to 100 percent of the compensation paid to individuals under the agreement. States will not receive payment if entitled to reimbursement under other federal laws. Sums payable to states with agreements will be determined accordingly. Sums payable to states with agreements under this title will be determined by the Secretary in advance or by reimbursement. The estimates will be based on the Secretary's calculations for each calendar month, adjusted for any discrepancies from prior months. The method of estimation will be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency. SEC. 5. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Funds from the extended unemployment compensation account in the Unemployment Trust Fund are used to make payments to States with agreements under this title. The Secretary certifies payments to States, and the Treasury makes payments to States accordingly. Appropriations are made to provide assistance to States. Transfers are made from the extended unemployment compensation account to the State's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Funds are appropriated to assist States in meeting administration costs under this title. Appropriations are made from the general fund of the Treasury to the extended unemployment compensation account for necessary payments. The Secretary estimates necessary payments under this section for compensation payable under chapter 85 of title 5, United States Code, and compensation based on services under section 3309(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Appropriated amounts do not need to be repaid. SEC. 6. FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS. Individuals who knowingly make false statements or fail to disclose material facts to receive unauthorized temporary emergency unemployment compensation will be ineligible for further benefits and may face prosecution under section 1001 of title 18, United States Code. Repayment is required for individuals who have received such benefits. Individuals who fraudulently claim unauthorized temporary emergency unemployment compensation may face prosecution under section 1001 of title 18, United States Code. Repayment of such benefits is required unless the State agency determines it was not the individual's fault and repayment would be unfair. The State agency has the authority to recover the amount owed. The State agency may recover fraudulent temporary emergency unemployment compensation by deducting from future payments within a 3-year period if repayment is deemed fair and equitable. The State agency can recover fraudulent temporary emergency unemployment compensation by deducting from future payments within a 3-year period, with a maximum deduction of 50 percent of the weekly benefit amount. Repayment cannot be required until a fair hearing has been provided, and any determination can be reviewed in the same manner as under the State unemployment compensation law. Any determination by a State agency under this section shall be subject to review in the same manner and to the same extent as determinations under the State unemployment compensation law. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. This title defines key terms related to compensation and unemployment. SEC. 8. APPLICABILITY. Agreements under this Act apply to specific weeks of unemployment. SEC. 9.
