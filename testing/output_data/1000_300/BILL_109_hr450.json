The Congress finds that the United States must maintain its position in science and technology to advance human understanding and improve lives. Over half of the US economic growth is attributed to research and development in science and technology. The United States must maintain its position in science and technology to advance human understanding and improve lives. Fundamental research explores the universe and seeks answers to new questions. Applied research applies these answers to real-world problems, promoting economic growth and innovation. Education is crucial for developing intellectual capital. The United States' economic growth relies on intellectual capital and innovation, which is closely tied to education. The country needs scientists, engineers, technologically proficient workers, and scientifically literate individuals to drive research, development, and decision-making. Student performance on recent international math and science assessments highlights the shortcomings of K-12 education in the United States. New teaching methods, curricula, teacher training, and parental involvement are needed to improve science and math education. Science is a process of inquiry, not just a collection of facts and theories. Science education should focus on inquiry, observation, and data to explain the universe through concepts and theories. Students should learn by doing science, with education being object-oriented, experiment-centered, and concept-based. Early and continuous science education is essential to nurture children's natural curiosity. Teachers play a crucial role in connecting students to the scientific process. To effectively tap into innate qualities, science education should start early and continue throughout school. Teachers are vital in connecting students to the content they learn. High-quality teachers should be recruited with a respected, rewarding career path and opportunities for growth. Incentives for teachers to stay in the classroom and improve their practice are crucial, along with ongoing training in content knowledge, curriculum, research, and teaching techniques. Teachers must be knowledgeable in their content area, curriculum, up-to-date research in teaching and learning, and techniques to connect with students in the classroom for superior results. Refundable credit for undergraduate education of certain teachers is provided under section 36 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A 10% tax credit is allowed for eligible teachers for qualified undergraduate tuition paid, with a maximum credit of $1,000 per year. For teachers in high-needs school districts, the credit can be up to $1,500 for the first 5 years. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows a tax credit of $1,500 for eligible teachers in high-needs school districts for the first 5 years. No credit is allowed after the 10th year. Eligible teachers are full-time teachers in grades K-12 who primarily teach math or science. The tax credit is available for substitute teachers in grades K-12 who teach math, science, engineering, or technology courses. Teachers must have a degree in one of these subjects and be highly qualified. The tax credit is available for substitute teachers in grades K-12 who teach math, science, engineering, or technology courses. Teachers must have a baccalaureate degree in one of these subjects and be highly qualified. School administrative functions can be considered teaching courses if they relate to these subjects or are for a school focusing on them. Qualified undergraduate tuition refers to higher education expenses for enrollment at an institution of higher education. The term 'qualified undergraduate tuition' refers to higher education expenses for enrollment at an institution of higher education as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this section. Conforming amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code. Conforming amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code by inserting \"or 36\" after \"section 35\" and amending the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment date. Only eligible teachers after this date are considered for tax benefits. New credits are introduced for contributions benefiting STEM education at the elementary and secondary school level. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new section on contributions benefiting STEM education at the elementary and secondary school level. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows for a STEM contributions credit equal to 100% of qualified STEM contributions made by taxpayers, including STEM school contributions, STEM teacher externship expenses, and STEM teacher training expenses. Qualified STEM contributions encompass STEM property and service contributions. The term 'STEM school contributions' includes STEM property and service contributions. STEM property contributions refer to deductible amounts for charitable donations of STEM inventory property to eligible schools for educational purposes in grades K-12. The curr_chunk discusses the conditions for deducting charitable donations of property to educational institutions in the United States, emphasizing that the property must be used for educational purposes and fit into the donee's education plan. The amount of deduction is determined under section 170. The curr_chunk explains that STEM service contributions refer to payments for STEM services benefiting students at specific schools. Taxpayers must be engaged in providing these services commercially for the deduction to apply. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of STEM inventory property and STEM services for contributions benefiting students at schools. Taxpayers must provide these services commercially without charging for them. The curr_chunk defines STEM services as services needed by schools to provide education in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics for grades K-12. It also explains the Defense Dependents' Education System. The curr_chunk defines the Defense Dependents' Education System as the program established under the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978. It also defines STEM teacher externship expenses as amounts paid for a STEM externship program involving eligible STEM teachers. The curr_chunk defines a STEM externship program as a program for eligible STEM teachers to enhance their teaching skills in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Eligible STEM teachers are K-12 teachers at educational organizations in the US or on US military bases. The curr_chunk defines STEM teacher training expenses as amounts paid by a taxpayer in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics for eligible STEM teachers' participation in training programs. Eligible teachers are K-12 educators in the US or on US military bases. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility for a STEM contributions credit for taxpayers who engage in a trade or business related to science, technology, engineering, or mathematics and provide training programs for eligible STEM teachers. The denial of a double benefit is also mentioned. This is in line with the definition of STEM teacher training expenses for K-12 educators in the US or on US military bases. The curr_chunk amends the tax code to include a STEM contributions credit for eligible taxpayers engaged in STEM-related businesses. This credit is for training programs for STEM teachers and aims to prevent double benefits. The amendments in this section introduce a tax credit for STEM contributions benefiting elementary and secondary school education. The effective date for these changes is after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, the Act ensures continued local control over educational institutions and school systems, prohibiting any federal direction or supervision over curriculum, instruction, administration, or personnel."
