    "content": "The United States has historically been a major provider of food aid globally, but funding for agricultural development has decreased over the years. Critics argue that this has reduced the country's capacity to provide assistance. In response to global hunger reaching a historic high in 2009, President Obama made it a top priority of his Administration and pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a new global hunger and food security initiative. In response to the global hunger crisis of 2007-2008 and the ongoing economic recession, the Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a new global hunger and food security initiative called Feed the Future. The initiative aims to promote agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations like women and children. This is seen as a critical moment in U.S. foreign assistance history, with calls for reform of American food aid and foreign assistance. Some argue for reform of American food aid and foreign assistance to address global food security issues. A new U.S. global food security initiative should involve innovative approaches with local buy-in and private sector engagement. Interagency reviews of development policies and programs will inform Congress's funding and oversight decisions. The 112th Congress will discuss and fund the U.S. global food security initiative, involving various U.S. agencies and international organizations. Legislation may be considered to support agricultural development assistance and research. Congress plays a key role in oversight and funding through the annual appropriations process. The 112th Congress will discuss and fund the U.S. global food security initiative, including support for agricultural development assistance and research. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress may also impact U.S. foreign assistance funding. The primary objectives of this report are to provide context on food insecurity, overview the Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative, and discuss issues related to global hunger. The report highlights the global food insecurity crisis, with over 1 billion people undernourished in 2009. The number of chronically hungry individuals is estimated to be 925 million in 2010, down from 1.023 billion in 2009. The Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative and potential issues for the 112th Congress regarding agricultural development and food security are also discussed. The proportion of hungry people in the world increased in 2008 and 2009 due to global food and economic crises. The estimate for the number of chronically hungry individuals in 2010 is 925 million, a decrease from 1.023 billion in 2009. The number of undernourished people had been slowly increasing for the past decade before the recent crises. The decline in hunger reduction in the 1980s and early 1990s was attributed to increased investment in agriculture, but this progress was reversed between 1995-2006 due to decreased official development assistance for agriculture. Between 1995-1997 and 2004-2006, official development assistance for agriculture declined, leading to an increase in the number of hungry people in all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean. The U.N. Secretary General's Millennium Development Goals report shows that recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in undernourishment. The proportion of hungry people in the world dropped from 20% in the early 1990s to 16% in the mid-2000s but rose by a percentage point in 2008. Progress in meeting the MDGs of reducing hunger, alleviating poverty, and improving health has been hindered. The proportion of hungry people in the world dropped from 20% in the early 1990s to about 16% in the mid-2000s, but rose by a percentage point in 2008. The U.N. Secretary General suggests that progress in meeting the MDGs of reducing hunger, alleviating poverty, and improving health for the world's poor has slowed or even reversed. FAO's 2010 hunger report estimated that 578 million people suffer from chronic undernourishment in Asia and the Pacific, 239 million in sub-Saharan Africa, 53 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 37 million in the Near East and North Africa, and 19 million in developed countries. Globally, the 2010 hunger figure marked a decline of 9.6% from the 2009 level, with the reduction mostly concentrated in Asia. The 2010 hunger figure globally declined by 9.6% from 2009, with Asia seeing the most significant reduction. Sub-Saharan Africa had a smaller drop, with the region still having the highest rates of food insecurity. The 2010 Global Health Index showed improvement worldwide, with varying progress by region and country. The 2010 Global Health Index (GHI) scores decreased in various regions, with significant progress in Southeast Asia and Latin America. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa still have the highest GHI scores, but South Asia has made more progress since 1990. The causes of hunger differ between the regions, with South Asia affected by low nutritional, educational, and social status of women, while sub-Saharan Africa faces challenges related to governance. According to a think tank, the causes of hunger in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa differ. In South Asia, low nutritional, educational, and social status of women contribute to underweight children, while in sub-Saharan Africa, factors include low government effectiveness, conflict, political instability, and high rates of HIV/AIDS. Most countries with high GHI scores are in these regions, with slow progress in reducing the GHI compared to Latin America. Only a few countries have reduced their scores significantly over the past decades. Not many countries in Latin America were able to reduce their Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores by 50% or more over the past decades. About one-third made modest progress, while another third decreased their scores by less than 25%. In sub-Saharan Africa, all nine countries saw an increase in GHI, with causes including conflict, political instability, HIV/AIDS, and inequality. Countries like The Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, and Zimbabwe experienced significant challenges in food security despite higher national incomes. AIDS and high inequality have worsened food security despite higher national incomes. In The Gambia, undernourishment increased due to lower social protection spending. Zimbabwe, once a breadbasket, now faces economic collapse leading to more underweight children and child mortality. Some countries like Angola, Ethiopia, and Ghana have made significant progress in improving their Global Hunger Index scores. President Obama made global hunger a top priority during his administration. President Obama prioritized alleviating global hunger during his administration, pledging $3.5 billion over three years for agricultural development and food security at the G8 Summit in Italy. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion to combat hunger and poverty, emphasizing principles like supporting comprehensive strategies and donor coordination. The G8 summit pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a food security initiative, focusing on sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth. The initiative aims to support country-owned plans, improve donor coordination, leverage multilateral institutions, and provide emergency food aid. Leaders committed to sustainable funding to enhance global food production. The G8 leaders pledged sustainable funding to enhance global food production and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The initiative aims to support country-owned plans and improve donor coordination through country-led strategies and implementation plans. The AAA was agreed upon by developing and donor countries, focusing on country-led strategies and implementation plans for agricultural development. In sub-Saharan Africa, the G8 endorsed the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) to target resources to country priorities, aiming to improve food security and increase incomes for smallholder farmers. Established in 2003, CAADP is part of the African Union's efforts to enhance agriculture. The CAADP program, established in 2003 as part of the African Union's efforts, aims to improve food security, nutrition, and increase incomes of smallholder farmers by raising agricultural productivity and increasing public investment in agriculture. The program is aligned with the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) to address immediate and long-term global food and nutrition security challenges. The Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) proposed immediate actions to address the global food price challenge, including enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade policies, and managing the macroeconomic situation. For longer-term food security, the CFA called for expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led food availability growth, improving international food market accessibility, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit in 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and called for the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund. The G20 Summit in 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and called for the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund to finance investments in agricultural productivity and market access in low-income countries. Countries like Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland pledged $2 billion to support the Global Partnership, bringing the total commitment to $22 billion. The United States also collaborated with private sector actors to coordinate food security efforts. In November 2009, FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome with 60 heads of state and government. In November 2009, FAO organized a World Summit on Food Security in Rome with 60 heads of state and government endorsing the Global Partnership to reduce hunger. The summit highlighted the need to increase agricultural output by 70% to feed a growing population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050. The U.S. State Department led the global hunger and food security initiative. The U.S. State Department led the Administration's global hunger and food security initiative, which aimed to increase agricultural output by 70% to feed a world population expected to surpass 9 billion by 2050. In 2010, the initiative was officially launched as \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) with a new strategy guide and implementation documents released. The FtF strategy guide and implementation documents were developed through a consultative process with global stakeholders, focusing on sustainable food security principles and cross-cutting priorities like gender and climate change. The initiative aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries through interventions that enhance agricultural productivity. The Feed the Future initiative aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries through interventions that enhance agricultural productivity, expand markets, develop policies, and improve infrastructure for smallholder farmers. Progress will be measured by changes in agricultural production and income levels of farmers. Specific activities and investments will vary by country based on key priorities. The Feed the Future initiative aims to improve agricultural production and income levels of farmers in rural areas. The initiative also focuses on strengthening links between agriculture and nutrition outcomes, coordinating with governments and partners to implement country-specific nutrition strategies. Progress will be measured by changes in child stunting, wasting, and women's underweight prevalence. The Feed the Future initiative aims to improve nutrition by measuring changes in stunted and wasted children, and underweight women. It includes investments in regional programs, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation. The initiative does not explicitly include traditional U.S. food aid funding but maintains a commitment to providing emergency food assistance. Currently focusing on 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The Feed the Future initiative is currently focusing on 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. These countries were selected based on criteria such as chronic hunger, potential for agricultural-led growth, regional synergies, government commitment, and resource availability. Investments will be made in two phases, with Phase 1 countries preparing their country investment plans (CIPs) with assistance in capacity-building and technical support. Phase 1 countries are preparing their country investment plans (CIPs) with assistance in capacity-building and technical support. Phase 2 countries should have completed a CIP that includes priority areas, financial projections, defined targets, beneficiary analysis, and a practical implementation plan. Additionally, Phase 2 countries must commit their own resources and establish a policy environment for agricultural development and improved nutrition. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) activities is $1.64 billion, representing about 3% of the total international affairs budget. FtF aims to partner with countries to develop and implement Country Investment Plans (CIPs) for agricultural development. Phase 2 countries are required to commit their own resources and establish a policy environment conducive to agricultural growth and improved nutrition. The FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) activities is $1.64 billion, a 40% increase from the estimated FY2010 allocation. The increase is mainly due to a $408 million contribution to a new multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. Additionally, $200 million for nutrition activities funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account are part of the food security effort but requested through the Global Health Initiative. The FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) activities is $1.64 billion, with a $408 million contribution to a new multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. Additionally, there is a request for $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance in FY2011, including funds for Food for Peace Title II emergency and non-emergency food aid, Migration and Refugee Assistance, International Disaster Assistance, and Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. The FY2011 budget request includes $1.690 billion for Food for Peace Title II aid, $1.605 billion for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $861 million for International Disaster Assistance, and $45 million for Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. There have been discussions about reforming U.S. foreign aid programs to better address national security challenges and development needs. Many criticize current aid programs as inefficient and not aligned with national security interests. The Obama Administration launched the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009 to reform U.S. aid programs. Led by the State Department, the QDDR aimed to align development policy with national security interests. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in 2010. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) was led by the State Department to reform U.S. aid programs. Secretary Clinton officially released the findings in 2010, outlining a strategy document titled \"Leading Through Civilian Power\" to elevate American \"civilian power\" for better national interests and partnership with the military. The QDDR developed foreign policy and development objectives, recommended strategies, tools, resources, and organizational reforms. Additionally, a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD-7) was launched in August 2009. The Administration also launched a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD-7) in August 2009 to review the roles of U.S. government agencies in global development. The process was led by the President's National Security Advisor and the Chairman of the National Economic Policy Council. National Security Council staff played key roles in the review, with a draft titled \"A New Way Forward on Global Development\" being prepared in May 2010. The PSD-7 review, led by the President's National Security Advisor and the Chairman of the National Economic Policy Council, prioritizes economic growth and democratic governance in U.S. foreign policy. The draft released in May 2010 emphasizes the importance of development as a key pillar. The Administration aims to integrate the QDDR results into broader interagency approaches and foreign policy framework. The QDDR will contribute to the PSD by assessing how its recommendations fit into broader interagency approaches and the Administration's foreign policy framework. The PSD-7 process has been delayed, and it is unclear if final outputs will be made public. President Obama's Global Development Policy Directive emphasizes development, diplomacy, and defense working together for national security, with a focus on Global Food Security, Climate Change, and Global Health. The President's Policy Directive emphasizes the integration of diplomacy, defense, and development for national security, with a focus on Global Food Security, Climate Change, and Global Health. The establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) at USAID will lead efforts to implement the Feed the Future initiative, coordinating interagency efforts and expanding partnerships with the private sector and NGOs. The establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) at USAID will lead efforts to implement Obama's Feed the Future initiative, coordinating interagency efforts and expanding partnerships with the private sector and NGOs. Congress is currently considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the initiative. Congress is currently considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House and Senate have proposed funding bills, with differences in amounts allocated for food security and agricultural development compared to the Obama Administration's request. The Senate approved a FY2011 State-Foreign Operations funding bill, S. 3676, allocating $54.22 billion, which is less than the House subcommittee draft and the Administration's request. The bill included $1.3 billion for food security and agriculture development programs under the Feed the Future initiative, lower than the Administration's request. However, none of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011 were enacted, and funding for the federal government was continued through continuing resolutions. The current fiscal situation and change in congressional leadership may lead to further debate on funding priorities for food security and agriculture. The current fiscal situation and change in congressional leadership may lead to further debate on funding priorities for food security and agriculture. The G8 L'Aquila commitment to the Global Partnership faces skepticism in meeting the $22 billion pledge over three years. The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund has received only a fraction of the pledged amount, raising doubts about meeting past aid commitments. The G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland pledged $50 billion in development aid to sub-Saharan Africa by 2009, but fell short by $15 billion. Concerns have been raised about the lack of strong leadership at USAID, with key positions remaining unfilled. This leadership vacuum has allowed other federal agencies to take on a larger role in global development efforts. Several key posts at USAID remain unfilled, leading to a \"leadership vacuum\" that has allowed other federal agencies like the State Department, Department of Defense, and U.S. Department of Agriculture to take on more responsibility in development activities. Critics question the divided development approach among different agencies, expressing concerns about undermining USAID's authority and resources. The Center for Global Development notes USAID's absence in significant foreign policy challenges in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. Senior government officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former USAID Administrator Peter McPherson, have raised alarms about the decline in USAID's effectiveness. Several senior government officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former USAID Administrator Peter McPherson, have raised concerns about the severe decline in staff capacity at USAID over the past few decades, impacting the country's national security capabilities. The decline in staff capacity at USAID over the past few decades has impacted the country's national security capabilities. The State Department froze hiring of new Foreign Service officers, while USAID saw a significant drop in permanent staff members. Testimony noted a decline in specialized staff, such as engineers and agriculture experts, leading to reduced on-the-ground effectiveness. The decline in staff capacity at USAID has led to detrimental impacts, with only two engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts in 2008. This has resulted in reduced on-the-ground effectiveness, the closing of overseas missions, and a shift towards contracting out foreign aid programs. Critics argue that this has led to less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. Additionally, there are challenges in managing the large number of small projects in USAID's agricultural development portfolio. Since the 1950s, the U.S. government has collaborated with land-grant universities to establish institutions in developing countries. USAID has faced challenges in managing its agricultural development portfolio due to staff shortages, leading to efforts to rebuild technical capacity. The agency has hired additional foreign-service officers to address this issue. Since the 1950s, land-grant universities have helped establish institutions in developing countries. In 1975, the Title XII amendment formalized their role in international development. However, USAID's support for capacity building has declined since the 1990s, leading to weaker institutional capacity in partner countries. This has also resulted in reduced support for agricultural research and projects, impacting long-term outcomes. USAID's support for capacity building in developing countries has declined since the 1990s, impacting agricultural research and projects. This has led to weaker institutional capacity in partner countries, raising concerns about the effectiveness of implementing agricultural programs. Some questions exist about the institutional capacity in the United States and developing countries, particularly Africa, to implement agricultural research and market development programs effectively. Sub-Saharan Africa lacks a strong scientific foundation for modern agriculture, with governments and donors hesitant to invest in science and technology for increased productivity. Several U.S. agencies, including USAID, State Department, USDA, MCC, Treasury Department, and USTR, are involved in agricultural development and food security assistance. The need for interagency coordination in agricultural development and food security assistance involving various U.S. government agencies has been widely discussed. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President to ensure consistent priorities and actions among agencies. The Chicago Council recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President to provide leadership and maintain consistent priorities among U.S. government agencies. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination issues between USDA and USAID in food aid provision. The Feed the Future initiative aims for a \"whole-of-government\" approach to address fragmentation in government agency activities. The new food security initiative aims for a \"whole-of-government\" approach, with some seeing it as an opportunity for better interagency coordination, while others view fragmentation across government agencies as a constraint. USAID will lead the implementation of the Feed the Future initiative, but coordination with other government entities is still unclear. Funding implications and the need for interagency coordination have been highlighted in bills introduced in Congress. Bills introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to enhance the U.S. role in addressing global hunger and emphasized the need for interagency coordination. Efforts to harmonize strategies and activities among donors and aid agencies began in the late 1990s. The United States continues to work with other donors and international bodies to make international aid more effective and efficient. The United States collaborates with other donors and international bodies to enhance global aid effectiveness. This includes participation in discussions and coordination with organizations like the United Nations, OECD's Development Assistance Committee, World Bank, and African Development Bank. Global summits also play a crucial role in donor coordination and establishing international development goals. Donors have agreed to principles like increasing aid predictability and flexibility to better meet the needs and priorities of recipient countries. The United States aligns with other donors to enhance global aid effectiveness, supporting country-led strategies and plans for development. Aid reform processes are criticized for being slow, with calls for more significant efforts from the United States. The United States supports global aid effectiveness and country-led development plans, but some criticize the slow aid reform process and call for more significant efforts. Concerns exist over donor control and oversight in implementing country-led planning. Some Members of Congress have concerns over country-led planning, citing issues with donor control and oversight. Developing countries may lack capacity for robust strategic planning and accountability measures. Civil society sectors worry that government-led strategies may exclude them. Coordination with U.S. food aid is not emphasized in the planning process. The Food for Peace (P.L. 480) Title II food aid is a significant component of U.S. food security assistance, with $1.69 billion allocated in the Administration's FY2011 request. Questions arise on how to coordinate U.S. commodity food aid with Feed the Future activities in the 20 focus countries and whether food aid should align with FtF objectives. The importance of cross-cutting initiatives like gender is also highlighted in the FtF strategy guide. The Food for Peace (P.L. 480) Title II food aid is a significant component of U.S. food security assistance, with questions arising on how to coordinate it with Feed the Future (FtF) activities. The FtF strategy guide emphasizes the importance of cross-cutting initiatives such as gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change. However, it is unclear how these issues will be integrated into country plans, the resources needed, metrics to track progress, and coordination with other USG initiatives like PEPFAR and GCCI. The Administration has been working on components of the FtF results framework and key indicators. The USG is working on components of the FtF results framework and key indicators to track progress towards the initiative's goals. It is unclear which agency will be responsible for monitoring progress and when results will be realized. Questions remain about whether FtF will help achieve MDG1 in the 20 countries involved and how frequently Congress will receive updates."
