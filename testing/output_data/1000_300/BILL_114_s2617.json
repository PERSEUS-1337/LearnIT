The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms Congress's goal for NASA to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with international partners, as outlined in the 2010 Authorization Act. The National Academy of Sciences reviewed human spaceflight goals and capabilities, publishing findings in a 2014 report. The National Academy of Sciences conducted a review of human spaceflight goals and capabilities, concluding that various rationales support human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, scientific discovery, and inspiring citizens. The National Academy of Sciences reviewed the rationales for human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, scientific discovery, and inspiring citizens. The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed Mars as the long-term goal and recommended sustainable steps for NASA to achieve human missions to Mars.

The National Academy of Sciences reviewed the rationales for human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, scientific discovery, and inspiring citizens. The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed Mars as the long-term goal and recommended sustainable steps for NASA to achieve human missions to Mars. Section 202(b) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to achieve human exploration of Mars, including the establishment of a capability to extend human presence to the surface of Mars. The Administrator of NASA shall submit a strategy to achieve this objective. The Administrator of NASA must submit a strategy to achieve human exploration of Mars, including an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space through successive missions using the Space Launch System and Orion crew capsule. The Administrator of NASA is required to develop a strategy for human exploration of Mars and an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space, including missions to various destinations for exploration and collaboration with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies. The strategy for human exploration of Mars and an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space includes collaboration with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies. It also focuses on utilizing the International Space Station for scientific research and technological developments to support missions beyond cis-lunar space. Exploration mission architectures and approaches, including capabilities for the Orion crew capsule and the Space Launch System, are also considered. The comparison of architectures and approaches for missions includes factors like cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, and opportunities for international collaboration. It also evaluates how different approaches may create new markets for US private industry and opportunities for scientific discovery and technological excellence. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of markets and opportunities for US private industry, scientific discovery, technological excellence, competitiveness, leadership, and national security. It also highlights the need for flexible architectures to adapt to evolving technologies, partners, priorities, and budget constraints. Additionally, it mentions measures for ensuring crew health and safety, including radiation exposure limits and necessary countermeasures. The curr_chunk outlines measures for crew health and safety, including radiation exposure limits and necessary countermeasures, crew training needs, capabilities, and a plan for prioritizing near-term intermediate destinations and missions. The curr_chunk details a plan for prioritizing near-term intermediate destinations and missions, assessing recommendations from a previous report, and providing technical information for potential stakeholder interest. The Administrator will arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to independently review and comment on each interim report regarding the strategy, identifying agreed-upon matters and concerns. The National Academy of Sciences will review and comment on interim reports regarding the strategy, focusing on agreed-upon matters, concerns, and recommendations deemed appropriate. The review process will be conducted in a timely manner to comply with requirements and facilitate feedback. The Administrator must submit interim reports on the strategy to the National Academy of Sciences within 90 days of the Act's enactment and every five years thereafter. The reports aim to facilitate independent review and incorporate the Academy's comments into the final report required by the subsection. The Administrator must submit an interim report to the National Academy of Sciences within 90 days of the Act's enactment and every five years thereafter. A final report on the strategy is required one year after the Act's enactment and every five years thereafter, incorporating the Academy's response to the interim report."
