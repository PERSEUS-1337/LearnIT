    "content": "The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 authorized federal agencies to participate in projects to restore the Everglades, coordinated under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The Everglades is crucial to the South Florida ecosystem, which includes national wildlife refuges, national park units, and a large population. Changes in water quantity and quality since the 1950s have significantly impacted the region's ecology, leading to water shortages during dry seasons. During the dry season, South Florida faces water shortages due to lower rainfall, impacting both natural systems and urban/agricultural needs. The Everglades, a vast wetland network, once spanned 220 miles from Orlando to Florida Bay, with water flowing south from lakes and rivers. The region's flat topography allowed water to slowly move through marshes to Lake Okeechobee and eventually to Florida Bay. The Everglades once served as a natural filter and retention area for water flowing from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. However, human interventions such as flood control and reclamation efforts have altered the Everglades' hydrology, allowing for development and agriculture. The Central and Southern Florida project by the Army Corps of Engineers, authorized in 1948, has had a significant impact on the Everglades. The Central and Southern Florida project by the Army Corps of Engineers, authorized in 1948, has significantly altered the Everglades' water regime, directing water into canals and rivers instead of allowing it to flow naturally across the Everglades. This change has impacted the ecosystem by reducing water flow during the dry season and increasing it during the rainy season. The Everglades ecosystem has changed due to altered water flow patterns, urban and agricultural development, leading to habitat loss and a reduction in size. Water quality is degraded by pollutants like excess nutrients, metals, and pesticides, causing harm to plant and animal populations. Changes in freshwater flows have disrupted coastal estuaries and reef systems. The federal government and the State of Florida have undertaken restoration activities to address the decline in native vegetation and overabundance of invasive species in the Everglades. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force coordinates these efforts with goals to improve water quality, restore habitats, and ensure compatibility of built and natural systems, with an estimated cost of nearly $20 billion. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aims to restore natural hydrologic functions, water quality, and provide water supplies in South Florida. With an estimated cost of nearly $20 billion, CERP focuses on capturing and storing freshwater for use during the dry season. The plan includes removing levees and canals, building reservoirs, underground storage wells, and pumping stations to redistribute water to replicate natural flow. CERP aims to restore natural hydrologic functions in South Florida by removing levees and canals, building reservoirs, and pumping stations to capture and redistribute water. WRDA 2000 and WRDA 2007 authorized funding for CERP projects, totaling roughly $2.0 billion in authorizations. Title VI of WRDA 2000 established that construction, operation, and maintenance costs of CERP projects would be equally shared by Floridian stakeholders and the federal government, totaling $2.0 billion in authorizations. CERP authorization was achieved after negotiations among federal, state, local, and tribal stakeholders. Federal agencies responsible for CERP components receive appropriations through annual bills. Information on appropriations for CERP activities is available in CRS Report RL34009. Support for CERP remains broad, but concerns persist over implementation, project prioritization, federal efforts, and mitigation of excess phosphorous. Issues also include restoration effectiveness and technological uncertainties. Since WRDA 2000, $0.37 billion in federal funds and $1.63 billion in state funds have been allocated to CERP projects. Some stakeholders are concerned about the prioritization of CERP projects under the Acceler8 effort, fearing a shift towards meeting water supply needs over ecosystem restoration. Proponents argue that priority projects have benefits for both water supply and restoration, aligning with the CERP program's goals.

Proponents argue that priority projects have benefits for both water supply and restoration, aligning with the CERP program's goals. Federal funding pace is seen as too slow, with increasing costs, particularly in land acquisition, prompting Acceler8 proponents to push for quicker action. The costs of CERP have increased, especially in land acquisition, causing concern among stakeholders about potential funding limitations for other restoration projects. Delays in completing CERP components raise doubts about the plan's feasibility. Delays in completing CERP projects in coastal Louisiana may divert funds and jeopardize the plan's feasibility. Concerns arise from delays in the Modified Waters Deliveries Project, impacting water flows for Everglades restoration. Controversies also stem from potential delays in restoration due to a Florida state law addressing phosphorus pollution in the Everglades. The Florida state law (Chapter 2003-12) may cause delays in Everglades restoration efforts by extending phosphorus mitigation deadlines. Provisions in the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts condition funds for restoration on achieving water quality standards in federal properties. Failure to meet these standards could result in reduced appropriations for restoration. The enacted language in the FY2004 and FY2005 Interior appropriations emphasizes achieving water quality standards for waters entering federal lands in Florida. Some question the effectiveness and necessity of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) in improving water quality and ecological restoration. Concerns include the lack of emphasis on natural systems in water allocation and the focus on water supply over ecological restoration. The Corps revised the project implementation sequencing to address these concerns. Some groups and federal agencies have raised concerns about the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) not prioritizing natural systems in water allocation and focusing more on water supply than ecological restoration. The Corps made changes to include restoration activities earlier in the project, but some groups and scientists still oppose CERP. Environmental groups supporting CERP worry about Florida's financial contribution, arguing against using funds meant for land acquisition for other CERP projects. Land acquisition is seen as crucial for successful Everglades restoration, according to the National Research Council. Some groups and federal agencies have raised concerns about the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) not prioritizing natural systems in water allocation and focusing more on water supply than ecological restoration. Land acquisition is crucial for successful Everglades restoration, according to the National Research Council, to lower the potential for irreversible damage due to development within the Greater Everglades. Questions have been raised about the management of Lake Okeechobee, flood management for central Florida, integration of water management issues into restoration efforts, and the impacts of sea level rise and climate change on the Everglades ecosystem. Ecosystem restoration is a young science, with technologies and data still being developed. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) integrates rising sea levels and climate change effects on the ecosystem. CERP uses adaptive management and pilot projects to address uncertainties in ecosystem restoration. Pilot projects, including aquifer storage and recovery (ASR), test new water management strategies on a large scale. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) integrates rising sea levels and climate change effects on the ecosystem through pilot projects, including testing aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) for water management on a large scale. Uncertainties exist in the effectiveness of these ASR pilot projects for early water storage."
