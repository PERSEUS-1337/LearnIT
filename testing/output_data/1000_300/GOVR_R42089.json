    "content": "Residential energy efficiency can benefit consumers by reducing utility bills and supporting national environmental policy objectives. Various policies, including tax incentives, have been implemented since the 1970s to increase conservation and energy efficiency. The federal government is still determining the best policy tools to meet energy-efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the US was by the residential sector, which has gradually increased over time. Residential energy consumption in the United States has gradually increased over time but has slightly fallen in recent years. Per capita energy use has remained relatively constant since the 1970s, with a downward trend starting in the mid- to late-2000s. Efficiency gains have allowed for a modest decline in per capita residential energy use, indicating a potential for further improvements. Despite gains in energy efficiency, experts believe there is still untapped potential for increased residential energy efficiency. Concerns exist that consumers may not invest optimally in energy efficiency, leading to debates on the level of investment needed. Tax credits are one policy option explored to promote residential energy efficiency. This report explores the use of tax credits to promote residential energy efficiency by addressing market failures and barriers. It provides an economic rationale for these incentives and analyzes the primary tax incentives for residential energy efficiency. Tax credits are used to promote residential energy efficiency by addressing market barriers. Taxpayers can claim credits for energy-efficient improvements to their primary residence, including building envelope upgrades and high-efficiency appliances. Taxpayers can claim a tax credit for high-efficiency heating, cooling, and water-heating appliances purchased for their primary residence. The credit is calculated as 10% of expenditures on building envelope improvements plus the cost of each energy-efficient property, capped at $500. The Section 25C credit expired at the end of 2017. The Section 25C credit for residential energy-efficiency expired in 2017, and taxpayers cannot claim it if they had claimed $500 or more before that year. The Section 25D credit allows for a 30% tax credit on renewable energy property installations in 2017, with rates decreasing in subsequent years and expiring after 2021. The Section 25D credit offers a 30% tax credit for renewable energy property installations in 2017, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021 before expiring. The maximum value of the credit is not capped, and details on eligibility and legislative history can be found in the appendices. A rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technology if the savings outweigh the costs. Some consumers do not invest in optimal residential energy efficiency despite potential cost savings. Market failures and barriers contribute to this \"energy-efficiency paradox.\" Market failures and barriers, such as externalities and informational issues, hinder optimal investments in residential energy efficiency. This limits the impact of Section 25C and Section 25D credits in increasing energy efficiency. Energy consumption externalities, like pollution costs, can lead to underinvestment in residential energy efficiency. Lower electricity prices due to lack of reflecting environmental consequences result in excessive consumption and hinder adoption of energy-efficient technologies. The adoption of energy-efficient technologies can lead to positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects. These effects benefit society as a whole by encouraging more widespread adoption of emerging technologies. Market failures, such as not considering these benefits, can result in underinvestment in energy efficiency. Market failures, like the principal-agent problem, can lead to underinvestment in energy efficiency. Landlords and builders may not prioritize energy-efficient technologies due to disconnects between decision-makers and end-users. Investing in high-efficiency products can be cost-effective when selling a property. Landlords and builders may not invest optimally in energy efficiency without knowledge of end user energy use patterns. Capital market imperfections can lead to underinvestment in energy-efficient property, especially for low-income households who may settle for less efficient alternatives due to credit constraints. Lack of information about energy-saving technologies can also prevent consumers from making such investments. Consumers may settle for less energy-efficient alternatives due to credit constraints and lack of information about energy-saving technologies. Uncertainty about future energy prices can also deter investments in energy efficiency. Government policies like tax incentives can help address market failures or barriers. Other options include grants, rebates, or credit enhancements. Government policies, such as tax incentives, grants, rebates, and credit enhancements, can help address market barriers and encourage investments in energy efficiency. Policymakers can also use regulations, mandates, and informational programs like Energy Star to support energy efficiency initiatives. Tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D can lower the cost of energy-efficient investments and correct negative externalities associated with residential energy consumption. Tax credits such as Section 25C and Section 25D can lower energy-efficiency investment costs and promote additional investments in energy-efficient technologies. Other incentives like the expired energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit also reduce production costs for energy-efficient products. Governments can increase awareness through programs like Energy Star labeling. Increasing awareness about energy-efficiency technologies can be achieved through programs like the Energy Star labeling program. However, tax credits may not be the most economically efficient policy option for increasing energy-efficiency investment if markets underinvest due to artificially low electricity prices. Allowing electricity prices to fully reflect costs by removing federal financial support or taxing electricity production could be a more efficient way to increase investment in energy efficiency. Increasing the price of electricity to reflect full costs could boost investment in energy-efficiency technologies. Current tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not address the principal-agent problem, as they are not available to renters or landlords investing in rental properties. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not benefit landlords investing in rental properties, as they are not eligible for incentives. Other tax credits, like the one for energy-efficient new homes, address market problems more directly. However, tax credits may not be the most effective policy for immediate savings for credit-constrained consumers. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not be the most effective policy option for providing immediate savings to credit-constrained consumers. However, subsidies like tax credits can increase the adoption of energy-efficient technologies when consumers lack information about them. Research suggests that tax credits may not be necessary for well-informed consumers, as they may provide windfall gains instead. Targeting consumers effectively with tax credits is crucial for maximizing benefits. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency are most beneficial when targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies. While tax credits may not be necessary for well-informed consumers, they can provide windfall gains instead. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits aim to increase investment in energy-efficient property but may not address all market failures. An economic analysis evaluates their impact on investment behavior, fairness, and administrative issues. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency, specifically Section 25C and Section 25D, are analyzed for their impact on investment behavior, fairness, and administrative issues. It is unclear how effective these tax credits are in increasing investment, as they may mainly reward consumers who would have made investments regardless. These credits tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers, and there are identified administrative issues with the current system. The goal of these tax credits is to encourage energy efficiency. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has identified administrative issues with current tax benefits for residential energy efficiency. The goal of residential energy-efficiency tax credits is to encourage individuals to increase investments in energy efficiency. Tax credits should lead to additional investments, not just reward consumers for investments they would have made anyway. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not lead to additional investments or reduced energy consumption, as concerns were raised in the 1970s when these credits were first introduced. Representative Bill Frenzel expressed reservations about the effectiveness of tax credits in incentivizing energy efficiency investments. During hearings on residential energy tax benefits, Representative Bill Frenzel expressed doubts about the effectiveness of tax credits in stimulating the marketplace. He noted that the tax credit did not provide a significant incentive for investment and was more of a reward for actions already taken. Empirical evidence on the impact of residential energy tax credits in the late 1970s and early 1980s is mixed, with some researchers suggesting that tax incentives did lead to increased investment in energy-efficient property. The effectiveness of residential energy tax credits in stimulating additional investment in energy-efficient property is debated. Some researchers suggest that tax incentives led to increased investment, while others argue that the credits mainly resulted in windfall gains for recipients. Policymakers need to consider whether tax credits truly encourage enhanced residential energy-efficiency investment. Consumers may not be significantly influenced by these tax credits when making purchasing decisions, as they may already be responding to other market incentives like high energy prices. Residential energy tax credits may not significantly impact purchasing decisions for consumers due to various reasons. Consumers may already be investing in energy-efficient improvements due to market incentives like high energy prices. Additionally, the savings from tax credits are only realized after filing tax returns, reducing their incentive power. Furthermore, tax credits only benefit taxpayers with income tax liability, excluding households with no federal income tax liability. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers with tax liability, motivating them to invest in energy-efficient properties. These incentives may also encourage consumers already in the market for energy property to make more efficient choices. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency target higher-income taxpayers to invest in energy-efficient properties, motivating them to make more efficient choices. These incentives aim to increase investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties, particularly among homeowners. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency are primarily claimed by middle- and upper-income homeowners, with over three-quarters of claims made by taxpayers with incomes above $50,000 in 2015. These taxpayers also claimed 89% of the total value of residential credits that year. Tax units with incomes above $50,000 claimed 89.0% of residential credits in 2015. Those with incomes below $50,000 made up 61.4% of tax units but claimed only 11.0% of the total value of these credits. As income rises, the average credit amount also increases, with the highest income tax units receiving credits seven times higher than the lowest income units. The nonrefundability of certain tax credits limits who can claim them, as the credit cannot exceed a taxpayer's tax liability. The Section 25C and Section 25D tax credits have limitations on who can claim them, as the value of nonrefundable credits cannot exceed a taxpayer's tax liability. While the Section 25D credit can be carried forward, the Section 25C credit cannot. Taxpayers without enough tax liability in the current year may not fully benefit from the Section 25C credit, especially if they claim other tax incentives. This may restrict lower-income households from taking advantage of residential energy-efficiency incentives, which are mostly utilized by higher-income taxpayers. Residential energy-efficiency tax incentives are limited to higher-income taxpayers, which may not effectively address market barriers. Tax credits reducing upfront costs could encourage investment, but if only available to higher-income households, they may not be the best policy option. An ideal tax code should be simple for taxpayers to comply with and for the government to administer, to ensure low compliance costs and increased tax benefit claims. An ideal tax code should be simple for taxpayers to comply with and for the government to administer, ensuring low compliance costs and increased tax benefit claims. However, there may be a trade-off between allowing tax credits with minimal reporting requirements and overall taxpayer compliance. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration found opportunities for fraud in the processing of residential energy tax credits in April 2011. The IRS could not verify if individuals claiming residential energy credits made qualifying modifications to their homes. Lack of information and third-party verification led to potential fraud opportunities. IRS Form 5695 did not require eligibility confirmation, resulting in uncertainty for 30% of taxpayers sampled. The IRS Form 5695 did not request information to confirm eligibility for residential energy credits, leading to uncertainty for 30% of taxpayers sampled. In some cases, the IRS incorrectly denied eligible taxpayers $1.5 million in credits. The TIGTA report found that the IRS may have wrongly denied nearly 800 eligible taxpayers $1.5 million in residential energy tax credits. The $500 limit for the 25C credit was mistakenly applied to the 25D credit, resulting in taxpayers being denied the full amount. Congress has the option to let these tax credits expire, with the 25C credit already expired in 2017 and the 25D credit set to expire in 2021. Other policy options for future incentives in residential energy efficiency may be considered. The Section 25C and 25D residential energy tax credits are set to expire, with Congress considering options such as letting them expire as scheduled or modifying them. Policymakers may choose to extend, expand, or modify these incentives. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency, set to expire, may be extended, expanded, or modified by policymakers. Options include increasing the credit amount, expanding eligible technologies, and removing caps to provide additional incentives for homeowners. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency may be expanded by policymakers in various ways, such as using a more generous formula, expanding eligible technologies, and removing caps. These expansions could provide additional incentives for taxpayers and have shown significant growth in credit value in the past. Policymakers could also scale back these provisions by reinstating caps or reducing overall caps. Policymakers may consider changes to tax credits for residential energy efficiency, including reinstating technology-specific caps for Section 25D credit, introducing an overall cap for Section 25D credit, reducing technology-specific caps of Section 25C, or reducing the overall cap on Section 25C. These changes could lead to confusion among taxpayers estimating their credits. There is a possibility of phasing out credits for upper-income taxpayers and replacing them with a rebate program or alternative mechanism for direct cash payments to consumers. Extension of current policy, whether expanded or scaled back, will have a higher budgetary cost than expiration of these benefits. Policymakers may consider replacing tax credits with a rebate program or direct cash payments to incentivize energy-efficient purchases. Legislation in 2010 proposed a rebate program for installing energy-efficient property. This could benefit consumers who lack funds for upfront expenditures or have little to no tax liability. In 2010, legislation was introduced for a rebate program called Home Star, aimed at contractors installing energy-efficient property. The House passed the legislation, but it was not considered by the Senate. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency have a legislative history dating back to the late 1970s. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency were first introduced in the late 1970s under the Energy Tax Act of 1978. These incentives were allowed to expire in the mid-1980s but were reintroduced in 2005. The credits included components for energy conservation expenditures and qualified expenditures for solar, wind, and geothermal energy. In 1980, Congress passed the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-223), which increased the federal tax credit for renewable energy generation. The credit was calculated based on qualified expenditures for solar, wind, and geothermal energy, with a maximum value of $4,000. This credit expired in 1985 but was reintroduced in 2005 under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58). The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) created new temporary tax credits for residential energy efficiency and renewable-energy property. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to receive a nonrefundable tax credit equal to 10% of qualified expenditures for energy-efficient improvements to their homes. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) introduced temporary tax credits for residential energy efficiency and renewable-energy property. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) offered credits for specific improvements to the taxpayer's principal residence, with varying credit limits for different types of property. Additionally, a second credit, the residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D), provided a nonrefundable credit for expenditures on qualified photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties. The residential energy-efficient property credit (IRC \u00a725D) for 2006 and 2007 offered a nonrefundable credit of 30% of expenditures on qualified photovoltaic properties, solar water-heating properties, and fuel-cell generators, with annual limits. The credit for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties was capped at $2,000 per year, while fuel cells were limited to $500 per year. Section 25C expired at the end of 2007, but Section 25D was extended for the 2008 tax year by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-432). The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended the Section 25D credit for the 2008 tax year, allowing all property using solar energy to qualify. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for 2009, adding biomass fuel stoves and removing geothermal heat pumps from eligibility. The Section 25D tax credit was extended through 2016. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended the Section 25D tax credit for eight years, through 2016, and expanded it to include new technologies like geothermal heat pumps. The act removed the $2,000 maximum annual credit limit for solar-electric property expenditures and added small wind-energy property expenditures to qualify for a 30% credit. The credit for geothermal heat pumps was also included, with a cap set at $500 for each half kilowatt of electric capacity generated by a wind turbine, not to exceed $4,000 annually. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for small wind energy and geothermal heat pumps. Taxpayers could receive a 30% credit for expenditures on these technologies, with caps set at $500 per half kilowatt for wind energy and $2,000 annually for geothermal heat pumps. The credits were available for residential properties, and the Section 25C credit was extended for two years with a 30% credit for energy-efficiency improvements. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the Section 25C credit for two years, increasing the credit to 30% of qualified expenditures for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property. The credit cap was raised to $1,500 for 2009 and 2010, with the removal of the $200 cap for windows. Taxpayers could claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows in 2009 and 2010. Additionally, the efficiency standards for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property were reduced, expanding the availability of the credit to more products. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the Section 25C credit for two years, increasing the credit to 30% of qualified expenditures for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property. The credit cap was raised to $1,500 for 2009 and 2010, with the removal of the $200 cap for windows. Taxpayers could claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows in 2009 and 2010. ARRA generally reduced the efficiency standards for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property, expanding the availability of the credit to additional products. Changes were made to the Section 25D tax credit for 2009 and 2010, removing maximum credit caps for every type of technology except fuel cells. These changes were effective from 2009 through 2016, leading to an increase in the number and total dollar amount of credits being claimed. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year, reinstating the general lifetime limit of $500 and window lifetime limit of $200. Taxpayers who had already claimed these credits in previous years were ineligible to claim them in 2011. The Section 25C credit limits were extended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) for 2012 and 2013, and by the Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) for 2014. Efficiency standards were restored to pre-ARRA levels, and technology-specific credit limits for energy-efficiency property were reinstated. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended the Section 25C credit for 2014, while the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) extended it for 2015 and 2016. The PATH Act also introduced more stringent Energy Star 6.0 standards for windows and doors starting in 2016. Division P of the PATH Act extended the 25D credit for solar technologies through 2021. The Energy Star 6.0 standards for windows and doors will be more stringent starting in 2016. The 25D credit for solar technologies has been extended through 2021, with a modified credit formula. The credit will be calculated as 30% of qualifying expenditures from 2017 to 2019, 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021. In 2020, the solar technology credit will be 26% of qualifying expenditures, decreasing to 22% in 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021, with credit rates of 30% in 2019, 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021, aligning with solar technology credit rates. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021, with credit rates of 30% in 2019, 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021, aligning with solar technology credit rates."
