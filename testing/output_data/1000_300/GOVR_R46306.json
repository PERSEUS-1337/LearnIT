    "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in increasing financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs for individuals beyond high school age. These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certificates or licensure. There is a demand for workers in jobs that do not require a college degree but need training or postsecondary education. Demand exists for workers in jobs that do not require a college degree but need training or postsecondary education. Despite over $100 billion in federal financial aid for postsecondary education, most funds are not accessible to individuals pursuing non-degree programs. Some colleges are exploring new approaches to boost enrollment, including targeting adults seeking short programs for quick reentry into the workforce. Some traditional colleges are facing declining enrollment, leading them to explore creative approaches to increase student numbers and revenue. One strategy is to reach out to adults interested in short programs for quick reentry into the workforce or higher earnings. Congress is considering providing direct federal support to students pursuing non-degree programs, with proposals to increase funding for short-term education and training programs. In 2019, the House Committee on Education and Labor introduced the College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) to address this issue. In 2011-2017, the Department of Education allowed Pell Grants for short-term non-degree programs. The College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) aims to expand Pell Grant eligibility for non-degree programs. The President's Council of Economic Advisers suggested options to bring individuals back into the workforce with necessary skills, including expanding Pell Grants for short-term training programs. The President's FY2021 budget proposed expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs not currently eligible, supported by education and business organizations. Concerns exist about promoting non-degree programs, their quality, and potential high federal costs. Some concerns about non-degree educational programs include the lack of increased employment or earnings for completers compared to high school graduates, questions about program quality, potential high federal costs, need for student supports and business coordination, and perpetuating income inequalities. There are also concerns about diminishing labor market returns over time for some technical non-degree programs and the fact that some programs are not required or preferred by employers. Employers are increasingly relying on degrees for hiring, which may disadvantage non-degree holders in securing employment. Adults with degrees in positions not requiring a degree may also crowd out non-degree holders. Federal programs support individuals in non-degree training and work-based learning programs. This report outlines federal programs and benefits supporting individuals in non-degree training and work-based learning programs. It discusses employer demand for non-degree program graduates and describes key characteristics of these programs. Additionally, it details six federal programs and three tax benefits providing financial support to students pursuing non-degree instructional programs. The report details federal programs and tax benefits that provide financial support to students in non-degree training and work-based learning programs. It highlights gaps and limitations in the support offered, as well as eligibility requirements and federal oversight. Key reasons for promoting financial support include the need for individuals with non-degree credentials in the workforce and the benefits of attaining a non-degree postsecondary credential. The report discusses the importance of non-degree programs in meeting employer needs and economic growth. It provides data on employment and wages based on entry-level education requirements. Approximately 6.2% of jobs in the national economy in May 2018 required a non-degree postsecondary credential. Approximately 6.2% of jobs in the national economy required a non-degree postsecondary credential. The mean annual wages for occupations with entry-level education requirements of a high school diploma, some college but no degree, or a non-degree credential are similar. However, there may be significant earnings differences within these categories. Non-degree programs offer training primarily to individuals beyond typical secondary education age, preparing them for specific occupations. Research shows earnings premiums for various certificate categories, including long-term certificates, technical and health fields, and community college certificates. Programs can be classified as instructional or work-based learning, with some offering a combination of both. Postsecondary non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment. Upon completion, individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate as a credential awarded by an educational institution. Non-degree instructional programs provide postsecondary educational certificates for individuals completing coursework and assessments. These programs are pursued for various reasons such as expanding knowledge, preparing for further education or employment, and seeking promotion. Transfer programs, which do not award certificates or degrees but provide education for at least two academic years, are excluded from non-degree instructional programs. Non-degree instructional programs offer education for at least two academic years and lead to certificates or degrees. They are different from certifications and licenses, which are occupational credentials. Various institutions, including colleges, universities, trade, vocational, and technical schools, offer non-degree instructional programs. In fall 2018, nearly 1.9 million non-degree seeking undergraduate students were enrolled in these programs. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by traditional postsecondary educational institutions, trade schools, businesses, and other entities. In fall 2018, almost 1.9 million non-degree seeking undergraduate students were enrolled in these programs. There are over 4,500 for-profit non-traditional postsecondary educational institutions offering programs of varying lengths, from a few days to over two years. Instructional programs vary in length, ranging from a few days to over two years. The duration is influenced by curriculum requirements, industry expectations, and skills complexity. Federal, state, and private entities may set minimum educational hours for eligibility. Programs can be stackable units aligned to a career path. Funding for program costs, living expenses, and lost wages may need to be arranged by students. Programs are offered in various formats such as classrooms, online, or through a combination of methods. Programs vary in length and format, with costs ranging from $9,000 to $15,000 at public and private less-than-two-year colleges. There is a distinction between credit and noncredit instructional programs, with funding needed for program costs, living expenses, and lost wages. Credit programs offer courses that can be transferred for credit towards other programs, while noncredit programs do not offer this option. Credit programs have more stringent requirements and can lead to various vocations. Noncredit programs may offer vocational certificates but do not provide currency towards credit programs. Noncredit programs offer vocational certificates, ABE, ESL, personal enrichment, and customized training. They are less expensive, cover a broader range of topics, and can be quickly modified to meet industry and student needs. Approximately 38% of enrollments in one state community college system were in noncredit courses from 2007-2013. Approximately 38% of enrollments in one state community college system from 2007-2013 were in noncredit courses, including vocational (18%), ABE (9%), ESL (7%), and GED (4%). National data on non-degree instructional programs are incomplete, with some states and the federal government not collecting data on noncredit programs. In AY2017-2018, educational institutions participating in federal student aid programs awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and approximately 3 million undergraduate degrees. In AY2017-2018, educational institutions awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and approximately 3 million undergraduate degrees. Work-based learning includes various training activities to impart workplace skills, such as on-the-job training and apprenticeships. Work-based learning encompasses a variety of training activities, including on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, and cooperative programs. Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs, overseen by the Department of Labor (DOL), are a unique form of work-based learning with specific requirements for registration. These programs combine on-the-job training and related instruction to develop worker proficiency in specific competencies. The registration process for work-based learning programs involves submitting a work process schedule outlining competencies and training methods. Programs must be reviewed every five years to ensure compliance, with possible deregistration for significant failures. Various entities can offer work-based learning experiences, including employers, labor unions, training providers, and educational institutions. Work-based learning experiences can be offered by employers, labor unions, training providers, or educational institutions. These experiences are structured to meet the needs of the employer, potential employer, or trainee, with programs like summer internships providing informal or formal training opportunities. Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs require at least 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training and typically last four years, with apprentices learning skills through completing a specified number of hours of on-the-job training. Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs typically last four years and require at least 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training. Programs can take a time-based or competency-based approach, with related instruction included. Program costs are primarily covered by the provider, but trainees may need to cover living expenses. Program costs for work-based learning are usually covered by the provider, but trainees may need to pay for living expenses. These costs can include lost work time, fees for trainers, and trainee wages. Trainees may also have to cover related instruction costs. Those who do not receive or receive minimal remuneration must provide their own transportation, room, and board, potentially missing out on other paid employment opportunities. Data on employer-provided training is limited and varies in methodology and purpose. Data on employer-provided training is limited and varies in methodology. Surveys show that while most establishments offer some training, the percentage of workers receiving training ranges from 16% to 70%. A 2016 survey found that 21% of adults aged 16-65 completed work-based learning programs, with healthcare and teaching being the most common fields. The Department of Labor reported around 633,000 active apprentices in about 25,000 programs in FY2019. In FY2019, the Department of Labor reported 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs, with 81,000 completing a program. The construction industry has the largest share of apprenticeships, but they are also available in manufacturing and transportation. Federal programs provide financial support for training and education to help individuals enter the workforce and reach their potential. None of these programs exclusively focus on non-degree programs. Federal programs and benefits support training and education for individuals to realize their potential. The primary programs include the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I program, federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance. WIOA Title I, administered by the Department of Labor, subsidizes training costs for individuals pursuing non-degree programs. Federal programs such as WIOA Title I, federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance provide financial support for training and education. WIOA Title I subsidizes training costs, federal student aid programs offer grants and loans for postsecondary education, federal tax benefits provide financial support post-education, and veterans educational assistance programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC offer direct financial support. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC for financial support in education. Other programs like SNAP Employment & Training and TANF provide training and education assistance for needy individuals. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), offers opportunities for individuals at high risk of educational failure. TANF funds can be used for workforce training and education. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is the primary federal legislation for workforce development, aiming to coordinate federal programs. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA; P.L. 113-128) is the main federal legislation for workforce development, focusing on coordination among federal programs to increase employment, earnings, and postsecondary credentials. WIOA Title I, administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), provides services to improve the quality of the workforce, reduce welfare dependency, and meet employer skill requirements through formula grants to states for local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs). The Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities program under WIOA Title I provides formula grants to states for local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) to establish One-Stop delivery systems, provide career and training services, build relationships with employers, and develop industry partnerships. WIOA offers consumer choice to participants with career services and training options. Career services include basic and individualized assistance like labor market information and skills assessment. Career services under WIOA Title I include basic services like labor market information and job postings, as well as individualized services such as skills assessment and case management. Eligible participants can choose training from the Eligible Training Provider List, which includes institutions of higher education and other training providers offering recognized credentials. Allowable training activities supported by WIOA funds include non-degree and degree programs, as well as work-based learning opportunities. Entities providing RA or training programs leading to recognized credentials can be supported with WIOA Title I funds. Training activities include non-degree and degree programs, work-based learning like OJT and customized training. Training must be for in-demand occupations in the local area or region. The program must lead to an industry-recognized certificate, license, or associate degree. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) allows for training services that lead to industry-recognized certificates, licenses, degrees, or employment. Local areas can reserve funds for incumbent worker training. WIOA provides universal access to career services for adults, with individualized services available to help individuals obtain and retain employment. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), individuals in the United States can receive career services without needing to meet specific qualifications. These services aim to help individuals secure and maintain employment. Eligibility for training services requires the individual to demonstrate a need for training to achieve economic self-sufficiency, possess the necessary skills for successful participation, choose a training program linked to a local occupation, and not be able to access other grant assistance. Determinations are made by a One-Stop operator. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), individuals in the United States can receive career services without specific qualifications. Eligibility for training services requires demonstrating a need for training, possessing necessary skills, choosing a program linked to a local occupation, and being unable to access other grant assistance. Determinations are made by a One-Stop operator through an interview or assessment. Local WDBs prioritize career and training services for recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), priority for career and training services is given to recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) determine how to allocate funds among these groups. Training can be provided through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) or contracts for services, with funds also allowed for supportive services like child care and transportation. Eligible individuals can choose training services from the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL) in consultation with a One-Stop operator. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), eligible individuals can choose training services from the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL) in consultation with a One-Stop operator. An Individual Training Account (ITA) is established for payment to the training provider, not the individual, for non-degree instructional and degree programs. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) have the authority to set limits on the type, duration, and amount of an ITA, and may also provide supportive services like transportation, child care, and housing to enable participation in training. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) can offer supportive services such as transportation, child care, housing, and needs-related payments to help individuals participate in training. They may also provide training through a contract for services with employers or RA sponsors, reimbursed by the WDB. This option is available when consumer choice requirements are met, and there is a lack of training providers in the area to meet Individual Training Account (ITA) requirements under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) can offer supportive services such as transportation, child care, housing, and needs-related payments to help individuals participate in training. They may also provide training through a contract with employers or RA sponsors, reimbursed by the WDB. This option is available when consumer choice requirements are met, and there is a lack of training providers in the area to meet Individual Training Account (ITA) requirements under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). Training services can include OJT, RA, customized training, incumbent worker training, transitional employment, or contracting for training services in in-demand occupations or industry sectors. Reimbursement for wages can be up to 50% for OJT providers and up to 75% for RA sponsors through a contract. Local WDBs can offer supportive services and training through contracts with RA sponsors, reimbursed up to 75% of apprentice wages. States are responsible for developing the ETPL, with varying administrative structures. Quality assurance for training providers is ensured through eligibility processes. RA programs are automatically eligible for state funding. The RA programs are automatically eligible for state funding, while non-RA training providers must apply for initial eligibility. Existing training providers must follow procedures to maintain eligibility, with local WDBs having discretion on specific factors such as the duration of OJT contracts. WIOA gives local WDBs discretion in determining factors like the duration of OJT contracts and employer eligibility for training funding. ETPs and states must report program participation and outcomes, while RA programs are not required to submit ETP performance reports. Providers must submit performance and cost information for participants every two years for continued eligibility. Providers must submit performance and cost information every two years for continued eligibility, including data on program participants' employment status, earnings, credentials obtained, cost of attendance, and program completion rates. The governor may require additional performance information for continued eligibility of programs. States must publish annual ETP performance reports with details on program participants, credentials received, cost of attendance, and completion rates. The ETP performance reports must include data on participants in WIOA Title I programs, such as total number trained, exits, average cost per participant, and participants with barriers to employment. Work-based learning data from 2017 shows 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 dislocated worker participants, with the majority being over 30 years old. In 2017, there were 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 dislocated worker participants in WIOA-authorized work-based learning programs. Most participants were over 30 years old, unemployed, and lacked postsecondary education. 22% of adults and 34% of dislocated workers had a degree. In 2018, fewer than 20% of WIOA Title I participants engaged in work-based learning, with over 66% pursuing skills training or upgrading through non-degree programs. Healthcare was a popular occupation choice for adult trainees. WIOA Title I participants primarily engage in work-based learning through non-degree programs, with a focus on healthcare, transportation, material moving, and production occupations. The program supports adult entry or reentry into the workforce by providing career services and short-term training. To enhance support for non-degree training, One-Stop operators should increase access and additional funding could be allocated. The program supports adult entry or reentry into the workforce by providing career services and short-term training. To enhance support for non-degree training, recommendations include increasing access to non-degree training, dedicating additional funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxing the 20% limit on incumbent training, and eliminating restrictions on recipients obtaining other grant assistance. Non-degree program quality may vary due to state and local flexibility in developing the ETPL. Title IV of the Higher Education Act authorizes financial assistance programs for students at certain institutions. Grants and loans are available to qualified students, with Federal Pell Grants and Direct Loans being the primary types of aid. These programs are designed to provide portable aid to students at eligible postsecondary education institutions. The Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs provide portable aid to eligible individuals regardless of congressional appropriations. Pell Grants are considered a quasi-entitlement, while Direct Loans are a mandatory entitlement program for budgetary purposes. Both programs can be used to pursue Title IV-eligible education. The Pell Grant program is considered a quasi-entitlement as eligible students receive the award regardless of appropriations levels. Pell Grants and Direct Loans can be used for Title IV-eligible programs offered by participating institutions, including non-degree and degree programs. Eligibility criteria for programs and institutions include quality assurance measures. Institutions can be classified as public, private nonprofit, proprietary, or vocational institutions. Non-degree programs must meet specific eligibility requirements. Non-degree programs at various types of postsecondary institutions must meet specific eligibility requirements, such as leading to a recognized non-degree credential. Title IV aid is generally not available for noncredit programs or programs without defined credit or clock hours. Work-based learning programs must have the OJT portion supervised by the institution, with limits on contracted OJT. Non-degree programs are also subject to specific durational requirements. Non-degree programs at postsecondary institutions must meet specific durational requirements for Title IV aid eligibility. Pell Grants require at least 15 weeks of instructional time and 600 clock hours, 16 semester hours, or 24 quarter hours. Direct Loan programs mandate at least 10 weeks of instructional time for non-degree programs. Non-degree programs at postsecondary institutions must meet specific durational requirements for Title IV aid eligibility. For the Direct Loan program, non-degree programs must be at least 10 weeks of instructional time and 300-599 clock hours. Students must be enrolled at least half-time to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Non-degree programs of at least one academic year in length at public and private nonprofit institutions are eligible for Pell Grants and Direct Loans without specific durational requirements. Non-degree credential eligibility for Pell Grants and Direct Loans is not subject to specific durational requirements. To receive Title IV funds, students must be enrolled in a Title IV-eligible program and meet citizenship and education criteria. Pell Grant recipients must be in an undergraduate program, not have a bachelor's degree, and show financial need. To receive Pell Grants, students must meet program-specific criteria including being enrolled in an undergraduate program, not having completed a bachelor's degree, and demonstrating financial need. There is a lifetime eligibility cap of 12 full-time semesters for Pell Grant aid. For Direct Loan program loans, students must be enrolled at least half-time and may need to meet additional eligibility criteria. The primary loans available are Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduate students. Direct Loan program borrowers, including parents of dependent students, may need to meet additional eligibility criteria for specific loan types. The main loans available are Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for all students, and PLUS Loans for parents and graduate/professional students. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, can only borrow Direct Subsidized Loans for up to 150% of their program length. Title IV aid eligibility is determined by statutory rules, with aid not exceeding the cost of attendance. The amount of Title IV aid for which a student is eligible is guided by statutory award rules and cannot exceed the student's cost of attendance (COA). The COA includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation costs, and dependent care expenses. Pell Grant award rules do not consider other financial assistance. The maximum Pell Grant award amount is established by annual appropriations acts and the Higher Education Act (HEA). The maximum Pell Grant award amount for AY 2020-2021 is $6,345 for full-time students in a 26-30 week academic year. Pell Grant awards may be reduced based on COA, financial need, enrollment rate, or program duration. Pell Grants used for non-degree programs are subject to income taxation, while those for degree programs are taxed if used for non-tuition purposes. Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type, and other factors can affect aid eligibility. The Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type and other factors can affect aid eligibility. An individual cannot be awarded a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan exceeding statutory annual and aggregate limits based on dependency status and class level. For example, a dependent undergraduate student may borrow up to $5,500 in loans for the first year, while an independent undergraduate student may borrow up to $9,500 in loans for the first year. The Direct Loan program sets annual and aggregate limits based on dependency status and class level. Dependent undergraduates can borrow up to $5,500 in loans for the first year, while independent undergraduates can borrow up to $9,500. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs, handling tasks like system maintenance, customer service, and program integrity. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs, providing support for program administration, integrity, and funding disbursement to eligible students through participating institutions. Various provisions ensure the quality of programs and institutions, including state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. The program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification ensures quality in Title IV-eligible programs. Non-degree programs may also need to meet gainful employment requirements. Non-degree programs must meet gainful employment requirements, which vary among states. Some states approve individual educational programs, while others only require approval of the institution as a whole. States evaluate program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program necessity. The evaluation of an individual educational program varies by state, including the assessment of program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program necessity. Accreditation by a recognized agency is required for participation in Title IV programs. Accreditation by a regional or national accreditor is necessary for educational institutions to participate in Title IV programs. The accreditor evaluates various criteria such as faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement in relation to the institution's mission. Accrediting agencies have discretion in the evaluation measures they use, and may choose to evaluate a sample of programs within an institution. Accrediting agencies have discretion in evaluating measures for regional and national accreditation of educational institutions. Programmatic accreditation is not required for Title IV purposes but may be sought to meet employer and licensure requirements. When seeking Title IV participation, institutions must apply for certification from the Department of Education, which evaluates program eligibility based on established standards for the field of study. When institutions seek Title IV participation, they must apply for certification from the Department of Education to ensure they meet eligibility requirements. This includes evaluating educational programs to meet specific criteria such as completion and placement rates. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation as per regulations. The Higher Education Act requires clock-hour programs to apply for approval from the Department of Education. Regulations defining gainful employment in a recognized occupation were rescinded in 2019. The regulations aimed to measure program quality by debt-to-earnings rates, with programs failing to meet standards becoming ineligible for Title IV participation. Under the Higher Education Act, programs subject to gainful employment rules must meet specific criteria to maintain Title IV eligibility, including minimum D/E rates and third-party standards. Failure to meet these standards can result in ineligibility for Title IV participation. The Act does not define performance measures for Title IV programs but requires reporting on enrollment. The Higher Education Act requires Title IV participating institutions to report information on enrollment, certificates, degrees conferred, student charges, and other relevant data. Data on non-degree instructional for-credit programs is collected annually by the Department of Education. In the academic year 2017-2018, out of 6,418 Title IV-participating institutions, 4,618 offered non-degree for-credit programs, with private for-profit institutions offering approximately half of these programs. In AY2017-2018, 4,618 out of 6,418 Title IV-participating IHEs offered non-degree for-credit programs. Private for-profit IHEs offered half of these programs, while public IHEs awarded over two-thirds of non-degree for-credit credentials. In AY2015-2016, 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs, receiving $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. About 10% of undergraduates with Direct Loans were in certificate programs. Support for non-degree programs is limited to specific criteria at Title IV-participating IHEs. Support for non-degree programs is limited to specific criteria at Title IV-participating IHEs, with restrictions on aid for individuals without a high school diploma, Pell Grant eligibility for those with a bachelor's degree, and Direct Loan enrollment less than half-time. Non-degree program quality is assessed through state authorizers and accreditors. Non-degree program quality is primarily assessed through the program integrity triad, with state authorizers and accreditors having flexibility in determining criteria. Variation among state authorization requirements complicates assessing institutional experiences. Researchers point to challenges in evaluating non-degree programs due to state history, resources, and priorities affecting their role. Researchers have identified potential weaknesses in state authorization requirements for non-degree programs, including concerns about oversight, input requirements hindering innovation, lengthy authorization processes, conflicts across state laws, and challenges in assessing institutional experiences. The accreditation system has strengths and weaknesses related to program quality. Strengths include tailored peer reviews by institutional accreditors and programmatic accreditation aligned with specific fields. Weaknesses identified by the GAO include conflicting interests, insufficient resources, and experts' limitations. Programmatic accreditation is aligned with specific fields or programs. Weaknesses identified by GAO include conflicting interests, insufficient resources, and experts' limitations. Education tax benefits offset some higher education costs for eligible taxpayers, providing advantages to upper middle-income taxpayers when they file their federal income tax return. Education tax benefits provide advantages to upper middle-income taxpayers by allowing them to claim tax benefits when filing their federal income tax return, after paying for education expenses. These benefits reduce federal revenues and are not subject to annual appropriations. Some benefits are available to individuals in non-degree programs. Education tax benefits are a form of \"spending through the tax code\" that reduce federal revenues. Eligible individuals can receive benefits when filing their federal income tax return. These benefits may lead to overconsumption of education or subsidize education that would have occurred anyway. Taxpayers in non-degree programs may qualify for the Lifetime Learning Credit, a nonrefundable tax credit for 20% of the first $10,000 in qualifying expenses. The Lifetime Learning Credit is a nonrefundable tax credit for 20% of the first $10,000 in qualifying expenses. Employer Provided Educational Assistance excludes eligible costs from taxable income. 529 accounts help save for educational expenses. These benefits can be used for non-degree programs at Title IV-eligible IHEs. Qualified education expenses for the credit include tuition and related expenses. Qualified education expenses for the Lifetime Learning Credit include tuition and related expenses required for enrollment in a course at a Title IV-eligible IHE. Related expenses such as books, supplies, and equipment are also considered, but living expenses are not. These expenses can be offset by tax-free educational assistance, including employer-provided assistance and 529 account distributions. Employer-provided educational assistance can cover tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for both degree and non-degree programs. According to IRS Publication 970, employer-provided educational assistance can be used for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for courses that improve or develop skills, regardless of whether they are work-related or part of a degree program. The assistance can cover up to $5,250 of tuition costs per employee without being included in their wage income. Additionally, tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and equipment. The institution providing the program does not have to be a Title IV-eligible IHE. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses, including tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and equipment. Expenses do not need to be associated with a degree program. To qualify for tax benefits, participants must file a federal income tax return or be claimed as a dependent or spouse. Taxpayers can claim the credit for education expenses paid for themselves, spouses, or dependent children. Taxpayers can claim the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) for qualified education expenses paid for themselves, spouses, or dependent children. The LLC is 20% of the first $10,000 of expenses and can only be used if the employer offers an educational assistance program. Withdrawals from a 529 account for education expenses are tax-free. Individuals can apply for the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) when filing their federal income tax return after incurring qualified educational expenses. The LLC is calculated as 20% of the first $10,000 of expenses, with a maximum credit of $2,000 per taxpayer. The credit phases out for taxpayers with income between $58,000 and $68,000 ($116,000 and $136,000 for married joint filers) in 2019. The LLC is nonrefundable, meaning it cannot exceed the taxpayer's federal income tax liability. Employers can provide up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance per year under an employer-sponsored program. Taxpayers can withdraw funds from their 529 accounts tax-free for qualifying education expenses. They may transfer the account balance to certain relatives tax-free. The IRS relies on taxpayers, employers, and states for compliance. Taxpayers can establish 529 plans for children and transfer account balances to certain relatives tax-free. The IRS relies on taxpayers, employers, and states for compliance with education tax credits. Taxpayers apply for the LLC by filing Form 1040 and Form 8863. They do not need to specify the course of study when applying for the LLC. Employer's plans must qualify as educational assistance programs. When applying for the LLC on their federal income tax return, individuals need to list their enrolled course or program of study. An employer's educational assistance program must be in written form and meet specific requirements. The program cannot favor certain employees and must provide reasonable notice to eligible participants. Employees eligible for a 529 plan must receive reasonable notice of its terms. States typically sponsor 529 plans, allowing individuals to establish accounts for beneficiaries. Withdrawals from a 529 plan may be subject to taxation if used for non-eligible expenses. Taxpayers are not required to document how withdrawals are spent unless audited. Taxpayers who use 529 plan withdrawals for non-eligible expenses may face taxation. Documentation of how withdrawals are spent is not required unless audited. The IRS does not have rules on the quality of education programs for tax benefits. Limited IRS data shows that in 2015, 2.5 million taxpayers claimed $2.1 billion of the LLC, with an average credit of $830 per taxpayer. Data on education tax benefits is limited, with approximately 2.5 million taxpayers claiming $2.1 billion of the LLC in 2015. The average credit per taxpayer was $830, with half of all LLC dollars claimed by taxpayers with AGI between $50,000 and $200,000. Taxpayers with AGI below $15,000 or over $200,000 generally did not claim the LLC. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in improving job skills. Additionally, there is no available data on the exclusion of employer-provided educational assistance and its impact on non-degree program enrollment or job skills improvement for non-degree candidates. Data on education tax benefits is limited, with approximately 2.5 million taxpayers claiming $2.1 billion of the LLC in 2015. The average credit per taxpayer was $830, with half of all LLC dollars claimed by taxpayers with AGI between $50,000 and $200,000. Taxpayers with AGI below $15,000 or over $200,000 generally did not claim the LLC. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in improving job skills. Research on employer-provided educational assistance and 529 plans is also lacking, with no data available on their impact on non-degree program enrollment or job skills improvement for non-degree candidates. The research highlights limitations of education tax benefits for non-degree programs, such as delays in receiving benefits, confusion over eligibility, and exclusion of low-income taxpayers. Veterans education programs were originally intended to help former servicemembers transition to civilian life. The tax benefits discussed in this report mainly benefit taxpayers with income tax liabilities, excluding many low-income taxpayers. Veterans education programs like the GI Bills aim to help former servicemembers transition to civilian life by providing financial assistance. The VET TEC program incentivizes training providers for program completion and employment, offering an alternative approach to traditional GI Bill benefits. VET TEC and GI Bills provide financial assistance to students based on qualifying service in the uniformed services. Administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, GI Bills are funded with mandatory spending, while VET TEC is funded by a limited allocation from GI Bill appropriations. The Post-9/11 GI Bill has been the primary program since FY2013, representing over 80% of total participation and spending. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is the main program since FY2013, representing over 80% of total participation and spending. It supports education through degree pursuit and training programs at various establishments. Eligible programs include credit and noncredit instructional programs, OJT, apprenticeships, and courses leading to specific objectives. VET TEC benefits are available for non-degree high-technology programs at training providers with a Program Participation Agreement with the VA. The programs focus on computer programming, software, media application, data processing, and information science. Training providers must meet criteria such as not offering degrees and not exceeding annual VA caps for tuition and fees.

Veterans enrolled in educational programs at private institutions may receive up to $24,476.79 for tuition and fees, monthly housing allowance ranging from $800 to $4,300, and up to $1,000 for books and supplies. Those pursuing OJT or apprenticeships receive a decreasing housing allowance to offset wage increases. VET TEC provides payments to veterans and training providers, including a monthly housing allowance similar to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition costs and pays 25% upon enrollment. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition costs and pays 25% upon enrollment, 25% upon program completion, and 50% upon employment of the completer in a suitable field. Training providers cannot charge tuition and fees to the VET TEC participant directly. Potential participants apply to the VA to ensure eligibility for either the Post-9/11 GI Bill or VET TEC. Eligible individuals may then enroll in approved programs, with certifications made at regular intervals. Educational institutions certify enrollment and pursuit of eligible individuals to the VA. The VA verifies eligibility, calculates payments, and oversees program quality for GI Bill-approved programs through state approving agencies. VET TEC program quality is based on participant employment outcomes. The VA and SAAs share responsibility for ongoing oversight of approved programs. The VA relies on SAAs for initial approval and oversight of education programs. Quality standards are established for programs to ensure proper administration of GI Bill benefits. Four main standards include program objective, independent study restrictions, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. The VA relies on SAAs for initial approval and oversight of education programs, with quality standards like program objective, independent study restrictions, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. Independent study programs must be accredited and lead to a degree or certificate meeting specific criteria. The 85-15 rule limits institutional aid coverage for students, and contracted courses must be approved for GI Bill purposes. Additional requirements vary based on program type, such as non-degree programs needing adequate facilities and instructors. Non-degree programs approved for GI Bill purposes must meet specific standards, including adequate facilities, qualified instructors, and recognized curricula. Programs preparing individuals for licensure or certification must also meet relevant instructional requirements. Programs lacking approval from other government agencies must meet additional criteria. Approved non-degree programs include FAA flight training, DOL Registered Apprenticeships, and state-approved programs. The VA determines eligibility for VET TEC programs, which must meet specific standards and criteria. Payment is structured to ensure program quality and value, reimbursing providers upon completion and meaningful employment within 180 days. The VET TEC program ensures quality and value by reimbursing training providers for program completion and meaningful employment within 180 days. Providers must meet licensing requirements and the 85-15 rule. The program performance is measured by admittance rate and job outcomes. The VET TEC program measures performance through program admittance rate, job placement and retention rates, employment duration in the field of study, median annual salary, and transfer rates. While most GI Bill participants pursue degrees, a small percentage pursue educational certificates. In FY2018, approximately 0.4% of Post-9/11 GI Bill participants were pursuing OJT or an apprenticeship at approved educational institutions. Over 18,000 school locations and 9,000 OJT/apprenticeship locations did not award degrees. The most popular certificates completed by Post-9/11 GI Bill participants were in welding, information technology, HVAC, healthcare. In AY2018-2019, Post-9/11 GI Bill participants completed popular certificates in welding, information technology, HVAC, healthcare, and gunsmithing. Program eligibility is limited to uniformed services members and their family. Oversight of the program may be compromised due to limited funding and oversight actions. In 2018, reports highlighted limitations in oversight of SAA funding and institution audits. The SNAP program, administered by the Department of Agriculture, provides food benefits to low-income households. States receive SNAP Employment & Training funding for education services. The federal government provides SNAP Employment & Training funding to states for education services, established by Congress in 1987. States have the option to make their SNAP E&T programs mandatory or voluntary for nondisabled adults ages 18 to 59. The majority of state agencies operate voluntary SNAP E&T programs for nondisabled adults aged 18 to 59. These programs can include job search programs, workfare, education, and job training services. SNAP E&T funding includes various streams of mandatory funding, with nearly $124 million available without a state match. An open-ended federal match is available for states' administrative expenses, dependent care, and transportation. Since October 2015, USDA-FNS and Seattle Jobs Initiative have been operating SNAP to Skills, a capacity-building project aimed at providing states with technical assistance to enhance SNAP E&T programs. SNAP to Skills is a capacity-building project aimed at enhancing SNAP E&T programs by providing technical assistance to states. It offers tools, resources, and a learning academy to improve job-driven programs for SNAP recipients. Integration between WIOA Title I program and SNAP E&T is required by statutory provisions, with services delivered through the statewide workforce development system. SNAP staff are experienced in addressing the unique challenges faced by E&T recipients. Services and programs available vary by state. SNAP E&T recipients can receive services through WIOA One-Stop centers, but SNAP staff are experienced in addressing their unique challenges like low basic skills, housing instability, and mental health issues. State programs vary, but SNAP E&T programs can offer educational activities to improve employability, including high school programs, literacy education, and English as a second language instruction. Only educational components directly enhancing employability are allowed. SNAP E&T education activities must directly enhance employability, with a focus on vocational training, basic education, work experience, and training. Some states fund non-degree programs for SNAP participants. Apprenticeships, subsidized employment, and unpaid internships are allowable. The program serves SNAP participants subject to work requirements. SNAP E&T provides work experience, training, apprenticeships, and internships for eligible participants. Household income must be below 130% of the federal poverty level to qualify for SNAP. General work requirements are in place for SNAP participation. Under current law, SNAP participants must meet work requirements and register for work. States have the option to set the threshold for eligibility at up to 200% of the federal poverty level. SNAP agencies or third-party partners assess participants to determine the most effective E&T programs for them. States can choose to make E&T mandatory for certain populations or subsets. The 2018 farm bill requires all states to provide case management services for SNAP participants, including comprehensive intake assessments and individualized service plans. Some individuals enrolled half-time or more in an IHE may be ineligible for SNAP, unless assigned through specified programs like WIOA Title I or SNAP E&T. SNAP E&T provides educational programs and funds associated costs, such as dependent care and transportation. Funding is administered by state agencies and contracted programs, often through third-party partnerships. USDA-FNS promotes third-party partnerships for SNAP E&T programs, where states collaborate with entities like community colleges. Partners contribute financially, and states reimburse them using federal funds. Pell Grant-eligible students must use the Pell Grant first for college expenses before utilizing E&T funds. Expenses covered by E&T must be reasonable and necessary. The E&T benefit is based on college expenses not covered by the Pell Grant and must be reasonable and necessary. Workforce partnerships were added to the program by the 2018 farm bill, including private employers, nonprofit organizations, and training providers. Each state designs its SNAP E&T program within federal rules and regulations, subject to USDA-FNS approval. State programs vary in capacity and must explore other funding sources before using E&T funds for tuition. The SNAP E&T program is designed by each state within federal rules and regulations, with approval from USDA-FNS. State programs vary in capacity and services offered, and must consult with the state workforce development board or private employers for implementation. Participants learn about the programs through the SNAP state agency or partner referrals, with states monitoring and assessing program quality. USDA-FNS provides technical assistance to help states in this process. The 2014 farm bill required USDA to establish performance indicators for the SNAP E&T program. USDA has finalized the regulation for reporting, with national measures including unsubsidized employment, median wages, and completion of training components. USDA has not yet published a compilation of the reports. The SNAP E&T program includes measures such as median quarterly wages after completion, unsubsidized employment, and completion of educational components. Most participants receive services other than education. In FY2016, 38 state agencies included an education component, serving around 70,000 participants. Some states served fewer than 100 participants, while others served nearly 100,000. Limitations include a higher focus on job search over education, with fewer than 10% participating in educational components. The SNAP E&T program serves varying numbers of participants by state, with some serving fewer than 100 and others nearly 100,000. Limitations include a focus on job search over education, with less than 10% participating in educational components. Future evaluations may provide more information on program effectiveness and outcomes. Wages earned through SNAP E&T may increase household income, potentially affecting eligibility for SNAP and SNAP E&T. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant aims to provide assistance to needy families with children, promote work and marriage, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and support two-parent families. States have flexibility in how they use TANF funds to achieve these goals. TANF is a broad-purpose block grant administered by HHS, not specifically for education and training. It is known for providing monthly assistance to needy families. TANF is a mandatory spending program that provides monthly assistance to needy families with children. States have flexibility in how they use TANF funds, which can also support career pathways and education programs. Some states use TANF funds to support career pathways, providing education programs and services for students and workers to advance in their chosen careers. Coordinators paid with TANF funds work at community colleges, serving as case managers and recruiting students. TANF has no restrictions on eligible training programs, but limits on how much training can count towards performance measures. Funds must benefit low-income families with children. TANF funds are used for vocational education training for low-income families with children. State sets financial eligibility rules with significant variation. Many recipients have low education levels. TANF helps fund state assistance programs for needy families with children. TANF funds state assistance programs for needy families with children, allowing states to determine eligibility rules and benefit amounts. Adult recipients must participate in required activities like training and education, with benefits reduced or ended for non-compliance. TANF provides funding for benefits and support services other than cash assistance, including advising, career planning, and employment services. States decide which participants receive these services, and some may refer recipients to WIOA One Stop Centers for education or employment. There are no federal rules on the quality of training and education programs, but states may establish their own. The TANF program requires states to meet a minimum work participation rate, with rules limiting training and education activities. States can use strategies like reducing cash assistance caseload to meet this requirement. The TANF program requires states to meet a minimum work participation rate, with rules limiting training and education activities. States may use strategies like reducing cash assistance caseload to meet this requirement. TANF recipients face limitations in pursuing non-degree programs due to child care and educational preparation constraints. The cash assistance caseload is significantly disadvantaged in terms of education, with a 12-month lifetime limit on vocational educational training. The cash assistance caseload faces limitations in pursuing non-degree programs due to restrictions on vocational educational training. Income eligibility threshold may prevent individuals in apprenticeship programs from receiving assistance. Quality of training and education programs is uncertain."
