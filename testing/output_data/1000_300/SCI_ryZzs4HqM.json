Various forecasting methods for renewable generation and electric load prediction are classified into five categories. Various forecasting methods for renewable generation and electric load prediction can be classified into five categories: Regressive methods like Autoregressive (AR), ARIMA, and exponential smoothing models, Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and fuzzy logic systems, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), Sensing methods, and Hybrid models like neuro-fuzzy systems and ANN with satellite-derived cloud indices. NWP models are useful for forecasting solar radiation in areas without ground data but have limitations in predicting cloud positions accurately. NWP models are based on physical laws of motion and thermodynamics to forecast solar radiation where ground data is unavailable. However, they have limitations in predicting cloud positions accurately due to coarse spatial resolution and lack of micro-scale physics. Regional NWP models are downscaled for improved site-specific forecasts, but still have temporal-resolution limitations. Satellite-based irradiance measurement is useful for areas without ground-based data. It analyzes air mass evolution using satellite images, but has limitations in determining accurate radiance values under different sky conditions. Satellite sensing for solar irradiance forecasting has limitations in accurately determining radiance values under different sky conditions. Algorithms used are empirical or statistical, requiring ground-based solar data for accuracy. Short-term solar forecasting research has shifted towards timeseries analysis and AI techniques. Statistical models and AI techniques are being used for short-term solar forecasting research due to limitations in NWP and sensing models. Statistical techniques include linear stationary models, nonlinear stationary models, and linear nonstationary models. These techniques offer advantages over NWP and sensing methods but are limited by assumptions of normality, linearity, and variable independence. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can capture complex non-linear behaviors in higher dimensional settings. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are powerful in modeling complex non-linear relationships between exogenous variables like humidity, temperature, pressure, and Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) for solar forecasting. ANN with multiple hidden layers, known as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), have shown effectiveness in various fields due to advancements in computational capabilities. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have not been explored for solar forecasting, unlike feedforward neural networks. RNNs capture sequence dynamics using feedback connections and exhibit dynamic temporal behavior by processing arbitrary sequences with internal memory. This can be utilized in predicting irradiance for the next time step. Recent advances in parallelism, network architectures, optimization techniques, and GPUs have enabled successful large-scale learning with RNNs for solar forecasting. Traditional limitations have been overcome, and previous methods focused on specific time horizons with no single model performing well for multi-time-horizon forecasting. The proposed approach in this paper aims to address these challenges by focusing on instantaneous forecasts. The paper proposes two approaches using RNNs for solar forecasting, addressing the limitations of traditional methods. The first approach involves training a single algorithm to output solar forecasts for different time horizons. The second approach utilizes a unified architecture to predict solar irradiance values for multiple time horizons. This method can provide real-time forecasts based on live measured data, offering value for industrial applications. The RNN method enables real-time multi-time-horizon forecasting for industrial applications with high renewable energy penetration. It utilizes directed edges spanning adjacent time steps to incorporate past information in sequential data. The input sequence consists of real-valued vectors, and the target can be a sequence or a single value. The input to an RNN is a sequence with target sequences, denoted by (x BID0 , x BID1 ,...x (T) ) and (y BID0 , y BID1 ,...y (T) ) respectively. The RNN input has three dimensions: Mini-batch Size, Number of columns in the vector per time-step, and Number of time-steps. The number of time-steps differentiates RNN by unfolding the input vector over time. The RNN input unfolds the input vector over time, with neurons in each layer receiving input from the previous layer. The net input to a neuron in the next layer is the weighted sum of the previous neuron's output plus a bias term. The proposed architecture uses Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) as the activation function. The proposed RNN architecture utilizes Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) as the activation function and unfolds the input over time. It employs backpropagation through time (BPTT) for training and stochastic gradient descent for weight updates to minimize Mean Squared Loss (MSE). The RMSE is calculated for benchmarking, aiming to learn complex relationships within the data.

The algorithm and unified architecture in this paper were trained and tested on data from NOAA's SURFRAD BID30 sites. Input features include various solar and atmospheric parameters. Global downwelling solar measurements are also considered. Global downwelling solar measurements best represent the Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at SURFRAD sites, validated through exploratory data analysis. Clear Sky GHI and global downwelling solar show a positive correlation, with the Bird model used to calculate clear sky GHI. The clear sky index is introduced as the ratio between observed and theoretical maximum GHI at a given time. The algorithm uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the difference between target and output values in a neural network during training. Root Mean Squared Error is later calculated for benchmarking. The Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm is divided into three main blocks, with clear sky global horizontal irradiance values imported for site-specific data. The Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm involves importing site-specific data and clear sky global horizontal irradiance values, merging them, creating the clear sky index parameter, handling missing values, conducting exploratory data analysis, and defining the Recurrent Neural Network model with specified architectural parameters. The Recurrent Neural Network model is defined with architectural parameters such as input dimension, hidden dimension, layer dimension, and output dimension. The model is trained and tested on the dataset from the year 2010 and 2011 from SURFRAD observations sites in Boulder, CO. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is denormalized to calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). If RMSE is not satisfactory, hyperparameters are tuned and the model is retrained until a satisfactory RMSE is achieved. The algorithm is trained on data from SURFRAD observation sites in various locations. Two methods are proposed for predicting different time horizons using RNN architecture. The RMSE values in TAB1 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models. The proposed RNN architecture predicts for 1-hour, 2-hour, 3-hour, and 4-hour time horizons independently at seven SURFRAD sites. The RMSE values show lower errors compared to other machine learning algorithms. This method involves developing one model per site for all four time horizons simultaneously, a unique approach not seen in existing literature. The proposed method involves developing a model per SURFRAD site for all four time horizons simultaneously, achieving significantly lower RMSE values across short-term forecasting time horizons. This multi-time-horizon prediction capability makes the method relevant for industry applications.
