    "content": "The \"Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999\" includes sections on short title, findings and purposes, definitions, market loss assistance, payment amounts, relationship to other payments, emergency requirements, mandatory livestock market reporting, and regulations. Congress finds that recent changes in the marketing relationships between swine producers and meat packers have negatively impacted swine prices. The concentration of the meat packing industry and the increase in live swine imports have reduced slaughter capacity and affected swine prices in the United States. Additionally, a swine market price crisis occurred from October 1, 1998, to December 31, 1998, based on three key facts. During the swine market price crisis in the United States from October to December 1998, key factors included a 10% increase in swine available for slaughter, an 8% decrease in packer slaughter capacity compared to the previous year, and a 37% rise in Canadian swine imports. The fourth quarter of 1998 saw the lowest live swine prices in the spot market for the 20th century, with a 37% drop from 1932. Swine producers experienced a $2.6 billion reduction in equity capital investment value in 1998. In 1998, swine producers in the United States faced a significant decrease in live swine prices, reaching the lowest levels in the 20th century. This led to a $2.6 billion reduction in equity capital investment value for swine producers. Despite this, consumption of pork and pork products increased by seven percent, with swine producers receiving less than 30 percent of the consumer dollar spent on these products for the first time on record. The Act aims to compensate swine producers for losses incurred in 1998 due to adverse economic factors and lack of government action on foreign trade opportunities. Despite stable retail prices, pork consumption increased by seven percent in 1998, the only meat protein to see a per capita consumption rise.

Eligibility requires maintaining a swine operation and marketing swine for slaughter. Certain producers, like those affiliated with publicly owned packers, are ineligible for assistance under this Act. The Secretary shall limit assistance to eligible swine producers through an application process, requiring submission of necessary information for eligibility determination. SEC. 5. PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND PAYMENT LIMITATIONS. Assistance under this Act will be distributed fairly and equitably to swine producers who have incurred losses. The maximum payment per slaughter-weight swine is $25.00, and for feeder pigs, it is $9.00 as per regulations issued by the Secretary. Payments to swine producers will be calculated based on the crisis period. Payments to swine operation producers under this Act will be calculated based on the crisis period. The calculation involves multiplying the number of eligible swine marketed and slaughtered by $25.00, adding the number of eligible feeder pigs marketed by $9.00, and deducting payments received in another program. Payment limitations state that payments may not exceed $50,000 per swine operation for a swine producer. SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PAYMENTS. Assistance provided under this Act is in addition to assistance, payments, and loans obtained under various agricultural programs for the 1998 crop year. Payments under the Small Hog Operation Program announced on January 8, 1999, using funds from the Act of August 24, 1935, shall be deducted from payments to swine producers under this Act. SEC. 7. Emergency Requirement; Use of Commodity Credit Corporation. Congress designates amounts in this Act as an emergency requirement.

The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 is amended to include mandatory livestock market reporting. In this section, definitions are provided for livestock, livestock product, and packer. Livestock includes cattle, sheep, and swine. Livestock product refers to products derived from livestock. A packer is defined as a person involved in buying livestock for slaughter, processing livestock products, or marketing them in commerce. The term 'prices, volume, and terms of sale' in the context of livestock products includes various pricing factors and contract details offered by packers. The Secretary of Agriculture is referred to as the 'Secretary'. Mandatory reporting requirements apply to packers estimated to be involved in a significant portion of livestock commerce. The Secretary requires packers involved in a significant portion of livestock commerce to report information on prices, volume, and terms of sale for domestic and imported livestock. The Secretary mandates packers to report information on prices, volume, and terms of sale for domestic and imported livestock. Packers must comply by reporting this information promptly, and failure to do so is considered unlawful. The Secretary requires packers to provide information on prices, volume, and terms of sale for livestock. Noncompliance is unlawful, and the Secretary can verify the accuracy of the information. If a packer violates the regulations, the Secretary can issue a cease and desist order and impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000.

Voluntary reporting by packers not under mandatory reporting is encouraged, and information received will be made available to the public. The Secretary will make information received from voluntary reporting by packers available to the public in a timely manner while ensuring confidentiality and protecting proprietary business information. The reporting requirement for packers will expire after three years. Section 416 of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 is repealed. SEC. 9. REGULATIONS. The Secretary and the Commodity Credit Corporation must issue regulations promptly after the enactment of the Act to implement it. The regulations will address misrepresentations, appeals, and entitlement to benefits without following certain provisions. The Secretary of Agriculture must issue regulations promptly to implement the Act, utilizing authority under title 5, United States Code, the Statement of Policy effective July 24, 1971, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Congressional review of agency rulemaking will be conducted using the authority provided under section 808(2) of title 5, United States Code."
