    "content": "The Act titled \"Helping Responsible Homeowners Act\" allows for affordable refinancing of mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Act defines key terms such as \"Director,\" \"Enterprise,\" and \"Qualified mortgage,\" which refers to a mortgage on a one to four-family dwelling occupied by the mortgagor as their principal residence. The Act defines key terms and qualifications for mortgages, including cooperative ownership housing, Federal National Mortgage Association or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation guarantees, and current payment status. A refinancing mortgage is defined as one used to pay off existing mortgage debt and closing costs. The mortgage for refinancing must cover the principal loan amount to pay off existing debt and closing costs. The property subject to the mortgage must be the same as the qualified mortgage being refinanced. The interest rate should be fair and not exceed 40 basis points above the required net yield for a prime conventional conforming fixed rate mortgage. The mortgage interest rate should not exceed 40 basis points above the required net yield for a prime conventional conforming fixed rate mortgage. Loan-to-value ratio restrictions are not applicable. Prepayment penalties and fees related to default must be waived. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation will refinance qualified mortgages on single-family housing with a term to maturity of not more than 40 years. The program includes the purchase and securitization of refinancing mortgages, with waivers for fees and penalties related to default. The program established by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation allows for refinancing mortgages, with a prohibition on additional fees beyond the standard guarantee fee. Resubordination of second liens is also addressed for servicers or creditors. Loan Mortgage Corporation will not charge any upfront fee beyond the standard guarantee fee for refinancing qualified mortgages. Servicers or creditors holding a second lien on a qualified mortgage must resubordinate the lien to allow for refinancing, or their new mortgages will be ineligible for purchase or guarantee. The requirement for enterprises to refinance qualified mortgages does not apply to requests made after one year from the enactment of the Act, with the Director having the discretion to extend this period. The Director may extend the program for refinancing qualified mortgages under this section beyond the 1-year period from the enactment of the Act. Regulations and guidance will be issued by the Director to implement the program. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation must ensure that mortgage servicers inform borrowers about the refinancing program. The Director will include updates on the program in the monthly Foreclosure Prevention & Refinance Report."
