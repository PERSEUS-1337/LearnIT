    "content": "The \"H-2A Improvement Act\" allows nonimmigrant status for dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders coming temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural labor. Special rules are established for aliens employed in these roles. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders, allowing for initial admission of 3 years with the possibility of extension for an additional 3 years. Special rules under Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act allow for initial admission of up to 3 years for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders, with the possibility of extension for an additional 3 years. Employers filing petitions for H-2A workers in these positions are exempt from showing that the positions are seasonal or temporary. Eligible aliens can adjust to lawful permanent resident status based on employment in these roles. An eligible alien with H-2A worker status as a dairy worker, sheepherder, or goat herder for at least 33 of the last 36 months can seek an immigrant visa under section 203(b)(3)(A)(iii). A petition for classification under this section can be filed by the employer or the alien themselves, and no labor certification is required. An eligible alien with H-2A worker status can seek an immigrant visa under section 203(b)(3)(A)(iii). The petition can be filed by the employer or the alien, and no labor certification is required. The filing of this petition or an adjustment of status application based on it shall not be a basis for denying other petitions or extensions of nonimmigrant status. The extension of stay for an eligible alien with H-2A worker status shall not be a basis for denying various requests related to H-2A workers, including petitions, extensions of nonimmigrant status, admission, visa requests, status modifications, or stay extensions in the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security will extend the stay of eligible H-2A workers with pending or approved petitions in 1-year increments until a final decision is made on their adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence. This provision does not prevent eligible aliens from seeking status adjustment through other legal means. The provision allows eligible H-2A workers to stay in the U.S. while their adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence is pending. It does not restrict them from seeking status adjustment through other legal avenues."
