    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose to rescind funding from an appropriations act by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve the rescission within 45 days, the funding must be made available for executive agencies. President George W. Bush advocated for a line-item veto to address excessive earmark projects. The President advocated for a line-item veto in his State of the Union address in 2006 to address excessive earmark projects. An Administration draft bill, the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, was sent to Congress, proposing expedited rescission where at least one house must vote on the proposals. Enhanced rescission, available under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, favored the President by creating a presumption in spending reductions identified in special presidential messages. Under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, the \"enhanced rescission\" altered the framework to favor the President, making spending reductions identified in special presidential messages permanently cancelled unless Congress enacts a disapproval bill. Expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in Congress to ensure immediate consideration of the President's rescission request. Congressional approval is still necessary, but fast-track procedures encourage an up-or-down vote on the proposal. The expedited rescission approach involves fast-track procedures in Congress to encourage an up-or-down vote on the President's spending reduction proposal. It is seen as transferring less power from Congress to the President compared to other approaches modifying the ICA framework. In the past, the House passed expedited rescission bills annually, with specific limitations on proposed rescissions. The expedited rescission approach in Congress allows for fast-track procedures to vote on the President's spending reduction proposal. In the 103rd Congress, H.R. 1578 passed by the House in 1993 had no limit on the amount that could be rescinded, allowing the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding. This bill also included provisions for expedited judicial review and detailed fast-track procedures for expedited consideration of a rescission's substitute. H.R. 1578 and H.R. 4600 in the 103rd Congress detailed fast-track procedures for expedited rescission measures, allowing submission of special rescission messages and proposing the repeal of targeted tax benefits within 20 days following enactment. H.R. 4600 in the 103rd Congress proposed expedited rescission measures, allowing the President to propose repealing targeted tax benefits within 20 days of enactment. Additionally, a draft expedited rescission bill titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 was introduced, which aimed to amend the Impoundment Control Act to grant the President new legislative line item veto authority. The Administration bill proposed to amend the Impoundment Control Act by inserting a new \"Part C -- Legislative Line Item Veto,\" granting the President authority to propose rescission of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, or targeted tax benefits in a special message to Congress. The President would have flexibility in submitting and packaging these messages, with no time constraints and the ability to include multiple rescissions in a single message. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act allows the President to propose rescissions of budget authority or direct spending in special messages to Congress. There are no time constraints, and multiple rescissions can be included in one message. Rescinded amounts must be used for deficit reduction, and committee allocations and spending caps must be adjusted accordingly within five days of enactment. Rescission requests from the President would be considered under fast-track procedures. Under the Legislative Line Item Veto Act, the President can propose rescissions of budget authority or direct spending in special messages to Congress. Rescission requests would be considered under fast-track procedures, with specific timelines for introduction, committee review, and final passage. Debate would be limited, and no amendments would be allowed on the approval bill. The LLIVA introduced new expedited procedural rules for the consideration of approval bills. It allows the President to withhold budget authority proposed for rescission or suspend the execution of direct spending for up to 180 days. These provisions are unique and supporters argue they provide temporary withholding capabilities. The LLIVA introduced new expedited procedural rules allowing the President to withhold funds proposed for rescission or suspend direct spending for 180 days. Supporters argue these provisions provide temporary withholding capabilities until Congress can act on a President's request. Critics view them as potentially abusive and unnecessary, suggesting a shorter timeframe for Congress to consider a special message would suffice. Supporters of the 180-day provision argue that it allows for temporary withholding of funds until Congress can act on a special message. Critics see it as potentially abusive and unnecessary, suggesting a shorter timeframe for congressional consideration would suffice. The bill does not prohibit the President from initiating multiple 180-day withholding periods. Supporters of the 180-day provision argue that it allows for temporary withholding of funds until Congress can act on a special message. The bill language permits the President to release the funds earlier if deemed necessary. The LLIVA states that its provisions are severable for judicial review purposes. The act would become effective upon signing and apply only to spending or tax provisions in bills enacted after its passage. Several other measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress. Several measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress, including the LLIVA proposal (H.R. 4890 / S. 2381) and an omnibus budget reform measure (H.R. 2290) allowing the President to propose rescissions of \"wasteful\" budget authority. The President could also suggest reducing discretionary spending limits under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The SLICE Act of 2006, introduced by Representative Mark Udall in the 109th Congress, aims to enable expedited rescission measures. It limits the President to one message per appropriations act, unless multiple subcommittees are involved. Mark Udall introduced the SLICE Act of 2006 in the 109th Congress, allowing the President to propose spending cuts through expedited procedures for appropriations acts and the Omnibus Transportation Authorization Act. The President can submit multiple messages for different subcommittees under this bill. Senator John Kerry introduced S. 2372, the Expedited Budget Item Veto Review Act of 2006, on March 6, 2006. This bill is similar to the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 and would allow the President to propose cancellations for discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits within three days of enactment. The President could propose cancellations for discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits within three days of enactment. Representative John Spratt introduced H.R. 5667, which includes a legislative line item veto provision similar to bills in the 1990s. H.R. 5667, introduced by a member of the House Budget Committee, includes a legislative line item veto allowing the President to propose cancellations of discretionary spending and limited tax benefits. The bill also includes expedited procedures for congressional consideration of the President's proposals, with limited opportunities for amendments. The House Budget Committee approved H.R. 4890, an expedited rescission proposal, with amendments. The bill was later approved by the House and introduced in the Senate as S. 3521, containing budget process reforms. The Stop Over Spending Act, introduced as S. 3521, includes a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act and other budget process reforms. The Senate Budget Committee approved the bill with amendments. A comparative overview of expedited rescission bills shows differences among versions, including provisions from the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-130) was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1998. Differences among versions of the Stop Over Spending Act include deadlines for special rescission messages and limits on the number of messages allowed. The House-approved version requires submission within 45 days of enactment, while the Senate version allows up to one year. The Senate Budget Committee limits the President to four special messages per year, while the House version allows five. The Stop Over Spending Act includes differences in deadlines for special rescission messages and limits on the number of messages allowed. The House version allows submission within 45 days of enactment, while the Senate version allows up to one year. The House version is more permissive in the total number of special messages, while the Senate bill is more lenient in the timing of their submissions. The House version allows the President to withhold funds for up to 45 days, with a 45-day extension possible. The House version of the Stop Over Spending Act allows the President to withhold funds for up to 45 days, with a 45-day extension possible. The House-passed version provides a 90-day total withholding period, while the Senate version limits withholding to 45 days. The House version includes a sunset termination date after six years, while the Senate version stipulates termination after four years. Both versions narrow the range of targeted tax benefits that may be canceled compared to the Administration's proposal. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 and S. 3521 aim to limit targeted tax benefits affecting specific groups of taxpayers, falling between the Administration's proposal and the House version. The Senate Budget Committee and 1996 act require the Joint Committee on Taxation to identify these benefits, while the House version requires the chairmen of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees to do so. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 and S. 3521 aims to limit targeted tax benefits by requiring identification of such provisions by specific committees. The House version also includes changes related to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 and S. 3521 would amend the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 by removing the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 and introducing new provisions for expedited rescissions. A manager's amendment by Representative Paul Ryan was adopted to address concerns raised by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee regarding the cancellation of funds from trust or special funds. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 and S. 3521 includes a manager's amendment by Representative Paul Ryan to address concerns raised by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee regarding the cancellation of funds from trust or special funds. The bill would prohibit the President from resubmitting rejected direct spending or targeted tax benefits, but allow resubmission of proposed cancellations if Congress fails to act. The bill on legislative line item veto would prevent the President from resubmitting rejected spending or tax benefits, but allow resubmission of cancellations if Congress fails to act. The proposed amendment aims to shorten the period for the President to suspend new spending or tax benefits. Features in the bill remain unchanged from the original version. Various expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress seek to ensure a vote on approval within 10 days. Various versions of expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress aim to ensure a vote on final passage of the approval bill within 10 days after its introduction. These bills have differed in scope over the years, with some focusing on proposed rescissions of discretionary budget authority. In the 109th Congress, expedited rescission bills have evolved in scope, with H.R. 4699 expanding possible cancellations to include certain transportation projects. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996, with its broad rescission powers, faced constitutional concerns and included provisions for expedited judicial review. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996, with its enhanced rescission framework, was considered to have possible constitutional flaws. The expedited rescission approach, especially for discretionary spending, is seen as constitutionally sound. The LLIVA includes a severability provision, ensuring that if one part is found unconstitutional, the rest of the act remains unaffected. This allows the President to submit special rescission messages for expedited consideration of discretionary budget authority or direct spending items. The President's authority to submit special rescission messages for expedited consideration of discretionary budget authority or direct spending items may continue if tax benefits are overturned. The Bush Administration is still involved in seeking enactment of the Line Item Veto Act in the 109th Congress. The President called on the Senate to pass the line item veto to target pork in spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline. The President is pushing for the item veto to target pork in spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline as part of budget process reform."
