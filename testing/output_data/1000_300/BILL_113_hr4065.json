In this section, definitions are provided for terms related to mobile devices, including 'account holder', 'commercial mobile data service', 'commercial mobile service', and 'mobile device'. The term 'commercial mobile service' is defined in section 332, and 'mobile device' refers to a personal electronic device that receives commercial mobile service or data. Providers must offer a function on mobile devices that allows the account holder to remotely delete all their information and render the device inoperable. The device can store account holder information and be rendered inoperable globally on any commercial mobile network. It can also prevent reactivation without authorization after being disabled or factory reset. The legislation prohibits manufacturing or importing mobile devices in the US unless they allow the provider to remotely disable the device if lost or stolen, prevent unauthorized factory resets, and reverse any unauthorized actions upon recovery by the account holder. The legislation requires mobile service providers to offer a function on devices that allows for remote disabling if lost or stolen. Exemptions may be granted for technology that achieves the same purpose. The Commission may exempt manufacturers and importers from the requirement to offer remote disabling on mobile devices if the device allows for technology achieving the same function. Waivers may also be granted for low-cost, voice-only mobile devices. The Commission may waive requirements for low-cost, voice-only mobile devices with limited data functions. Providers cannot charge fees for certain mobile services. Forfeiture penalties apply for non-compliance. The Commission may impose forfeiture penalties on individuals found to have violated certain sections of the Act. This penalty is in addition to any other penalties outlined in the Act. Manufacturers and providers of mobile services are not prohibited from taking additional actions to protect consumers. The section allows manufacturers and providers of mobile services to take actions to protect consumers from mobile device theft. It applies to mobile devices manufactured or imported for sale in the US after January 1, 2015. The Federal Communications Commission may grant compliance extensions to individuals or entities subject to requirements under section 343(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, allowing them more time to comply with the regulations."
