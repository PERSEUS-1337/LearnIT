The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires distribution of an employee's interest within 5 years of their death for a trust to be qualified, with exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries who can receive distributions over their life expectancy. If an eligible designated beneficiary receives distributions over their life expectancy, the portion of the interest will be treated as distributed on the date distributions begin, as per the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
