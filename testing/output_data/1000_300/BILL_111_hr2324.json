The Congress finds that approximately 5,200 gun shows are held annually in the US, attracting many attendees and firearms sellers. These shows provide easy access for criminals and prohibited persons to obtain firearms without background checks or traceable records. The term 'gun show' is defined as an event where 50 or more firearms are offered for sale, exchange, or transfer, with exceptions for private sales at an individual's residence and events with fewer than 100 firearms. The term 'gun show vendor' refers to a person who is not licensed under section 923 and exhibits, sells, offers for sale, transfers, or exchanges a firearm at a gun show, regardless of arrangements with the gun show operator. Gun shows with not more than 100 firearms can be conducted by private, not-for-profit organizations for hunting activities, attended only by members and their immediate families.

Licensees who violate criminal background check requirements may face increased penalties, including fines and imprisonment for up to 10 years. Additionally, the authority to hire personnel to inspect gun shows is granted. The Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives may hire additional personnel to inspect gun shows and submit biennial reports to Congress on firearm sales at these shows. Congress will receive biennial reports on firearm sales at gun shows, including details on how firearms are sold, if background checks are conducted, needed resources, and recommendations for improvements.
