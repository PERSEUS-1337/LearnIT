    "content": "The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of unemployed individuals in the civilian labor force age 16 and older. It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total labor force. The rate can fluctuate based on changes in both the number of unemployed workers and the size of the labor force. The unemployment rate can move up or down based on changes in the number of workers without jobs and the number of individuals in the labor force. The size of the labor force may decrease during a recession as discouraged workers stop looking for jobs. Conversely, the labor force may increase if people believe the economy is improving. The unemployment rate is a lagging economic indicator, improving only after other indicators signal recovery. The unemployment rate is a lagging economic indicator that typically improves after other indicators signal recovery. Firms are hesitant to hire new workers until they are confident in sustained economic growth, often increasing production by extending current employees' hours or having them work overtime. Job growth may not immediately follow signs of an economic turnaround. Labor market analysts rely on the Current Employment Statistics for job data. The Current Employment Statistics program is a key source of job data used by labor market analysts. The Business Cycle Dating Committee relies on changes in national output and employment trends to determine the official beginning and end of recessions. Job growth may not occur immediately upon the economy showing signs of a turnaround, as firms may opt for overtime work instead of hiring new employees. The Business Cycle Dating Committee uses GDP and employment trends to identify recessions. The U.S. has had 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity and duration. Unemployment rates typically peak after recessions end, with a few exceptions. The unemployment rate typically peaks after recessions end, with variations in timing. In some cases, it peaked shortly after the recession ended, while in others, it continued to rise well into the economic recovery period. Employment data also showed no steady job growth until some months after a recession's end. After the end of recessions, the unemployment rate typically peaks, with variations in timing. Employment data also showed no steady job growth until some months after a recession's end. Sustained job growth occurred within three to five months of the start of seven recoveries, but in some cases, like the July 1990-March 1991 and March-November 2001 recessions, steady job growth did not commence until much later. The delayed improvement in the labor market after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions led to jobless recoveries. While private sector employment started to rise in January 2010, fiscal issues in local governments slowed overall job growth."
