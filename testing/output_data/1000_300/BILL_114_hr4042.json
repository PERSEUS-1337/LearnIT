    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pre-K for USA Act.\" The Pre-K for USA Act finds that the United States ranks 25th in early learning enrollment, children in high-quality prekindergarten programs are more successful in their careers, every public dollar spent on prekindergarten programs returns $7, and children who attend prekindergarten are less likely to develop drug problems or commit felonies. Children who attended prekindergarten have lower chances of developing drug problems, committing felonies, or going to prison. They also tend to have higher GPAs, are more likely to attend a four-year college, but about 40% of school districts do not offer prekindergarten programs. Texas missed out on significant federal funding to expand prekindergarten programs due to budget cuts in education funding. In 2011, Texas cut $5.4 billion in education funding, including $200 million in grants for full-day prekindergarten programs. Local governments stepped in to fund these programs, highlighting the need for direct federal funding for prekindergarten programs. SEC. 3. PREKINDERGARTEN DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will award competitive grants to increase capacity for high-quality prekindergarten programs. Grants will be awarded for up to 3 years and applications must be submitted by Governors or chief executive officers of eligible entities. The Act requires submission of an application to the Secretary of Education, along with necessary information. States must consult with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care when developing the grant application. A matching requirement mandates that non-Federal funds equal to at least 20% of the grant amount must be contributed by the State or local government entity to be eligible for the grant. The government entity must provide non-Federal matching funds of at least 20% of the grant amount. This can be done through State funding, local funding, philanthropy, in-kind contributions, or a combination of resources.

The Secretary can waive or reduce matching funds for entities in financial hardship when applying for a grant.
