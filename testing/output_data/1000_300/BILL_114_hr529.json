FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\" Congress finds that the tax treatment of section 529 college savings plans was changed in 2001 to exempt qualified distributions from income tax. This favorable tax treatment was made permanent in 2006. 529 plans help middle-class families save for college, with 11.83 million accounts nationwide totaling $244.5 billion in assets. The average account size is $20,671. States sponsoring these plans benefit families seeking to offset rising college costs. The 529 college savings plans have 11.83 million accounts nationwide with $244.5 billion in assets. States encourage saving for college with low minimum contributions. The President's proposal to tax 529 plans may discourage their use, leading to more student debt. The Act aims to strengthen and modernize 529 college savings plans, making them more consumer-friendly and responsive to students' needs. It proposes that purchasing a computer should be an eligible expense under these plans to reduce the need for students to take on more debt. SEC. 2. Computer technology and equipment permanently allowed as a qualified higher education expense for Section 529 accounts. Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include computer equipment, software, and internet access as qualified higher education expenses. This amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2014. SEC. 3 eliminates distribution aggregation requirements in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendment applies to distributions after December 31, 2014. SEC. 4 allows for the recontribution of refunded amounts. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded amounts of qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program within 60 days of receiving the refund, not exceeding the refunded amount. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded amounts of qualified higher education expenses within 60 days, not exceeding the refunded amount. The effective date for this amendment is after December 31, 2014, with a transition rule for refunds received before the enactment of the Act. The House of Representatives passed the amendment on February 25, 2015, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
