Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year, caused by inadequately treated sewage containing harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites. This leads to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, with millions of Americans getting sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters. The economic impact of beach closures due to pathogen contamination is estimated at $1 billion. Millions of Americans get sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters, leading to economic losses estimated at $28 billion. Better monitoring and reporting of sewer overflows could prevent illnesses and save lives. Public health authorities are not always notified of sewer overflows that pose a threat to public health. The text chunk discusses the definitions related to the topic at hand. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define 'sanitary sewer overflow' as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. This definition includes overflows or releases of wastewater reaching waters of the United States, those that do not reach waters of the United States, and backups caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer other than a building lateral. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement measures for timely detection and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows that may impact human health. Publicly owned treatment works must notify the public of sanitary sewer overflows that could affect human health within 24 hours of awareness. They must also inform public health authorities and other affected entities immediately of any overflow that poses a significant health risk. Additionally, they must report to the Administrator or State within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 24 hours of awareness. A written report must be provided within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, and measures to mitigate the impact. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State, including details such as the amount of wastewater released, duration of each overflow, and location. Publicly owned treatment works are required to report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State, providing details such as the amount of wastewater released, duration of each overflow, location, responses taken to clean up, and actions to mitigate impacts and prevent future overflows. States must then annually summarize reported overflows to the Administrator. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAuthorizes $2,200,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2012 for the Act."
