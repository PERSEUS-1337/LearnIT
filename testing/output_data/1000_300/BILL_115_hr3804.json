    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\" and includes findings. The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use planning, leading to costly relief programs and disruptive security measures. It emphasizes the need for federal and state support in integrating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into urban development. Community safety can be enhanced by integrating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into land use planning and urban development, with support from the Federal Government and State governments. Disaster response and relief efforts in the United States incur significant costs to taxpayers, with a focus on post-disaster recovery rather than mitigation. Planning should prioritize prevention of property damage and human casualties by proactively incorporating mitigation strategies from various professional fields such as urban planning, architecture, and landscape architecture. Disaster planning should shift towards proactive measures to prevent and minimize the impact of disasters. Disaster planning should prioritize prevention and mitigation strategies by incorporating comprehensive planning supported by the Federal Government and States. Efforts are being made to update land use statutes to enable planning for safe communities with long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness. Coordination of State and regional investments is essential for effective disaster planning. Efforts are being made by many States to update and reform statutes for better planning that incorporates long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness. State and regional investments need to be coordinated with local plans, and comprehensive urban planning should consider various critical infrastructure elements for safe and economically viable communities. Local governments should integrate safety considerations into their planning efforts, with safe housing being a crucial component of community development. Safe housing is essential for community development and should be integrated into comprehensive planning efforts. Prevailing land use patterns can put people and structures at risk, especially in poorly regulated rural communities and small towns. The Federal and State governments should work together to address these issues and incorporate modern planning techniques to ensure a broad range of safe housing options for all community members. The Federal Government and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning and community development to enhance housing safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate hazards, including acts of terror, and improve emergency preparedness efforts. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to improve emergency preparedness efforts, citizen engagement, and multi-State regional planning. Eligibility requires demonstrating consistency with guidelines set by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary requires that State or local government land use planning legislation align with guidelines on citizen engagement, multi-jurisdictional cooperation, and multi-agency coordination to address natural hazards and terrorist threats. The implementation of land use plans involves cooperation between Federal, State, and local government agencies, with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines for action. It also aligns with State and local budget objectives and guides decisions on future infrastructure development. The comprehensive planning process encourages incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into State or locally adopted land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans to guide infrastructure development decisions. Grant funds received by a State or local government under subsection (a) shall be used for developing comprehensive land use plans, integrating natural hazard mitigation and security plan elements, and assessing critical public infrastructure. The grant funds received by a State or local government can be used for developing land use plans, integrating hazard mitigation and security elements, mapping public infrastructure, developing geographical information systems, acquiring scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, and implementing CPTED initiatives. The curr_chunk discusses various strategies for enhancing security and mitigating risks related to land use, including updating building codes, implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing vulnerability, and promoting interagency cooperation. The curr_chunk focuses on grants for enhancing security and mitigating risks related to land use, including identifying hazard areas and updating comprehensive plans, with a maximum grant amount of $1,125,000 and a federal share not exceeding 90 percent. Coordination efforts by the Secretary are also emphasized. The Secretary encourages coordination between Federal land management agencies and State or local planning directors for land use planning. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security conducts audits on grants to ensure funds are used as specified. In this section, grants must be used for specified purposes, and audit results influence future grant awards. Definitions include \"land use planning legislation\" as actions by governments to regulate land use. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a comprehensive plan and the term \"State\" in the context of land use planning. It outlines the purpose of comprehensive plans in regulating and managing land use, natural resources, development practices, and urban development. The term \"State\" is defined to include various entities such as states, territories, and tribal governments. The curr_chunk defines the term \"State\" to include states, territories, tribal governments, and Native Hawaiian organizations. It also defines the roles of State planning director and local planning director in regulating land use and development. The curr_chunk defines the term \"local planning director\" as a local official responsible for drafting and updating local comprehensive plans that regulate land use and development within the local government's jurisdiction. It also defines \"Tribal government\" as the government of an Indian Tribe. The curr_chunk focuses on safe communities planning research. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with various partners, will conduct research on land use and community planning to mitigate natural hazards and terrorism threats. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans, assessing the impact of security strategies on communities, and using mapping tools for risk assessment. A report to Congress is due within 2 years. The Secretary of Homeland Security will report to Congress on best practices in community security and safety planning, evaluating land use codes, software tools for safe development, and design standards for residential development. The Secretary of Homeland Security will evaluate codes, ordinances, security design standards, and design tools for safe residential development, as well as best practices for incorporating safety and security into infrastructure planning. Consideration will be given to regional, State, and local differences, with a focus on risk-reduction and cost evaluation. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2019 through 2023: $57,250,000 allocated, with $56,250,000 for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4."
