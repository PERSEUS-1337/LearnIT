    "content": "State-action value functions, such as Q-values, are essential in reinforcement learning algorithms like SARSA and Q-learning. A new concept of action value, defined by a Gaussian smoothed version of expected Q-value, is proposed. These smoothed Q-values still adhere to a Bellman equation, making them learnable from experience. Gradients of expected reward can be derived from the gradient and Hessian of the smoothed Q-value function, allowing for new algorithms to train a Gaussian policy directly from a learned Q-value approximator. This approach enables learning both mean and covariance during training, enhancing its effectiveness. The approach of training a Gaussian policy directly from a learned Q-value approximator allows for learning both mean and covariance during training, achieving strong results on continuous control benchmarks. This method combines policy evaluation and policy improvement processes in model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, utilizing different notions of Q-value to enhance performance. In this work, a new notion of action value is introduced: the smoothed action value function Q\u03c0. Unlike previous notions, which associate a value with a specific action at each state, the smoothed Q-value aims to maximize the current value function and has a considerable effect on the resulting algorithm. The smoothed action value function Q\u03c0 introduces a new notion of action value by associating a value with a distribution over actions rather than a specific action at each state. It is defined as the expected return of taking an action sampled from a normal distribution centered at a, then following actions sampled from the current policy. Smoothed Q-values possess properties that make them attractive for use in RL algorithms, including satisfying a single-step Bellman consistency. Smoothed Q-values have properties that make them useful in RL algorithms, such as satisfying single-step Bellman consistency. They can be used to train a function approximator and optimize Gaussian policies. An algorithm called Smoothie is proposed to train policies using derivatives of a trained smoothed Q-value function. Smoothie is an algorithm that trains policies using derivatives of a trained smoothed Q-value function, allowing for exploratory behavior with a non-deterministic Gaussian policy. It can easily incorporate proximal policy optimization techniques by adding a penalty on KL-divergence from a previous policy version. Smoothie can be adapted to include proximal policy optimization techniques by penalizing KL-divergence from a previous policy version, improving stability and performance. Results on continuous control benchmarks are competitive, especially for challenging tasks with limited data. The goal is to find an agent that maximizes cumulative discounted reward in a Markov decision process. The problem involves finding an agent in a stochastic black-box environment that maximizes cumulative discounted reward through a Markov decision process. The agent's behavior is modeled using a stochastic policy, and the optimization objective is expressed in terms of the expected action value function. The optimization objective in reinforcement learning involves maximizing cumulative discounted reward through a Markov decision process using a stochastic policy. The policy gradient theorem expresses the gradient of the objective function with respect to the policy parameters. Various algorithms balance variance and bias when estimating the action value function to improve accuracy. In this paper, new RL training methods are developed for multivariate Gaussian policies over continuous action spaces. The policies are parametrized by mean and covariance functions mapping the observed state to a Gaussian distribution. The focus is on balancing variance and bias in estimating Q \u03c0 (s, a) using function approximation. The paper introduces new RL training methods for Gaussian policies parametrized by mean and covariance functions. It discusses the deterministic policy gradient for Gaussian policies and the estimation of expected future return from a state. Under a deterministic policy, one can estimate the expected future return from a state. The policy gradient theorem for deterministic policies is characterized by optimizing the parameterized policy. The Bellman equation can be re-expressed in the limit of a small parameter. Value function approximators can be optimized by minimizing the Bellman error using interactions from the environment. Algorithms like DDPG alternate between improving the value function and policy. Off-policy distributions are used for better sample efficiency. In practice, algorithms like DDPG alternate between improving the value function and policy. To improve sample efficiency, off-policy distributions are used. This paper introduces smoothed action value functions, denoted Q \u03c0 (s, a), which provide an effective signal for optimizing Gaussian policy parameters. Smoothed Q-values do not assume the first action is fully specified, but rather only the mean of the distribution. The paper introduces smoothed Q-values for optimizing Gaussian policy parameters. Unlike ordinary Q-values, smoothed Q-values do not require the first action to be fully specified, only the mean of the distribution. This approach directly learns a function approximator for Q \u03c0 (s, a) instead of sampling to approximate expectations. The paper introduces smoothed Q-values for optimizing Gaussian policy parameters by directly learning a function approximator for Q \u03c0 (s, a) without the need for sampling to approximate expectations. It utilizes Bellman consistency and a one-step Bellman equation for smoothed Q-values, enabling direct optimization of Q \u03c0. The policy is parameterized in terms of mean and covariance parameters, with gradients derived from the policy gradient theorem. The Bellman equation (13) allows direct optimization of Q \u03c0 by parameterizing a Gaussian policy \u03c0 \u03b8,\u03c6 with mean and covariance parameters. The gradient of the objective w.r.t. mean parameters follows the policy gradient theorem. Estimating the derivative w.r.t. covariance parameters requires observing the second derivative of Q \u03c0 w.r.t. actions to compute the derivative w.r.t. \u03a3. The full derivative w.r.t. \u03c6 can be optimized using samples from N (a, \u03a3(s)). The full derivative w.r.t. \u03c6 can be optimized using samples from N (a, \u03a3(s)). Two ways to optimize Q \u03c0 w (s, a) are discussed, with the second approach using a single function approximator for Q \u03c0 w (s, a) for a simpler implementation. Sampling from a replay buffer with knowledge of the sampling probability q(\u00e3 | s) allows for optimization of Q \u03c0 w (s, a) by minimizing a weighted Bellman error. The text discusses optimizing Q \u03c0 w (s, a) by sampling from a replay buffer with knowledge of the sampling probability q(\u00e3 | s) and drawing a phantom action a \u223c N (\u00e3, \u03a3(s)). It is noted that tracking probabilities q(\u00e3 | s) is unnecessary, assuming a near-uniform distribution of actions conditioned on states in the replay buffer. The text discusses the optimization of Q \u03c0 w (s, a) by sampling from a replay buffer with knowledge of the sampling probability q(\u00e3 | s). It is noted that tracking probabilities q(\u00e3 | s) is unnecessary, assuming a near-uniform distribution of actions conditioned on states in the replay buffer. Stabilizing techniques for policy gradient algorithms in continuous control problems have been developed to mitigate instability. The text discusses stabilizing techniques for policy gradient algorithms in continuous control problems, such as constraining gradient steps within a trust region or adding a penalty on KL-divergence from a previous policy. These techniques have not been applicable to algorithms like DDPG, but the proposed formulation in the paper is easily amenable to trust region optimization. The optimization involves augmenting the objective with a penalty where the KL-divergence of two Gaussians can be expressed analytically. This approach follows a line of work using Q-value functions to learn a stable policy, similar to methods that exploit gradient information. The text discusses using Q-value functions to learn a stable policy, similar to methods that exploit gradient information. The proposed method is a generalization of deterministic policy gradient, with updates for training the Q-value approximator and policy mean. Stochastic Value Gradient (SVG) also trains stochastic policies but lacks an update for the covariance. The text introduces Stochastic Value Gradient (SVG) and Expected Policy Gradients (EPG) as methods for training stochastic policies with updates for the mean and covariance of a Gaussian policy. SVG lacks a covariance update, while EPG provides updates for both mean and covariance using gradients of an estimated Q-value function. Our approach directly estimates the integral of the smoothed Q-value function for updating the mean and covariance of a Gaussian policy, avoiding the need for approximations used in EPG. We rely on neural network function approximators instead of a quadratic Taylor expansion, simplifying the updates. Our training scheme for learning the covariance of the policy leverages Gaussian integrals. The paper proposes a novel training scheme for learning the covariance of a Gaussian policy by estimating the smoothed Q-value function using neural network function approximators. This approach differs from recent advances in distributional RL by focusing on the averaged return of a distribution of actions rather than the distribution of returns of a single action. The paper introduces a new RL algorithm called Smoothie, which utilizes insights to train a Gaussian policy. The algorithm maintains a parameterized Q function and uses gradient and Hessian updates to train the policy. The algorithm's pseudocode is provided in Algorithm 1 with specified input parameters and training steps. Smoothie is evaluated against DDPG on a simple synthetic task with a reward function of two Gaussians. The policy is initialized for study in a restricted setting. Smoothie and DDPG are compared in a simple synthetic task with a reward function of two Gaussians. Smoothie learns both the mean and variance, while DDPG only learns the mean. DDPG struggles to escape the local optimum due to its inability to progress far from the initial mean. Smoothie successfully solves the task by adjusting the policy mean and covariance during training. Initially, the covariance decreases and then increases before decreasing again as the policy mean approaches the global optimum. During training, the covariance \u03a3 \u03c6 is adjusted to suit the reward function's convexity. Smoothie successfully navigates the synthetic task, adjusting policy variance as needed. In standard continuous control benchmarks, feed forward neural networks are used for policy implementation. Smoothie adjusts its policy variance based on the reward function's convexity. Implementations in standard continuous control benchmarks utilize feed forward neural networks for policy and Q-values. The exploration for DDPG is determined by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Smoothie is competitive with DDPG and learns the optimal noise scale during training, showing significant advantages in final reward performance. Smoothie outperforms DDPG in terms of final reward performance, especially in challenging tasks like Hopper, Walker2d, and Humanoid. TRPO is not sample-efficient compared to Smoothie and DDPG. Hyperparameter search was conducted for both algorithms, with DDPG exploring noise scale and Smoothie adjusting the weight on KL-penalty. Despite DDPG's advantage in exploration through hyperparameter search, Smoothie learns the optimal noise scale during training. Smoothie outperforms DDPG in various tasks, showing significant improvements in Hopper, Walker2d, and Humanoid. It achieves the best published results with only millions of environment steps, while TRPO requires tens of millions for better performance. Smoothie's exploration is learned without supervision, while DDPG relies on hyperparameter search for noise scale. Smoothie's use of a learnable covariance and KL-penalty improves performance, especially on harder tasks. This addresses the instability in DDPG training and shows significant performance improvements in Hopper and Humanoid tasks. Our algorithm, Smoothie, addresses the instability in DDPG training by utilizing a proximal policy optimization method. It introduces a new Q-value function, Q \u03c0, which allows for successful learning of both mean and covariance during training. This approach leads to performance improvements, especially in tasks like Hopper and Humanoid, without sacrificing sample efficiency. Smoothie introduces a new Q-value function, Q \u03c0, which successfully learns both mean and covariance during training, improving performance in tasks like Hopper and Humanoid. The smoothed Q-values make the reward surface smoother and have a more direct relationship with the expected discounted return objective. Future work should explore these claims and apply the underlying motivations of Q \u03c0 to other policies. The specific identity for Gaussian integrals can be derived using standard matrix calculus. We utilize the fact that for symmetric A, \u2202 \u2202A ||v||. The equations are simplified by omitting s from \u03a3(s). The left-hand side of the equation is tackled by noting DISPLAYFORM2, leading to DISPLAYFORM3."
