    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Our Nation's Trade, Infrastructure, Mobility, and Efficiency Act of 2007\" or the \"ON TIME Act of 2007\". The growth in international trade, particularly containerized trade, is increasing pressure on the nation's transportation network and causing traffic congestion near major US-international gateways. From 2000 to 2005, international trade value and containerized trade shipments significantly rose. Existing and potential future trade agreements indicate a further increase in international trade and freight congestion. Existing and potential future trade agreements suggest a rise in international trade and freight congestion. The United States is part of the World Trade Organization and has 11 free trade agreements with negotiations ongoing with 4 countries and multi-lateral organizations. Traffic congestion in US cities is worsening, leading to wasted hours, extra fuel consumption, and a congestion cost of $78 billion annually. Over 200 freight bottlenecks result in $8 billion in economic losses each year. The transportation system in the US faces significant challenges, with over 200 freight bottlenecks causing $8 billion in economic losses annually. To maintain current conditions, government investments of $235 billion in 2006, $304 billion in 2015, and $472 billion in 2030 are required. To improve conditions for economic productivity, investments of $288 billion in 2006, $368 billion in 2015, and $561 billion in 2030 are needed. To benefit the Nation's economic productivity, government investments of $288 billion in 2006, $368 billion in 2015, and $561 billion in 2030 are necessary.
