The \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" defines terms like proportionality, purchaser, and outlines findings related to a timber harvesting contract in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. The \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" aims to ensure a steady supply of timber for a pulp mill in southeast Alaska, supporting job creation and economic stability in the region. The purchaser plans to enhance environmental practices at the mill, including transitioning to a chlorine-free bleaching process. The purchaser plans to invest $200,000,000 in environmental and operational improvements to its pulp mill in Ketchikan, Alaska.

The continuation of the contract is crucial for the city's economy, providing year-round employment.

The national interest is served by a policy that ensures proper stewardship of publicly owned assets in the Tongass National Forest, fair return for public timber, and a balance among multiple use interests to enhance forest health and economic growth in southeast Alaska. The contract for public timber in the Tongass National Forest is extended by 15 years from June 30, 2004, with modifications to ensure fair return and sustainable harvest. The contract includes a plan for volume, location, and schedule of timber sales.

The purchaser is required to construct roads in advance of the operating period to ensure orderly harvest. The Forest Service requires the purchaser to provide timber meeting mid-market criteria for the 5-year operating period. Appraisals and rates for timber increments must be designated by the contracting officer following national forest procedures. Rates should not disadvantage the purchaser compared to similar enterprises in the Pacific Northwest. The Forest Service will measure proportionality using specific criteria. The purchaser shall only pay for timber provided. The Forest Service will measure proportionality based on contiguous management areas, acres, and rotation age. The purchaser can convert or replace their pulp mill with a facility producing other value-added products. The unilateral termination clause is removed, and subsequent modifications are allowed in the contract. The contract allows for modifications by mutual agreement without further congressional approval, with changes taking effect 45 days after enactment. The contracting officer must update the contract text to reflect the modifications. The contracting officer must modify the contract text to reflect changes made by subsection (c) and implement the modified contract. Timber volume under the contract will continue as modified by subsection (c) with additional volume to meet the requirement of 192,500,000 board feet per year."
