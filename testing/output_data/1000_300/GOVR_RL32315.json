Conflict arises between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on public lands. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands, reflecting Energy Task Force recommendations. Oil and gas development practices have sparked debate in Congress since the early years of the industry, with concerns about abuse of the Mining Law of 1872 leading to wasteful use of public lands. President Taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California from availability under the Mining Law in 1909. President Taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California from availability under the Mining Law of 1872 in 1909. This led to the Pickett Act of 1910, which recognized executive branch authority for public land withdrawals. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process, placing it under a leasing system that has generated billions in revenues for the federal government. Split-estate situations arise when minerals are owned by the federal government under privately held lands. The federal government has raised billions of dollars in revenues from royalties, rents, and bonus bids through a leasing system for minerals. Split-estate situations occur when minerals are owned by the federal government under privately held lands. Specific policies and procedures must be followed by mineral estate holders to develop minerals, with the mineral estate being dominant over the surface use. Oil and gas lessees must meet certain conditions such as obtaining surface agreements or consent from private surface owners. Environmentalists and ranchers have expressed concerns about the impact of oil and gas development on public lands, citing inadequate environmental protection under the Mining Law of 1872 and Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Development supporters argue that current environmental laws regulate development effectively. Wyoming and Montana have a high percentage of split-estate lands, with specific conditions required for mineral estate holders to develop minerals, including obtaining surface agreements or consent from private surface owners. Development supporters argue that current environmental laws regulate oil and gas development on public lands effectively, citing compliance with NEPA, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and other regulations. They complain about delays in drilling due to environmental reviews. The proposed energy bill addresses industry concerns over increasing domestic oil and gas production. The proposed conference report on a comprehensive energy bill (H.R. 6) and S. 2095 aims to expedite permitting on public lands for oil and gas development. Title III of the bill would establish a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination to address industry concerns. Environmentalists argue that these provisions could harm the environment and limit other land uses. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is awaiting action after a cloture motion failed to pass. The conference report on the energy bill has been approved by the House but not the Senate due to a failed cloture motion. It provides an overview of the oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands, including permitting, production, and reserves. The report discusses the contribution of onshore oil and gas to U.S. energy demand and estimates of reserves in restricted areas. An Appendix gives historical background on land withdrawals from mineral development and the role of the Bureau of Land Management in oil and gas development. The leasing of onshore federal public lands for oil and gas development is based on Resource Management Plans developed by the Bureau of Land Management. Tracts of public land with oil and gas potential are offered for competitive leasing each quarter, with a drilling permit required for each well. In FY2002, 1,765 new oil and gas leases were issued on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres. Industry has raised concerns about the lengthy process. In FY2002, the federal government issued 1,765 new oil and gas leases on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres. The Bureau of Land Management must consider environmental impacts during land-use planning when Resource Management Plans are developed and implemented. RMPs cover large areas and reflect diverse uses such as timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. Resource Management Plans (RMPs) cover large areas, reflecting diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. The plans weigh the impacts of various uses early in the process to ensure equitable consideration. RMPs must be consistent with environmental regulations and involve meaningful public participation. The Bureau of Land Management determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing through the land-use planning process. Public lands available for lease are offered to the highest responsible qualified bidder through quarterly auctions held by the BLM. The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 requires public lands to be offered for lease through competitive bidding to ensure a fair market value return to the federal government. If no bids meet the minimum acceptable bid of $2/acre, leases are offered noncompetitively. Noncompetitive leasing is available for two years, with a nonrefundable application fee of at least $75. Simultaneous noncompetitive lease applications are prioritized through a lottery system. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM for exploration excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. Once a lease is obtained, the lessee has exclusive rights for further exploration, development, and production. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved after obtaining a lease. After obtaining a lease, the lessee has exclusive rights for exploration, development, and production. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved, including a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. The APD is posted for review for 30 days before approval by the managing agency. The surface use plan for an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) should include details on drillpad location, construction, containment, waste disposal, and reclamation. The APD is reviewed for 30 days before consultation with the surface managing agency and a decision is made within 35 days. Despite the 35-day requirement, a study found delays in APD approval, with an average of 137 days in 2002. The Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS) found that in 2002, it took an average of 137 days to approve an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD), up from 84 days in 2001. Delays in drilling permits were attributed to the need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) due to increased natural gas leasing and development. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is currently revising several RMPs to align with approved activities. Under FLPMA, section 1712, the Secretary of the Interior is required to develop, maintain, and revise land use plans with public involvement. Current planning regulations mandate the preparation of an environmental impact statement under NEPA. IPAMS testified that rewriting RMPs now takes up to three years, compared to less than one year a decade ago. The Association argues that the usefulness of an RMP is now seven years. The IPAMS testified that rewriting RMPs can now take up to three years, compared to less than one year a decade ago. The Association argues that the usefulness of an RMP is now seven years, with concerns raised about the delay in site-specific analysis for drilling permits due to the need for revised/amended RMPs. In April 2003, BLM announced new strategies to expedite the APD process, including processing multiple permit applications together, implementing geographic area development planning, establishing standard operating practice agreements, and promoting consistent procedures for oil and gas leasing on public lands. The BLM announced strategies to expedite the APD process for oil and gas operators on public lands, categorizing land availability into open, restricted, and closed areas. Closed areas include wilderness areas and national parks, unlikely to reopen for leasing. Some areas are closed for planning or compliance reasons, while others are restricted due to federal decisions on endangered species or historical sites. A BLM study found that around 700 million acres of federal subsurface are affected. Some areas are closed for planning or compliance reasons, while others are restricted due to federal decisions on endangered species or historical sites. Approximately 165 million acres of federal subsurface minerals have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale, with another 182 million acres subject to surface management agency approval. Mineral development on 182 million acres requires approval from surface management agency and must not conflict with land designations. Public lands open to leasing may have restrictions like no surface occupancy, timing limitations, and controlled surface use, which industry sources claim can hinder oil and gas development. The Rocky Mountain region accounts for a significant portion of the natural gas and crude oil projections on public lands. Industry argues that federal withdrawals hinder exploration and development, while environmental groups believe the withdrawals are necessary to protect non-mineral values of public lands. Some lease stipulations are seen as overly restrictive by industry, leading to concerns about de facto closures to oil and gas development. The Rocky Mountain region holds a large portion of natural gas and crude oil on public lands. There are concerns about restrictions on access to these resources, with industry and environmental groups at odds over the issue. Recent reports have focused on the impact of these restrictions on natural gas development in the region. The Rocky Mountain region is a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy. Recent reports by the National Petroleum Council (NPC) and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) studied restrictions on natural gas in the region. Despite differences in resource base, the amount of natural gas on federal lands open to development was similar across the studies. The natural gas resource base in the Rocky Mountain region is around 335 trillion cubic feet (tcf) according to the 1999 NPC study and 293.6 tcf according to more recent EIA data. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf in the five major geologic basins in the region. Despite differences in resource base, the amount of natural gas on federal lands open to development was similar across the studies. The NPC and EIA studies show that a significant portion of the Rocky Mountain region's natural gas resource base is closed or restricted. The EPCA study found that 63% of proven reserves on federal lands are open for leasing. If the Rocky Mountain reserves were included in the EIA report, the percentage of natural gas open for leasing would likely increase. The EPCA study found that 63% of proven reserves on federal lands are open for leasing, with the Rocky Mountain reserves potentially increasing this percentage. The study also identified about 600 million barrels of oil falling under the \"no access\" category, while 3.2 billion barrels would be available for leasing, with one-third having restrictions. Additionally, 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated to be available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The EPCA study found that 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated to be available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The study also concluded that development of natural gas in the restricted land use category would likely face costly delays, but with greater flexibility in federal regulations, about 29 tcf of natural gas could become immediately available. The EIA report suggests that gas development in restricted land use areas could face delays, but with regulatory flexibility, 80 tcf of gas could be made available. Environmental groups argue that relaxing restrictions would pose ecological risks. The NPC study estimates that 41% of gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are closed or restricted, totaling 335 tcf. The NPC study estimates that 41% of gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are either closed or restricted, totaling 335 tcf as of 1999. If the estimated 108 tcf of natural gas currently restricted were produced, it could last between 20-30 years, meeting about 15% of projected annual U.S. demand. The Rocky Mountain region has significant natural gas resources, with 41% currently closed or restricted. If the estimated 108 tcf of natural gas were produced, it could meet about 15% of projected annual U.S. demand for 20-30 years. The Wilderness Society asserts that the U.S. has enough natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years, based on annual demand growth projections. Based on the NPC's estimate of 1,466 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas in the U.S., with 115 tcf classified as off-limits, TWS concludes that 1,351 tcf could be available for development. The NPC suggests that 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas could be brought into production with certain impediments resolved. The NPC proposes relaxing land-use constraints to access Rocky Mountain natural gas, including \"no surface occupancy\" designations and restrictive environmental stipulations. The RAND Corporation suggests focusing on viable reserve categories for access restrictions. The RAND Corporation suggests focusing on viable reserve categories for access restrictions in the environment. Total U.S. oil production is forecasted to decline, with oil imports estimated to make up a significant portion of the total supply in 2025. Total production of natural gas has increased from 1993 to 2002. Total U.S. oil production is projected to decline annually, with oil imports expected to make up nearly 65% of total supply in 2025. Federal onshore oil production is concentrated in three states, with production falling over the past decade. Natural gas production has increased from 1993 to 2002, with projections showing further growth by 2025. U.S. natural gas production increased from 18-20 tcf annually between 1993-2002 to a projected 20 tcf - 24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are forecasted to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010, then fall to 2.6 tcf in 2025. LNG imports are expected to increase from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025. Gas production on public lands rose to 2.2 tcf in 2002 from 1.7 tcf in 1993. Gas production on public lands in the U.S. increased to 2.2 tcf in 2002 from 1.7 tcf in 1993, with New Mexico and Wyoming being the top two states in natural gas production on public lands. The federal onshore share of total U.S. domestic oil and gas production is not expected to change significantly in the near term. U.S. proved oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels of oil (BBO) as of December 31, 2002, with natural gas liquids estimated at 8 billion barrels and natural gas reserves at 187 tcf. The U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels of oil (BBO) as of December 31, 2002, with natural gas liquids estimated at 8 billion barrels and natural gas reserves at 187 tcf. Texas leads in both oil and natural gas reserves. U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years, while production declined by 500 million barrels. In 2001, 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil were discovered, three times greater than the average annual discovery since 1976. The discoveries in the United States were about 950 million barrels, exceeding the annual average since 1976. There are substantial oil reserves available, but production is expected to decline in the long term. The technically recoverable onshore and offshore oil resources are estimated at 92 billion barrels. In contrast, natural gas reserves in the US have increased by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with rising production and imports. The 2002 EIA Annual Report shows an increase in U.S. natural gas reserves by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with production and imports also rising. Annual discoveries have been 70% above the average since 1976. Technically recoverable gas resources are estimated at 1,000 tcf, over five times the current proved reserves. Additionally, there are 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources in the Rocky Mountain West. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment in the Rocky Mountain West estimates 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources. Over 90% of the undiscovered gas is unconventional, with coalbed methane accounting for 25%. Proven reserves in the region show that oil and natural gas liquids on public lands make up 53.6%, while natural gas accounts for 60.1%. Federal onshore oil is estimated to be 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, and natural gas on public lands is estimated to be 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels. The EIA estimates federal onshore oil to be 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, while natural gas on public lands is estimated at 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, and undiscovered conventional natural gas resources at 319.7 trillion cubic feet. Coalbed methane gas is natural gas trapped in coalbeds, with extraction methods involving water removal to release the gas. Coalbed methane (CBM) extraction involves removing water from coal to release methane gas. Operators may fracture coal formations to facilitate gas movement. Concerns about groundwater contamination have led to regulations on water quality and disposal methods. A tax credit in 1980 incentivized CBM development, leading to a four-fold increase in production since 1987. Production of coalbed methane (CBM) has significantly increased since 1987, with CBM accounting for 8% of natural gas production in the United States in 2002. There were 10,000 CBM wells producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day in 2002, mainly in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. Despite estimates of 700 tcf of CBM reserves in the US, only about 100 tcf are economically recoverable. Coalbed methane (CBM) reserves in the United States are largely undeveloped, with only about 100 tcf of the estimated 700 tcf classified as economically recoverable. CBM proved reserves were 18.5 tcf in 2001, accounting for 10% of U.S. dry gas reserves. The San Juan Basin is the most productive, containing 65% of known reserves and 80% of production, while the Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive, contributing 9% of U.S. production. Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also have significant CBM reserves. The San Juan Basin is the most productive for coalbed methane (CBM), containing 65% of known reserves and 80% of production. The Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive, contributing 9% of U.S. production. Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also have significant CBM reserves. The Powder River Basin (PRB) has estimated CBM resources of 39 tcf, with the federal government owning over half of the mineral rights. Surface rights in the PRB are mostly held privately, leading to split-estates, with over 80% of CBM wells on private or state-held land in Wyoming. Surface owners have concerns about fair compensation for surface use agreements with mineral lessees. In Wyoming, stakeholders have established the Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative in 2002 to address conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners or lessees. Environmental concerns about CBM production focus on land and water issues, including surface infrastructure and water usage. CBM production focuses on land disturbance and water issues, including surface infrastructure, water removal, effects on the water table, salinity levels, and disposal of water. Concerns over hydraulic fracturing for CBM production include the impact of injected fluids on underground drinking water, particularly diesel fuel. EPA's draft report found no evidence of contamination but expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel due to its chemical constituents. The EPA report found no evidence of contamination of drinking water wells from CBM hydraulic fracturing. Concerns were raised over the use of diesel fuel due to its chemical constituents, leading to an agreement to end its use. Proposed energy legislation may prohibit EPA from regulating underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing. Dennis Hemmer explained that water from CBM production mostly seeps into underground aquifers, potentially polluting drinking water wells. Hemmer of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality stated that water from CBM production mainly seeps into underground aquifers, potentially contaminating drinking water wells. CBM production results in significant water discharges annually, with concerns raised about the environmental impact on groundwater, water sources, and wildlife habitats. The Wildlife Management Institute of Washington D.C. warns about the negative effects of CBM production on water sources used by wildlife, including depletion of aquifers and loss of vegetation. BLM requires CBM producers to drill monitoring wells to monitor water quality and levels, with one set per four townships with CBM leases. On private lands, monitoring wells are not mandatory. After BLM review, one set of wells (shallow and deep) is needed per four townships with CBM leases to monitor water quality and levels. Monitoring wells are not required on private lands. IBLA invalidated three leases in 2002 due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. Supplemental EAs were prepared for the Powder River Basin to guide CBM development in approved leasing areas, allowing more drilling with new conditions. WOC sued BLM to withdraw 3,800 acres of leases from a 2002 sale in Wyoming following an IBLA ruling. The Wyoming Outdoor Council (WOC) sued BLM to withdraw 3,800 acres of leases from a 2002 sale in Wyoming due to violations of an IBLA ruling. BLM did not proceed with lease sales on public lands with high CBM content. The IBLA dismissed the case in December 2003, and the Wyoming BLM office finalized a new EA and RMP for approving 39,000 permits for new wells. DOI made a decision to begin issuing permits in July 2003. Oil demand is forecasted to rise by 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025. The DOI is anticipating approving 39,000 permits for new wells over a 10-year period starting in July 2003. Oil demand is projected to rise by 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025, with imports reaching nearly 65%. U.S. natural gas demand is also expected to increase by 1.4% annually, reaching 31.4 tcf by 2025. The outlook for increased oil and natural gas production from U.S. public lands is uncertain, with efforts to ease restrictions in place. The Bush Administration is working to ease restrictions on public lands to increase oil and natural gas production. There is uncertainty about the opposition these initiatives will face, with concerns about violations of BLM's multiple-use mandate. Production of conventional natural gas is expected to remain steady, while onshore unconventional natural gas is forecasted to increase its share by 2025. Industry's main concern is to have greater access to federal lands with oil and gas potential and expedite the permitting process. The Rocky Mountain region is expected to increase its share of natural gas production in the lower 48 from 32% in 2002 to 43% by 2025. Industry seeks greater access to federal lands for drilling, while environmental groups are concerned about potential damage to sensitive lands. The US will rely more on natural gas imports, including LNG from stable countries and increased production from the deepwater OCS. A proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms continue to explore ways to meet US energy demand. The United States is expected to rely more on natural gas imports, primarily LNG from stable countries, and increased production from the deepwater OCS. A proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms worldwide continue exploration and development, considering factors like political stability and resource base for investment decisions. Public land use decisions must weigh environmental and societal impacts. Terms for competitive leases include maximum acreage, minimum bid, term length, and bond requirement. Noncompetitive leases have different terms for maximum acreage. The terms for competitive and noncompetitive leases on public lands include maximum acreage, minimum bid, term length, and bond requirements. Rentals and royalties are also specified for both types of leases. The onshore leasing program generates significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury through bonus bids, rents, and royalties. The onshore leasing program on federal lands generates significant annual revenues for the U.S. Treasury through bonus bids, rents, and royalties. Revenues are collected by the Minerals Management Service and distributed to states, the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, and other designated programs. Alaska receives 90% of all revenues collected, while other states receive 50%. Revenues from federal leases vary due to price fluctuations, with revenues increasing significantly in 2000. In 2001, there were 23,000 federal oil and gas leases covering over 17 million acres of federal public lands. In 2000, revenues increased significantly due to higher oil and gas prices. There were 23,000 federal oil and gas leases covering over 17 million acres of federal public lands in 2001. The National Park System was created in 1916 to conserve scenery and wildlife for future generations. The early philosophies of the National Park System and the Forest Service were not synchronized. In the early days of the National Park System, there was tension with the Forest Service due to differing philosophies. The focus was on public lands withdrawal debates and the President's authority to make such orders for national security reasons. The President has the authority to designate specific public lands as unavailable for activities like homesteading or resource exploitation, even though Congress has authority over public lands. This power has been used to establish military reservations and create national monuments through acts like the Antiquities Act. The President can designate public lands as national monuments under various acts like the Antiquities Act, ensuring protection for historic landmarks and scientific objects. Acts like the Taylor Grazing Act and the Organic Act regulate land use for recreation and wilderness preservation. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act also plays a role in land withdrawals for specific purposes. Under FLPMA, withdrawals can be made by the executive branch or Congress, with wilderness designations considered essential for permanent protection. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act withdrew large areas of Alaska from resource use pending congressional disposition. The Wilderness Act required the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability. Wilderness is defined as off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. Currently, there are four types of withdrawal, with Congress having sole authority in some cases. The Act states that federal lands can only be designated as wilderness areas by Congress or as provided for in the Wilderness Act. There are four types of withdrawal: Congress has sole authority in some cases, the executive branch can use delegated power, Congress may withdraw specific resources, and there is a general congressional withdrawal for lands pending final disposition. Modern executive withdrawals are governed by FLPMA. The General Mining Law of 1872 removed lands from potential development, while the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) governs modern executive withdrawals. FLPMA established a federal land use management policy with public and congressional input, detailing procedures for land sales, acquisitions, withdrawals, and exchanges. Withdrawals can be temporary or permanent, with parcels over 5,000 acres requiring congressional approval for up to 20 years, subject to renewal. FLPMA replaced executive authority with defined procedures for public land withdrawals. Withdrawals over 5,000 acres need congressional approval for up to 20 years. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals for up to three years. A review of existing withdrawals in 11 Western states is mandated to determine continuation. Millions of acres were withdrawn prior to FLPMA. BLM continues to review approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, prioritizing 26 million acres for potential return or alternative uses. As of November 2000, BLM had reviewed 7 million acres, revoking withdrawals on over 6 million acres. As of November 2000, BLM had completed reviewing approximately 7 million withdrawn acres, mostly BLM and Bureau of Reclamation land; withdrawals on over 6 million acres have been revoked. Retention of a withdrawal requires a compelling show of need, and an agency manager must convince the BLM Director, the Secretary, and the public that there is no reasonable alternative to continued withdrawal or classification. The review process is continuous over the next several years, supported by documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Revoked lands could be developed for oil and gas resources. Withdrawals must be considered in BLM's planning process and supported by documentation under NEPA. Some lands could be developed for oil and gas resources, while others deemed unsuitable will likely remain closed or restricted."
