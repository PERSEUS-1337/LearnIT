The Secretary of the Treasury can mandate electronic funds transfer for employee pay if deemed practical and with sufficient safeguards. Employees must designate a financial organization to receive their payments. The regulation requires employees to designate a financial organization to receive their pay, and the Secretary cannot charge any transfer fees to the financial organization. The Electronic Funds Transfer Federal Salary Act prohibits transfer fees for payments made by the Secretary to financial organizations and employees. Employees with annual pay below $20,000 can request an exemption from the Act. The Electronic Funds Transfer Federal Salary Act exempts employees with annual pay below $20,000 from certain requirements. The Act also includes national security exceptions for the Central Intelligence Agency. The Central Intelligence Agency can be exempt from regulations if compliance risks compromising security. Acceptance of payment by a financial organization authorized by the Secretary constitutes full acquittance by the United States. The United States can make payments through electronic fund transfers as authorized by the Secretary, which will serve as full acquittance. Section 3332 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include technical and conforming amendments."
