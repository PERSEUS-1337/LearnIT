    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, particularly related to buildings, have become a major concern in recent decades. Buildings, including residential, commercial, and government structures, are recognized as a significant source of environmental impact due to their construction, operation, and demolition. This impact includes resource depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, and effects on human health. U.S. buildings consume vast amounts of resources annually, especially in terms of electricity for lighting. Buildings in the United States have a significant environmental impact, consuming resources like electricity and water, and producing waste throughout their lifecycle. They account for 40% of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the country, costing consumers over $430 billion annually. The location and surroundings of a building also affect its ecological and human health impacts. Buildings in the United States contribute to 40% of greenhouse gas emissions and cost consumers over $430 billion annually in energy bills. A building's location and interaction with its environment impact stormwater management, transportation energy usage, and indoor air quality, affecting occupant health and productivity. Green building addresses environmental and health impacts in construction, renovation, and operations of buildings. It aims to improve indoor air quality, reduce pollutants, and combat \"sick building syndrome.\" The concept has gained popularity since the 1990s, involving various stakeholders like construction firms, building owners, and occupants. Green building has become a respected approach to construction since the 1990s, involving stakeholders like construction firms, building owners, and government agencies. This report discusses the concept of green building, federal policies, tools for ensuring green criteria, and key issues in implementation. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s with the formation of organizations like the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). The concept has since expanded to promote environmentally conscious design principles and federal green building projects, such as the \"Greening of the White House.\" The concept of green building emerged in the 1990s with organizations like the AIA and USGBC. Green building encompasses environmentally conscious design principles and practices to reduce harmful impacts. There is no single definition, with efforts ranging from standard practices to \"zero-impact\" buildings. Some use green building as a marketing tool, known as \"greenwashing.\" Green building aims to significantly reduce the environmental footprint of buildings through integrated design, construction, and operations. It includes concepts like \"zero-impact\" and \"minus-impact\" buildings, which strive for no net environmental impact or a net environmental benefit. This approach contrasts with \"greenwashing\" practices that may not have as ambitious goals. The environmental footprint of buildings is the overall impact on the environment, including the human environment. Green building is a relative concept that aims to improve environmental performance through various techniques and strategies, such as energy-efficient systems and design features to influence occupant behavior. This approach can be applied to any type of building, large or small, commercial or residential. Green building techniques focus on improving environmental performance through innovative technologies and design features to influence occupant behavior. These decisions are typically made during the design and planning phase and can impact a building's environmental footprint throughout its lifecycle. Green building is often associated with sustainable building practices, with a growing trend towards green renovation and retrofit projects. The term green building is often used interchangeably with sustainable building and high-performance building. Sustainable building aims to maintain small environmental footprints indefinitely, while high-performance building includes factors like security. Federal statutory definitions emphasize integrating and optimizing various attributes for energy efficiency, durability, and occupant productivity. High-performance buildings integrate and optimize key attributes like energy efficiency, durability, and occupant productivity on a life cycle basis. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established a detailed definition for high-performance green buildings. Additional objectives such as aesthetics and historical preservation may also be considered in their design. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) defined high-performance green buildings with a focus on elements like energy, water, materials, waste, health, and siting. Siting has gained importance in recent years, emphasizing transportation, ecology, and smart growth. Serviceability, productivity, and functionality are implicit elements in building design objectives. High-performance buildings focus on elements like energy, water, materials, waste, health, and siting. Objectives may include serviceability, productivity, functionality, disaster and climate resilience. Stakeholder needs and local factors influence design priorities. Reduced energy footprint is a key element of green building, focusing on energy efficiency, conservation, and use of renewable energy sources like solar or geothermal power. Energy storage technologies and smart-grid innovations also play a role in reducing economic costs and environmental impacts associated with energy use. Energy efficiency measures in buildings, along with on-site renewable energy generation and smart-grid innovations, are crucial for reducing economic costs and environmental impacts associated with energy use. A 2010 study found that buildings have higher potential energy savings compared to transportation and industry. Federal law mandates reductions in energy use by federal buildings, with a 22% decline in energy intensity from 2003 to 2015. Despite progress, 2015 consumption exceeded the federal goal. Energy is sometimes mistakenly treated as the predominant element in green building, but a building focusing solely on energy may not be green. Reducing water usage in buildings can provide cost savings and aid in water resource management. This can be achieved through measures like reduced-flow plumbing fixtures and recycling wastewater. Reducing water usage in buildings can provide cost savings and aid in water resource management. Measures include reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, recycling wastewater, and landscaping to reduce irrigation needs. Water management also involves handling rain, on-site water, and run-off, with low-impact development using natural and engineered techniques to control stormwater. Green infrastructure methods like porous materials, green roofs, and holding ponds are used for effective water management. The choice and use of materials in a building can significantly impact its environmental footprint. Environmentally preferable products, such as those with recycled content or made from renewable resources, can help reduce resource depletion, pollution, and energy consumption. These materials are designed to minimize health risks and environmental impact. Environmentally preferable materials are made from renewable resources, have low energy and pollutant levels, and reduce health risks. There is debate on what defines environmentally preferable materials due to inconsistent vocabulary and measurement methods. Waste reduction efforts in building construction include source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy. The environmental impacts of a building's waste stream can be mitigated through waste-reduction efforts like source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy. Efforts include efficient material use, recycling, and landscaping practices. High-efficiency boilers can reduce atmospheric pollutants, and operational waste like paper and food can be recycled. Factors influencing health impacts of buildings include indoor air pollutants like mold and asbestos. Several factors can influence the health impacts of buildings, such as indoor air pollutants like mold, radon, carbon monoxide, asbestos, and VOCs. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is crucial for occupant health, with techniques like ventilation, air filtration, and using materials without toxic substances. Overall indoor environmental quality (IEQ) includes factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design, all of which can impact the health of building occupants. The siting of a building can also affect its environmental footprint. The siting of buildings near transportation hubs can reduce impacts from private automobiles and facilitate the use of public transportation. Site selection considers ecological sensitivity to minimize adverse impacts on native species. Building orientation and proximity to trees affect heating and cooling requirements. Climate-related risks like sea-level rise and extreme weather events are also considered in siting decisions. Green building considers factors such as site selection, climate-related risks, and productivity. Studies show that indoor environmental quality (IEQ) can impact worker comfort and productivity in green buildings. However, some green buildings may have poor acoustic performance, leading to potential trade-offs. Green buildings can improve worker productivity, but some may have poor acoustic performance. Serviceability is an important aspect in high-performance buildings and is receiving more attention in green certification systems. Resilience to hazards like earthquakes and flooding can increase a building's useful life and functionality during emergencies. Resilience in green building involves practices like resistant construction, on-site power generation, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling to withstand severe weather events and climate change. Integration across elements and stages is key to improving performance and minimizing environmental impacts. The green building approach emphasizes integration across elements and stages to improve performance and minimize environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. This holistic approach allows for better assessment of environmental impact, balance among competing goals, and the development of an integrated strategy. Information technology can enhance integration and performance, while focusing on one element at the expense of others can be counterproductive. The appropriate use of information technology in building operations can enhance integration and performance across various elements. Focusing solely on energy efficiency, such as sealing the building envelope, may lead to unintended consequences like poor air quality and moisture issues. A green building approach considers the interconnectedness of different elements to achieve overall optimization and reduce the risk of problems. A green building approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of different elements to achieve overall optimization. Prioritizing certain elements over others may be necessary due to constraints or priorities. Focusing on only one stage in a building's life cycle can lead to savings in one area but losses in another. For example, the use of concrete walls provides more insulation on average than wood. The environmental impacts of alternative building materials need to be carefully considered. Concrete walls offer better insulation than wood but have higher carbon dioxide emissions. Energy usage during building operation should be balanced with construction choices. A green building approach assesses impacts across all stages, with elements like product choice affecting occupant health and productivity. On-site renewable energy can ensure functionality during power outages. Formal systems and tools have been developed to set criteria for green and sustainable buildings, falling into categories like rating systems, certifications, standards, and codes. Determining if a building is green or sustainable is complex due to the interconnections of elements involved. In the 1990s, professional organizations in the building sector developed rating and certification systems to standardize green building practices. Rating systems assign points to buildings based on meeting criteria in various green design categories, such as LEED. LEED combines rating and certification into a single system, assigning points to buildings for meeting green building design criteria. Certification validates that a building meets specified requirements, with an independent third party conducting the assessment. USGBC's LEED is the most prevalent certification system in the United States. The LEED certification system, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), is widely recognized as a benchmark for green building design. Over 37,300 commercial buildings worldwide have been certified by LEED as of April 2017. USGBC offers certifications for various categories including new commercial construction, existing buildings, building interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, whole neighborhoods, and others. USGBC has expanded building certification categories to include new commercial construction, existing buildings, building interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, whole neighborhoods, and others. Certification is available for operations and maintenance with a five-year recertification cycle. LEED focuses on six green building elements and has credit categories for innovation and regional priority. Buildings must meet mandatory requirements and earn a designated number of points to be LEED-certified. The LEED certification system evaluates buildings based on specific sustainability factors in a region. Buildings must meet mandatory requirements and earn a certain number of points to achieve certification levels: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. The system allows for simple compliance assessment and integrated consideration of green building elements. Other certification systems in the US include BREEAM. LEED v4, the latest version, was released in November 2013. The LEED v4 certification system, released in November 2013, evaluates buildings based on sustainability factors. In the US, other systems like BREEAM In-Use are also used for benchmarking commercial building performance. BREEAM ratings range from Acceptable to Outstanding and are based on nine impact categories. Unlike LEED, BREEAM In-Use has no prerequisites and can be used by any existing building for performance benchmarking and certification. Green Globes is a certification system developed in Canada by the Green Building Initiative, based on BREEAM. Buildings can earn between one and four Globes based on points earned across six elements. Certification is solely based on the number of points earned, with no mandatory provisions or prerequisites. The International Living Future Institute's Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification. Criteria for certification fall into seven performance areas: place, water, energy, health and happiness, materials, equity, and beauty. Living Building Certification requires meeting requirements in all seven areas, Petal Certification requires compliance with at least three of the seven Petals, and Zero Energy Certification requires generating all energy needs on site. Different green building certification systems emphasize various aspects of sustainability. The Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building, Petal, and Zero Energy. Each certification has specific requirements, such as generating all energy needs on site for Zero Energy Certification. Local conditions and priorities may determine which certification system is most suitable. Some systems focus on new construction, while others are geared towards existing buildings. Some green building certification systems focus on specific aspects of sustainability and offer certifications for different types of buildings. Additional programs like Energy Star, Indoor airPLUS, WaterSense, Zero Energy Ready Home, and Passive House/ PHIUS+ certify buildings for specific environmental improvements. Federal offices and agencies are required to meet green building standards and may use third-party certification systems. Several federal statutes and policies impose green building requirements on federal offices and agencies, recommending the use of third-party green certification systems. The General Services Administration (GSA) suggests using these systems to simplify compliance with federal guidelines, reduce the need for additional staff, and communicate sustainability efforts. Some agencies have internal policies on certification under available rating systems. EISA required the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA, to establish green building requirements. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense, is required by EISA to identify a third-party certification system for green buildings. GSA recommended the use of either LEED or Green Globes for federal agencies as of 2013. The Director of GSA's Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings, established by EISA, recommended LEED or Green Globes for federal agencies in 2013. The 2014 Department of Energy rule sets minimum criteria for green building certification systems used by federal agencies, while states and cities may also have their own requirements for green building certification. Many states and jurisdictions require green building certification for government and commercial buildings, with some offering grants or tax incentives. Green building rating systems have influenced model building codes, which may incorporate standards that are not mandatory. This section focuses on comprehensive green building codes and standards that cover various elements, excluding energy efficiency. Building codes specify minimum requirements for building design and construction, covering various aspects from aesthetics to resource use. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a baseline for energy efficiency in building codes. State and local governments adopt or modify national model codes for regulating buildings within their jurisdictions. Green building codes address multiple elements but do not focus solely on energy efficiency. Green building codes go beyond minimum building code requirements and can be mandatory or voluntary. They specify additional environmental design and performance requirements that can be layered on top of existing codes. Technical standards for specific components are often incorporated from recognized standards development organizations. Green building codes and standards incorporate technical standards for specific components or features created by recognized standards development organizations. These standards define guidelines and criteria against which a product can be judged. Buildings meeting a standard may be certified as having met its criteria through prescriptive or performance pathways. Green building standards offer prescriptive, performance, and outcome-based pathways for achieving requirements. They are written in mandatory language and may be adopted by jurisdictions. Standards are developed through a consensus process and require accreditation by organizations like ANSI. The International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE are the main developers of national green building model codes and standards in the United States. The ICC is responsible for the widely used International Building Code (IBC) and released the International Green Construction Code (IgCC) in 2012, which includes sustainability measures for buildings. These codes and standards are developed through a consensus process and require accreditation by organizations like ANSI. The ICC released the International Green Construction Code (IgCC) in 2012, which includes sustainability measures for buildings. The IgCC functions as an overlay code that can be adopted alongside other ICC codes. Municipalities can choose from various compliance pathways and options to adjust requirements based on local factors. The IgCC covers most building types except low-rise residential buildings. The IgCC covers most building types, excluding low-rise residential buildings, and refers them to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard (NGBS). ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES have jointly released Standard 189.1 for nonresidential and residential buildings over three stories, offering compliance options under the IgCC. Standard 189.1, a code-intended standard, covers requirements for site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. It has been integrated into Department of Defense properties and will serve as the technical content of the 2018 IgCC version. The new code will align with the LEED rating system and streamline beyond-code tools. Additionally, various state, local, and tribal authorities have developed their own green building codes. The new IgCC code will align with the LEED rating system and provide beyond-code tools. Various state, local, and tribal authorities have their own green building codes. Federal laws and policies also have provisions for green building, such as the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) included incentives and requirements for energy and water efficiency in federal, commercial, and residential buildings, as well as state building energy codes and energy conservation programs for federal buildings. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) mandated energy and water conservation programs for congressional buildings, a 20% reduction in energy consumption by federal buildings by 2015, promoted energy-efficient products procurement, set energy consumption targets for new federal buildings, and required sustainable design principles. It also continued funding for DOE's weatherization assistance program and set improvement goals for state energy conservation plans. EPACT 2005 set an improvement goal of 25% by 2012 for state energy conservation plans, funded rebate programs for energy-efficient appliances, established Energy Star labeling, and set energy and water conservation standards for products. It also mandated energy-efficiency standards for public housing and directed HUD to develop a strategy. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) provided a legislative framework for federal green building efforts, including energy efficiency standards for appliances and lighting. It also mandated the use of energy-efficient lighting in GSA leased facilities. Title III, IV, and V of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set efficiency standards for appliances and lighting, required energy-efficient lighting in GSA leased facilities, increased funding for weatherization of low-income residences, and established energy-efficiency standards for manufactured housing.

The rise of green building since the 1990s has raised questions about its impacts, including market penetration, cost, building performance, measurement science, legislative goals, and implementation. The building industry is a significant part of the U.S. economy, with construction and renovation work exceeding $1 trillion in 2016. The building industry in the U.S. is a substantial component of the economy, with construction and renovation work exceeding $1 trillion in 2016. The percentage of green building in the construction market has grown significantly, from 2% in 2005 to 20% in 2013, driven by various factors like government requirements and environmental concerns. Green construction in the United States has seen significant growth, with spending more than tripling from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014. By 2013, green building accounted for 20% of new construction, up from 2% in previous years. Projections suggest that green building activities will contribute $303.4 billion to the GDP between 2015 and 2018, with new institutional construction driving much of this growth. The percentage of certified-green floorspace is also increasing, particularly in office spaces certified by LEED or Energy Star. The National Green Building Adoption Index has reported a rise in the percentage of office space certified by LEED or Energy Star from 5% in 2005 to 38% in 2016 for the 30 largest U.S. office markets. Green building efforts can impact a building's financial performance by affecting construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The true costs of implementing green building measures can influence design and construction decisions. The costs of implementing green building measures can impact design and construction decisions, affecting initial construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. Perceived higher initial costs are a major obstacle for green building adoption in the United States. Limited empirical evidence makes it difficult to generalize the cost performance of green buildings as a whole. The initial costs of green buildings are often perceived to be higher, which is a major obstacle for their adoption in the United States. However, a review by the DOE found that construction costs for green buildings are comparable to conventional buildings. Higher costs can stem from features like high-efficiency appliances and design expenses, but integrated design can help mitigate these costs. The DOE review found that green building construction costs are comparable to conventional buildings. Integrated design can help reduce initial costs. Green buildings can save on operational costs by reducing utility usage and selling renewable energy back to the grid. Studies show green certification is linked to lower utility expenses. GSA saved $340 million in energy and water costs from efficiency improvements. The GSA claims to have saved over $340 million in energy and water costs from efficiency improvements between FY2008 and FY2015. Studies support that green certification is associated with reduced utility expenses, but evidence is mixed on whether it reduces overall operating expenses. Green-labeled buildings can command price premiums in the real estate market, but some factors may reduce incentives for investments in green building, such as homeowners moving frequently. The features of real estate markets can reduce incentives for investments in green building. Building owners, especially homeowners, may move frequently, limiting the time for a return on their initial investment. The financial return on green building investments depends on the premium owners can charge tenants. Constraints on capital availability may also limit potential beneficiaries of green building renovations. Constraints on capital availability may limit potential beneficiaries of green building renovations, including educational institutions, hospitals, and municipalities. Cost barriers may decrease as green building practices become more widespread, with financial incentives helping to make investments more financially attractive. The \"triple bottom line\" concept considers social and environmental costs beyond simple monetary expenditures in green building literature. The \"triple bottom line\" concept in green building literature includes social and environmental returns, in addition to financial ones. Green building efforts need to distinguish between design and performance, with a focus on operational factors that can affect a building's performance after receiving its green rating. Certified green buildings may not always perform significantly better than conventional buildings due to factors like inadequate maintenance, alterations to building controls, and changes in building use. Some certified green buildings have been shown to be resource-intensive post-occupancy. Studies evaluating green building performance show that while resource-use efficiency may be demonstrated, savings can be offset by other factors. Even with demonstrated resource-use efficiency, savings from green building efforts can be offset by factors like larger home sizes and increased energy consumption from electronic devices. The discrepancy between predicted and actual energy performance, known as the \"performance gap,\" is a key concern in the construction industry. The \"performance gap\" between predicted and actual energy use in buildings is a significant concern in the construction industry. Rating systems like LEED are now emphasizing postoccupancy performance assessment by requiring building-level energy and water meters for the first five years after certification. Other systems, such as BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification, include performance parameters in their criteria for certification. Building codes are also starting to incorporate performance outcomes. Building systems can be commissioned to ensure they are designed, installed, tested, and operated as planned, improving environmental performance, especially for energy use. This process can be applied to new or existing buildings during retrofitting or ongoing operations. In addition to certification and commissioning, organizations can develop an environmental management system (EMS). Building systems can be commissioned to improve environmental performance, especially for energy use, in new or existing buildings. Organizations can develop an environmental management system (EMS) with international standards for certification. EMS includes commitments to conform to environmental requirements, improve performance, and prevent pollution. Networked building monitoring tools allow early fault detection and resource use analytics for effective response to changing patterns in real time. Building monitoring tools are increasingly prevalent for early fault detection in critical equipment and resource use analytics. GSAlink, a building diagnostic tool, identified over 33,000 instances of sub-optimal equipment performance. Studies on green building performance lack consensus on criteria and outcomes, making it challenging to compare results. Evidence on whether green buildings outperform conventional ones is mixed. Recent studies have shown mixed results on the performance of green buildings compared to conventional ones. Some green buildings exhibit energy performance below design expectations, with about one in seven performing worse than average. A study of over 100 LEED-certified buildings found that, on average, they performed 24% better than other buildings, but this study was criticized for sample bias and other concerns. A follow-up assessment using the same data concluded that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. A GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most of which had received LEED certification, found that, on average, the buildings studied performed better than the national average in all measured performance areas, including energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions. Some buildings performed worse than the national average in certain areas, however. A study of the energy consumption of 11 LEED-certified Navy buildings found that 9 of the 11 buildings performed better than average. The majority of LEED-certified buildings underperformed in energy consumption compared to national averages, indicating a gap between design strategies and actual performance. This raises questions about the effectiveness of LEED certification in improving building performance. The findings from studies on LEED-certified buildings show a disconnect between design strategies and actual energy consumption performance. Limited sample sizes and proprietary performance data hinder comprehensive assessments. Improved access to building performance data is crucial for evaluating and enhancing environmental targets. Current methods for measuring green building performance are still underdeveloped. Performance measurement is crucial for ensuring green buildings meet environmental targets and identifying areas for improvement. However, methods for measuring green building performance are not well-developed for most elements, with some being easier to quantify than others. Disagreements may arise on which metrics are most relevant, such as energy use intensity (EUI) for evaluating federal building performance. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed new methodologies for measuring energy use intensity (EUI) in federal buildings, including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation. However, accurate building occupancy data is needed to calculate occupancy-adjusted EUI effectively. Additionally, commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not be highly correlated with intended outcomes. The Green Building Advisory Committee proposed new methods for measuring energy use intensity in federal buildings, emphasizing the importance of accurate building occupancy data. Commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not accurately reflect outcomes. Regular measurement and adjustment of building performance are crucial for long-term environmental sustainability. EISA mandates federal agencies to measure building performance against energy use targets, with stricter requirements for new construction. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) requires federal agencies to measure the performance of their buildings against specified energy use targets, with more stringent requirements for new construction. However, challenges exist in accurately determining baseline energy consumption levels and obtaining reliable data. Consensus on measurement goals and metrics is lacking, making effective application difficult. Measurement science in green building is an active area of research, with the development of appropriate measurement science identified as a top research need in 2008. Measurement science in green building is a priority for progress in sustainable construction. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is focused on developing metrics and tools for measuring building sustainability. Agency progress towards federally mandated green building goals varies, with the Obama Administration releasing annual sustainability and energy scorecards to track progress in areas such as GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings. Federal progress towards sustainability goals in areas such as GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings is tracked through annual scorecards. The scorecards provide numeric reports and color scores (green, yellow, red) to indicate agency progress towards meeting targets. Green indicates meeting or being on track, yellow shows some progress, and red indicates lack of progress. Federal progress towards sustainability goals is tracked through annual scorecards with color scores indicating agency progress. Some agencies have surpassed the green building goal, while others are making progress. Many agencies did not meet the energy intensity goal set by EISA. The government set goals for federal facilities to reduce energy intensity and potable water intensity. While progress has been made, some agencies did not meet the energy intensity goal. Green building initiatives are seen positively, with some agencies surpassing goals. Some agencies have achieved the earlier goal of reducing energy intensity, with progress towards the 36% reduction required for 2025. Critics have concerns about green building certification systems, citing lack of caps on performance metrics and insufficient integrative design criteria. They argue that mere mitigation of environmental impacts is not sustainable. Some critics argue that green building design criteria lack sufficient integration across elements or stages in the building's life cycle. They suggest new approaches focused on maintenance or enhancement of ecosystem services beyond individual buildings. Concerns exist that builders new to green building may not prioritize a forward-thinking, integrative approach. Limited scientific and technological knowledge base for green building is also noted. Some may view green building measures as add-ons rather than integral parts of a project. Limited scientific knowledge hinders identifying appropriate approaches, compounded by differing goals. Objective criteria for elements like siting are challenging. Research is needed to enhance the knowledge base. Congress may face questions regarding the effectiveness of current federal green building programs, coordination methods among agencies, extending efforts to support green building adoption nationwide, prioritizing elements like siting, and promoting scientific knowledge growth in green building. Congress may take actions to facilitate the growth of scientific and technical knowledge relating to green building through appropriations, new statutory requirements, and tax law. GAO reports have identified various federal efforts related to green building, but few initiatives focus on green building in an integrative sense. Coordination among agencies to assess the performance of initiatives is recommended. Few federal initiatives focus on green building in an integrative sense, with most concentrating on specific elements like energy, IEQ, or water. Congress is urged to assess how well federal agencies are implementing green building programs and their impact on adoption nationwide. Additionally, coordination among agencies and support for energy-efficient mortgages by agencies like the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs are highlighted. Some federal agencies, like the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs, support energy-efficient mortgages. Congress could consider providing stronger incentives, funding rebate programs, and taking regulatory actions to promote green building adoption. Congress could consider regulatory actions to address areas of lagging market penetration in residential renovation. Efforts may be complicated by federalism issues and regional requirements. Enhancing current green building efforts in federal agencies, accelerating green building for new and existing stock, and ensuring integration and harmonization across agencies are key considerations. Energy has been a priority in green building discussions due to concerns about fossil fuel imports and strategic vulnerability. The report highlights the importance of energy in green building discussions, emphasizing concerns about fossil fuel imports, strategic vulnerability, and climate change. Congress is urged to ensure a balanced approach to green building elements and consider the effectiveness of current programs. Additionally, there is a suggestion to evaluate if the incremental approach to green building is sufficient or if modifications are needed to address national needs. Congress may need to consider if the incremental approach in green building is adequate to meet national needs. Research and development funding for green building is currently suboptimal, with energy receiving higher priority than other elements. Funding for R&D in green building varies, with energy being a higher priority. Congress should consider modifying funding levels, creating incentives for private-sector R&D, and ensuring sufficient training for a knowledgeable workforce in green building construction and operation."
