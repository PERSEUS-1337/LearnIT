The Secretary may conduct audits to make this determination. The Secretary may audit and inspect books or records of an organization to determine if a delay in terminating a Medicare+Choice plan is warranted to prevent substantial financial losses. The delay can be ended if an adequate provider network is established to maintain insurance coverage levels in the affected area.
