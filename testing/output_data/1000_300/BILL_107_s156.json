    "content": "The \"After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students, reduce juvenile crime, and decrease the risk of youth becoming victims of crime by offering productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face increased social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are most at risk of violence during after school hours. Academic failure consequences are more severe in 2001, and after school programs have been effective in addressing youth social problems. Many governors support expanding after school programs through a Federal/State partnership. Many governors and law enforcement officials advocate for increasing after school programs to address social issues like drugs, alcohol, and gang involvement among youth. Providing safe and positive learning environments during after school hours is seen as a crucial investment in children. The goals of the Act include increasing academic success, promoting safe after school environments, providing alternatives to negative activities, and reducing juvenile crime. The Act also amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to increase program authorization. Section 10904 of the Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to require recipients to provide a minimum of 35% of the annual project cost from sources other than funds provided under the Act. The recipient must provide a contribution in cash or in kind, evaluated fairly, not exceeding 25% of the annual project cost from funds provided by the Secretary under other Federal programs. Additionally, the recipient must maintain their fiscal effort from non-Federal sources each year. SEC. 7. USES OF FUNDS. Section 10905 of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to allow grants for establishing or expanding community learning centers that offer various activities, including job skills preparation. Additionally, after school programs must include mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training. After school programs funded under the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act must include mentoring, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training. Additionally, they may offer drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation. At least two-thirds of the funding each year must be used for these programs, which can also provide expanded opportunities for children and youth. SEC. 8. ADMINISTRATION. Section 10905 of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to include provisions for local educational agencies, schools, or consortia to involve volunteers from various communities, engage youth in designing activities, conduct outreach creatively, request donations, and collaborate with park and recreation departments.
