    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act of 2017\" or the \"LOVE Act of 2017\". During the Lavender Scare in the 1950s and 1960s, over 1,000 Department of State employees were wrongfully dismissed for alleged homosexuality. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security cited sexual orientation as a security risk, leading to discriminatory hiring practices. Between 1950 and 1969, the Department of State implemented a screening process to prevent the hiring of individuals who were perceived as gay or lesbian. This was partly in response to congressional investigations into the \"sex perversion of Federal employees\" and concerns about the presence of homosexuals sympathetic to Communism within the Department. Between 1950 and 1969, the Department of State reported on homosexuals fired annually. In the early 1990s, State personnel suspected of being gay were investigated and removed as security risks. In 1994, discrimination based on sexual orientation was prohibited, and in 1998, discrimination was barred by Executive Order 13087. In 1998, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13087 prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Department of State. In 2017, Secretary of State John Kerry apologized for past discriminatory practices and reaffirmed the commitment to diversity and inclusion for all employees, including the LGBTI community.
