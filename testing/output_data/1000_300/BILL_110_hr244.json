The Congress finds that the value added by workers in the US and other countries is increasingly dependent on educational and training investments. The disparity in investment between the US and its trading partners is leading to declining educational performance in the US compared to other countries in a global marketplace. The performance of students in the United States is compared to their counterparts in other countries. In a global marketplace, US businesses struggle to fund worker education and training that is provided at no cost by other countries. The current workforce environment creates competitive pressures for domestic companies to utilize highly educated knowledge workers abroad. It is crucial for the US government to reverse this trend to preserve national security, the middle class, and the welfare of workers while remaining globally competitive. Public-private partnerships in the United States, like the research and development tax credit, help advance the needs of citizens, businesses, and communities. Businesses are effective at training the workforce by tailoring programs to available jobs and utilizing new methods. The United States aims to improve cost effectiveness by encouraging businesses to train the workforce for high-paying technology jobs to support retiring baby boomers. This Act provides incentives for businesses and individuals to support the educational development of knowledge workers.
