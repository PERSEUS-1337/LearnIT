    "content": "The FMLA requires covered employers to grant up to 12 workweeks of leave for various reasons including the birth or adoption of a child, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or the employee's own health condition. Additionally, eligible employees can receive up to 26 workweeks of leave to care for a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness. The FMLA provides up to 26 workweeks of leave for eligible employees to care for a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness sustained in the line of duty. To be eligible, an employee must work for a covered employer, have 1,250 hours of service in the previous 12 months, work at a location with 50 or more employees within 75 miles, and have worked for the employer for 12 months. Private-sector employers with 50 or more employees are covered, as well as public agencies. The FMLA applies to employers engaged in commerce with 50 or more employees for 20 weeks in the current or last calendar year. Public agencies are covered regardless of staffing levels. The FMLA has been amended multiple times since 1993. Bills in the 114th Congress aimed to create new entitlements. In the 114th Congress, several bills were introduced to amend the FMLA by creating new entitlements, expanding permissible leave categories, and modifying employee eligibility requirements. Currently, eligible employees are entitled to 12 workweeks of FMLA leave for family and medical needs and 26 workweeks to care for a seriously ill or injured servicemember. Some proposals in the Congress sought to create additional entitlements for similar purposes. Two bills proposed creating additional entitlements for FMLA leave: Parental Involvement and Family Wellness Leave. H.R. 5518 would allow up to 24 hours of leave in a 12-month period for school activities or medical care needs. H.R. 5535 would provide up to eight hours of leave for parental involvement. H.R. 5535 would entitle eligible employees to up to eight hours of leave in any 30-day period, with a maximum of 48 hours in a 12-month period, for school conferences or activities attended by their child or grandchild. Employees must notify employers at least seven days in advance of using this leave. The 7-day notice requirement for FMLA leave is shorter than the 30-day notice for other qualifying reasons. The 114th Congress considered expanding FMLA leave for new categories like bereavement and domestic violence needs. Bills in the 114th Congress proposed expanding FMLA leave entitlement for bereavement, domestic violence needs, family involvement, and medical needs related to service-connected disabilities for veterans. Specific proposals included allowing employees to use FMLA leave for the death of a son or daughter, parent, or sibling, but not for the death of a spouse. S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA leave entitlement to include bereavement for the death of a son or daughter, parent, or sibling. It also allowed leave for domestic violence needs and family involvement, such as school-related activities or medical appointments for family members. Employees can use family involvement leave for school-related activities or medical appointments for family members, up to 24 hours in a 12-month period. H.R. 5165 proposed allowing FMLA leave for hospital care or medical services for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 30% or higher. Several other proposals aimed to expand FMLA leave entitlement for various family-related purposes. Under current law, employees can use FMLA leave to assist or provide care to family members, including a new son or daughter by birth or placement. Proposals have been made to expand FMLA-qualifying uses of leave by broadening the set of relationships for which an employee may take family leave. The FMLA allows leave for a son or daughter under 18 years old, or over 18 with a disability. Leave can also be taken for a family member's serious health condition or military-related reasons. Proposed changes aim to expand the eligible family members for FMLA leave. Proposed legislative changes aim to expand FMLA leave eligibility to include caregiving for a wider range of family members, such as domestic partner's children, adult children, grandchildren, and adult grandchildren. H.R. 5701 proposed expanding FMLA leave to include placement of adult children, grandchildren, and grandparents. S. 473 also suggested adding domestic partners, parents-in-law, and siblings for caregiving needs. H.R. 5701 and S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA leave to include various family members such as adult children, grandchildren, grandparents, domestic partners, parents-in-law, siblings, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, and any other individual with a close family-like relationship. The 114th Congress considered legislation to broaden FMLA-qualifying uses of leave by amending definitions of son or daughter and serious health condition to include a wider range of family members such as adult children, grandchildren, and grandparents. Under current law, FMLA defines son or daughter as a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is under 18 years of age or 18 years of age or older and incapable of self-care due to a mental or physical disability. Proposed legislation would expand the definition to include children of any age and a child of a domestic partner, broadening the applicability of FMLA leave. The act defines a serious health condition as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. The proposed legislation aims to amend the FMLA to include recovery from surgery related to organ donation as a \"physical or mental condition\" qualifying for leave. This would not automatically constitute a serious health condition; the existing criteria of inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider would still need to be met. The 114th Congress considered proposals to amend FMLA eligibility requirements for employees seeking leave, including recovery from surgery related to organ donation. S. 2584 and H.R. 4616 clarified that recovery alone does not constitute a serious health condition; inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider would still be required. Key eligibility criteria include working for a covered employer, having 1,250 hours of service in the past 12 months, working for the employer for 12 months, and being at a location with 50 or more employees within 75 miles. The 114th Congress considered proposals to amend FMLA eligibility requirements for employees seeking leave. H.R. 5518 aimed to reduce the minimum number of employees within 75 miles of an employee's worksite from 50 to 15, while H.R. 5496 sought to amend the hours-of-service requirement. Additionally, new eligibility requirements were proposed for certain veterans with service-connected disabilities and education support professionals. H.R. 5165 proposed new FMLA-qualifying leave for veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher. It included separate eligibility requirements allowing certain veterans to access this leave without meeting the standard employment requirements. A veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30%-50% could use leave for medical care related to their disability after 8 months of employment. A veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher can use leave for medical care related to their disability after meeting specific employment requirements. Certification from a VA medical provider or approved non-VA facility is required for using the leave. The bill proposed that veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher must provide certification from a VA medical provider or approved non-VA facility to use leave for medical care related to their disability. Veterans with a disability rated at 30%-50% at the time of retirement can use leave after meeting specific employment requirements. Veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher must provide certification from the Department of Defense to access FMLA leave for medical needs related to their disability. Different employment requirements apply based on the disability rating at the time of retirement. S. 3444 proposed separate eligibility requirements for veterans and educational support professionals (ESP) to access FMLA leave for medical needs, potentially allowing quicker access for veterans with service-connected disabilities and adjusting the hours-of-service requirement for ESPs. S. 3444 proposed separate eligibility requirements for veterans and educational support professionals (ESP) to access FMLA leave for medical needs. An ESP would meet the hours-of-service requirement for eligibility by working an average of 60 hours per month or 60% of the total monthly hours expected for their job description. The proposal would also allow the Secretary of Labor to create separate rules for calculating leave entitlement for ESPs without changing the size of the entitlement available to them."
