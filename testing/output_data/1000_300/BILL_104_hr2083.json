    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tax Reduction and Economic Growth Act of 1995\" and includes provisions for tax reduction in the event of low growth. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must notify the President and Congress if economic growth is below 1.5% and national unemployment is above 6.5% for specific testing periods. After economic conditions trigger notification, the President can authorize temporary tax reductions for a specified year to stimulate the economy. The notification periods include the quarter of notification and the preceding quarter, the previous 4 quarters, and the 2 quarters following notification. Temporary income tax reductions are required for a specified calendar year to provide a quick fiscal stimulus to the economy. The President can transmit a declaration to Congress for temporary tax modifications, including reductions in tax rates for the first income bracket. The first income bracket in the tax tables under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 can be reduced by up to 3 percent as specified in a declaration from the President to Congress. Withholding tables will be adjusted to reflect this rate reduction for maximum impact. The Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate can modify withholding tables under section 3402(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reflect a rate reduction declared by the President. Withholding reductions will be spread out over the calendar year for maximum effect. Additionally, a temporary surtax may be implemented in the following year if economic growth requirements are met. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased by a certain percentage each year, except for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000. The tax amounts will not exceed the rates from the previous year before the temporary tax reduction. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased annually, except for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000. The tax amounts shall not exceed the rates from the year prior to the temporary tax reduction, and withholding tables will be adjusted accordingly. Economic growth requirements must be met for any calendar year. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased annually, except for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000. Economic growth requirements must be met for any calendar year, with GDP growth over 4.5% and unemployment below 5.5%. The percentage increase in tax is determined based on these criteria. The national unemployment rate is estimated to be less than 5.5 percent. The percentage increase in tax rates under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is determined based on specific criteria, with adjustments for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000. The tax rates increase based on specific criteria, with adjustments for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000. The percentage is published in the Federal Register before the calendar year begins. SEC. 3.
