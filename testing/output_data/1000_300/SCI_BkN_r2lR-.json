    "content": "Identifying analogies across domains without supervision is a key task for artificial intelligence. Recent advances in cross domain image mapping focus on translating images across domains, but visual fidelity often falls short for matching samples. This paper introduces AN-GAN, a matching-by-synthesis approach that outperforms current techniques in finding exact analogies between datasets. The cross-domain mapping task is divided into domain alignment and learning the mapping function, which can be iteratively solved to improve alignment and reach quality comparable to full supervision. Humans have the remarkable ability to make analogies between different domains without prior supervision, which is crucial for leveraging previous knowledge in new situations. Recent advances in AI have focused on supervised problems, but identifying analogies in unsupervised scenarios remains a challenge. Various approaches have been proposed for unsupervised mapping between domains.

Recent advances in AI have focused on supervised problems, but identifying analogies in unsupervised scenarios remains a challenge. Several approaches have been proposed for unsupervised mapping between domains, where a mapping function is learned to transform images from one domain to another while maintaining distributional and cycle constraints. The task of analogy identification involves finding pairs of examples in two domains related by a fixed non-linear transformation. Current methods, although effective in training a mapping function, often result in translated images lacking visual fidelity for exact matching. This is attributed to the absence of exemplar-based constraints in addition to distributional and inversion constraints. This work addresses the problem of analogy identification and explores the potential of incorporating exemplar-based constraints to improve image translation quality. In this work, the focus is on analogy identification in unsupervised scenarios. The method proposed adds exemplar-based constraints to improve visual analogy identification performance. It can find correspondences between sets even when exact analogies are not present in all sample images. By retrieving examples instead of mapping them, the method achieves better visual quality. Additionally, a two-step approach for training a domain mapping function is introduced, which is more accurate than current methods.

A two-step approach for training a domain mapping function is introduced, which is more accurate than current methods. Analogy identification in unsupervised scenarios is related to image matching methods. Various approaches have been proposed for image matching, including pixel-and feature-point based matching and deep neural networks. Generic visual feature matching is relevant in unsupervised scenarios, but standard visual features may not achieve good analogies between different domains. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technology has revolutionized image synthesis, allowing for the creation of realistic images. While standard visual features may struggle to create analogies between different domains, GAN methods train a generator network to synthesize samples from a target distribution by jointly training a discriminator network. The use of GANs for generating realistic images involves training a generator network to synthesize samples from a target distribution by jointly training a discriminator network. Different mapping methods, such as unsupervised and supervised mapping, have been employed for image to image translation and natural language translation. Supervised mapping methods involve training a mapping network with matching pairs of input and output images. The discriminator network receives pairs of images to strengthen the link between source and target images. While no supervision is used in the algorithm, correspondences are generated between domains for potential use in supervised mapping methods. Our algorithm generates correspondences between domains without supervision. The method for analogy identification involves finding matching indexes between two sets of images in different domains. An iterative approach is used to map images from the source domain to the target domain. Our approach involves finding matching indexes between images in different domains to map them iteratively. A GAN-based distribution approach is used to map images from one domain to another, optimizing the distribution alignment between the two domains. The alignment between image domains is enforced by training a discriminator to distinguish between samples from different distributions. Additional constraints like circularity and distance invariance have been effectively added to improve the distribution alignment. The popular cycle approach involves training GANs in both directions and ensuring that translated images recover the original ones. The popular cycle approach in GAN training involves one-sided GANs in both directions, ensuring that translated images recover the original ones. A two-sided cycle loss function is used to provide exact matches between image domains. In the previous section, a distributional approach was described for mapping A domain images to B domain images. This section provides a method for exact matches between domains, aiming to find a set of indices for matching. The goal is to train a fully supervised mapping function T AB by recovering exact matches, resulting in a mapping function of high quality. The task involves creating a binary matrix with proposed matches between B domain images and A domain images, using a \"perceptual loss\" function. The section describes an optimization process for creating a binary matrix with proposed matches between B domain images and A domain images. The optimization involves using weights and constraints to enforce sparsity and positivity, with the final objective being optimized using SGD. The final optimization objective involves enforcing constraints using an auxiliary variable and a Softmax function. The relaxed formulation can be optimized using SGD, with the entropy term playing a significant role in converging to the original correspondence problem. Updating mappings iteratively for N epochs and then updating the auxiliary variable \u03b2 for N epochs achieves excellent results. The training scheme requires full mapping only once at the beginning of each iteration. AN-GAN is a cross domain matching method that utilizes exemplar and distribution based constraints. The loss function includes distributional loss, cycle loss, and exemplar loss to ensure good performance in matching images between domains. The AN-GAN optimization problem involves distributional loss, cycle loss, and exemplar loss to match images between domains. The optimization also adversarially trains discriminators D A and D B. Initially, all matches have equal likelihood, with a burn-in period to align distributions before individual images. Optimization includes iterations for exemplar loss and learning rate decay. In optimizing the exemplar-loss, we used one \u03b1-iteration of 22 epochs, one T-iteration of 10 epochs, and another \u03b1-iteration of 10 epochs. The initial learning rate was set at 1e \u2212 3 and decayed after 20 epochs. Shared \u03b2 parameters were used to inform likelihood of matches in both mapping directions. Different loss functions were explored, with Laplacian pyramid loss showing improvement, but the best performance was achieved with a different approach. In experiments, Euclidean or L1 loss functions were not perceptual enough, but Laplacian pyramid loss provided some improvement. The best performance came from using a perceptual loss function, as seen in prior works. The loss function extracts VGG features for image pairs I1 and I2, using different layers depending on image resolution. Additionally, L1 loss on pixels is used to consider colors. The perceptual loss function is defined as \u03c6m1 and \u03c6m2 for feature maps of images I1 and I2. The perceptual loss function for cross-domain image matching uses feature maps \u03c6m1 and \u03c6m2 for images I1 and I2, incorporating L1 loss on pixels for color consideration. The method is considered unsupervised as features are off-the-shelf, with evaluations conducted on various public datasets. Comparisons are made against existing solutions for cross-domain matching. In experiments on multiple public datasets, various scenarios were evaluated for cross-domain image matching. The method was compared against existing solutions such as U nmapped \u2212 P ixel, U nmapped \u2212 V GG, CycleGAN \u2212 P ixel, and CycleGAN \u2212 V GG, each utilizing different techniques for finding nearest neighbors in the target domain. The method was evaluated on 4 public datasets: Facades with 400 building facade images, Maps with 1096 aligned maps and satellite images, and a dataset of shoes. Different techniques like CycleGAN - Pixel and CycleGAN - VGG were used to find nearest neighbors in the target domain. The Maps dataset consists of 1096 aligned maps and satellite images scraped from Google Maps. The dataset also includes images of shoes from the Zappos50K dataset and Amazon handbags. The edge images were automatically detected using HED. The datasets were down-sampled to 2k images each for memory complexity. The method was compared with five others for exact correspondence identification. In a set of experiments comparing methods for exact correspondence identification, images are shuffled before training to recover the match function. Results show that generic features cannot easily match between different domains, but CycleGAN and pixel-loss matching improve performance. In experiments comparing methods for exact correspondence identification, it was found that generic features struggle to match between different domains. Using CycleGAN and pixel-loss matching improved performance, but there is still room for enhancement. Perceptual features, specifically VGG features, were used to improve image retrieval tasks. Exhaustive search was deemed too computationally expensive, leading to the need for subsampling features. Perceptual features outperformed pixel matching, and linear combinations of mapped images were matched using the \u03b1 iterations step. The method of matching linear combinations of mapped images using \u03b1 iterations step showed significant improvements in performance. The exemplar loss, aided by distributional auxiliary loss, was able to converge through \u03b1 \u2212 T iterations, demonstrating the importance of distribution and cycle auxiliary losses in improving identification between domains. The distributional auxiliary loss helped the exemplar loss converge through \u03b1 \u2212 T iterations, showing its importance in successful analogy finding. The AN-GAN method, utilizing the full exemplar-based loss, significantly improved performance for all datasets and matching directions. In experiments with M % of matches unavailable, images from A and B domains were randomly removed, resulting in unmatched samples in both domains. In experiments with M % of matches unavailable, images from A and B domains were randomly removed. The task is to identify correct matches for samples in the other domain. Results show that the method can handle scenarios where not all examples have matches, with comparable results to the clean case when 10% of samples do not have matches. The results show that the method can handle scenarios where not all examples have matches. Results are comparable to the clean case when 10% of samples do not have matches, and not significantly lower for most datasets with 25% of samples without exact matches. AN-GAN achieved around 90% match rate with 75% of samples not having matches in some datasets. The method was also tested on finding similar matches when no exact analogies are available. In an experiment evaluating the method on scenarios without exact analogies, the DiscoGAN architecture was used for mapping in the Shoes2Handbags scenario. Results showed varying quality of matches, with AN-GAN providing more relevant matches compared to DiscoGAN. Our method aligns datasets accurately, suggesting a two-step approach: (i) Find analogies using AN-GAN, and (ii) Train a mapping function using self-supervision. Achieving 97% alignment accuracy on the Facades dataset, we used it to train a fully self-supervised mapping function with Pix2Pix for facade photos to segmentations task evaluation. Our self-supervised method for image mapping using Pix2Pix achieves high accuracy, outperforming unsupervised methods like CycleGAN. The results show that our approach is comparable to fully supervised methods in terms of quality and performance on the facade photos to segmentations task. Our self-supervised method for image mapping using Pix2Pix outperforms CycleGAN and achieves similar quality to fully supervised methods. The use of appropriate loss and larger architecture enables improved performance over CycleGAN and competitive results with full-supervision. Our method shows improved performance over CycleGAN and competes with full-supervision in image mapping. Additionally, we tested our method on point cloud matching, demonstrating success in achieving alignment for various rotation angles using the Bunny benchmark. The architecture used for both CycleGAN and our method includes a fully connected network with 2 hidden layers, BatchNorm, Leaky ReLU activations, and a linear affine matrix mapping function.

Our method significantly outperforms the baseline results reported in BID17, especially for large transformations. It is effective for low dimensional transformations and settings without exact matches.
