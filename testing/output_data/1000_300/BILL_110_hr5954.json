    "content": "Presumptions of service connection for diseases associated with service in the armed forces and exposure to biological, chemical, or other toxic agents as part of Project 112 under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Presumption of service connection for diseases associated with Project 112 under title 38, United States Code, allows for diseases to be considered incurred or aggravated by service, even without evidence during that period. The Secretary determines diseases warranting a presumption of service connection due to increased incidence. The Secretary determines diseases warranting a presumption of service connection by reason of increased exposure to toxic agents associated with Project 112 during service in the Armed Forces. Veterans who served on active duty and were exposed to such agents may qualify if the disease manifests within a specified period. Veterans exposed to chemical or biological warfare tests under Project 112 may be presumed to have been exposed to toxic agents associated with the disease unless evidence proves otherwise. The Secretary determines diseases eligible for service connection due to increased exposure to these agents during active duty. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for a presumption of service connection for diseases linked to exposure to toxic agents during Project 112 testing. This is based on evidence of a positive association between exposure to these agents during military service and the occurrence of diagnosed diseases. The Secretary considers all medical and scientific information when determining service connection for diseases related to exposure to toxic agents during Project 112 testing. The association between disease occurrence and exposure to toxic agents is deemed positive if results are statistically significant, replicable, and peer-reviewed. The association between disease occurrence and exposure to toxic agents is considered positive if credible evidence outweighs against it. Veterans awarded compensation before the removal of presumption will continue to receive it. Veterans awarded compensation before the removal of presumption will continue to receive it, including survivors entitled to dependency and indemnity compensation.
