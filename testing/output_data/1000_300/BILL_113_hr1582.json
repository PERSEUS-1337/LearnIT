    "content": "The \"Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013\" prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency from finalizing energy-related rules estimated to cost more than $1 billion if they will have significant adverse effects on the economy. Prior reports and determinations are required before finalizing such rules. Before finalizing any energy-related rule estimated to cost over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details on the rule, its costs, benefits, and uncertainties. Before finalizing any energy-related rule estimated to cost over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details on the rule, its costs, benefits, and uncertainties. The report should include a description of the modeling, calculations, assumptions, and limitations related to the estimates, as well as a certification that all data and documents used in developing the estimates have been preserved and are available for public review on the Agency's website, while ensuring confidentiality of sensitive information. Before finalizing any energy-related rule estimated to cost over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details on the rule, its costs, benefits, and uncertainties. The report should include a description of the modeling, calculations, assumptions, and limitations related to the estimates, as well as a certification that all data and documents used in developing the estimates have been preserved and are available for public review on the Agency's website, while ensuring confidentiality of sensitive information. The report must also provide an estimate of the increases in energy prices, including potential increases in gasoline or electricity prices for consumers, and a detailed description of the employment effects, including potential job losses and shifts in employment, that may result from implementation or enforcement of the rule. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with relevant agencies, will conduct an analysis to determine the impacts of a proposed energy-related rule. This analysis will assess potential increases in energy prices for consumers, effects on fuel diversity and electric reliability, adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, and use, and any other negative impacts on energy supply. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other agencies, will analyze the impacts of a proposed energy-related rule, including adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, and use. If adverse effects are determined, further assessments will be made in collaboration with relevant authorities. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other agencies, will assess the economic impacts of a proposed rule, considering costs, benefits, and effects on economic indicators like GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices. The Secretary of Energy will assess economic impacts of a proposed rule, including GDP, unemployment, wages, consumer prices, and business activity, and publish the results in the Federal Register. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the terms \"direct costs\" and \"indirect costs\" are defined according to the Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines. The term \"energy-related rule that is estimated to cost more than $1 billion\" refers to a rule regulating aspects of energy production, supply, distribution, or use, with estimated costs exceeding $1 billion. The term \"rule\" as defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code, can impose direct and indirect costs exceeding $1 billion, requiring approval from the Environmental Protection Agency or the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON USE OF SOCIAL COST OF CARBON IN ANALYSIS. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is prohibited from using the social cost of carbon in cost-benefit analysis for energy-related rules costing over $1 billion, unless authorized by Federal law. The term \"social cost of carbon\" refers to a specific technical document or any related estimate. The House of Representatives passed a bill on August 1, 2013, related to monetized damages from increased carbon dioxide emissions. Karen L. Haas attested to the bill."
