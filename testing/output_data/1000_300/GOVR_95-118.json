PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, maintaining separate reserve funds for each program. In FY2018, PBGC insured about 25,000 DB pension plans covering about 37 million participants. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, covering about 37 million participants. PBGC pays benefits to 1.4 million people and provides financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. 49% of participants in terminated multiemployer plans have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee. Among participants in terminated multiemployer plans, 49% have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee, while 51% have benefits larger than the guarantee. PBGC is a government-owned corporation with a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury are also board members. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with Senate approval. ERISA establishes a seven-member Advisory Committee to advise PBGC on various issues. MAP-21 made changes to PBGC's governance structures. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) altered governance structures of PBGC, including setting the Director's term at five years and establishing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate. PBGC is self-supporting and receives no general revenue appropriations, with ERISA stating the US is not liable for its obligations. Some Members of Congress are hesitant to provide financial assistance to PBGC. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is self-supporting and does not receive general revenue appropriations. Congress is reluctant to provide financial assistance to PBGC. PBGC's main source of revenue is premiums set by Congress and paid by private-sector employers. Other sources of income include assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded pension plans. PBGC's receipts and disbursements are included in federal budget totals. Sponsors of private-sector pension plans pay various premiums to PBGC, including flat-rate per-participant premiums for single-employer and multiemployer plans. The sponsors of private-sector pension plans pay premiums to PBGC, including flat-rate and variable-rate premiums. Single-employer plans pay $80 per participant annually, with underfunded plans paying an additional premium based on underfunding. There is also a per-participant premium for terminated plans for three years. In addition to flat-rate premiums, sponsors of underfunded single-employer DB pension plans pay an annual premium based on unfunded vested benefits. There is a per-participant limit for this premium. Terminated single-employer plans pay a premium for three years. Multiemployer plans pay a flat-rate premium per participant. PBGC only covers DB plans that meet qualification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans are not covered. PBGC covers only DB plans that meet IRC qualification requirements, providing tax benefits to qualified pension plans. Employer contributions are tax-deductible, and plan earnings are not taxable until distribution. Plans must offer definite benefits and be intended as a permanent arrangement to qualify under IRC. When a pension plan participant receives income, it is taxed as ordinary income. To be qualified under the IRC, a pension plan must be permanent, provide definite benefits, not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees, and cover a minimum number of employees. PBGC excludes certain plans from insurance, such as governmental plans, church plans, and plans for substantial owners of businesses. PBGC operates single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs separately with separate reserve funds. PBGC operates single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs separately with separate reserve funds. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated, underfunded single-employer DB pension plans, while in the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent multiemployer DB pension plans. PBGC provides loans to insolvent multiemployer DB pension plans when they have insufficient assets to pay participant benefits. Employers can terminate single-employer plans voluntarily, with PBGC and participants being notified. PBGC may involuntarily terminate underfunded plans if the sponsor cannot meet pension obligations. Companies can end pension plans voluntarily if assets cover benefit liabilities, with PBGC confirming termination requirements are met. Benefit liabilities include all earned benefits, vested and nonvested, plus certain early retirement supplements. The plan meets termination requirements when benefit liabilities are covered by assets. Benefits are distributed to participants through annuity contracts or lump-sum payments. Any excess assets may be recovered by the employer through an asset reversion, which is included in the employer's gross income. The employer may recover excess assets through an asset reversion, subject to an excise tax. If the plan terminates in distress, PBGC takes over as trustee, using assets to pay benefit liabilities. PBGC, as trustee of the plan, assumes control of assets and liabilities. Payments for benefit liabilities come from plan assets and recovered employer assets. If plan assets are insufficient, a \"distress\" termination may occur under specific criteria. The Single Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1986 outlines criteria for plan termination, including bankruptcy filings, reorganization petitions, PBGC determination of necessity for debt payment or to avoid pension cost burdens. The Single Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1986 (SEPPAA) and subsequent acts outline criteria for plan termination, including bankruptcy filings, reorganization petitions, and PBGC determination of necessity for debt payment or to avoid pension cost burdens. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it has not met minimum funding standards and will be unable to pay benefits. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it has not met minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has a substantial owner with a distribution over $10,000, or if PBGC's long-term loss is expected to increase unreasonably. A federal court can also order termination to protect participants' interests or avoid financial deterioration. The court may order termination of a pension plan to protect participants' interests, prevent financial deterioration, or avoid increasing PBGC's liability. PBGC became trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans from FY1974 to FY2016. Most terminations result in standard terminations, but distress or involuntary terminations make the plan's sponsor and controlled group liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. Following a distress or involuntary termination, the plan's sponsor and their controlled group are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. This liability is measured as the plan's liabilities minus its assets at the termination date. Payment is typically required in cash or negotiable securities on the termination date, with potential property liens for non-payment. If the sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC may not be able to create a lien. When a plan undergoes distress termination, PBGC may not have legal authority to create a lien if the sponsor is in bankruptcy. PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited in such cases, as it has the same standing as other creditors of the sponsor. The benefits PBGC pays upon termination depend on guaranteed benefit limits set by Congress, plan assets, and recoveries from the sponsor. PBGC guarantees vested retirement benefits and certain other benefits at the date of termination, excluding benefits solely due to termination. PBGC guarantees vested retirement benefits and certain other benefits at the date of plan termination, excluding benefits solely due to termination. Retirement benefits that commence before the plan's normal age of retirement are guaranteed, provided they meet the other conditions of guarantee. Contingent benefits are guaranteed only if the triggering event occurs before plan termination, with the PBGC guarantee phased in over a five-year period following the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees retirement benefits and certain other benefits at the date of plan termination. Maximum pension guarantee is $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019, adjusted annually for wage growth. Benefits are adjusted based on age of participant and form of benefit payment. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits at plan termination, with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in 2019. Benefits are adjusted based on age and form of payment, with reductions for benefits paid before age 65. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits at plan termination, with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in 2019. Benefits are adjusted based on age and form of payment, with reductions for benefits paid before age 65. The reduction in benefits paid before age 65 is 7% for each of the first 5 years, 4% for the next 5 years, and 2% for the following 10 years. Only \"basic benefits\" are guaranteed, including benefits at normal retirement age, certain early retirement and disability benefits, and benefits for survivors. Only vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 for retirees in FY2015. Over 80% of PBGC recipients in single-employer plans received their full benefits. In FY2015, retirees received an average monthly benefit of $606. PBGC recipients in single-employer plans mostly received their full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits were reduced. Assets of terminated plans are allocated to pay benefits based on a priority schedule. PBGC also pays participants a portion of their unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on recovered assets. PBGC provides financial assistance to participants in multiemployer plans by insuring plan insolvency, which does not require plan termination. When a plan is insolvent and unable to pay benefits, PBGC steps in to provide additional resources needed. PBGC may provide loans to multiemployer plans if available resources are insufficient to pay benefits, with loans rarely repaid. Repayment terms apply if the plan recovers. Only one plan has repaid financial assistance. PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans with a different ceiling. Benefits are determined by a flat dollar rate multiplied by years of service. Repayment is tied to this formula. The benefit guarantee ceiling for participants in multiemployer plans is tied to a formula based on years of service. For a participant with 30 years of service, the guaranteed limit is $12,870. PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance received their full benefit, but only 49% would receive full benefits in plans needing assistance in the future. Among ongoing plans, the average benefit is almost twice as large as in terminated plans, indicating potential benefit reductions for participants in plans receiving PBGC financial assistance. PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. The trust fund and revolving funds are PBGC's main assets. At the end of FY2018, PBGC had assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion, resulting in a net financial position of -$51.4 billion. PBGC's main assets include its trust fund and revolving funds, while its main liabilities consist of future benefit payments and financial assistance to insolvent plans. PBGC has had a deficit at the end of each fiscal year since FY2002. PBGC has had a deficit at the end of each fiscal year since FY2002, with the single-employer program showing a surplus in FY2018 due to increased employer premiums. The multiemployer program is projected to become insolvent in FY2025, with a less than 1% chance of remaining solvent in FY2026. PBGC has reported deficits every year since FY2002. The multiemployer program is projected to become insolvent in FY2025, with less than a 1% chance of remaining solvent in FY2026. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015, with an average monthly payment of $536. In FY2015, approximately 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment with an average amount of $2,054. PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion in FY2018, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. The financial condition of the multiemployer insurance program has been worsening, with the deficit increasing from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017. In FY2018, 78 multiemployer plans received financial assistance, benefiting approximately 62,300 participants. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program increased from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017, before decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. This was due to the likelihood of insolvency of several large multiemployer pension plans in financial distress. PBGC's budgetary cash flows are based on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and the interaction of trust and revolving funds. Trust funds contain pension plan assets, while revolving funds contain premiums and transfers used for participants' benefits. PBGC manages trust funds with plan assets and revolving funds with premiums for participants' benefits. When PBGC becomes trustee of a pension plan, assets are transferred to a nonbudgetary trust fund managed by private-sector money managers. The trust fund investments totaled $70.2 billion in FY2018. The PBGC's investment policy allocates 30% to equities and 70% to fixed income assets. Trust fund investments were $70.2 billion in FY2018. Three revolving funds hold premiums from pension plan sponsors and trust fund transfers to pay benefits. Revolving funds are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with assets totaling $1.8 billion for Fund 1, $2.1 billion for Fund 2, and $29.3 billion for Fund 7 in FY2018. The PBGC's revolving funds, totaling $33.2 billion in assets at the end of FY2018, are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. These funds are on-budget accounts and their outlays include benefit payments and administrative expenses, while receipts come from premiums, interest, and reimbursements. Some stakeholders criticize recent premium increases, arguing they are used to offset federal spending and do not address PBGC's financial condition. PBGC's financial condition projections show a deficit in the multiemployer program by FY2025. The single-employer program is expected to have a surplus of $26 billion in 10 years. Critics argue that recent premium increases do not address PBGC's financial condition and may discourage employers from maintaining their pension plans. PBGC projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years. There is a high likelihood of insolvency for the multiemployer program due to several large pension plans. The program's exposure to financial assistance is estimated at $53.8 billion. Premium levels may not be enough to support insolvent plans, potentially exhausting PBGC's ability to guarantee benefits. Once resources are depleted, insolvent plans may need to reduce benefits to sustain through premium collections only. PBGC's multiemployer program faces insolvency risk due to large pension plans, with estimated financial assistance exposure of $53.8 billion. Insolvent plans may need to reduce benefits to sustain through premium collections only, improving PBGC's financial condition. Uncertainty remains on how MPRA provisions allowing benefit suspensions will be utilized. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to improve PBGC's financial condition. The committee did not release recommendations by the deadline. The Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans was tasked with improving PBGC's financial condition but did not release recommendations or legislative language by the November 30, 2018 deadline. Tables A-1 and A-2 provide historical data on single-employer and multiemployer program premium levels."
