    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 for a new base closure round in 2005. The closures and realignments from previous BRAC commissions have resulted in significant savings. The 1995 BRAC closures and realignments saved $16.7 billion with annual savings of $6.6 billion. Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two more closure rounds in 1999 and 2001 due to downsizing of base structure lagging behind force structure reductions. Force structure decreased by 33% since the first closure round. Secretary of Defense Cohen called for more base closures in 1999 and 2001 to align with force structure reductions. He emphasized the need for significant savings to fund future readiness and weapons acquisition programs. Without these savings, DOD would struggle to fulfill its missions and responsibilities. Secretary of Defense Cohen's plan for new rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001 to fund future readiness and weapons acquisition programs faced opposition on Capitol Hill, with concerns about economic and political fallout in districts. Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve the proposal for two more rounds of base closures. The Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly failed to approve a proposal for two more rounds of base closings in 1999 and 2001. Senator Carl Levin, along with other senators, pledged to push for more base closings to reduce excess infrastructure and fund new weapons. However, the full Senate voted against the initiative and supported a substitute amendment that delayed new base closings until the Department of Defense developed accurate cost measurement techniques. The substitute amendment required the Department of Defense to submit a cost/savings report to Congress in a timely manner for potential base closings in 2001. Opposition in the House National Security Committee, led by Representative Joel Hefley, questioned the actual savings of base closures due to high upfront costs. DOD officials claimed net savings starting in FY1996, but concerns were raised about the accuracy of these estimates. The DOD officials claimed net savings from base closures starting in FY1996, but concerns were raised about the accuracy of these estimates by Congressional opponents. Despite lack of support on Capitol Hill, senior DOD officials and the President continued to push for new rounds of base closures in the near future. The Defense Reform Initiative (DRI) included two additional rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming to save $2.8 billion annually. This was part of a broader effort to generate $6 billion in annual savings for priority weapons programs. The Defense Reform Initiative included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, with anticipated annual savings of $2.8 billion. This was part of a larger effort to save $6 billion annually through various actions, including outsourcing, paperless contracting, and reducing personnel. Support for more base closures came from a 1997 report urging quick action to restore the base realignment and closure process. The DOD-sponsored National Defense Panel urged Congress and the Defense Department to quickly restore the base realignment and closure process, calling for closures to begin earlier than the current 2001-2005 proposal. Secretary of Defense Cohen endorsed the panel's findings, emphasizing the importance of two additional BRAC rounds for financing and accelerating the transformation of U.S. military capabilities. President Clinton's actions regarding the closure of two Air Force maintenance depots were highly contentious. President Clinton opposed the closure of two Air Force maintenance depots, McClellan and Kelly, due to previous disproportionate effects on California and Texas. He proposed privatization-in-place to prevent job losses, but faced criticism for political meddling in the base closing process. President Clinton faced opposition for proposing privatization-in-place at the Air Force maintenance depots in California and Texas to prevent job losses. Legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah believed the plan deprived their local populations of jobs and left their depots vulnerable to closure in future base reductions. Resentment over Clinton's intervention persisted until the end of his second term. Some Members sought to block DOD from privatizing depot maintenance work at McClellan and Kelly air force bases. The House military readiness subcommittee approved an amendment prohibiting privatization unless the three remaining depots were operating at 80% capacity. The full House National Security Committee and Senate Armed Services approved similar depot language. Three depots were operating at 80% capacity, while others were at 50%. The House and Senate committees approved depot language, but faced opposition from Senators representing California and Texas. Efforts to remove depot-related restrictions in the defense authorization bill were unsuccessful. Senator Inhofe tried to restore depot restrictions in the Senate bill but withdrew the amendment before floor consideration. In the conference committee, the depot-related language in the House bill became a major obstacle to reaching final agreement on the FY1998 defense authorization bill. A resolution was achieved by Senate and House conferees and reported on October 23. Under the compromise agreement, the limit on depot competition was addressed. The compromise agreement on the FY1998 defense authorization bill was reached on October 23, increasing the limit on depot work by private contractors to 50%. The House passed the conference report on October 28, but the Senate debated the provisions on depot maintenance operations without reaching a final vote. The Senate finally reached an agreement on November 6. In November 1997, the Senate passed the FY1998 defense authorization bill after reaching a final agreement. The bill included provisions prohibiting new base closures until a report on costs and savings from previous closures was submitted. President Clinton signed the bill into law on November 18 (P.L. 105-85). The Department of Defense submitted a report to Congress in April 1998, ahead of the deadline set for base closure and realignment recommendations. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for new legislation, citing excess base structure and potential savings for modernization. The Department of Defense report highlighted the imbalance between force and base structures, with significant reductions in Navy ships and Army soldiers compared to base facilities. The closure costs of previous rounds were lower than estimated, with expected savings for modernization and readiness. The Department of Defense report stated that the closure costs of previous rounds were lower than estimated, with expected savings exceeding initial estimates. The report projected net total savings of $14 billion through 2001, with annual savings estimated at $5.6 billion thereafter. The Pentagon anticipated additional savings of $3 billion a year from new rounds of closures in 2001 and 2005. Congress required reviews from CBO and GAO on the accuracy of the report's findings. The Pentagon's report projected net total savings of $14 billion through 2001, with annual savings estimated at $5.6 billion thereafter. Additional savings of about $3 billion a year were expected from new rounds of closures in 2001 and 2005. Congress mandated reviews from CBO and GAO on the report's accuracy. Other features included a recommendation to follow previous base closure commissions' model and a statement on successful economic recovery in impacted communities. A controversial Air Force memo mentioned White House involvement in encouraging Lockheed Martin to pursue depot maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base. The White House deputy chief of staff attempted to influence Lockheed Martin to pursue depot maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base, sparking opposition from members who accused the Administration of meddling in the base closure process. Capitol Hill reacted strongly to the report's call for new base closure rounds, with widespread resistance from the House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senate Armed Services Committee was divided on the issue of new base closures, with a 10-8 vote defeating a proposed round in 2001. Senators McCain and Levin considered seeking support for an amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill but ultimately abandoned the initiative due to majority opposition. During Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill, an amendment was proposed to make it harder for the Pentagon to close bases. Sponsored by Senator James Inhofe, the amendment would have set new thresholds for base closures and realignments, as well as imposed a four-year restriction on closing bases after a realignment. Ultimately, the amendment was defeated with a 48-45 vote in the Senate. The Inhofe amendment proposed new thresholds for base closures, including a restriction on closing bases within four years after a realignment. It aimed to delay or block the Department of Defense from reducing civilian employees to less than 225 at bases with 750 personnel. Additionally, it expressed opposition to new closure rounds until previous actions were completed. The amendment was dropped from the FY1999 defense authorization bill during conference. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, finding that DOD's estimates of savings were consistent with its own estimates. CBO explained that BRAC savings are avoided costs, not actual expenditures, making it impossible to measure them directly. DOD can only estimate savings rather than measure them due to the nature of these costs. The DOD cannot observe or record avoided costs as actual expenditures, leading to the need for estimating savings instead of measuring them directly. The CBO noted a lack of analysis on data regarding potential base closures in future BRAC rounds. Difficulty in analyzing the impact on local communities and missing data on cost and savings estimates were also highlighted. The DOD had difficulty locating some requested data, including original cost and savings estimates for BRAC commissions. Estimates would be more accurate if they included environmental and caretaker costs for bases after the implementation period. The GAO review of DOD's report provided more detail than the CBO review, giving DOD good grades overall. The report was seen as a rough approximation of costs and savings, with DOD's data systems not capturing all associated savings. The GAO found that previous BRAC closure rounds resulted in substantial net savings, but noted that DOD's report provided a rough approximation of costs and savings. DOD's data systems do not capture all savings associated with BRAC actions. The report also highlighted that communities affected by prior BRAC actions are rebounding economically. Proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would be conducted similarly to prior rounds. The DOD's report suggests that proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would be conducted like prior rounds. A legislative proposal requesting authority for two additional BRAC rounds provides a starting point for future legislation. Senator John McCain sponsored a bill calling for two new rounds in 2001. Senator John McCain, along with Senator Carl Levin, sponsored a bill (S. 258) calling for two new rounds of BRAC in 2001 and 2003. Senator McCain highlighted the 23% excess capacity in DOD infrastructure and emphasized the potential billions of dollars in savings from closing and realigning bases. The bill proposed changes to the BRAC selection process, including starting and finishing two months later in 2001 to allow a new President to nominate commission members, and prohibiting privatization-in-place in closing installations. The bill sponsored by Senators McCain and Levin called for two new rounds of BRAC in 2001 and 2003, with changes to the selection process. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the importance of base closures to improve efficiency and save money, stating that wasteful spending on unneeded facilities was hindering military readiness. The proposed rounds were projected to save $20 billion. The proposed bill called for two new rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2003 to save money and improve military efficiency. Despite appeals, some Members of Congress opposed the idea due to constituent fears. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted against authorizing new closure rounds in the FY2000 defense authorization bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee rejected calls for two more closure rounds, blocking DOD's base closure initiative for the third year in a row. Despite attempts by Senators McCain and Levin, the Senate voted against authorizing new closure rounds in the FY2000 defense bill. With strong opposition in the House, DOD's base closure initiative was effectively halted for the year. The Administration's FY2000 DOD budget proposed closing more military bases in 2003 and 2005. The DOD's high priority initiative to close military bases in 2003 and 2005 was effectively blocked by Congress for the third year in a row. Secretary of Defense Cohen argued that closing more bases was necessary to save money for upgrading weapon systems and improving U.S. fighting forces. Congress rejected the amendment for new rounds of military base closures in 2003 and 2005, despite the Pentagon's argument that it would save money for upgrading weapon systems and improving U.S. fighting forces. Politics continued to play a role in the decision-making process. In the early stages of the 107th Congress, DOD sought authority for military base closures. Senators Levin and McCain introduced a bill for new rounds of closures in 2003 and 2005. Taxpayers for Common Sense supported the initiative, estimating potential savings of $21 billion by 2015. Senator Hutchison had a differing opinion on the matter. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison disagreed with the idea of closing more domestic military bases prematurely, citing increasing restrictions on U.S. military training in locations abroad. She pointed out past BRAC decisions that were considered mistakes, like at Reese Air Force Base, TX, and Fort Hood, TX. Despite this, the Department of Defense urged Congress to approve another round of base closures and realignments in 2001, highlighting excess capacity in the military infrastructure. The Department of Defense urged Congress to approve another round of base closures and realignments in 2001, proposing the Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001 (EFI) to reduce excess infrastructure. This initiative was based on the experience of Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX, where property was transferred to the local community and leased back to the base commander as needed. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a new round of base closures and realignments in 2001, following the Department of Defense's proposal based on the Efficient Facilities Initiative. The committee voted for a new round, which was ultimately approved by the full Senate, marking the first success in five years for proponents of base closure. The full Senate approved a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003 by a margin of 53 to 47, marking the first success in five years for proponents of base closure. General Henry H. Shelton and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the need to convert excess capacity into war-fighting ability, while opponents argued that the current war on terrorism and uncertain economy made it the worst time to start closing bases. Opponents of the proposal argued that the current war on terrorism and uncertain economy made it the worst time to start closing bases. Minority Leader Trent Lott expressed concerns about calling up reserves while considering base closures. Supporters emphasized the importance of providing resources for the military to combat terrorism, trusting the Commander-in-Chief and defense officials. No base-closing language was included in the House of Representatives FY2002 defense authorization bill. The House and Senate leaders stood by their positions on base closures, causing a stalemate in passing the defense bill. After weeks of negotiations, a compromise was reached on December 10, 2001, and the President signed the defense authorization bill (P.L. 107-107) on December 28, 2001. John McCain warned of a potential veto by the President on the defense bill. Senior negotiators reached a compromise on December 10, 2001, and the President signed the defense authorization bill (P.L. 107-107) on December 28, 2001. The conference report made important changes to the 1990 BRAC Act language, including extending the authority for a new round in 2005 and requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit force structure plans. The defense authorization bill (P.L. 107-107) in 2001 made changes to the 1990 BRAC Act, extending the authority for a new round in 2005. The Secretary of Defense was required to submit force structure plans, review military installations, and certify the need for closure and realignment based on military value and cost savings. The commission was also modified to increase members to 9 and allow the Secretary of Defense to testify before it. The 2001 defense authorization bill made changes to the 1990 BRAC Act, extending the authority for a new round in 2005. The commission was modified to increase members to 9 and allow the Secretary of Defense to testify before it. The process of closing or realigning military installations must prioritize military value. Privatization-in-place of closed or realigned bases is prohibited unless recommended by the commission. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld secured approval from Congress for a new round of base closures in 2005. Communities near military bases are concerned about their survival and are implementing defensive and offensive strategies to retain or acquire military units/functions. Community leaders near military bases are implementing defensive and offensive strategies to retain or acquire military units/functions, with a focus on preventing range encroachment that could de-value installations and lead to closure in 2005. If range encroachment near military bases continues, installations may be de-valued and at risk of closure in 2005. The BRAC commission process includes criteria publication, nomination deadlines, presidential approval, and congressional review."
