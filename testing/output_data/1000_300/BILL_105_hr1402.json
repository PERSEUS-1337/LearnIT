    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on Probabilistic Methods Act\". The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integration of these methods in business practices has saved billions for companies. Federal use of probabilistic methods lags behind industry, but they offer better understanding of safety and environmental risks, leading to more business-friendly regulations. Incorporating probabilistic methods in federally funded design efforts could enhance product specifications. Properly applied probabilistic methods can lead to more business-friendly regulations and reduce overdesign and associated costs in federally funded design efforts. The Department of Transportation could benefit from using probabilistic methods to create more reliable and less costly components for transportation systems, benefiting other Federal agencies as well. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish a Commission on Probabilistic Methods to improve regulations and reduce costs in design efforts. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify ways to help the Department of Transportation, assess how these methods can improve ROI and public safety, evaluate technology, recommend techniques for practical use, establish models for quantifying uncertainties, identify key technology areas for development, and recommend implementation guidelines. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods for the Department of Transportation will recommend guidelines for implementing probabilistic technology, setting reliability levels for public safety, safety testing, creating databases, expediting technology transfer, addressing legal and cultural barriers, and ensuring appropriate use of probabilistic methods in decision-making. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods for the Department of Transportation will recommend guidelines for implementing probabilistic technology, addressing legal and cultural barriers, and making recommendations for the use of probabilistic methods in Department of Transportation programs. They will also recommend pilot projects for evaluation of probabilistic methods technology. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 19 members, including a chairperson from an engineering society with experience in probabilistic methods, representatives from higher education, government, industry, labor, environmental community, public interest, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, and National Institutes of Health. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, including representatives from various sectors. Members serve for life and vacancies are filled as per original appointment. They serve without pay but receive travel expenses as per regulations. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, serving without pay but receiving travel expenses. A quorum is 10 members, with the initial meeting to occur within 180 days. Within 6 months of the initial meeting, the Commission must provide an agenda to the Administrator. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. The Department of Transportation will provide administrative support to the Commission as needed. The Commission can hire experts and consultants and obtain official data from government agencies. They can also use the United States mails. SEC. 7. REPORTS.\n\nThe Commission must submit an interim report to the Administrator within 2 years of its initial meeting and a final report within 36 months. The final report will include findings, conclusions, and recommendations.\n\nSEC. 8. TERMINATION.\n\nThe Commission will end 10 days after submitting the final report. The Federal Advisory Committee Act's termination rules do not apply.\n\nSEC. 9. BUDGET ACT COMPLIANCE. The Commission will terminate 10 days after submitting its final report. The Federal Advisory Committee Act's termination rules do not apply. Any spending authority authorized by this Act is effective only as provided in appropriation Acts."
