    "content": "The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were set to expire at the end of 2010. This included lower rates for long-term capital gains and dividends. Without legislative action, capital gains tax rates would have increased to 20% and dividends would be taxed at ordinary rates. President Obama proposed to retain lower rates for middle-income taxpayers but increase rates for higher-income earners. The tax rates were extended until the end of 2012. The tax rates for capital gains and dividends were temporarily extended through 2012, with higher rates for married couples earning over $250,000 and singles over $200,000. In 2013, higher-income individuals were taxed at even higher rates, with thresholds set at $480,050 for couples and $453,350 for singles in 2018. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes depends on behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is strongly affected by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. The Obama Administration estimated in February 2010 that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion of revenue in FY2019. However, based on Congressional Budget Office projections in January 2010, the current effective capital gains tax was 13.3% in 2008 and would have increased to 17.9% in 2019, resulting in a revenue difference of $40 billion. Assumptions about behavioral responses are the main reason for the reduction in projected revenues. Some propose applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued to address potential behavioral responses and increase tax revenue. This approach aims to eliminate the realization response for affected assets and could involve look-back treatment for assets that are less easily valued. However, these changes come with complexities and limitations on options for increasing taxes on realized capital gains. The tax on capital gains was imposed on an accrual basis, leading to complexities in addressing behavioral responses. Realization responses in revenue projections were discussed in the late 1980s, affecting revenue estimates. The analysis suggests that current projections may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. The analysis suggests that current projections may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire due to potential realizations responses. Taxpayers can delay realizations to avoid taxes, leading to a reduction in potential revenue. Capital gains realizations responses are typically negative elasticities, impacting revenue estimates. The elasticity of capital gains realizations responses is crucial in determining the impact of tax rate changes. A higher elasticity value indicates a smaller revenue gain or loss from a tax increase or decrease. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase gains revenue; if it is greater than one, the tax increase loses revenue. The elasticity of capital gains realizations determines the impact of tax rate changes. A higher elasticity value means a smaller revenue gain or loss from a tax increase or decrease. Three types of elasticities are relevant: permanent elasticity for long-term responses, short-run elasticity for short-term responses, and the ratio of revenue gain projected to the gain realized with no behavioral response. The permanent elasticity measures the longer-term response to a permanent tax rate change, while the short-run elasticity measures the short-term response. The transitory elasticity captures the response to temporary tax changes, influenced by varying incomes and tax planning strategies. Taxpayers may shift realizations to take advantage of lower tax rates, impacting revenue projections. When taxpayers anticipate a tax increase next year, they may accelerate realizations to benefit from the current lower tax rate. Short-term effects of tax changes pose challenges in estimation and influence immediate responses. The short-term realizations elasticity, often discussed in the context of capital gains tax cuts, can lead to increased realizations in the first year or two. However, recent increases in realizations may dampen this short-term response. The short-term response to tax changes can lead to a larger increase in realizations in the first year or two. However, recent increases in realizations may dampen this short-term effect. It is unlikely for a tax increase that is not pre-announced to cause a similar contraction in realizations as a tax cut would unleash short-term realizations. The short-term response to tax changes can lead to a larger increase in realizations in the first year or two. A tax increase that is not pre-announced is unlikely to cause a contraction in realizations as a tax cut would unleash short-term realizations. Transitory responses occur due to temporary changes in tax rates, with examples in 1986 and 2012. In 2012, a significant increase in tax rates led to transitory responses among higher-income taxpayers with fluctuating income. Prior to 1987, capital gains subject to graduated rates saw pronounced transitory responses. Elasticities of realizations responses are based on functional forms, with the percentage change in gains divided by the percentage change in tax rates rising proportionally with the tax rate. The discussion in the 1990 debate focused on the elasticities of capital gains realizations in relation to tax rates. Elasticities are expected to be negative, but in this report, they are stated in absolute value. The revenue-maximizing tax rate is where the most capital gains tax revenue is realized, with the 22% rate being a starting point for considering tax increases. The underlying equations are provided in Appendix A. The 22% rate is considered a starting point for tax increases to maximize capital gains tax revenue. Additional taxes include a 3.8% net investment income tax for high-income taxpayers. The overall marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains is estimated to be around 21.2% to 21.3%. Dividends are taxed at a slightly lower marginal rate of 18.4%. The George H. W. Bush Administration proposed to reduce the capital gains tax rate in 1990, increasing it from 20% to 28% by taxing capital gains as ordinary income. Revenue-estimating agencies began investigating behavioral responses and realizations elasticities in the late 1980s. The issue of revenue cost was crucial due to strict budget constraints at that time. The Congressional Budget Office included tax variables in their regressions to forecast capital gains revenues in 1990. The Administration and JTC used different elasticities to estimate realizations response, using aggregate time series and micro-data studies. Estimates of realizations response varied dramatically, ranging from 0.3 to almost 4, with implications for revenue. Elasticities of 0.3 to 4 show potential revenue gains or losses based on tax rate changes. Aggregate time series estimates were lower, while individual taxpayer data showed a wider range of responses. Estimates of realizations response varied widely, ranging from 0.3 to 3.8 based on individual taxpayer data. The range of estimated responses raised concerns about the reliability of estimation methods. The Treasury and JCT differed in their preferred methodologies for estimating elasticity. Individual data is generally preferred over aggregation for more accurate estimation. The challenges in estimating realizations response are discussed in detail in Appendix B. Using individual data is preferred for estimation to avoid bias and information loss. It is difficult to control for changing factors over time, especially in distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses. Timing realizations to coincide with low tax rates and cashing in assets during periods of low income are concerns that complicate estimation. Larger elasticities close to 4 from micro-data studies were not relied upon by revenue-estimating entities. The concern of timing realizations to coincide with low tax rates and cashing in assets during periods of low income complicates estimation. Panel data studies reported smaller elasticities, but still above one in some cases, influencing the Treasury to choose a larger elasticity than suggested by aggregate time series. The panel studies available at the time influenced the Treasury to choose a larger elasticity than suggested by aggregate time series data. However, panel studies may not fully correct for transitory effects, as periods of lower or higher income can persist for several years. While panel studies offer some control over transitory effects, the available panels were limited to a few years. The panel studies available were limited to a few years, which may not fully correct for transitory effects on income. Despite efforts to reduce biases in estimates, neither panel nor time-series approaches were flawless. Proposed tax cuts were not enacted at the time, but realizations elasticities remained broad, prompting researchers to seek more precise estimates. Researchers focused on improving methods for estimating capital gains taxes after a significant increase in realizations in 1986. The spike in realizations, particularly in December of that year, raised concerns about the accuracy of econometric studies in capturing transitory responses. Subsequent academic studies from 1990 onwards further examined the realizations response to tax changes. Eleven additional academic econometric studies on realizations response have been identified since 1990, with estimates by CBO, JCT, and Treasury included in Table 1. CBO's estimate is not for revenue estimation but part of a statistical study projecting capital gains realizations. The coefficient in Table 1, when multiplied by the tax rate, gives the elasticity. Studies are ranked by elasticity, with results from Gravelle's non-econometric study also included. The studies in Table 1, ranked by elasticity, include results from Gravelle's non-econometric study. Gravelle's study found a limit to the realizations response, with a maximum elasticity of 0.5, below estimates from other studies. The study analyzed data on realizations to accruals ratio and tax rates over a long period, estimating the upper limit of realizations elasticity at 0.5. This limit is lower than estimates from other studies and suggests that individuals would sell every asset annually in the absence of taxes and transaction costs. However, the actual elasticity is likely lower due to investors' satisfaction with their investments and reluctance to sell certain assets like controlling shares, family businesses, and real estate. The study from 1991 analyzed data from 1954 to 1989, estimating a 46% realizations to accruals level and an 18.4% tax rate. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 shows a 48% ratio and a 17.3% tax rate, supporting previous findings. The highest coefficient suggests that without taxes and costs, realizations could increase by 4.25 times their current value. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study found that eliminating taxes and costs could increase realizations by 4.25 times their current value. The study also corrected the elasticity for the 1980s panel study, showing an elasticity of 3.2. Panel studies, time series, and cross-state aggregate panel studies were included in the research, with the Burman and Randolph study using state tax rates to estimate a small and statistically insignificant elasticity. The Burman and Randolph study used state tax rates to estimate a small and statistically insignificant elasticity, while subsequent studies like Auten and Joulfaian and Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen found higher elasticities. Most subsequent studies incorporated state tax rates. The Auten and Joulfaian study and the Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study had the highest elasticities. These studies added state tax rates and had longer panels, making time series effects more important. Their estimates likely reflect transitory, timing responses rather than permanent responses. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study also provided sensitivity analysis, resulting in a wide range of estimates. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study conducted sensitivity analysis, producing a wide range of estimates based on different specifications, variables, and time periods. Adding more years to time series data resulted in lower elasticities, with all results falling within the range of the eight time series studies. The Eichner and Sinai studies added more years to time series data, showing lower elasticities. Results fell within the range of eight time series studies from the 1980s. One study used Australian data, while state studies by Bogart and Gentry and Bakija and Gentry had slightly higher results than the Gravelle study's upper limit. Bakija and Gentry's study on state variation in response to time controls showed slightly higher results than the Gravelle study's upper limit. The inclusion of state fixed effects was found to be important, with coefficients rising from 2.91 to 3.88 without them. The elasticities in their study were lower compared to studies from the 1980s, with JCT and Treasury estimates now being of similar magnitude. The Treasury and JCT estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains appear high and likely understate potential revenue gains. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for a five percentage point increase in the tax rate for 2019, based on CBO projections. Adjusting for short-term gains taxed at ordinary rates, the estimated revenue is $180 billion, lower than CBO's $199 billion projection. The CBO's estimates for 2019 revenue of $199 billion and average marginal tax rate of 21.2% are adjusted down to $180 billion to reflect short-term gains taxed at ordinary rates. The revenue gain for a five-percentage-point tax rate increase ranges from $31.4 billion to $1 billion, showing interest in measures like accrual-based taxation with a look-back method to increase capital gains revenues. The look-back method could increase capital gains revenues significantly, potentially collecting $222 billion on unrealized gains in a steady state. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study is considered reliable but may overstate the permanent elasticity, while the Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced the largest elasticity. The Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced the largest elasticity in time series elements, exceeding Gravelle's upper limit estimate. Eichner and Sinai's results suggest a lower elasticity below 0.5, indicating potential revenue gains from the look-back method. The elasticity is likely below 0.5, suggesting that revenue gains from increasing the tax rate by five percentage points may be underestimated. Post-1980s econometric studies and the limits study indicate revenue gains, with projections potentially three times larger than JCT estimates. JCT's projections may likely understate revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates. The appendix explains the method of calculating taxes under the look-back method using a semi-log function. It estimates the elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes, suggesting that revenue gains from increasing the tax rate may be underestimated. The appendix discusses the calculation of taxes using a semi-log function to estimate revenue gains from tax rate increases. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes is highlighted, indicating potential underestimation of revenue gains. If equation (4) is logged and differentiated, the result is dR/r = dt/t (1-bt). The revenue maximizing tax rate is where (1-bt) equals zero, which is equal to 1/b. Calculating Taxes under the Look-Back Method involves adjusting basis to achieve the same net on a sale as if the tax had been paid on an accrual basis. The growth rate g can be determined using the formula g = (S/B) (1/T) -1. To determine the growth rate g for calculating taxes on an accrual basis, use the formula g = (S/B) (1/T) -1. Equating the gain on realization with the new basis to the gain on accrual, the formula for finding the new basis B* is provided. Additionally, elasticities from econometric studies in the 1980s are discussed in Table B-1, influencing realizations response during the 1990 debate. The 1980s econometric studies influenced realizations response during the 1990 debate. Studies categorized by approach, facing challenges in relating capital gains realizations to tax rates. Debate over data type: aggregate time series vs individual taxpayer data. Aggregate time series examines economy-wide realizations over time compared to tax rates. Individual taxpayer data relates individual realizations to tax rates. The debate over data type for studying capital gains realizations includes aggregate time series and individual taxpayer data. Aggregate time series results were smaller and more consistent, while individual taxpayer data varied more. It is preferable to use individual data as aggregate data can lead to a loss of information and bias results. The use of aggregate data for studying capital gains realizations can lead to a loss of information and bias results. Changes in transactions costs and a disconnect between asset prices and accruals may cause estimates to be overstated. Problems with individual data sets have led many researchers to believe that aggregate time series results are more reliable. The effective capital gains tax rate, used as an explanatory variable, is actually influenced by realizations themselves. The effective capital gains tax rate is an endogenous variable influenced by realizations. Different techniques can be used to address this econometric problem, such as using first dollar tax rate, maximum statutory rates, predicted gains, or instrumental variables methods. Endogeneity issues are more severe in individual cross-section data compared to aggregate time series data. The endogeneity of the explanatory variable is more severe in individual cross-section data compared to aggregate time series data. The issue of distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses in individual data arises due to fluctuations in income and tax rates over time. Attempts to address this problem with panel studies may not fully correct for the transitory effect. Studies since the 1980s have attempted to address the issue of fluctuating income and tax rates by using panel studies. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) found varying elasticities in their six-year small panel study. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) conducted a six-year small panel study replicating previous research on income and tax rate elasticities. They found large elasticities, with some exceeding 5, confirming issues with previous studies. Their results also highlighted problems with short panels and showed significant variation over time periods. The study estimated a regression linking differences in realizations and tax rates, obtaining large but statistically insignificant results. The methodology used was criticized and excluded from further analysis. Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extended a previous time series analysis, making changes in approaches and using instrumental variables techniques. The authors made three changes to improve the regression analysis. They used taxes on predicted gains as an instrument, which increased the coefficient and elasticity. They also suggested using the maximum tax rate as an instrument and differencing the data, resulting in higher elasticities but not statistically significant results. The authors used taxes on predicted gains and the maximum tax rate as instruments in the regression analysis, resulting in higher elasticities but not statistically significant results. Excluding 1986, the estimated elasticities ranged from 0.75 to 1.18. The choice between predicted gains rate and maximum rate as an instrument remains a crucial issue. The authors used taxes on predicted gains and the maximum tax rate as instruments in the regression analysis, resulting in higher elasticities but not statistically significant results. The choice between predicted gains rate and maximum rate as an instrument remains a crucial issue due to changes in the law over time. Burman and Randolph (1994) reported a coefficient of 3.4 in their study, highlighting the challenges of using the maximum rate as an instrument. The Burman and Randolph study from 1994 innovatively separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates. They found an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate, showing how taxpayers with different income levels were affected. The authors separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates, finding an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate. They also estimated a transitory elasticity of 6.45. Subsequent studies also used state tax rates to analyze taxpayer responses. The study analyzed taxpayer responses to state tax rates from 1979 to 1990, reporting an elasticity of 0.65. Auerbach and Siegel replicated the results from 1985 to 1994, finding an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate, estimated to be around 25%. Based on evidence from other sources, the tax rate is likely around 25%. The coefficient suggests an elasticity of 0.25 at a 22% rate, similar to previous findings. Auerbach and Siegel also report a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 compared to 0.33, but their approach may introduce a transitory element to the tax rate. The elasticity coefficient of 1.126 is reported in Table 1, with Auerbach and Siegel providing separate regressions for different taxpayer groups. Eichner and Sinai's study extends time series analysis through 1997, excluding 1986 to find a coefficient of 2.28, indicating an elasticity of 0.5. Excluding 1997 is also considered. Eichner and Sinai (2000) extended time series analysis through 1997, excluding 1986 and possibly 1997. The coefficient ranged from 2.18 to 5.13, with elasticities varying from 0.48 to 1.13. Different specifications were tried, including an instrumental variables method using the top marginal tax rate. The analysis by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) used a longer micro-data panel over 17 years to estimate permanent and transitory effects of tax rates. They found that using marginal tax rates and changes in tax rates led to elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46, but with many coefficients not statistically significant. Due to the instability of these specifications, a coefficient of 2.28 was reported in Table 1. The analysis by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) used a longer micro-data panel over 17 years to estimate permanent and transitory effects of tax rates. Their estimate is lower than most estimates from the 1980s, with an elasticity of 0.72 at a 20% tax rate and 0.79 at a 22% tax rate. Evans (2009) conducted a basic cross-section regression study with different specifications, resulting in various elasticities. The Evans study conducted a cross-section regression analysis with different specifications, yielding elasticities typically between 2 and 5. Bakija and Gentry (2014) utilized a 50-year panel of state data to examine changes in combined federal and state tax rates. The study by Bakija and Gentry (2014) analyzed changes in tax rates using a 50-year state panel data with fixed effects to control for differences across states. Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) used a 10-year panel for their study, but their estimates of elasticities may be affected by transitory effects. The study by Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) uses a 10-year panel with year-fixed effects to control for transitory effects from law changes. Minas, Lim, and Evans (2018) conducted an aggregate time series study with Australian data from 1988 to 2015, including controls for GDP, inflation, and the stock market index.
