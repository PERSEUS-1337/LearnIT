    "content": "The report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress through two legislative vehicles: The Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018. These provisions address forest management on federal and nonfederal lands, as well as forestry research. This report focuses on forest management provisions related to federal lands, specifically the National Forest System (NFS) and public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). It discusses changes in how the Forest Service (FS) and BLM manage their respective lands, totaling 193 million acres and 246 million acres, respectively. The report also provides background information on the NFS, BLM's public lands, and key laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA). The report summarizes forest management provisions for federal lands, including the National Forest System (NFS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands. It covers laws like NEPA and HFRA, discussing changes made by the 115th Congress in project planning, fire management, restoration programs, and more. The report highlights potential issues for Congress in each category. The report discusses forest management provisions for federal lands, including the National Forest System (NFS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands. It covers various programs and issues, summarizes changes made by the 115th Congress, and highlights potential issues for Congress. The Appendix contains side-by-side tables comparing forest-related provisions in each law to prior law. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre NFS consists of forests and woodlands, with Congress directing management to protect watersheds and provide a continuous timber supply. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System (NFS) consists of forests and woodlands. Congress directed management to protect watersheds, provide a continuous timber supply, and authorized the sale of certain trees. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 added recreation, livestock grazing, energy development, and wildlife protection as official uses of national forests, in addition to timber production. Management is to be coordinated for multiple uses and sustained yield. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) requires the Forest Service to prepare and update comprehensive land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit. Plans must be developed and revised with public involvement and comply with cross-cutting laws such as NEPA, Endangered Species Act, and National Historic Preservation Act. Forest plans must comply with cross-cutting laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. They describe desired resource conditions but do not authorize specific on-the-ground actions. Projects, such as timber harvests and trail maintenance, implement the forest plan and must align with resource objectives. Projects must follow FS procedures to ensure compliance with applicable requirements. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, primarily in the western United States, with approximately 38 million acres of woodlands and forests. These lands are managed under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, similar to the NFS. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) are also included in this management. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) Lands in western Oregon are managed for permanent forest production under the principle of sustained yield, providing timber, protecting watersheds, offering recreational opportunities, and supporting local economies. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) directs the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to prepare and maintain comprehensive resource management plans for these lands. FLPMA directs BLM to prepare and maintain resource management plans for Oregon and California Railroad Lands. On-the-ground activities must align with these plans and comply with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts before final decisions. Impacts determine if an EIS or EA is needed for compliance. The preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required to assess the impacts of proposed actions on the human environment. Agencies may also conduct an environmental assessment (EA) to determine the need for an EIS or issue a finding of no significant impact (FONSI). Evaluating impacts and alternatives, including a no-action alternative, is essential for decision-making. Categorical exclusions (CEs) exempt actions with minimal environmental effects from EIS or EA requirements. Under NEPA regulations, categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions with minimal environmental impact that do not require an EIS or EA. Agencies like FS and BLM have established CEs based on past experience, with some CEs set by Congress. Agencies may decide on additional documentation for CEs, with FS distinguishing between actions needing further documentation or a decision memorandum. Each federal agency has its own procedures for implementing NEPA and identifying CEs. In their agency-specific procedures, federal agencies have identified actions that require further analysis in an EA or EIS due to extraordinary circumstances like flood plains, endangered species habitats, and archaeological sites. These actions may preclude the use of a categorical exclusion. Federal agencies have identified various extraordinary circumstances such as flood plains, endangered species habitats, and archaeological sites that may prevent the use of a categorical exclusion for certain projects. The NEPA process helps identify potential environmental impacts and additional requirements, serving as a compliance umbrella for agencies. Compliance with NEPA may trigger further environmental review and consultation under laws like ESA and NHPA. The NEPA process identifies project impacts that may require additional environmental review under laws like ESA and NHPA. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk. HFRA defined hazardous fuel reduction projects for expedited planning on federal lands, covering up to 20 million acres. At-Risk Community is defined as an area with infrastructure at risk from large-scale wildfires. Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) involve methods such as prescribed fire, wildland fire use, and mechanical methods to reduce hazardous fuels. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes are terms used to prioritize and assess fuel reduction projects based on historical fire patterns. The Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) refers to areas where infrastructure is at risk from large-scale wildfires. The Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) is an area near at-risk communities where hazardous fuel reduction projects can be conducted. These projects target areas with significant departure from historical fire regimes, damaged land, or habitats threatened by wildfire. Designated wilderness areas are explicitly excluded from HFRA projects. HFRA projects focus on hazardous fuel reduction in at-risk areas, excluding designated wilderness areas. Projects must align with land management plans and prioritize thinning, prescribed fire, and tree removal to modify fire behavior while retaining large or old-growth trees for fire resiliency. An objection process is in place for proposed HFRA projects. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) focuses on reducing hazardous fuels in at-risk areas by thinning small-diameter trees and retaining large or old-growth trees for fire resiliency. An objection process allows for review of proposed HFRA projects within 30 days of draft decision documents being published, with limited objections accepted only from parties who submitted specific comments during comment periods. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) requires a pre-decisional objection process for all Forest Service projects. If an objector is unsatisfied after administrative review, they can seek judicial review in federal court. Only issues raised during public comments and administrative review can be considered in judicial proceedings. Congress mandated the use of the pre-decisional objection process for all FS projects, with some differences between HFRA and non-HFRA projects. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) requires a pre-decisional objection process for all Forest Service projects. The Chief of the Forest Service may declare a non-HFRA project an emergency situation and proceed directly to implementation. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added a new Section 602 to HFRA, authorizing the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS. The Forest Service designates insect and disease treatment areas based on declining forest health, risk of tree mortality, or hazard trees. Approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide have been designated. Projects within these areas aim to reduce insect or disease infestations and increase resilience. Projects initiated before FY2018 are considered hazardous fuel reduction projects and must follow HFRA's objections process. Collaboration with state and local entities is required for project development. Projects initiated before FY2018 are considered hazardous fuel reduction projects under HFRA. They must follow HFRA's objections process, involve collaboration with state and local entities, consider the best available science, and prioritize the retention of old-growth and large trees. Projects within the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) require analysis of the proposed action and one alternative, while projects outside the WUI must also consider a no-action alternative. The Forest Service is authorized to identify eligible NFS areas for designation as I&D areas, prioritize projects, and implement them through an expedited process. As of March 2019, 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states have been proposed under these authorities, with 20 evaluated using EA analysis procedures and three using an EIS. The Forest Service has proposed 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states under expedited authorities. 20 projects were evaluated using EA analysis procedures, three using an EIS, and the remaining 183 using a CE. The 2014 farm bill added a new Section 603 to HFRA, specifying certain projects as categorically excluded from NEPA requirements, including actions to reduce insect or disease infestations within I&D areas. Projects eligible for the 2014 Farm Bill CE must comply with CFLRP requirements or consider the best available science, prioritize old-growth tree retention, and involve a collaborative transparent process. New permanent roads are not allowed, and temporary roads must be removed within three years of project completion. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are permitted. Projects eligible for the 2014 Farm Bill CE must comply with CFLRP requirements, prioritize old-growth tree retention, and involve a collaborative transparent process. New permanent roads are not allowed, and temporary roads must be removed within three years of project completion. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres and must be located within designated I&D areas or in areas classified as Condition Classes 2 or 3 in Fire Regime Group I, II, or III. FS policy requires documenting decisions using a decision memorandum after assessing resource conditions for extraordinary circumstances. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill made changes to FS and BLM planning and project implementation requirements. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill amended FS and BLM planning requirements, expanding HFRA authorities to include fuel and fire breaks for wildfire prevention. Projects may now be planned and implemented under HFRA procedures, requiring analysis of alternatives based on location. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized procedures for priority projects in I&D areas, including hazardous fuels reduction projects. It also established a new statutory NEPA CE and made changes to interagency consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The 2018 farm bill and the omnibus bill established new statutory CEs to expedite specific projects, with provisions affecting interagency consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The omnibus bill created a CE for wildfire resilience projects for FS, while the farm bill established a CE for projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat for both FS and BLM. The potential impact of these new CEs on project planning, implementation, and forest management goals is uncertain. The Farm Bill CE allows for larger projects to be planned and implemented more efficiently, potentially achieving landscape-level goals. A 2014 Government Accountability Office report found that using a CE reduced the time for environmental review, leading to faster project implementation. The 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the Forest Service (FS) took 177 days on average to complete CEs, compared to 565 days for EAs in FY2012. FS used CEs less frequently from FY2008 to FY2012, leading to longer completion times. Concerns exist about conducting large projects without detailed environmental reviews, but the Wildfire Resilience CE established in FY2018 aims to address this for hazardous fuel reduction projects within designated areas on NFS. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established in FY2018, allows for hazardous fuel reduction projects within designated areas on NFS lands. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or focus on retaining old-growth and large trees for resiliency. Decision to use the Farm Bill CE must be documented through a decision memo, considering any significant environmental effects. New permanent roads are not allowed for these projects. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established in FY2018, allows hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands within designated areas. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or focus on retaining old-growth and large trees for resiliency. Projects cannot establish new permanent roads, and temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres and must be located within I&D areas or in areas with very high wildfire hazard potential. The Secretary must submit an annual report on the use of CEs to specified committees and GAO. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established in FY2018, allows hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS lands within designated areas with very high wildfire hazard potential. Projects must comply with specific requirements, including limitations on project size and location. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report on the use of CEs to specified committees and GAO. The Wildfire Resilience CE prioritizes projects in the WUI with high wildfire hazard potential, while the Farm Bill CE is broader, addressing insect and disease infestation. The Wildfire Resilience CE requires evaluation of extraordinary circumstances, potentially leading to further analysis through an EA or EIS. The Farm Bill CE requires assessment of extraordinary circumstances for projects aimed at protecting, restoring, or improving sage-grouse and/or mule-deer habitat. Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill mandates the establishment of a CE for NFS and BLM lands within one year of enactment, with specific requirements for habitat projects in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The Farm Bill CE mandates the establishment of a CE for NFS and BLM lands within one year of enactment. Projects must protect, restore, or improve habitat in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem for either species, or both if located in mule deer and sage-grouse habitat. Activities include removal of nonnative vegetation, targeted grazing, and herbicide use. Projects are restricted from designated wilderness areas and new permanent roads. The Farm Bill CE mandates projects on NFS and BLM lands to protect, restore, or improve habitat in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Projects are restricted from designated wilderness areas and new permanent roads. Projects must not exceed 4,500 acres and temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Agencies must consider landscape-scale habitat projects, population declines, and develop a 20-year monitoring plan before using the CE. The Farm Bill CE mandates projects on NFS and BLM lands to protect, restore, or improve habitat in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Projects are restricted from designated wilderness areas and new permanent roads. The agencies must consider landscape-scale habitat projects, population declines, and develop a 20-year monitoring plan before using the CE. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve endangered species and their ecosystems, administered by FWS and NMFS. Individual species of plants and animals are protected under the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). It allows for the listing of endangered or threatened species and imposes prohibitions to protect them. Federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure actions do not harm listed species or their habitats. Federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure actions do not harm listed species or their habitats. A Section 7 consultation is required if an action might adversely affect a listed species. If the action is found to not jeopardize a species or its critical habitat, a biological opinion is issued with terms and conditions for the action to proceed. The Secretary issues a biological opinion specifying terms and conditions for federal actions to avoid harm to listed species or critical habitat. Consultations mostly result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives. FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land management plans. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land management plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. The law specifies conditions for updating forest plans in relation to species listing or critical habitat designation under the ESA. These changes have sparked controversy as they set a new precedent for ESA implementation. The FY2018 omnibus made controversial changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. Some argue that the changes override a Ninth Circuit Court decision, providing more flexibility in plan implementation and reducing delays. The FY2018 omnibus made controversial changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. The exceptions in the law would allow for changes in plans after a certain time, reflecting changes to listed species and their critical habitat. Critics argue that not allowing for consultation due to changes in listing species and critical habitat could harm species and their habitat. Proponents argue that projects under a plan still require consultation, making plan consultation redundant. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. Critics argue that not allowing consultation for changes in listed species and critical habitat could harm species and their habitat. Proponents argue that projects under a plan still require consultation, making plan consultation redundant. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include fuel reduction, preparedness, prevention, detection, response, suppression, and recovery activities. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill contained provisions that changed how Congress appropriates funding for wildfire suppression, added requirements for wildfire risk mapping, and specific reporting requirements. The FY2018 omnibus bill made changes to consultation requirements for forest plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. Critics argue that not allowing consultation for changes in listed species and critical habitat could harm species and their habitat. Proponents argue that projects under a plan still require consultation, making plan consultation redundant. The bill also added specific requirements for wildfire risk mapping and reporting, as well as changes to FS and DOI's hazardous fuel reduction programs. Congress provides discretionary appropriations for wildland fire management to both FS and DOI through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funding for DOI is provided to the department, which then allocates the funding to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies\u2014BLM, the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Funding for wildland fire management is provided to both FS and DOI through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The funding is allocated to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies\u2014BLM, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Suppression Operations program within FS's and DOI's Wildland Fire Management account funds wildfire control on federal land, including firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, and post-wildfire response programs. If suppression funding is depleted, funds can be transferred from other accounts to cover firefighting costs. Overall, appropriations for wildland fire management have increased significantly since the 1990s, with a large portion of the increase going towards rising suppression costs. The Forest Service (FS) and Department of the Interior (DOI) often require more suppression funds than what is allocated to them, leading to \"fire borrowing\" from other accounts. This practice has raised concerns that increased suppression spending may negatively impact other agency programs. Congress typically enacts supplemental appropriations to repay the transferred funds and replenish the agencies' wildfire budgets. In response to concerns about fire borrowing and the impact of increased suppression spending on other agency programs, Congress has enacted supplemental appropriations to replenish wildfire accounts. The 115th Congress established a new mechanism for suppression funding in the FY2018 omnibus, known as the wildfire funding fix, to address these issues. The 115th Congress established the wildfire funding fix (\u00a7102(a)) to address concerns about fire borrowing and increased suppression spending. Discretionary spending is subject to statutory limits under the Budget Control Act of 2011, with sequestration enforcing limits through automatic budget authority cancellations. Certain spending, like emergency requirements and disaster relief, is exempt from these limits. The FY2018 omnibus amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to include a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations starting in FY2020. This adjustment covers emergency aspects of wildland firefighting, emergency management activities, and necessary funds for repayment of costs. It applies to appropriations exceeding the 10-year average spending level for wildfires. The FY2018 omnibus amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to include a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations starting in FY2020. This adjustment covers emergency aspects of wildland firefighting, emergency management activities, and necessary funds for repayment of costs. It applies to appropriations exceeding the 10-year average spending level for wildfires. The new adjustment would apply to appropriations provided above the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations as calculated for FY2015. The amount of the adjustment is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing to $2.95 billion in FY2027. Whatever amount Congress appropriates for wildfire suppression over the FY2015 baseline effectively would not be subject to the discretionary spending limits established in the BCA for FY2020. In FY2020, Congress could appropriate up to $3.64 billion for wildfire suppression, with $1.39 billion subject to discretionary limits and an additional $2.25 billion outside of those limits. In FY2019, FS and DOI received $2.05 billion for suppression purposes. The wildfire funding fix in FY2020 could provide up to $3.64 billion for suppression, with $1.39 billion subject to discretionary limits. The enactment potentially removes budget barriers for additional funds, at least until FY2021. If new limits are set for FY2022-2027, the wildfire adjustment would still apply. It is uncertain if Congress will continue to grant fire borrowing authority to the agencies. The wildfire funding fix in FY2020 could provide up to $3.64 billion for suppression, with $1.39 billion subject to discretionary limits. If new limits are established for FY2022 through FY2027, the wildfire adjustment would still be applicable. It is unclear if Congress will continue to provide fire borrowing authority to the agencies once the wildfire adjustment is in effect. Congress would need to take additional action to ensure agencies have access to funds for federal services in response to wildfires. The wildfire funding fix in FY2020 could provide up to $3.64 billion for suppression, with $1.39 billion subject to discretionary limits. Congress would need to take additional action to ensure agencies have access to funds for federal services in response to wildfires. Concerns for Congress include accountability, oversight of suppression spending, lack of inflationary factors in baseline adjustments, and the temporary nature of the funding fix. The wildfire funding fix in FY2020 provides up to $3.64 billion for suppression, with $1.39 billion subject to discretionary limits. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index to inform strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale. FS estimates approximately 226 wildfires are difficult to suppress or contain based on the WHP index. The Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index, based on vegetation, fuels, and past wildfire data, reflects the potential for difficult-to-suppress wildfires. Approximately 226 million acres in the US have high or very high WHP, with 53% on federal lands. High WHP indicates fuels prone to extreme fire behavior under certain weather conditions, helping assess relative wildfire risk to resources. The FY2018 omnibus directs FS to pair the Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) data with appropriate spatial data to approximate relative wildfire risk for resources and assets. Section 210 requires consultation with federal and state partners to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for community use. Reports to Congress on wildland fire management are mandated by both the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill require FS and BLM to submit reports to Congress on wildland fire management. The reports must be submitted annually within 90 days after the fiscal year ends if the wildfire funding fix is used. The Secretaries must consult with the OMB Director and the reports should be available to the public and submitted to specific House and Senate Committees. The reports will document the use of the wildfire funding fix. The 2018 farm bill mandates annual reports from FS and BLM to Congress on wildland fire management, detailing the use of the wildfire funding fix and overall spending. Reports must analyze fire size, costs, regional location, and risk-based factors influencing suppression decisions. They must also include an analysis of large fires, covering cost drivers, fuel treatment effectiveness, and preparedness investments. The 2018 farm bill requires annual reports to Congress from FS and BLM on wildland fire management, analyzing fire size, costs, regional location, and risk factors. The reports must also cover large fires, including cost drivers, fuel treatment effectiveness, and preparedness investments. Additionally, a report on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land is due annually to specific congressional committees. The agencies are required to report annually on various aspects of federal land management, including wildfire prevention, timber production, road maintenance, water quality, and ecosystem restoration activities. Forest restoration activities on federal land aim to enhance ecosystem resilience and resistance to disturbances like insect infestations or wildfires. This may involve thinning trees to reduce density, using prescribed fires to manage vegetation buildup, and facilitate post-fire recovery. Forest restoration on federal land involves prescribed fire to reduce understory vegetation, mitigate wildfire intensity, and aid post-fire recovery. BLM's authority comes from FLPMA, while FS's authority is based on various acts to protect and manage national forests for multiple uses. Congress has authorized specific forest restoration programs for FS and BLM. The Forest Service and BLM have specific forest restoration programs authorized by Congress, including the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, stewardship contracting authority, and the good neighbor authority. These programs allow partnerships with stakeholders to address forest restoration needs and management activities as part of the \"Shared Stewardship\" approach. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act authorizes forest restoration programs that involve stakeholders in identifying and performing specified forest management and restoration activities. These programs are part of the \"Shared Stewardship\" approach to address land management concerns at a landscape-scale and across ownership boundaries, offering opportunities to accelerate forest restoration and provide benefits to surrounding communities. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about specific aspects of these programs. The Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 established the CFLRP to fund restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, involving diverse stakeholders in a transparent and nonexclusive collaboration process. Priority landscapes must be at least 50,000 acres of NFS lands in need of restoration, potentially including other federal, state, tribal, or private land. The Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (SRS) prioritizes forest landscapes over 50,000 acres, primarily NFS lands for restoration. Proposals must use best available science, focus on old-growth stand maintenance, reduce hazardous fuels, and avoid new permanent roads. Annual and 5-year reports are required, with up to 10 proposals funded per fiscal year by the Secretary of Agriculture. The law requires annual and 5-year reports on forest restoration projects funded by the Secretary of Agriculture. Up to 10 proposals can be selected and funded each fiscal year, with a total of 23 proposals funded since FY2010. Each proposal can receive up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years for project implementation. A fund has been established to cover 50% of project costs, with up to $40 million in annual appropriations authorized through FY2019. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) covers up to 50% of project costs and authorizes $40 million in annual appropriations through FY2019. Each selected proposal can receive up to $4 million per year for 10 years for project implementation. The program is seen as successful, achieving land management objectives and benefiting local economies. The dedicated funding provides stability for project coordination, but some may argue it diverts resources from other areas. The funding commitment for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program is seen as a valuable aspect, providing stability for project implementation. However, some concerns exist about resources being directed away from NFS lands not covered by selected projects. The program has economic benefits but falls short in creating new markets for wood products and reducing treatment costs. While it improves relationships with stakeholders, collaboration has focused on simpler issues rather than resolving complex ones. The program was reauthorized in the 2018 farm bill with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. It allows for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years, with the possibility of more projects being selected and funded if Congress appropriates to the new authorization level. The law also includes the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture as recipients of program status reports. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. An extension of eligibility could result in projects continuing beyond the initial time-frame, with the possibility of more projects being selected and funded if Congress appropriates to the new authorization level. The program allows for good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands, including treating trees, reducing fuels, and improving forest, rangeland, and watershed health. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023, allowing for projects to continue beyond the initial time-frame. The program permits good neighbor agreements with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands, including treating trees, reducing fuels, and improving forest, rangeland, and watershed health. The law prohibits treatments in designated wilderness areas and does not include construction or restoration of paved roads. States may perform the work, but FS and BLM retain responsibility for compliance with federal laws. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows states to work on federal lands under the supervision of FS and BLM, ensuring compliance with federal laws. Master Agreements (MAs) and Supplemental Project Agreements (SPAs) outline project scopes and implementation terms. FS has executed 48 MAs and 105 SPAs in multiple states, covering various activities like timber production, wildlife management, and hazardous fuels reduction. The GNA is perceived as a valuable tool for collaborative land management. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows states to work on federal lands for specific project types like timber production, wildlife management, and hazardous fuels reduction. It is seen as successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and leveraging state resources. Concerns exist about the sustainability of future GNA work. Recent legislative changes have expanded GNA activities to include road construction and restoration services on defined NFS roads. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to include federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments. Funds received by a state through timber sales under GNA can be used for additional projects until FY2023. Payments made by counties under GNA projects are not subject to revenue-sharing laws. This expansion may significantly increase the use of GNA and create more opportunities. The expansion of the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to tribes and county governments has the potential to increase its use significantly. This could lead to more opportunities for cross-boundary restoration work and leveraging nonfederal resources. However, it may also increase administrative demands on agencies like FS or BLM. Concerns include the distribution of receipts from timber sales and whether revenue from GNA projects should be shared with county governments. Stewardship end-result contracting was established as a temporary pilot program in 1999. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals. This includes combining timber sale contracts with service contracts to offset costs. The Good Neighbor Authority allows FS and BLM to combine timber sale contracts with service contracts to achieve land management goals, such as improving forest health and restoring watersheds. Excess revenue from timber sales can be deposited into a Stewardship Contracting Fund for future projects without needing further appropriation. Stewardship contracting allows FS and BLM to use excess timber sale revenue for other projects without additional appropriation. Contracts are awarded based on best value, considering past performance and innovation. Annual reports are required on contract development and accomplishments. Stakeholders view stewardship contracting positively for increased restoration opportunities and economic benefits. Stewardship contracting is generally viewed favorably by stakeholders for increased restoration opportunities and economic benefits. Some concerns include the incentive to remove ecologically important trees for more service work and issues with revenue distribution. Up-front financial obligations and revenue-sharing requirements with county governments are also areas of concern. The initial implementation of stewardship contracting faced challenges with integrating contract types and record-keeping. Despite improvements in contracting systems and increased contract offerings, a 2015 USDA OIG report highlighted issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. The 2015 USDA OIG report found issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in certain fire regime groups and gave a procurement preference to contractors promoting innovative use of forest products. The 2018 law authorized the Secretary to give procurement preference to contractors promoting innovative use of forest products in certain fire regime groups. It also allowed FS and BLM to include cancellation ceilings in stewardship contracts, with funds obligated in stages. Excess revenues can be used to pay outstanding liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is required for contracts with a cancellation ceiling over $25 million without proposed funding. The cancellation ceiling provision in stewardship contracts allows funds to be obligated in stages, with a ceiling higher than $25 million. This can help resolve concerns about upfront financial obligations and allow for the use of excess revenue to offset costs. The use of 20-year stewardship contracts and procurement preference may increase market certainty for forest products industries and promote innovation in forest restoration. The protection of watersheds is an authorized activity of many FS programs. The Forest Service's watershed programs were criticized for lacking water quality data and a consistent national approach. To address this, they committed to developing performance measures, improving data quality, and prioritizing watershed management on NFS lands. This included the creation of a Watershed Condition Framework. The Forest Service developed a Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) to classify and prioritize watershed conditions across NFS lands, identify priority watersheds, and create restoration action plans. However, a 2017 USDA OIG report highlighted inadequacies in FS' management and implementation of the WCF program, including coordination and oversight issues, inadequate record-keeping methodologies, and monitoring project costs and performance towards watershed restoration. The 2018 farm bill codified the WCF program in statute, assigning specific program responsibilities. The 2018 farm bill codified the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) program, assigning specific responsibilities for monitoring project costs and performance towards watershed restoration at the national level. The law authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a WCF for NFS land, evaluate watershed conditions, identify priority watersheds for protection and restoration, and develop restoration action plans in coordination with nonfederal landowners and governments. The 2018 farm bill established the Watershed Condition Framework program to monitor and prioritize watershed restoration on NFS land. It allows for the identification of up to five priority watersheds in each national forest for protection and restoration, with the option for emergency designation in cases of significant wildfire impact. Water source protection is a key focus, with authorized activities including cooperative agreements for watershed restoration and enhancement. The 2018 farm bill authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing for cooperative agreements for watershed restoration and enhancement with various entities. This includes improving fish, wildlife, and other resources within the watershed. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into partnership agreements with nonfederal partners for watershed protection and restoration projects to safeguard municipal water sources and restore forest health. FS can conduct a single environmental analysis for each project proposed under the plan. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to partner with nonfederal entities for watershed protection and restoration projects. FS can conduct a single environmental analysis for each project proposed under the plan. Congress authorized $10 million in annual appropriations to the Water Source Protection Fund through FY2023 to match partner donations. The 2018 farm bill included provisions related to federal forest land, such as designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. It also addressed land acquisition, exchange, disposal, special use authorizations, Secure Rural Schools Act payments, activities, and Resource Advisory Committees. Additionally, it designated a new wilderness area and expanded existing areas in NFS lands in Tennessee. Bald River Wilderness, part of Cherokee National Forest, covers 9,038 acres. Additions to existing wilderness areas include Big Frog, Big Laurel Branch, Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock, Little Frog Mountain, and Sampson Mountain. The areas are managed according to the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access. The 2018 farm bill introduced provisions for land acquisition, exchange, and disposal by FS and/or BLM. Section 8623 of the bill established a new program authorizing the Secretary. The 2018 farm bill and FY2018 omnibus enacted provisions for FS and BLM to acquire, exchange, or dispose of federal land. This included establishing new programs for leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites and reauthorizing programs for selling or exchanging BLM lands. Additionally, the bill reauthorized the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program for conveying administrative sites or undeveloped parcels of NFS land. The Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program, which allows conveyance of administrative sites or undeveloped parcels of NFS land, was reauthorized for FY2019 through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill also modified existing FS programs and authorized exchanges or sales for specific parcels. Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands, allowing specific use for various purposes including water infrastructure, transportation systems, electricity generation, communication systems, and other necessary facilities. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands for various purposes including water infrastructure, transportation systems, electricity generation, communication systems, and other necessary facilities. FS and BLM charge cost-recovery fees for processing applications and monitoring activities, based on estimated hours and land value. The 115th Congress enacted provisions directing FS to update their process and fee schedule for issuing special use authorizations for communication sites and established a pilot process for activities within utility ROWs. Concerns about wildfire ignitions within electricity ROWs were addressed, as power line ignitions are associated with fires that burn across larger areas. The 115th Congress enacted provisions to address concerns about wildfire ignitions within electricity transmission and distribution rights-of-way (ROWs). Some believe administrative processes hinder necessary maintenance activities to mitigate fire risks, while others place more responsibility on permit holders. These provisions aim to improve the approval process for ROW permit holders to implement vegetation management projects on federal lands. The 115th Congress provisions aim to improve the approval process for ROW permit holders to implement vegetation management projects on federal lands. Some are concerned about the balance between expediting project implementation and maintaining accountability for wildfire suppression costs and liability on federal lands. The 115th Congress provisions aim to improve the approval process for ROW permit holders to implement vegetation management projects on federal lands. Concerns exist regarding liability costs for ROW permit holders, with some arguing that limiting damages and liability will incentivize prompt agency action on maintenance requests. Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations revising the process to issue special use authorizations for communications uses on NFS lands within one year. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the process for issuing special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands. The new process must be streamlined, uniform, and standardized, consider applications on a competitive and nondiscriminatory basis, and have lease terms of at least 15 years. Regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing costs, with fees deposited into a Treasury account for managing related activities. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the process for issuing special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands, with lease terms of at least 15 years. Regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing costs, with fees deposited into a Treasury account for managing related activities, including vegetation management and facility inspections on federal land containing electric transmission and distribution facilities. The 2018 farm bill mandated guidance for vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance on federal land with electric transmission facilities. It outlines the process for reviewing and approving plans submitted by ROW permit holders, allowing them to conduct activities within their ROW based on an approved plan. The 2018 farm bill mandates guidance for vegetation management and operation on federal land with electric transmission facilities. It allows owners to develop and submit plans for approval by the appropriate Secretary and conduct activities within their ROW. Owners may conduct certain management activities without an approved plan in specific circumstances. FS and BLM are directed to identify NEPA categorical exclusions for these activities. The law also encourages training programs for employees on vegetation management and the electrical transmission system. The FY2018 omnibus bill encourages training programs for FS and DOI employees on vegetation management and the electrical transmission system. It specifies ROW permit holder liabilities related to vegetation management activities, limiting strict liability for damages or injury to $500,000 under certain conditions for ten years. FS and BLM must report on the impacts of the liability clauses to Congress within four years. Section 8630 of the 2018 farm bill establishes a pilot program for utility ROW through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) land, allowing them to develop vegetation management plans and perform projects within their ROWs. Participants must adhere to FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation. Participants in the pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) land are responsible for adhering to FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation management. They may pay for and conduct projects on specified NFS lands within and up to 75 feet from the ROW, with the possibility of FS contributing funds at the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture. The law requires FS to submit a program status report to Congress every two years, and participants must reimburse FS for wildfire suppression costs and damage to FS resources if caused by their operations. The pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) land requires participants to adhere to FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation management. Participants must reimburse FS for wildfire suppression costs and damage to FS resources if caused by their operations, with a limit of up to $500,000 in certain circumstances. The program status report must be submitted to Congress every two years, and participants may conduct projects within and up to 75 feet from the ROW, with the possibility of FS contributing funds at the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture. The FY2018 omnibus program for electricity ROWs differs from the ROW pilot program on NFS lands. The FS pilot program under the 2018 farm bill includes electricity ROWs, natural gas, and related infrastructure. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on revenue generated. SRS offers optional payment system based on historic revenue, land acreage, and per capita income. SRS authorized optional payment system for counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands based on historic revenue, land acreage, and per capita income. Payments allocated among Title I FS for education and roads, Title II for projects on lands, and Title III for county programs like fire prevention and emergency services. Resource Advisory Committees established to improve collaborative relationships and provide advice. Title II of the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) Act established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) to improve collaborative relationships and provide advice to agencies. RACs have specific membership requirements and represent various interests such as outdoor recreation, timber industry, environmental organizations, and local elected officials. The authorized payment level was set at 95% of the previous year's payment level, with payments extended multiple times through FY2015. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) Act established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) to provide advice and improve relationships. Payments were set at 95% of the previous year's level and extended until FY2015. The last authorized payment was disbursed in FY2016, with counties receiving revenue-sharing payments in FY2017.

The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) Act reauthorization in FY2018 and FY2019 set the FY2017 payment level at 95% of the last authorized payment. Counties received full SRS payments for FY2017 in two installments. The reauthorization also expanded the uses for Title III funds and expired at the end of FY2018. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the SRS statute despite the law's expiration. The 2018 farm bill enacted changes to the SRS statute, establishing a process for modifying RAC membership requirements and a pilot program for appointing RAC members in Montana and Arizona. The Tribal Forest Protection Act authorized agreements with Indian tribes for forest projects on tribal lands and adjacent NFS and BLM lands. The Tribal Forest Protection Act allows the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to enter agreements with federally recognized Indian tribes for forest projects on tribal lands and adjacent NFS and BLM lands. The projects aim to address forest restoration needs or threats to tribal lands, evaluated based on tribal factors. This Act complements the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, which allows tribes to operate federal Indian programs through self-determination contracts. The 2018 farm bill authorized federally recognized tribes to enter self-determination contracts with the federal government for administrative functions of the Tribal Forest Protection Act on NFS land. The Secretary of Agriculture carries out delegated responsibilities, while decision-making authority over NEPA and TFPA remains with the Secretary concerned. The 2018 farm bill authorized tribes to enter self-determination contracts for TFPA on NFS land, with the Secretary of Agriculture carrying out delegated responsibilities. Congress may oversee implementation of new laws and address concerns with federal forest management, including a backlog of 52-58 million acres in need of restoration treatments on NFS lands. The Forest Service reports a backlog of 52-58 million acres of NFS lands in need of restoration treatments due to high fire risk or insect infestation. They currently treat 2-6 million acres annually, but it could take 9-29 years to address the backlog. Hazardous fuels are accumulating faster than treatments are being done. To address this, the FS proposes increasing forest management projects and restoration treatments. Administrative process barriers, including decision-making processes related to NEPA, are identified as obstacles to progress. Administrative process barriers, such as agency decision-making related to NEPA, hinder progress in addressing the backlog of 52-58 million acres of NFS lands in need of restoration treatments. Stakeholders point to funding levels and training as additional obstacles. Provisions enacted by the 115th Congress aim to improve agency efficiencies. The 115th Congress enacted provisions to improve agency efficiencies by expanding procedures to expedite project planning and review processes for hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects. Some stakeholders believe that utilizing Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities and NEPA Categorical Exclusions would help expedite project implementation and achieve restoration goals, while others argue that these changes are altering the legal framework for federal forest management. Some stakeholders believe that changes in agency decision-making processes, such as the use of Categorical Exclusions, are impacting federal forest management and limiting citizen participation. Concerns about forest health and fuel levels have been ongoing for decades, with recommendations made to invest more in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems. In 1994, the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters recommended investing more in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems. Recommendations were also made in 1995 and 1999 to increase hazardous fuel treatments and develop a strategy for reducing fuels to address forest health issues. In 2006, concerns were raised about the hazardous fuels reduction program, leading to recommendations for guidance and controls. The hazardous fuels reduction program has faced ongoing issues with prioritizing, tracking, and reporting on projects. Concerns about project implementation have been raised, with a significant percentage of fuel reduction decisions being appealed in various years. Academic studies have also examined the Forest Service's NEPA process. The Forest Service's hazardous fuels reduction program has faced challenges with project implementation, with a significant percentage of decisions being appealed in FY2001 and FY2002. Academic studies suggest that complex projects are more likely to be challenged, despite provisions in the HFRA to expedite implementation. The NFS areas in need of treatment have continued to increase, prompting the FS to seek ways to accelerate project implementation. The Forest Service's hazardous fuels reduction program has faced challenges with project implementation, despite provisions in the HFRA to expedite decision-making. The extent of NFS areas in need of treatment has continued to increase, leading FS to seek ways to increase project implementation pace. Some believe the HFRA approach has not been successful, while others suggest it needs broader application as seen in legislation enacted during the 115th Congress. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill forest-related provisions are compared in two tables, highlighting changes from prior laws."
