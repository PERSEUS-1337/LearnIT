    "content": "Congress has been grappling with reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for over five years. The IHCIA authorizes various specific Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. Despite the expiration of authorizations of appropriations for IHCIA programs in FY2001, Congress continues to fund these programs. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorizes various Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. Despite authorizations expiring in FY2001, Congress continues to fund these programs. Negotiations for IHCIA reauthorization have led to multiple bills introduced in Congress. A House bill (H.R. 5312) similar to S. 1057 was referred to House committees and ordered reported by the Resources Committee. A Senate Finance Committee bill, S. 3524, amending the Social Security Act for Indian health provisions, was reported by the Committee. Congress faces a multi-billion-dollar problem with Indian trust funds due to mismanagement, leading to financial claims against the US. Indian individual claimants alone suggest they are owed as much as $176 billion. The mismanagement of Indian trust funds and lands has resulted in financial claims against the United States by Indian individuals and tribes, totaling as much as $176 billion. This issue has led to the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) within the Department of the Interior (DOI). The BIA has historically managed funds, lands, and physical assets held in trust for tribes and individuals, with trust lands totaling about 56 million acres and funds totaling $3.3 billion. $2.9 billion was in tribal accounts and $400 million in Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The Treasury Department manages the accounts, historically criticized for mismanagement. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 aimed to reform trust fund management, leading to the creation of the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST). A class action suit was filed by IIM account holders based on the 1994 act and general trust law. The OST was created to oversee trust management reforms following the 1994 act. IIM account holders filed a class action suit demanding an accounting of their funds and correction of mismanagement. This led to the reorganization of the BIA and OST, with congressional consideration of settling IIM and tribal claims. The district court found DOI and Treasury breached their trust duties regarding document retention, data gathering, business systems, and staffing for an accounting. In the Cobell case, the district court found that DOI and Treasury breached their trust duties regarding document retention, data gathering, and trust management. The court ordered them to bring trust management up to current standards. The final stage of the lawsuit will determine the amount of money owed to the IIM plaintiffs. DOI proposed a method for reconciling trust account transactions, while the plaintiffs suggested using databases to estimate the total amount due. The district court ordered DOI to perform a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions back to 1938, estimating losses in the tens of millions. DOI's compliance cost was estimated at $12-13 billion. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court's order twice. DOI continues its historical accounting plan, while Congress has acted on the Cobell case. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court's order for a historical accounting of IIM trust account transactions back to 1938, costing $12-13 billion. Congress has addressed the Cobell lawsuit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts. Concerns remain about the lawsuit's impact on DOI trust reform implementation. Congress has not introduced any bills in this Congress to amend the 1994 Act regarding the historical accounting obligation in the Cobell lawsuit. Concerns persist about the costs of the lawsuit impacting DOI trust reform implementation and funding for other Indian programs. Current and potential future costs include ongoing litigation expenses, a court-ordered historical accounting costing $12-$13 billion, a possible Cobell settlement, and estimated amounts owed to Cobell plaintiffs exceeding $100 billion. Funding sources for these costs may include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund.\" The 109th Congress has introduced two settlement bills, S. 1439 and H.R. 4322, to address the Cobell lawsuit. The bills propose establishing an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund for payments to claimants and creating a commission to review Indian trust asset management. Funding sources for the settlement include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund.\" The introduced bills, S. 1439 and H.R. 4322, propose creating a fund for IIM claimants, establishing a commission for trust asset management review, increasing payments for individual Indian trust interests, and requiring annual audits of trust funds. Hearings have been held on both bills, with H.R. 4322 awaiting further committee action. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on S. 1439 in July 2005 and March 28, 2006, along with the House Resources Committee on March 1, 2006. H.R. 4322 is pending further committee action. A mark-up of an amended S. 1439 with an $8 billion settlement amount was scheduled but withdrawn for more negotiations on including IIM land mismanagement claims. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made organizational changes since the 1994 Act, including transferring trust fund management from BIA to OST in 1996. The 1996 transfer of trust fund management from BIA to OST was a significant change in management reform. A new reorganization in April 2003 split BIA trust management operations from other services, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing lack of consultation and undefined OST duties. DOI claims prior consultation with tribes and court-ordered procedures. The DOI reorganization faced opposition from tribes due to lack of consultation and undefined OST duties. Attempts to halt the reorganization in Congress have failed, with bills proposing changes in trust management not progressing. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 aim to reorganize DOI management of Indian trust assets. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose reorganizing DOI management of Indian trust assets. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) regulates gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands, aiming for tribal economic development. IGRA prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, with exceptions for specific circumstances, leading to criticism of \"reservation shopping\" by tribes seeking off-reservation gaming opportunities. Critics argue that exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act allow for \"reservation shopping\" by tribes seeking off-reservation gaming opportunities. Bills like S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to curb these exceptions by removing the requirement for Interior Secretary and state governor agreement, while still allowing applications filed before certain dates to proceed. These bills also retain exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988. The bills, H.R. 4893 and S. 2078, aim to restrict off-reservation gaming opportunities for tribes by removing certain requirements for approval. H.R. 4893 adds limitations based on tribal land connections, while both bills maintain exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988. H.R. 4893 repeals the land claim exception but introduces a new one for tribes without land at the time of enactment. Opponents argue that these bills impose unfair burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes. The bills, H.R. 4893 and S. 2078, aim to restrict off-reservation gaming opportunities for tribes by adding limitations based on tribal land connections. Opponents argue that these bills impose unfair burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes, with concerns about tribal sovereignty being subjected to local governments. Native Hawaiians, not considered Indians under federal law, have federal programs authorized for their benefit. Native Hawaiians are not recognized as Indians under federal law and lack a political entity recognized by the government. Congress has authorized federal programs for Native Hawaiians, but without a recognized political entity, these programs are at risk of legal challenges. Legislation in the 109th Congress aims to establish a process for recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity. Three bills in the 109th Congress, S. 147, H.R. 309, and S. 3064, aim to establish a process for recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity. The bills address federal recognition and organization of the entity, leaving questions about governmental powers and lands for future negotiations. Proponents argue that Congress has the authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity based on its constitutional powers over indigenous peoples, similar to Indian tribes. Proponents argue that Congress has the authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity based on its constitutional powers over indigenous peoples, similar to Indian tribes. They point to the special political and legal relationship with Native Hawaiians, citing programs like the Hawaiian homelands program reserved for lease only to Native Hawaiians. Native Hawaiians have not given up their claims to sovereignty but had it forcibly withdrawn in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Opponents dispute the recognition of a Native Hawaiian political entity, arguing that Congress's authority only extends to Indian tribes, not all indigenous peoples. They also claim that the United States does not have a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians as it does for Indian tribes. Opponents of recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity argue that it would be based on race alone and set a precedent for other non-Indian groups. They dispute claims of Native Hawaiian sovereignty and raise concerns about racial discrimination. Opponents of S. 147 argue against its passage due to concerns of racial discrimination and dispute claims of Native Hawaiian sovereignty, citing historical reasons such as political rights given to non-Native Hawaiians before 1893. S. 147 and H.R. 309 faced scrutiny in previous Congresses, with S. 147 failing to proceed in the Senate in 2006. On May 25, 2006, discussions among congressional offices, the Administration, and Hawaii took place. The Senate failed to proceed with S. 147 and S. 3064 on June 8, 2006. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee and has not been reported. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on constitutional issues raised by H.R. 309 on July 19, 2005."
