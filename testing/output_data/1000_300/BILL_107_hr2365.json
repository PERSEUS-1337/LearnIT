    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for the growing US economy. The increasing use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, competitive electricity market, and reliance on coal as the most abundant fossil energy resource are key factors driving the need for clean electricity. Coal comprises over 85% of fossil resources in the US, enough to last 250 years at current usage rates. Investments in emissions control tech have reduced pollutants by 21% in the past 30 years. Continuous efficiency improvements in electricity generation can sustain coal use and preserve other energy resources. New technologies can eliminate health-threatening emissions from coal-based electricity generation. The continued use of coal can be sustained by investments in emissions control technology and efficiency improvements in electricity generation. New technologies can eliminate health-threatening emissions from coal-based electricity generation and improve efficiency by up to 50%. Continued environmental improvement in coal-based generation towards near-zero emissions is important. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cost and performance goals\" refers to those established under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will assess cost and performance goals for technologies enabling the competitive use of coal for electricity, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel in 2007, 2015, and 2020. Consultation with various stakeholders is required. The Secretary will issue draft cost and performance goals for coal technologies within 120 days of the Act's enactment, and submit final goals to Congress within 180 days. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs for achieving goals. Recommendations for technology development programs will be included. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs for achieving goals. Recommendations for technology development programs will be included, along with expert advice from representatives of relevant entities. The recommendations aim to achieve cost and performance goals through the development and demonstration of technologies, either individually or in combination with others, and may also include suggestions for additional authorities needed to reach these goals. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a research and development program on coal-based technologies under various Acts. The program aims to achieve cost and performance goals. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for sections 4, 5, and 6. This is in addition to existing appropriations and does not cap Department of Energy fossil energy research. Additionally, there is a Clean Coal Power Commercial Applications Initiative. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for new or existing power plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards and may include new technologies not previously considered for commercial use. A plan for this initiative must be submitted to Congress within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will transmit a plan to Congress within 120 days of the Act's enactment, outlining program elements, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies at electric generation units. The plan aims to achieve efficiency improvements of at least 3 percent compared to current standards. The curr_chunk discusses improvements to achieve higher efficiency and environmental performance in electric generation units, including design efficiency improvements, environmental technology enhancements, and recycling or reusing methods. The curr_chunk focuses on developing cost-effective technologies for recycling coal combustion or gasification wastes and capturing carbon dioxide in electric generation units. The curr_chunk focuses on financial assistance related to developing cost-effective technologies for recycling coal combustion or gasification wastes and capturing carbon dioxide in electric generation units. The Secretary will solicit proposals for projects at facilities designed to improve efficiency and reduce emissions without increasing pollutants. The Secretary will solicit proposals for projects at facilities to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, or carbon monoxide. This includes a reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions based on the type of coal being used. The regulations require a combustion concentration of less than 1.2 pounds per million British thermal units of heat input for sulfur dioxide emissions, 0.1 pound per million British thermal units of heat for nitrogen oxide emissions from boilers other than cyclone-fired ones, and 0.02 pound per million British thermal units of heat for particulate matter emissions. The regulations set emission levels for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions from boilers. The emission levels must meet the standards of the Clean Air Act or new source performance standards. Additionally, coal combustion byproducts should have significant economic value. Financial assistance will be provided by the Secretary to projects that demonstrate cost reductions in coal utilization for energy generation, improve coal competitiveness among energy sources, and achieve cost-effective emissions reductions. Financial assistance will be provided by the Secretary to projects that demonstrate cost reductions in coal utilization for energy generation, improve coal competitiveness among energy sources, achieve cost-effective emissions reductions, and demonstrate applicable technologies for a quarter of coal-based electricity generating facilities. The Federal share of project costs shall not exceed 50 percent, with an authorization of $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for this purpose. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to carry out the section is set at $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012, with alternative funding sources available."
