    "content": "Since the 1930s, federal job training and employment programs have aimed to connect vulnerable youth to work and school. These young people are typically low-income with barriers to employment, such as dropping out of school or being in foster care. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. WIA includes programs for job training, adult education, employment services, and vocational rehabilitation, all authorized under Title I and carried out by the Department of Labor. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training programs for youth through Title I, administered by the Department of Labor. Programs like WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild aim to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities. Despite WIA's authorization expiring in 2003, funding continues through annual appropriations. Policymakers in the 112th Congress hinted at a possible reauthorization of the law. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training programs for youth through Title I, administered by the Department of Labor. WIA Youth Activities and Job Corps offer job training and employment services for youth. Funding for WIA programs continues through annual appropriations, with potential reauthorization hinted by policymakers in the 112th Congress. Job training and employment services for youth under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) include WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants (YOG). Although WIA's authorization of appropriations expired in FY2003, Congress continues to appropriate funds for these programs. The Youth Opportunity Grants (YOG) program, funded through FY2003, created centers in low-income communities for youth employment and services. Congress continues to appropriate funds for youth job training programs, except for YOG which has not been funded since FY2003. Various programs under the Division of Youth Services in DOL's Employment and Training Administration connect low-income youth to educational and employment opportunities. The Youth Opportunity Grants program, along with Job Corps, YouthBuild, and the youth component of the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, aim to connect low-income youth to educational and employment opportunities. Each program serves youth with specific employment barriers, with YouthBuild specifically for high school dropouts. The programs provide employment and educational services differently, with Youth Activities requiring specific elements like mentoring, while YouthBuild focuses on housing-related activities. The Youth Activities program, YouthBuild, Job Corps, and the youth component of the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program offer various services to low-income youth. Each program has specific elements and focuses on different activities, such as mentoring, construction work, residential services, and reentry services. Funding for these programs is allocated differently, with DOL distributing funds to local WIBs for Youth Activities and entering agreements with organizations to operate Job Corps centers. DOL funds Youth Activities through states and local WIBs, operates Job Corps centers through agreements with organizations, and collaborates with USDA for Job Corps programs on USDA lands. YouthBuild and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program award grants competitively. Congress is working on reauthorizing WIA. During the reauthorization process of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), Congress has held hearings and listening sessions to address issues related to WIA youth programs. The Senate HELP Committee focused on positive aspects of WIA and potential improvements, while the Senate HELP Subcommittee discussed updating WIA to meet the needs of workers and employers in a changing economy. The House Education and Workforce Committee also played a role in the reauthorization process. During the reauthorization process of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), Congress held hearings to discuss updating WIA to meet the needs of workers and employers in a changing economy. The House Education and Workforce Committee also played a role in addressing issues related to WIA youth programs. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce introduced the SKILLS Act (H.R. 803) in the 113th Congress to amend and reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act. The bill was reported favorably and passed in the House in March 2013. The House Committee introduced H.R. 803 to amend the Workforce Investment Act. The bill was reported and passed in the House in March 2013. In the Senate, S. 1356 was introduced by Senators Murray, Alexander, Harkin, and Isakson in July 2013. Issues raised during the WIA reauthorization process include consolidating workforce programs for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Consolidating workforce programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth could increase efficiency and reduce costs. However, concerns exist that at-risk youth and other vulnerable groups may be overlooked. Coordination between the workforce system and other systems, such as education, is also seen as lacking. Greater coordination and oversight, such as through one-stop centers and youth councils, may help address the varied needs of youth as intended by the Workforce Investment Act. Stakeholders suggest greater coordination between workforce programs and education systems to meet youth needs as intended by WIA. Congress is interested in evaluating the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with only Job Corps having been evaluated so far. A contract has been awarded to evaluate YouthBuild. Specific concerns include eligibility requirements for Youth Activities and Job Corps, with discussions on income eligibility potentially excluding needy individuals. Stakeholders discuss eligibility requirements for the Youth Activities program under WIA, with concerns about income verification for needy youth. There is debate on targeting older youth aged 22-24 and the potential costs involved. Coordination between workforce programs and education systems is suggested to meet youth needs as intended by WIA. Stakeholders debate whether WIA should target older youth aged 22-24 in the Youth Activities program, considering possible costs. Concerns also arise about the school status of youth and eligibility criteria for the program. Proposals include federal funding for Job Corps centers and addressing program performance issues. Overlapping services in federal workforce programs have been identified in a 2011 GAO report. The 2011 GAO report identified overlapping services in federal workforce programs, recommending consolidation of selected programs like the Employment Service and TANF services. Past legislation has aimed to address program performance issues. The 2011 GAO report recommended consolidating selected workforce programs like the Employment Service and TANF services. Legislation in the 113th Congress proposed consolidating multiple workforce programs, including those for youth, into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states and local areas for employment and training activities. The 2011 GAO report recommended consolidating workforce programs into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states for employment and training activities, including services for youth and ex-offenders. Required activities would include providing \"work ready services\" in the one-stop delivery system, such as assessment of skills, job search assistance, career planning, case management, internship, and work experience. Funding allocation to states would be based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth. The bill proposes funding allocation to states for employment and training activities, including services for disadvantaged youth. States would set aside funding for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, such as low-income youth. Grants could be awarded to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services. The bill proposes funding allocation to states for employment and training activities for individuals 16 or older and low-income. States could award grants to local boards or nonprofits to provide services to at-risk and out-of-school youth, including education, credentials, and employment experience in in-demand industries. The bill aims to provide funding for employment and training activities for at-risk youth, including dropout recovery, work readiness training, and internships in high-demand industries. Concerns have been raised about potential reduced youth services under the proposed program. The bill aims to streamline youth programs and establish Youth Innovation and Replication Grants. Concerns have been raised about potential reduced youth services under the proposed program. The bill aims to streamline youth programs and establish Youth Innovation and Replication Grants. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers in serving youth, as nearly 20 federal programs currently provide services through these centers. These centers use various methods to attract youth, such as actively recruiting, placing youth program staff, and training one-stop staff in youth programs. Some one-stop centers face challenges attracting youth despite using various methods like actively recruiting, placing youth program staff, and training one-stop staff in youth programs. Recommendations include catering more to youth, better training service professionals on youth matters, and targeting youth through funding support for local projects. DOL has encouraged one-stop centers to target youth by providing funding for local projects to enhance youth connections, guidance on co-locating youth program staff, and customizing facilities to be more \"youth-friendly.\" H.R. 803 and S. 1356 require states to continue funding one-stop centers for job search assistance, but do not specify youth involvement. Under H.R. 803 and S. 1356, states must continue funding one-stop centers for job search assistance, without specifying youth involvement. The bills do not address how youth would be served at these centers or the role of youth councils in coordinating services for eligible youth. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). GAO and DOL reports have identified difficulties in establishing youth councils, including issues with youth and parent participation due to transportation and scheduling conflicts. The 2002 report identified enabling conditions for innovative youth councils to develop comprehensive systems for youth activities under the Youth program. These conditions include the presence of an established intermediary organization, a strong school-to-career partnership, and a pre-existing community-wide planning process. The 2002 report identified conditions for innovative youth councils to develop comprehensive systems for youth activities under the Youth program, including an established intermediary organization, a strong school-to-career partnership, and a community-wide planning process. Stakeholders recommend a stronger role for youth councils, suggesting greater flexibility in partner selection and priority setting. Reauthorization legislation may make youth councils optional and not require youth representation on local workforce investment boards. H.R. 803 in the 113th Congress would make youth councils optional and not require youth representation on local workforce investment boards. S. 1356 would change local workforce investment boards to local workforce development boards (LWDB) and require LWDBs to establish standing committees for youth services. The bill would require standing committees for youth services to provide information and assistance with planning, operational issues, and coordination with community-based organizations. Existing entities can fulfill the requirements as long as they meet the criteria for establishing a standing committee. Congress may consider best practices from existing youth councils to improve youth workforce activities and address coordination issues between the workforce system and education system. The perceived lack of coordination between youth workforce programs and the education system is a concern. WIA includes provisions for local boards to have representatives from education entities. Stakeholders suggest that greater coordination can help meet the needs of youth as intended by WIA. Existing infrastructure like one-stop centers and youth councils can facilitate this coordination. Some stakeholders believe that better coordination between youth workforce programs and the education system, as outlined in WIA, can meet the needs of youth. Existing infrastructure like one-stop centers and youth councils can aid in this coordination, as discussed at a Senate HELP Committee session on WIA and youth. A 2004 GAO report highlighted collaboration and areas for improvement in the Youth Activities program, noting that about half of youth received services through various entities, although some education entities were hesitant to partner. The report found that some education entities were cautious about partnering with the Youth Activities program under WIA, as they believed it was inconsistent with schools' mission to provide academic services to all youth. In Wisconsin, schools hesitated to allow WIA services on school grounds due to the perceived stigma of it being targeted only to at-risk youth. At a 2009 hearing, officials from the Department of Labor and Department of Education testified about the challenges in coordinating youth workforce programs with the education system. At a 2009 hearing, officials from the Department of Labor and Department of Education testified about collaborating to ensure youth receive necessary services and supports. They mentioned the successful School-to-Work program as an example of past collaboration, which provided work-based learning in schools and job training. Congress could learn from this program's successes and challenges in partnership between the two departments. The grants supported programs combining work-based learning in schools, school-based learning in the workplace, and job training. Lessons from the STW program can inform Congress on successful school-work partnerships. H.R. 803 includes provisions for workforce-education coordination, but it is not explicit. Local areas may include education officials on workforce investment boards, and must identify strategies for youth education and skill development. The local plan under H.R. 803 requires local areas to identify strategies for assisting youth in acquiring education and skills for the labor market, potentially improving coordination between workforce and education systems. The Senate bill S. 1356 also addresses coordination with the education system, requiring states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering various programs under WIA. The plan under Titles I and II of WIA includes Adult Activities, Dislocated Workers, adult education, Employment Service, and vocational rehabilitation programs. States can submit a unified plan covering WIA Title I, WIA Title II, and Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education programs. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA, such as Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, due to limited evaluations. The evaluations of the three major youth programs under WIA, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, have shown that they have met or exceeded their goals. Section 172 of WIA mandates continuous evaluations to assess program effectiveness and cost efficiency. The evaluations of programs funded under WIA, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, are required to assess effectiveness and cost efficiency. Legislation from the 113th Congress aims to conduct independent evaluations every five years. Limited information exists on the effectiveness of these programs, with only a few impact studies conducted since 2004. Rigorous impact studies involve randomly assigning individuals to treatment and control groups to determine program outcomes. The impact study on programs funded under WIA, including Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, aims to determine program effectiveness through rigorous evaluations involving treatment and control groups. Limited information on program impacts makes it challenging for policymakers to assess their effectiveness. Youth Activities program has not been formally evaluated for participant outcomes, with only a few comprehensive studies focusing on program implementation. The Youth Activities program has not been formally evaluated for impacts on participants, but a few studies have focused on program implementation. A social science research organization is conducting an impact evaluation of YouthBuild, with initial results expected in 2015. A process evaluation of the Job Corps program was recently completed to identify center practices associated with performance measures. The Job Corps program was evaluated based on job placement rate, post-program earnings, and education/training attainment. Factors linked to strong performance included robust student support, staff accountability, and strong partner relationships. The most recent impact evaluation for Job Corps is dated back to the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Job Corps program was evaluated in the late 1990s and early 2000s to determine its impact on youth aged 16-24. Positive outcomes in education and employment were found initially, but long-term effects showed similar employment rates and earnings between program and control groups. The research on random assignment for youth aged 26-34 showed similar employment rates and earnings between program and control groups. However, youth aged 20-24 at the time of program application had increased earnings. WIA specifies performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs, with concerns raised about disincentives for serving youth with the greatest barriers to employment. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization bill, aims to revamp performance measures for Youth Activities and Job Corps to address concerns about disincentives for serving youth with barriers to employment. The proposed indicators include entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in unsubsidized employment, change in earnings, and attainment of postsecondary credentials. The WIA reauthorization bill, H.R. 803, proposes new performance measures for Youth Activities and Job Corps to address concerns about serving youth with barriers to employment. The indicators include entry into education, training, or employment, retention in education, training, or employment, earnings for employed youth, and attainment of postsecondary credentials. S. 1356 establishes six performance indicators for eligible youth in activities funded by the WIA Youth Activities program. These indicators focus on education, training, employment, earnings, and attainment of industry-recognized credentials. The WIA reauthorization bill proposes new performance measures for Youth Activities and Job Corps, including indicators like entry into education, training, or employment, retention, earnings, and attainment of credentials. S. 1356 establishes six performance indicators for eligible youth in WIA-funded activities, focusing on education, training, employment, earnings, and credential attainment. States may also require additional indicators, and the DOL Secretary must establish measures for Job Corps operators based on these indicators. Section 136 of WIA sets state and local performance measures for the Youth Activities program. The WIA reauthorization bill proposes new performance measures for Youth Activities and Job Corps, including indicators like entry into education, training, or employment, retention, earnings, and attainment of credentials. Section 136 of WIA sets forth state and local performance measures for the Youth Activities program, based on six indicators for youth eligibility. These measures are used to assess the effectiveness of states and local areas in achieving continuous improvement of workforce investment activities funded under WIA. The core indicators for youth ages 14 through 18 in the WIA reauthorization bill are attainment of basic skills, secondary school diplomas, and placement in postsecondary education or employment. For youth ages 19 through 21, the core indicators are entry into employment, retention, earnings, and attainment of a credential. States negotiate with DOL to establish performance levels for each indicator. Stakeholders have raised concerns that performance measures may not accurately reflect the progress of at-risk youth. Stakeholders have raised concerns that performance measures in WIA Section 136 may not accurately reflect the progress of at-risk youth. Some local programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accept youth who meet specific grade levels to ensure program goals are met, potentially excluding lower-skilled youth. DOL officials are aware that program contracts issued for 12 months may not provide adequate time to assist youth in meeting program goals. In response to concerns about program contracts discouraging lower-skilled youth, DOL issued guidance in 2010 to state workforce agencies on strategies to better serve at-risk youth. This included employing multiyear contracts, using real-time indicators for performance assessment, and negotiating performance goals based on participant characteristics and external factors. The 2010 DOL guidance encouraged the use of interim progress benchmarks to assess provider performance, factoring participant characteristics into performance goal negotiations, creating positive incentives for enrolling at-risk youth, and promoting interagency collaboration. The common measures were suggested to provide flexibility for working with youth at different ability levels. The 2010 DOL guidance encourages local WIBs to adopt \"real-time\" indicators like changes in attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills for youth programs. Some suggest adjusting performance levels for serving higher-risk youth populations. Some recommend adjusting performance levels for workforce investment boards serving higher-risk youth populations, similar to adjustments made under the Job Training Partnership Act. Governors could adjust standards for service delivery areas based on economic and demographic factors. The process of adjusting national performance standards under JTPA involved dividing states into SDAs, similar to local workforce investment boards. This was done to level the playing field across areas with different local conditions. Job Corps under WIA is required to establish over 20 core performance metrics, including measures like entered employment and retention in postsecondary education or employment. Additionally, DOL has implemented 33 performance metrics to assess program performance, developed from DOL policy and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The Department of Labor (DOL) has implemented 33 performance metrics to assess the Job Corps program's performance, developed from DOL policy and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). A report by the DOL Office of the Inspector General raised concerns about inaccurate reporting of results, lack of established targets for some metrics, and miscalculation of program participant costs. The YouthBuild program had inaccurate results for some metrics, lacked established targets for others, and did not publicly publish required results. The final regulation for YouthBuild in February 2012 addressed performance indicators for grantees, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, literacy and numeracy gains, and other indicators required by the Secretary. The Department of Labor (DOL) has established performance indicators for grantees in the YouthBuild program, including placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, literacy and numeracy gains, retention rate, and recidivism rate. DOL will provide detailed guidance on these indicators to grantees. The recidivism rate in the YouthBuild program is the percentage of participants re-arrested or re-incarcerated within one year of enrollment. Stakeholders are discussing eligibility criteria and serving out-of-school and older youth. H.R. 803 requires states to have strategies for at-risk youth. Under H.R. 803, states and local areas must have strategies to assist at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals with barriers to employment, and out-of-school youth aged 16-24. Eligibility for the Youth Activities program includes being age 14-21, low-income, and facing barriers like literacy deficiencies or homelessness. There is ongoing discussion about the WIA Youth program. The WIA Youth program aims to assist at-risk youth, including those with barriers like literacy deficiencies or homelessness. There is ongoing debate about the program's requirement for youth to prove their low-income status, with challenges reported in documenting income eligibility. This diversion of resources away from direct services was highlighted in the Government Accountability Office's 2002 research on program implementation. The WIA Youth program faces challenges with youth proving their eligibility due to difficulties in providing required documentation, diverting resources from service delivery. State and local officials noted that income eligibility requirements may exclude some needy youth, and obtaining documentation for other eligibility criteria can also be problematic. The WIA Youth program encounters challenges with youth proving their eligibility, as income requirements may exclude needy youth. Obtaining documentation for other criteria, such as involvement in foster care or the justice system, can also be difficult. Some states have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria, but DOL cannot waive participant eligibility requirements. Some states and local areas face challenges with youth proving eligibility for the WIA Youth program. While waivers are allowed for certain requirements, participant eligibility cannot be waived. States and local governments have the authority to establish their own policies for verifying eligibility, but stakeholders argue that WIA regulations do not allow flexibility in documenting income and other factors. Some states and localities have preferred using eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act. Some states and local areas face challenges with youth proving eligibility for the WIA Youth program. Stakeholders argue that WIA regulations do not allow flexibility in documenting income and other factors. Localities reported a preference for using eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act, including criteria based on economic disadvantage and residency in high-poverty areas. Some suggest adding eligibility based on residency in high-poverty census tracts. Youth living in Youth Opportunity grant program sites are automatically eligible based on their residency in low-income communities. Some stakeholders suggest expanding eligibility for the WIA Youth program to include at-risk youth regardless of income. The focus is on serving vulnerable youth, but there are concerns about how changing eligibility criteria would impact the number of eligible youth and the services they receive. Stakeholders also question whether the program should prioritize out-of-school youth. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the focus of the Youth Activities program on out-of-school youth and the challenges in recruiting and retaining them, as reported by GAO. Serving out-of-school youth is more costly than in-school youth, and local officials struggle to maintain contact with them. The challenges in recruiting and retaining out-of-school youth for the WIA Youth program include higher costs compared to in-school youth, difficulty in maintaining contact, and transportation issues. Stakeholders suggest allocating more funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, both in and out of school. Previous legislation proposed prioritizing out-of-school youth for WIA funds. Prior legislation in Congress proposed prioritizing out-of-school youth for WIA funds, but some argue for maintaining current funding levels while increasing technical assistance. DOL has provided guidance on serving out-of-school and at-risk in-school youth, with flexibility for localities to determine funding allocation. In response to concerns about recruiting and retaining out-of-school youth, DOL recommended strong alternative measures. DOL issued guidance recommending strong alternative education programs for out-of-school youth, funded Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants, and provided $3.4 million to reconnect youth who have dropped out to multiple education pathways. A 2004 report identified successful ways local areas served out-of-school youth, including technical assistance and training networks. The Department of Labor (DOL) addressed the implementation of Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs for out-of-school youth. States provided technical assistance and resources, such as GED programs and vocational training, for youth aged 14-21. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily extended WIA services to youth up to age 24. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded WIA Youth services to individuals up to age 24 to address the growing number of unemployed young adults. Research shows that many young people are taking longer to transition to adulthood due to factors like delayed marriage, high living costs, and more educational opportunities. Vulnerable youth face challenges like family conflict, lack of employment with adequate wages and health insurance. The transition to adulthood for vulnerable youth is complicated by challenges such as family conflict, obstacles to employment, and being disconnected from work or school. There is a debate on whether the WIA program should target older disconnected youth, but increasing the age limit could strain resources. Approximately 21,000 youth aged 22-24 were participating in the Youth program funded by ARRA. According to a GAO report on oversight of ARRA activities, about 21,000 youth aged 22-24 were participating in the Youth program funded by ARRA. DOL allows co-enrollment of older youth in both the Youth and Adult programs to meet individual needs, such as mentoring services and occupational skills training. The Youth program allows individuals aged 18-21 to access an individual training account (ITA) for occupational skills training. Exiters aged 19-21 have increased from 28.1% to 34.8% in recent years. In comparison, older youth aged 18-21 in the Adult program make up 10% of the exiter population. The Youth program offers more academic opportunities than the Adult program. The Youth program offers more academic services like tutoring and alternative secondary school services, while the Adult program focuses on job search assistance and workplace training with related instruction. The Youth program also emphasizes leadership skills development and community service activities, which the Adult program lacks. Both programs provide occupational skills training and links to employment, but these activities are more accessible in the Youth program. The Youth program emphasizes leadership skills and community service activities, while the Adult program lacks this focus. Both programs offer occupational skills training and employment links, but the Youth program provides more accessible training opportunities. The Youth program also offers supportive services like child care and transportation, as well as adult mentoring and counseling for drug and alcohol abuse. In comparison, the Adult program primarily focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase. The Youth program offers leadership skills, community service activities, occupational skills training, and supportive services like child care and transportation. The Adult program focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase. DOL published a request for comment on selecting low-performing centers for closure based on performance rating, on-board strength, and facility condition. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing low-performing centers based on factors like on-board strength, facility condition, and student outcomes. DOL aims to improve center performance through federal oversight and ensure at least one center remains in each state. Cost is not a primary factor in the closure proposal. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing low-performing centers as part of its reform agenda to improve center performance. Cost is not cited as a driving factor, but budget constraints emphasize the need to maximize resources for students and taxpayers. H.R. 803 includes provisions to improve and potentially close underperforming centers, with new performance measures and a requirement for improvement plans for centers with less than 50% performance. The bill aims to close low-performing centers that do not improve, with new performance measures and provisions for improvement plans. It also requires an audit of center performance over the past 10 years, ranking them based on performance and incidents of violence. The DOL Secretary must submit a report to Congress identifying centers with poor performance indicators. The bill aims to close low-performing Job Corps centers based on audit findings of poor performance indicators, including incidents of violence. The DOL Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress identifying the bottom-ranked centers for closure within 12 months of enactment. Similar proposals have been suggested in previous Congresses but were not implemented. The 104th Congress proposed legislation to close 25 underperforming Job Corps centers based on various criteria. The proposal also suggested transferring operation of Job Corps from the federal government to the states. Some Members objected to this transfer due to concerns about potential decreases in student numbers. The 104th Congress proposed closing underperforming Job Corps centers and transferring operations to states, which raised concerns about decreased student numbers and limited access to programs outside their states. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 would give the Secretary authority to close centers and make changes to the program. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) would give the Secretary authority to determine center closures, establish performance levels, and implement a performance improvement plan for the Youth Activities program. It also includes common measures for performance metrics across various workforce programs. The common measures are a set of performance metrics used in various workforce programs, including Youth Activities and Job Corps. These measures include placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, and literacy and numeracy gains. ETA implemented the common measures policy in 2003 to collect program performance data. ETA implemented common measures for youth programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps in 2003. These measures are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act. The common measures do not replace existing statutory reporting requirements for WIA, and states still negotiate performance goals for Youth Activities. Table A-1 shows the goals and outcomes of common measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs for PY2011 and PY2012. The common measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs include goals and outcomes for PY2011 and PY2012. The goals are set ambitiously and may be adjusted for individual grantees. Performance targets are developed using regression analysis. DOL sets performance targets for Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Job Corps programs using regression analysis to account for economic and individual factors. Targets are based on program results, labor market conditions, and economic assumptions. The DOL sets performance targets for Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Job Corps programs using regression analysis. Targets are based on economic assumptions, program results, and factors developed for the regression model. Each program met or exceeded its goals in PY2011 and PY2012, with a focus on placement in employment or education for youth. The DOL sets performance targets for Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Job Corps programs based on economic assumptions and program results. Each program met or exceeded its goals in PY2011 and PY2012, focusing on placement in employment or education for youth. Attainment of a Degree or Certificate measures the share of youth participants who attain a diploma, GED, or certificate by the end of the third quarter after the exit quarter. The DOL specifies that a work readiness certificate does not qualify as a diploma. Youth in postsecondary school are excluded from this measure. Literacy or Numeracy Gains measure the increase in educational functional levels for out-of-school youth through assessments in reading, writing, and math. The DOL measures literacy and numeracy gains for out-of-school youth by assessing reading, writing, and math skills. Pre-tests are given before entering the program, with follow-up tests at regular intervals within a year. Those not basic skills-deficient are excluded to focus on remediation. Additional guidance by DOL outlines acceptable test types. The DOL measures literacy and numeracy gains for out-of-school youth through assessments in reading, writing, and math skills. Those who are not basic skills-deficient are excluded to focus on remediation. Additional guidance by DOL discusses types of tests and accommodations for students with disabilities."
