Unemployment may not immediately decrease when the economy improves after a recession due to firms keeping underutilized employees on payroll to avoid costs. Employers may initially increase output without hiring more workers by raising current employees' productivity, temporarily boosting labor productivity growth. In the early stages of a recovery, firms can increase productivity of current employees to meet rising demand without hiring more workers, temporarily boosting labor productivity growth. However, once labor resources are fully utilized, output growth is limited by productivity growth until firms start hiring. Over time, the relationship between real GDP growth and unemployment follows \"Okun's law,\" where employment rises when GDP growth exceeds labor productivity growth, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate. In the long run, there is a negative relationship between changes in real GDP growth rates and unemployment, known as \"Okun's law\" coined by economist Arthur Okun in the 1960s. This law states that stable unemployment rates require real GDP growth equal to potential output growth. Potential output is the economy's capacity to produce goods and services when resources are fully utilized. The rate of growth in potential output is determined by potential productivity and labor supply at full employment. When the unemployment rate is high, actual GDP falls short of potential GDP, creating an output gap. If GDP growth lags behind labor force growth, unemployment will rise as not enough new jobs are created. When GDP growth falls below labor force growth, unemployment will rise as not enough new jobs are created to accommodate job seekers. Conversely, if GDP growth exceeds labor force growth, unemployment will fall as new jobs are created to meet rising demand. Only when GDP growth surpasses the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity will the unemployment rate decrease in the long run. The unemployment rate will rise if GDP growth falls below labor force growth. To lower the unemployment rate, GDP growth must exceed the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity. Labor force growth has slowed over time, from 1.6% between 1950 and 2000 to 0.8% between 2000 and 2010, and is projected to further decrease to 0.7% per year on average. The annual rate of labor force growth has slowed over time, from 1.6% between 1950 and 2000 to 0.8% between 2000 and 2010, and is projected to further decrease to 0.7% per year on average. Productivity growth has also fluctuated, with rates varying between 2.8% and 1.4% in different time periods. The annual rate of productivity growth has fluctuated over time, from 1.4% between 1995 and 2005 to 1.6% between 2005 and 2011. Real GDP growth above 2.5% is needed to lower the unemployment rate, according to Okun's law. It may take some time for the unemployment rate to decline after an economic recovery. The time it takes for the unemployment rate to decline after an economic recovery varies. Following past economic contractions, the unemployment rate began to trend downward at different points. For example, after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, it took over a year for the rate to start declining, leading to jobless recoveries. In contrast, after earlier recessions, the rate started declining within five months. The current recovery is closer to the longer end of this range, with the unemployment rate experiencing two successive monthly declines 12 months after the start of the recovery from the 2007-2009 recession, also labeled a jobless recovery. The current recovery lies within the high-end of the range for the time it takes for the unemployment rate to decline after an economic recovery. After the 2007-2009 recession, the unemployment rate experienced two successive monthly declines 12 months into the recovery, leading to a jobless recovery. The pace of decline in the unemployment rate has varied after postwar recessions, with some taking at least eight months for a one percentage point decrease. The recovery after the 2007-2009 recession saw a slow decline in the unemployment rate, with some debate over the applicability of Okun's law. Despite high growth rates, the unemployment rate stalled at around 9.0% in 2011 before accelerating in the fourth quarter. The unemployment rate stalled at about 9.0% in the first three quarters of 2011, with slow GDP growth. However, output growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate to 8.5% in December 2011. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke noted a disconnect between the unemployment rate and GDP growth, suggesting it may have compensated for a previous deviation from Okun's law. Based on analysis by Bernanke and researchers at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, there was a temporary disconnect between the unemployment rate and GDP growth in 2011, possibly compensating for earlier deviations from Okun's law. Previous recessions also showed periods of instability in the relationship between economic growth and unemployment, with variations possibly due to the stage of the business cycle. The relationship between economic growth and unemployment has shown periods of instability, possibly influenced by the business cycle. Owyang and Sekhposyan caution against relying too heavily on calculations linking changes in unemployment to output growth. Ball et al, however, support Okun's theory that output changes affect unemployment equally in both recoveries and recessions, with no breakdown observed during recent jobless recoveries. Okun's law applies to both recoveries and recessions, with no breakdown observed during recent jobless recoveries. Large output gaps persisted in the three jobless recoveries from 1990-1991, 2001, and 2007-2009 recessions. Researchers believe Okun's Law has earned its name as a strong and stable macroeconomic relationship. According to economists, Okun's Law is considered strong and stable in macroeconomics. Economist Robert J. Gordon estimates potential output growth at 3.4% annually since 1875, but predicts a slower rate of 2.4% over the next 20 years due to diminishing gains from technology investments. This slower growth, along with expected declines in labor force growth, could lead to a declining unemployment rate. Economists Susanto Basu and John G. Fernald also analyze the outlook for potential output growth. Economists Susanto Basu and John G. Fernald suggest that a drop in household net worth during the 2007-2009 recession may lead to a larger supply of labor in the near term, temporarily boosting growth in potential output. However, disruptions in financial markets could constrain growth due to higher investment risks. Weidner and Williams also examined the uncertain estimates of growth in potential output. The uncertain estimates of growth in potential output in financial markets may constrain growth due to higher investment risks. Weidner and Williams found that potential output growth varied during past recoveries, with slower growth after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions. They estimated potential GDP growth at 2.1% at the start of the recovery from the Great Recession, leading to a falling unemployment rate with real economic growth above this level. The Congressional Budget Office projected a lower potential output growth rate of 2.2% between 2012 and 2022, compared to 3.3% between 1950 and 2011. This decrease is mainly due to reduced potential labor force growth, with retirements among baby-boomers being a significant factor. The Congressional Budget Office projected a greatly reduced potential labor force growth rate from 1.5% between 1950 and 2011 to 0.5% between 2012 and 2022, mainly due to increasing retirements among baby-boomers. The annual average growth rate of real GDP is expected to stay below potential output growth until 2018, leading to unemployment rates above 8.0% through 2014, then falling to 5.9% by 2017 as the output gap narrows."
