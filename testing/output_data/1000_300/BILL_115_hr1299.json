Congress finds that the Honduran police are corrupt and commit human rights abuses with impunity, including torture, rape, illegal detention, and murder. The New York Times revealed documents showing top police officials ordered the killings of drug-crime investigators in 2009 and 2011, with the knowledge of high-ranking government officials. Individuals in the police with records of human rights abuses continue to act with impunity. The President of Honduras manipulates the police for corrupt purposes. Officers with a history of human rights abuses are promoted, and international bodies report widespread impunity for killings and death squad activities within the police force. Investigations into police abuses are hindered by inefficiency and corruption, leading to a culture of impunity. The Honduran police force is marred by inefficiency, corruption, and impunity. Efforts to clean up the police have largely failed, with minimal progress in prosecuting members involved in corruption and human rights abuses. Fundamental reform of the police is still needed. Rights Action documented the involvement of the Fifteenth Battalion of the Honduran Armed Forces in killings of small-farmer activists in the Aguan Valley since 2000. Human Rights Watch confirmed the lack of consequences for these killings in 2015. Only one private actor has been convicted so far, and assassinations of activists continue, as seen with the deaths of Jose Angel Flores and Silmer Dionisio George in 2016. In October 2016, Jose Angel Flores and Silmer Dionisio George of the Unified Campesino Movement of the Aguan were assassinated. Other instances of human rights abuses by the military include the killing of Tomas Garcia in July 2013 and the torture and killing of Amado Maradiaga Quiroz in May 2014. These cases remain unresolved. In December 2015, the Honduran Navy reportedly killed Joel Palacios Lino and Elvis Armando. The Honduran military has been involved in various human rights abuses, including the torture and killing of Amado Maradiaga Quiroz and his son. In another case, two Garifuna men were killed by the Navy while digging a car out of the sand on a beach. The government has expanded the military's role in domestic policing, leading to fatal incidents like the killings of a 15-year-old boy and a student who passed unarmed through checkpoints. The Honduran military has been implicated in human rights abuses, with incidents such as the killings of a 15-year-old boy and a student passing through checkpoints. The country's judicial system is plagued by corruption, with officials linked to organized crime and drug traffickers, leading to near-complete immunity. The creation of new battalions of the Military Police has raised concerns about increased human rights violations. The judicial system in Honduras is corrupt, with officials connected to organized crime and drug traffickers, leading to widespread impunity. Efforts to reform the justice system have been ineffective, with rampant crime and human rights abuses remaining the norm. The assassination of activist Berta Caceres in 2016 highlights the ongoing challenges in the country. The assassination of activist Berta Caceres in 2016 exemplifies the human rights crisis in Honduras, showcasing the government's failure to investigate threats and provide adequate protection measures. The killing of Berta Caceres in 2016 highlighted the human rights crisis in Honduras, with 33 threats reported prior to her death, none of which were investigated. Eight suspects, including individuals with ties to the Honduran military, have been arrested, raising concerns about military involvement in her assassination. The government of Honduras has restricted access to the case for Caceres' family. The Honduran government restricts access to the case file of Berta Caceres, despite calls for an independent investigation by various groups. The Honduran government restricts access to the case file of Berta Caceres, despite calls for an independent investigation. Activists, journalists, and critics of the government are at severe risk of human rights abuses, with previous crimes largely unpunished. The shooting of journalist Felix Molina in 2016 highlights the ongoing danger, as he had linked Caceres's killing to government officials. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $18 million to the Honduran police and military. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $18 million to the Honduran police and military, with additional funding authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The Inter-American Development Bank also lent $59.8 million to the Honduran police in 2012 with U.S. approval. SEC. 3. Suspension of security assistance to Honduras' police and military, including equipment and training. The Secretary of the Treasury to vote against any loans for the Honduran police or military at multilateral development banks. SEC. 4. Conditions for lifting suspensions and restrictions. The Act will end when the Secretary of State certifies that Honduras has pursued legal action for various murders and human rights violations, including those of Berta Caceres and small-farmer activists. Military and police members found guilty of human rights violations must be prosecuted. The Honduran government must investigate and prosecute military and police members responsible for human rights violations, withdraw the military from domestic policing, and protect the rights of various activists and critics. The Honduran government must protect the rights of activists and critics, including trade unionists, journalists, human rights defenders, Indigenous, Afro-Indigenous, small-farmer, and LGBTI activists. It should also establish the rule of law and ensure a capable judicial system to prosecute police and military members for human rights abuses."
