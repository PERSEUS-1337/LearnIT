    "content": "Bankruptcy filings peaked in 1987 for businesses and continued to grow for consumers until 2005 when filings surpassed 2 million. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 caused a rush of filings before its implementation. Filings dropped sharply in 2006 due to accelerated filings, but rose steadily until 2010. The long-term impact of BAPCPA on reducing filings is still uncertain. Household debt figures are shown in Table 2. Household debt figures, including mortgage debt and consumer credit, are detailed in Table 2. Consumer credit comprises revolving credit (credit card debt) and non-revolving debt (auto and college loans). Mortgage debt is borrowing secured by real estate, with home equity lending as a subcategory. Federal Reserve estimates the burden of debt service as a percentage of household disposable income. The burden of debt service, as a percentage of household disposable income, has fluctuated within a narrow range in recent years. Despite a gradual increase in debt burden since the 1980s, it does not explain the significant rise in personal bankruptcy filings. The decline in debt service ratio since 2007 has not led to a reduction in bankruptcy rates. There has been a fivefold increase in personal bankruptcy filings over the past two decades, despite a decline in the debt service ratio since 2007. Interest rates, especially mortgage rates, have decreased to historically low levels, leading to a rise in the ratio of debt outstanding to income. This increase in debt burden suggests that further bankruptcy filings may occur if interest rates rise suddenly. The rise in personal bankruptcy filings has outpaced the increase in debt burden since 1990. Declining interest rates have allowed households to take on more debt without a significant rise in interest payments. Variations exist among families, with some struggling to repay debt. Data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances shows a high percentage of lower-income families facing financial distress. The data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances highlights the high distress rate among lower-income families facing financial difficulties. Despite no significant increase in debt burden, personal bankruptcy filings have risen since 1990. In 2007, there was a notable increase in distress among higher-income families, possibly due to increased mortgage debt during the housing boom. The question remains why families at or below the national median income levels take on high debt levels leading to bankruptcy court. The rise in consumer bankruptcy filings since 1990 may be due to increased mortgage debt taken on during the housing boom. Families at or below the national median income levels are facing high levels of debt leading to bankruptcy court. Supporters of the 2005 bankruptcy reform argued that the code was too debtor-friendly, while opponents blamed credit card issuers and lenders for financial distress. The lack of a consensus explanation suggests the issue will remain controversial. In December 2007, the U.S. economy entered a recession amidst global financial panic, leading to a decline in household debt levels. Debt balances fell for 11 quarters before slightly rising in the second quarter of 2011. Factors contributing to the decrease in debt include households paying down debt, borrowing less, and a reduction in mortgage debt. Mortgage debt accounted for most of the drop in debt balances, with factors such as households paying down debt, borrowing less, and lenders tightening credit standards contributing to the decrease. Mortgage balances have fallen due to modifications, negotiations reducing principal outstanding, and foreclosed homes being sold for less than the old mortgage amount. Causes and implications of deleveraging are discussed in CRS Report R41623, U.S. Household Debt Reduction."
