    "content": "President Bush signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, which included funding for transportation and election reform projects. The Act also included an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. Congress passed a continuing resolution for FY2004 funding, extending funding for programs to January 31, 2004. On November 21, 2003, Congress passed a continuing resolution for FY2004 funding, extending funding for programs to January 31, 2004. The Senate and House of Representatives each passed their versions of the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bills, with key financial differences from the Administration request. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill provides $85.8 billion. Key financial differences include $4.4 billion in highway funding and the deletion of $3.4 billion for airport grants. Congress is now considering appropriations for DOT, Treasury, Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and General Government in a single bill. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill consolidates funding for various agencies under a single bill due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. This reorganization transferred agencies like the United States Coast Guard and Transportation Security Administration to DHS from the Department of Transportation, and others like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to DHS from the Department of the Treasury. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) underwent a reorganization in FY2004, transferring various agencies from the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury to DHS. Budget numbers were adjusted for comparison, and there was a 0.65% across-the-board rescission in FY2003. The House divides its appropriation bill into six titles, while the Senate has five titles. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission for the Departments of Transportation and Treasury. The Administration's FY2004 budget request was $85.9 billion, slightly lower than the FY2003 figure. The allocation of funding within the request is shown in Table 2. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission for the Departments of Transportation and Treasury. The Administration's FY2004 budget request was $85.9 billion, slightly lower than the FY2003 figure. Table 2 shows the allocation of funding within the overall request for Transportation/Treasury Appropriations in FY2003-FY2004. The Senate report on \"Independent Agencies\" noted reductions in transportation funding due to disputes over funding mechanisms. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 included a 0.59% rescission not reflected in the figures, resulting in a drop in total funding from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 included a 0.59% rescission, reducing total funding from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion. Funding trends for Transportation/Treasury Appropriations from FY1999-FY2004 show adjustments for comparison with previous years. The Transportation/Treasury Appropriations for FY1999-FY2004 were adjusted for comparison with previous years. The FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, with various across-the-board rescissions in different years. The FY2004 DOT budget proposed $54.3 billion, with across-the-board rescissions in different years. The budget request aligned with TEA-21 and FAIR21 authorizing acts, with some proposed changes to highway and transit funding structure. The request proposed changes to the highway and transit funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. Figures in the table may differ slightly from the text due to supplemental appropriations and other funding actions. Funding for two programs was struck during House deliberations on H.R. 2989. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck due to disputes over fund allocation: FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program ($3.425 billion) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program ($47 million), reducing total transportation funding in the bill by those amounts. These figures do not include across-the-board rescissions and are in addition to the annual authorization for the Essential Air Service. The FY2004 funding includes a 0.65% rescission from P.L. 108-7 and does not reflect the 0.59% rescission from H.R.2673. Additionally, there is $102 million allocated for the Essential Air Service program and $187 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System. Congress provided $111.5 million for motor carrier safety activities and $100 million transferred from FHWA to NHTSA. The difference in budgetary resources available to NHTSA for FY2003 and FY2004 is $131 million. The FY2004 funding includes a $100 million transfer from FHWA to NHTSA, resulting in a $131 million difference in budgetary resources available. Additionally, Congress postponed Amtrak's repayment of a $100 million loan from DOT. The total resources for RSPA for FY2003 are $119 million, and for FY2004 are $132 million, with $14 million in permanent appropriations not reflected in the figures. Rescissions of unobligated previous years' contract authority have been subtracted, resulting in a total available resources of $55.9 billion for FY2003 enacted. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 provides the FAA with $13.93 billion in funding, a $440 million increase from FY2003. The total resources available for FY2003 enacted were $55.9 billion. The funding amount differs slightly from the House and Senate bills. The FAA budget for FY2004, as provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, is $13.93 billion, a $440 million increase from FY2003. The majority of the increased funding would be used for Operations & Maintenance expenses, with no major new initiatives proposed. Funding comes mainly from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with some O&M funding from Treasury general fund monies. The Administration aimed to increase the general fund contribution to O&M funding. The Administration aimed to increase the general fund contribution to O&M funding, with the FY2004 Act raising it to $4.5 billion from $3.3 billion proposed for FY2003. The House initially suggested $1.5 billion, but it was amended to $3.5 billion during debate. The Senate proposed $1.5 billion, but the final Act increased it to $4.5 billion, a significant part of the annual FAA budget debate. The FY2004 Act increases the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion for O&M spending, which includes funding for FAA personnel salaries and air traffic control system costs. The same amount was included in both the House and Senate bills, representing a significant increase over the previous year's funding level. The FY2004 Act provides $2.91 billion for Facilities and Equipment (F&E) activities, with $30 million subject to rescission. Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) receives $119.4 million in funding. There are no significant new F&E spending initiatives in the Act. The FY2004 Act allocates $119.4 million for Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D), which is slightly higher than the proposed amounts. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, funded through user fees, has an authorized level of $50 million but receives additional funding from other sources. The EAS program has an annual authorized funding level of $50 million but receives additional funding from other sources. In FY2003, $102 million was provided for the program, with $50 million from regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. The FY2004 Act also allocates $102 million for EAS, rejecting the overflight fee as the principal funding mechanism and precluding funding for a pilot cost-sharing program. This funding level is the same as proposed by the Senate and $11 million less than what was provided by the House, despite calls from the Bush Administration to reduce it. The FY2004 Act sets a $102 million program level for the EAS program, rejecting calls to reduce its size and require local contributions. The House provision for improved program coordination and funding reporting is also absent. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) is recommended to receive $3.425 billion, $25 million above the Administration's proposal. The Bush Administration FY2004 budget proposed $3.4 billion for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), with the House recommending $3.425 billion. The House-passed bill did not include funding for AIP, but the Senate-passed bill provided $3.5 billion, including a $100 million transfer from the facilities and equipment account. The appropriations bill provided $3.5 billion for AIP, including a $100 million transfer from the F&E account. Priority was given to projects at 241 airports named in the report. The bill prohibited using AIP grants for airport changes needed for bulk explosive detection systems. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provided $3.4 billion for AIP, without the $100 million transfer from the F&E account. It also prohibited using AIP grants for certain airport improvements. The Senate-passed bill includes a $100 million transfer from the F&E account. P.L.108-199 prohibits using AIP grants for certain airport improvements. The FHWA budget provides funding for the Federal-Aid Highway Program. The President requested $30.2 billion for FHWA in FY2004. The FHWA budget for FY2004 requested $30.2 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the previous year. The proposed obligation limitation was set at $29.3 billion, with funding for exempt programs increasing to $931 million. The budget included a new $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative. The FY2004 FHWA budget proposed a $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative, distributing funds for congestion projects based on the Surface Transportation Program formula. Revenues from the gasohol excise tax would be redirected to the highway trust fund, adding $600 million in FY2004. Legislation would be required for this change. The House and Senate passed FY2004 appropriations bills for FHWA, with the House bill providing $34.6 billion, $2.2 billion over FY2003 levels. The bill included a change to redirect gasohol excise tax revenues to the highway trust fund, adding $600 million. Legislation would be needed for this change. The Senate-passed FY2004 appropriations bill provided $34.8 billion for FHWA, with $931 million for exempt obligations. Discretionary programs were heavily earmarked, and $175 million was directed for surface transportation projects. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocated $34.7 billion in total budgetary resources. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocated $34.7 billion for FHWA, with a slight increase over the House total and a decrease from the Senate total. The limitation on obligations is $33.8 billion, similar to both the House and Senate bills. Project earmarking heavily earmarked all discretionary programs under FHWA's control. The FY2004 conference agreement heavily earmarked all discretionary programs under FHWA's control, including core formula programs that were traditionally free of earmarks. The FY2004 conference agreement earmarked over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds for various transportation programs, with a 100% federal share for eligible projects. This is a departure from past practices where the federal share was determined by the specific program. The FY2004 conference agreement provides a 100% federal share for earmarked projects, a departure from past practices. Nearly $300 million unobligated core formula funds are allocated for interagency transfers and project earmarks, including funds for Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Additionally, funds are allocated for construction of Pennsylvania Avenue and Amber Alert grants, with a 100% federal share and availability until expended. The FY2004 conference agreement provides a 100% federal share for earmarked projects, including funds for construction of Pennsylvania Avenue and Amber Alert grants. An additional $150 million is allocated for the Appalachian Development Highway System, with $75 million earmarked. The TEA-21 Funding Framework is extended until February 29, 2004, with expectations of retaining existing program funding framework. TEA-21, the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, continued most highway and transit programs from its predecessor legislation. The Federal Highway Administration has various highway programs, including the National Highway System, Interstate Maintenance, Surface Transportation Program, Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation, and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement. Funding for these programs is apportioned annually.

MARAD's budget for FY2004 is $226.4 million, which is $7.8 million more than the House passed bill and $1.2 million less than the Senate passed bill. The focus of the discussion is on promoting the development of the U.S. merchant marine and administering programs for U.S. vessel owners, shipyards, and ship crews. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2003 allocated $226.4 million for MARAD, slightly more than the House bill and slightly less than the Senate bill. The focus is on the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program, which provides loans for purchasing ships and modernizing shipyards to promote growth. The Administration requested no funds for additional loans in FY2004, calling it a \"corporate subsidy,\" but requested $4.5 million for loan administration. The Administration requested $4.5 million for loan administration in FY2003. Congress provided $25 million for the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program in the Wartime Supplemental Appropriations bill. The DOT Inspector General called for more effective review of loan applications and financial oversight after the bankruptcy of American Classic Voyages.

The Treasury Department has historically performed key functions such as formulating economic policies, serving as the financial agent for the government, enforcing financial laws, and producing currency. However, with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, its role has evolved significantly. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in 2002, changing the Treasury Department's role. Treasury remains an economic policymaker and financial manager but has limited law enforcement duties. The Department consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus, with the bureaus accounting for over 95% of employment and funding. The Treasury Department's operating bureaus handle specific duties, with financial responsibilities managed by various agencies and law enforcement tasks carried out by others. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the exception, as it performs both financial and law enforcement functions. The Treasury Department's operating bureaus handle financial responsibilities, while law enforcement tasks are carried out by other agencies. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is unique in performing both financial and law enforcement functions. The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reduced the Treasury Department's involvement in law enforcement, with agencies like the Secret Service and Customs Service being transferred to DHS. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau was created to administer laws related to alcohol and tobacco, taking over responsibilities from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF). The Treasury Department established the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in January 2003 to administer laws related to alcohol and tobacco. The bureau's main duties include collecting excise taxes and classifying products for tax purposes. The Bush Administration sought $11.408 billion in funding for the Treasury Department in FY2004, prioritizing efforts to monitor tax compliance, streamline operations, and combat money laundering. The top priorities for Treasury operations in FY2004 were to bolster IRS's compliance efforts, improve efficiency, combat money laundering, and support international anti-terrorism activities. The proposed budget allocated the majority of funds to IRS, with increases for FinCen and international assistance programs. The Administration proposed $4 million for the Department's International Technical Assistance program to aid countries affected by war or instability. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) was suggested to merge with the Office of Inspector General (OIG). The House Committee on Appropriations approved $11.273 billion in funding for Treasury operations in FY2004, $423.5 million more than FY2003 but $70 million less than the Bush Administration's request. The House Committee on Appropriations approved $11.273 billion in funding for Treasury operations in FY2004, which was $423.5 million more than FY2003 but $70 million less than the Bush Administration's request. H.R. 2989 provided less funding for IRS operations compared to the Administration's request, with reductions in processing, assistance, management, tax law enforcement, and information systems funding, but more funding for Treasury's departmental offices, mainly for administrative costs related to functions transferred to the DHS and increased funding for specific offices. The House approved $11.273 billion in funding for Treasury operations in FY2004, with increases in administrative costs for functions transferred to DHS and funding for specific offices. H.R. 2989 denied combining OIG and TIGTA, adding $1.7 million to OIG's budget for FY2003 and $3.8 million to TIGTA's budget for FY2003. The bill matched the Administration's funding request for FinCen in FY2004 and was approved by the full House on September 9, 2003. The House approved funding for Treasury operations in FY2004, including FinCen, in H.R. 2989. Amendments were introduced, one by Rep. Jim Cooper to reduce funding for an IRS pilot program, and another by Rep. Bernie Sanders to prevent Treasury from using funds to overturn a judicial ruling. Cooper's amendment failed, while Sanders' was not successful. The House passed H.R. 2989 funding Treasury operations in FY2004. Rep. Bernie Sanders introduced an amendment to prevent Treasury from using funds to assist in overturning a judicial ruling in the Cooper v. IBM case regarding age-discrimination in pension plans. The amendment passed by a vote of 258 to 160. The House passed H.R. 2989 funding Treasury operations in FY2004. Rep. Bernie Sanders introduced an amendment to prevent Treasury from using funds to assist in overturning a judicial ruling in the Cooper v. IBM case regarding age-discrimination in pension plans. The amendment passed by a vote of 258 to 160. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill providing $11.196 billion in funding for the Treasury Department in FY2004. The Senate bill S. 1589 provided less funding for IRS operations compared to the Administration's request and the House-passed version of H.R. 2989 for FY2004. Key differences included reduced funding for tax processing, assistance, and management, IRS information systems, and a merger of IRS accounts resulting in decreased funding for tax law enforcement and EITC compliance. Additionally, S. 1589 allocated more funds for Treasury's departmental offices than the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee opposed the merger of the OIG and TIGTA into a new office due to the vast differences in their duties and responsibilities. Instead, it recommended increased funding for OIG by $1.6 million and for TIGTA by $3.8 million in FY2004. The Senate Appropriations Committee opposed merging OIG and TIGTA, recommending increased funding for both in FY2004. The bill also included funding for FinCen to manage new responsibilities under the USA Patriot Act. The Senate passed the bill with an amendment to H.R. 2989 by a vote of 93 to 1. On October 23, 2003, the Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 2989 by a vote of 93 to 1, which included amendments related to Treasury appropriations.

In January 2004, the President proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay increase, with an alternative plan suggesting a 1.5% increase in basic pay and a 0.5% increase in locality pay. Congress had not finalized legislation on pay rates, so the President's plan went into effect. The FY2004 budget resolution aimed for parity between civilian and military pay increases. H.R. 2989 proposed a 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees in January 2004, matching the military increase, with the split between basic and locality pay left to the President's discretion. The January 2004 pay increase proposal for civilian employees was set at 4.1%, matching the military increase. The split between basic and locality pay would be determined by the President. The 4.1% increase would consist of 2.7% for basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates for similar occupations. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates for similar occupations. Congress has limited the rates of adjustment for FWS wages in high-cost areas to prevent them from exceeding salaries paid to General Schedule supervisors. Wages in lower cost areas will increase according to wage surveys. In high-cost areas, FWS wages are capped to prevent them from exceeding General Schedule supervisor salaries. The Monroney Amendment extended out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel. The Senior Executive Service salaries were changed under the National Defense Authorization Act for 2004, eliminating the six-tier system and capping rates at Level II of the Executive Schedule. The Senior Executive Service salaries were changed under the National Defense Authorization Act for 2004, shifting salary setting authority to the Office of Personnel Management and capping rates at Level II of the Executive Schedule.

Additionally, a $500 million fund was proposed for rewarding top performers with permanent base pay increases. A $500 million fund is set aside for rewarding top-performing individuals with permanent base pay increases. There are no provisions in the House-passed or Senate-reported versions addressing the pay of Members of Congress, Judges, or other federal officials. A pay adjustment of 2.2% is scheduled for officials effective January 2004, with the full adjustment of 2.2% being retroactive. The pay adjustment rate for federal officials was 1.5% until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, when it increased to 2.2% retroactively. The Senate voted against an amendment that would have denied the pay increase to Members of Congress. Pay adjustments for officials are based on ECI calculations, with a 2.2% adjustment in January 2004. The temporary maximum rate of adjustment was 1.5% due to limitations in the General Schedule base pay adjustment. The General Schedule base pay was adjusted at a rate of 1.5% until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 increased it to 2.2% retroactively. The mechanism for pay adjustments is automatic, with no bill language needed. Judges require specific authorization for annual pay increases, unlike Members of Congress and executive branch officials.

The Administration proposed changes to charge administrative costs to each employing agency to improve workplace safety, with a surcharge of around 3.5% of benefit costs. The surcharge would mainly be paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. No similar language is found in the House, Senate, or conference bill. The Administration supported competitive sourcing on H.R. 2989, objected to an amendment hindering it, and threatened a veto if funding prohibition for public-private competitions was included. Competitive sourcing provisions were altered or removed by OMB in H.R. 2673. This initiative is part of the President's Management Agenda since 2001. The OMB has implemented initiatives to promote competitive sourcing since 2001, including revising Circular A-76 and requiring agencies to submit inventories of inherently governmental activities. Section 647 of H.R. 2673 imposes conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees, requiring agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO). The Agencies Appropriations bill of 2004 imposes conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees, requiring agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) and consider the conversion differential in streamlined competitions. The conversion differential is a key consideration in streamlined competitions under Circular A-76. Section 647(a) may override the circular by requiring the competitive sourcing official to assess how the conversion differential would impact the contractor's cost. This assessment involves determining if the contractor's cost would be less than $10 million or 10% of the government's personnel costs. The official must consider the cost of contractor performance under Section 647(a)(2), comparing it to the agency's costs. It is unclear how this comparison should be made or if it could override a performance decision. Standard competitions have a more stringent requirement for adding the conversion differential. The circular and Section 647(a) apply to standard competitions, with a more stringent requirement for adding the conversion differential. Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on competitive sourcing activities, including completed competitions, costs, savings, and projected FTEs. The agency's reporting requirement for competitive sourcing activities includes completed competitions, costs, savings, projected FTEs, and decision-making process. However, the absence of a defined methodology for collecting this information may reduce its usefulness and increase costs. Agency reports could inform OMB policy and agency decisions. The methodology for identifying and collecting required information for competitive sourcing may add to costs. Agency heads are not required to limit performance periods to five years for MEOs under Section 647(c). This flexibility could result in less frequent recompetitions, affecting government agencies and private sector sources differently. Contractors winning public-private competitions are subject to recompetition under FAR, while agencies can write letters of obligation with longer performance periods. Per Circular A-76, contractors winning public-private competitions are subject to recompetition under FAR. Allowing agencies to issue letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years could address recruitment and retention concerns among federal employees. Section 647(d) permits agency heads to use funds for monitoring activities post-competition, supporting oversight and decision-making efforts. Section 647(e) prohibits moving work converted to contractor performance outside the US if previously done by federal employees within the country. This could impact contractor bids if labor costs are cheaper abroad. The provision in the FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on travel transactions, but was dropped in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act. This could impact contractor bids if labor costs are cheaper abroad, but could also help retain jobs in the US. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill aimed to restrict travel transactions, but the provisions were dropped in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act, which also removed two Cuba-related provisions. The White House threatened to veto any legislation weakening economic sanctions against Cuba. U.S. policy towards Cuba has focused on isolating the Communist government since the 1960s. The President's senior advisors would recommend vetoing any bill weakening sanctions against Cuba, which have been in place since the 1960s to isolate the Communist government of Fidel Castro. The sanctions were strengthened by congressional acts in 1992 and 1996, including prohibitions on financial transactions and travel. Cuba sanctions, administered by the Treasury Department's OFAC, have been a source of controversy in recent years. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) govern transactions with Cuba, including travel, and are administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). There have been debates in Congress about lifting or easing Cuba sanctions to promote democracy and human rights on the island. Different approaches include maximum pressure on the Cuban government, lifting some sanctions hurting the Cuban people, or normalizing U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. The House-approved H.R. 2929 had three Cuba provisions. The House-approved H.R. 2929 had provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions and remittances on Cuba. Restrictions on travel have been a contentious issue in U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a key issue in U.S. efforts to isolate the country. Certain categories of travelers, such as government officials, journalists, and those with close relatives in Cuba, may travel under a general license. Supporters of the Flake amendment argued for changes in U.S. policy. Supporters of the Flake amendment argued that U.S. policy towards Cuba restricts the rights of Americans to travel to countries with authoritarian governments, and that such travel can promote freedom and expose Cubans to alternative information. Opponents of the amendment warned that lifting travel restrictions would financially benefit the Cuban government while it suppresses democracy activists, and would not lead to meaningful interactions with ordinary Cubans. In March 2003, OFAC amended Cuba travel regulations to allow travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances, with a $300 limit per quarter for Cuban households. Supporters argued for unlimited financial support for Cuban Americans to send to their families, while opponents feared more money would go to the Cuban regime through inflated prices at government-owned stores. H.Amdt. 377 (Delahunt) and H.Amdt. 382 (Davis) were approved to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances. In March 2003, OFAC tightened Cuba travel regulations, restricting certain types of educational exchanges. H.Amdt. 382 (Davis) aimed to prohibit funds from eliminating people-to-people educational exchanges, which became section 749 of the House bill. Some groups supported the restrictions, while others criticized the decision to limit travel opportunities for ordinary people to Cuba. Some criticized the Administration's decision to restrict travel to Cuba for educational exchanges, while others saw it as an opportunity for unrestricted travel. Senate approved a provision to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions to Cuba, with a similar amendment in the House bill. The Dorgan amendment, similar to the Flake amendment in the House bill, aimed to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba. Momentum for these legislative proposals was affected by Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 had less support compared to previous years. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL31740 and CRS Report RL31139 on Cuba. The bill was approved by a vote of 262-167. Relevant reports include CRS Report RL31740 and CRS Report RL31139 on Cuba. Various acronyms related to transportation and aviation legislation were also mentioned. The curr_chunk provides a list of acronyms related to transportation and aviation legislation, including DOT, FAA, FHWA, FTA, and more.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) budget is funded through transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget and is part of the discretionary budget. Key programs include TEA-21, TIFIA, and TSA. The DOT budget is funded mainly by transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds, such as the highway trust fund and airport trust fund, provide the majority of funding. Highway and transit programs receive contract authority from the highway trust fund, making up a significant portion of DOT appropriations. Most highway and transit programs receive contract authority from the highway trust fund, which is significant for budgeting. This authority allows funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year without the need for new appropriations. Transportation appropriators face a unique situation where the authority to spend for these programs already exists, and the mechanism to obligate funds is in place. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections, creating a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs to make altering funding levels difficult. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century created a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs, making it difficult to alter funding levels. Additional highway funds can be provided annually through Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA). TEA-21 changed the role of House and Senate appropriations and budget committees in determining spending levels for these programs. TEA-21 altered the role of House and Senate appropriations committees in setting annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The committees are now limited in their ability to adjust obligations, with spending levels established by TEA-21 and adjusted annually through RABA computation. The FY2000 and FY2001 appropriations acts saw attempts by appropriators to regain some control over highway spending by redistributing funds and adding new projects. In the FY2000 and FY2001 appropriations acts, appropriators attempted to regain control over highway spending by redistributing funds and adding new projects. This trend continued in the FY2002 Act with major redistributions of RABA funds and transfers to agencies not eligible for RABA funding under TEA-21. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (FAIR21 or AIR21) guarantees Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) program spending. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (FAIR21 or AIR21) guarantees Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) program spending through two point-of-order rules for the House and Senate. Supporters believe it requires increased spending on aviation programs, but some view the guarantees as weaker than those in TEA-21. Congress can waive points-of-order during legislation consideration. Transportation appropriators have control over spending only for the TSA due to TEA-21 and FAIR21 enactment. Enactment of TEA-21 and FAIR21 gives transportation appropriators control over spending for TSA, Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and smaller DOT agencies. Transportation budgeting involves a complex lexicon of budget authority and contract authority, with contract authority providing obligational funding for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Changes in spending for transportation had previously been achieved through the appropriations process. Contract authority, a form of budget authority, provides obligational funding for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Changes in transportation spending were previously achieved through the appropriations process by combining changes in budget/contract authority and placing limitations on obligations. Contract authority allows authorized funds to be automatically available to states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legislation. Appropriations are required for outlays at a future date to cover these obligations. TEA-21 amended Title 23 U.S.C. to streamline this process. TEA-21 amended 23 U.S.C. to authorize funds automatically available to states at the start of each fiscal year without the need for appropriations legislation. The Act limited the role of appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligations levels for FY1999 through FY2003. States pay for projects upfront, and federal payments are made upon project completion, leading to high trust fund balances. Trust fund balances remain high due to obligated funds representing work in progress, which are not subtracted from balances. Both highway and transit accounts have short- and long-term commitments, including payments for current fiscal year projects and outstanding obligations for future dates. Unobligated amounts are still dedicated to projects. Apportionments distribute contract authority funds to states and programs. The distribution of contract authority funds to states and programs involves apportionments for formula-driven programs and allocations for programs under direct federal control. Apportionments are funds distributed to states, while allocations are funds distributed administratively to various entities. These terms provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients."
