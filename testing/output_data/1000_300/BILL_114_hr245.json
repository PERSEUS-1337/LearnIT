    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. CODIFICATION OF EFFECTIVE DATES FOR CLAIMS UNDER THE LAWS ADMINISTERED BY THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\" has been condensed to focus on the codification of effective dates for claims under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to claims for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, including terms like 'claimant', 'claim', 'formal claim', and 'informal claim'. The curr_chunk defines an 'informal claim' as a written communication requesting entitlement to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary, submitted in a non-prescribed format, indicating intent to apply for benefits, identifying the benefit sought, and made by a claimant or authorized representative. The curr_chunk introduces the term 'reasonably raised claim' as evidence of entitlement to benefits not explicitly raised in a claim but logically placed at issue. It also includes a clerical amendment to the table of sections in the relevant title. The curr_chunk amends sections related to informal claims and effective dates in the context of filing formal claims for benefits. The curr_chunk amends Section 5110(a) by specifying that an application for benefits is considered filed on the date of an informal communication, as long as a formal application is submitted within 180 days of receiving necessary forms from the Secretary. The Secretary will consider an application filed on the date the completed form is submitted if the applicant fails to file within 180 days of receiving necessary forms. Additionally, a new section is added to address reasonably raised claims in the adjudication process. The Secretary will consider an application filed on the date the completed form is submitted if the applicant fails to file within 180 days of receiving necessary forms. A new section is added to address reasonably raised claims in the adjudication process, including evidence relating to separate conditions never identified as part of a formal claim. The amendments made by this Act regarding the treatment of reasonably raised claims will be effective on the date of enactment and apply to claims submitted on or after that date."
