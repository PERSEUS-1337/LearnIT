    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Police Gun Buyback Assistance Act\". Congress finds that decommissioned firearms once used by law enforcement agencies have been involved in over 3,000 crimes in the past 9 years, including 293 homicides, 301 assaults, and 279 drug-related crimes. Additionally, white supremacist Buford Furrow used a Glock pistol sold by a law enforcement agency to shoot children at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. Twelve firearms stolen during shipment from the Miami-Dade Police Department to Chicago have been traced to crimes in Chicago, including a shooting near a playground. Many State and local law enforcement departments also resell firearms that were previously used. The Act aims to reduce the number of firearms on the streets by stopping the transfer of decommissioned firearms to individuals. Law enforcement agencies have been involved in reselling firearms used in crimes, including assault weapons. Some departments have started destroying decommissioned firearms to prevent their circulation.

The Attorney General may provide grants to States or local governments to purchase new firearms and destroy decommissioned firearms. To be eligible for a grant, a State or local government must have a policy that prohibits transferring decommissioned firearms to individuals and requires their destruction, with an exception for law enforcement agencies. The Act allows for the transfer of decommissioned firearms to law enforcement agencies, with funds from grants only to be used for purchasing new firearms. To apply for a grant under this Act, the chief executive of a State or unit of local government must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information. Regulations for the grant application process are outlined in Section 5. The Attorney General must establish regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment for grant applications. States and local governments must report on Act implementation within 2 years of receiving funds. Budget assurances for law enforcement agencies are required to ensure future firearm purchases without transferring decommissioned firearms. SEC. 7. DEFINITION.\n\n    Defines \"decommissioned firearm\" as a firearm no longer in use by law enforcement or needed for evidentiary purposes, and clarifies the terms \"firearm\" and \"person.\"\n\nSEC. 8.
