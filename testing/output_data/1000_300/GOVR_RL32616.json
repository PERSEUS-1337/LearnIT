    "content": "The 9/11 Commission report highlighted that key officials responsible for alien admissions were not fully involved in counterterrorism efforts before September 11, 2001, leading to missed opportunities to intercept the terrorists. The report emphasized the need for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities, as the hijackers had known ties to the organization and exhibited suspicious behaviors during their entry into the United States. The 9/11 Commission issued recommendations related to immigration law and policy, emphasizing the importance of targeting terrorist travel, integrating border security into a larger screening network, and supporting the Department of Homeland Security in intercepting terrorists. The U.S. border security system should be integrated into a larger network of screening points, including transportation systems and vital facilities like nuclear reactors. The Department of Homeland Security, with support from Congress, should quickly implement a biometric entry-exit screening system. Collaboration with other governments is essential to prevent terrorists from entering the country. Immigration law and policy reforms have been a key focus in Congress, with several bills implementing recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. In the 108th Congress, immigration-related reforms were a key focus, with two bills passing their respective Houses: H.R. 10 and S. 2845. These bills proposed revisions to immigration law but faced contention among lawmakers, delaying a compromise bill.

The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) was signed on December 17, 2004, incorporating some immigration provisions from the contentious bills. The major areas of consideration in these reform proposals are briefly discussed, with references to CRS reports for in-depth analysis. The 108th Congress focused on immigration-related reforms with the passage of bills H.R. 10 and S. 2845. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) included immigration provisions from these bills. Measures were taken to enhance border security and implement an automated entry and exit data system with biometric identifiers for improved security.

The House and Senate passed measures to enhance visa security, including requiring interviews for nonimmigrant visa applicants aged 12-65 and limiting the President's waiver authority for U.S. citizens traveling abroad. Additionally, there are proposed amendments to waiver authority for arriving foreign nationals, requiring biometric passports for U.S. citizens and foreign nationals from contiguous territories or adjacent islands. The Senate passed a plan for the use of biometric passports, requiring U.S. citizens and foreign nationals from contiguous territories to present biometric passports for travel into the United States. This plan is part of measures to enhance visa security. The House-passed and Senate-passed versions of S. 2845 differed on grounds for alien exclusion, removal, and relief from removal. The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes criteria for foreign nationals entering or remaining in the US, including forms of relief like asylum. Congress has expanded grounds of inadmissibility through various acts starting from 1988. Congress has expanded grounds of inadmissibility and deportation, as well as the use of expedited removal, while also restricting relief from removal and judicial review. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of judicial review in removal-related matters, stating that eliminating it would raise serious constitutional questions. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress expanded terrorism grounds for inadmissibility and removal in response to concerns about loopholes in immigration laws aiding terrorists. Proposals included barring aliens engaged in terrorist activity from relief in removal cases. Proposals post-9/11 aimed to bar aliens engaged in terrorist activity from relief in removal cases, expanding grounds for inadmissibility and deportability related to terror activities. The House-passed bill expands definitions related to terrorist activities, including providing support to terrorist organizations and committing acts of genocide or torture abroad.

The House-passed bill includes provisions related to asylum and relief from removal, stating that aliens seeking asylum must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific characteristics. Additionally, regulations prohibit the return of individuals to countries where there are grounds for believing they would be in danger of torture. The Torture Convention prohibits the return of individuals to countries where there is a risk of torture. Proposed modifications to asylum and relief from removal include establishing stricter standards for asylum applicants accused of terrorist activities and allowing indefinite detention of aliens deemed a danger to national security. The House-passed provision allows for indefinite detention of aliens deemed a danger to national security pending removal, with review every six months. Concerns have been raised about terrorist aliens acquiring U.S. identification documents to facilitate terrorist activities. The 9/11 Commission highlighted that most of the hijackers obtained U.S. identification documents, aiding them in their terrorist activities. National standards for birth certificates and drivers' licenses were recommended to prevent fraudulent acquisition. The controversy surrounding the issuance of these documents has often been associated with immigration legislation. The controversy surrounding the issuance of various forms of identification, such as state drivers' licenses and birth certificates, has been linked with immigration legislation. Congress provided standards for acceptance of these documents for federal purposes, but concerns over a national identification card led to the repeal of this provision in 2000. Following the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, proposals were made to enhance the security of these documents and verify the identity of individuals applying for benefits under the INA. Proposals were made to enhance the security of state-issued identification documents, including drivers' licenses and birth certificates, as well as Social Security documents.
