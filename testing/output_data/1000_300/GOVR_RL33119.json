    "content": "Prior to the passage of SAFETEA, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) provided funds for federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs from FY1998-FY2003. After October 1, 2003, short-term extension acts were used to continue federal surface transportation programs, causing uncertainty in the highway and transit community. Long-term reauthorizations, like TEA-21, are preferred for better long-term planning and construction of infrastructure. The passage of SAFETEA brought relief to the highway and transit community, which had faced uncertainty due to short-term extensions. SAFETEA, originally intended as a six-year bill, was passed as a four-year bill expiring in FY2009. Federal funding for surface transportation is closely tied to the revenue from the highway trust fund, funded primarily by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes. The trust fund has separate accounts for highways and mass transit, with these fuel taxes contributing about 90% of the funds' income. The highway trust fund is primarily funded by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, providing about 90% of its income. The trust fund has separate accounts for highways and mass transit, with the highway account receiving $31 billion in tax revenues in FY2004 and the mass transit account receiving $5 billion. The last increase in fuel tax occurred in 1993, and the trust fund has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation for almost 50 years. The highway trust fund has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation for almost 50 years. In FY2004, the highway account received $31 billion in tax revenues, while the mass transit account received $5 billion. However, there is uncertainty about the long-term financial health of the trust fund due to declining unexpended balances despite higher obligations and appropriations. The trust fund's unexpended balance is substantial but declining, causing uncertainty about its long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided additional income through changes in gasohol taxation. Reauthorization legislation was passed by both the House and Senate, but disagreement on total program funding for the next period stalled progress. The Conference Committee, Congressional Leadership, and the Administration could not agree on total program funding for the next reauthorization period. Some Members of Congress supported more project funding than the Bush Administration, which objected to raising fuel taxes. Various mechanisms, including gasohol changes and tax adjustments, were proposed to support a larger program, but additional measures were needed. Conferees on SAFETEA discussed potential tax and other changes to increase funding. The gasohol changes alone were not enough to fund the desired program size. Conferees on SAFETEA considered various tax and revenue-increasing measures, including cutting back on tax fraud and transferring Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. These changes, combined with gasohol legislation from 2004 and expected economic growth, were believed to be sufficient to finance the $286.4 billion program created by the act. The SAFETEA changes, along with gasohol legislation from 2004 and expected economic growth, were expected to finance the $286.4 billion program created by the act. TEA-21 altered the highway trust fund's relationship with the Federal Unified Budget by creating new budget categories and setting limitations on obligations. It also introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust amounts in the highway account. TEA-21 established obligations for fiscal years FY1999 to FY2003 in authorizing legislation. It introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust highway account amounts based on revenue changes. This set predetermined funding levels for core highway and transit programs, separate from the discretionary budget. The TEA-21 legislation set predetermined funding levels for core highway and transit programs, known as discretionary spending guarantees. These \"firewalls\" ensured funds were dedicated solely to these programs. SAFETEA continued this budget format, providing $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending authority for FY2004-FY2009, with most debate focusing on funding distribution. SAFETEA provided a significant increase in funding, with $286.4 billion guaranteed for FY2004-FY2009, compared to TEA-21's $218 billion for FY1998-FY2003. The debate mainly centered around funding distribution. SAFETEA provided over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority between FY2005-FY2009, with significant funding increases for all major programs. Total annual spending increased each year, with FY2009 spending almost 23% higher than FY2005. More detailed programmatic information can be found at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/fundtables.htm. The House version of SAFETEA included a \"re-opener\" provision. The House version of SAFETEA included a \"re-opener\" provision that would have required Congress to reconsider funding at a later date. TEA-21 created a spending mechanism to adjust highway program obligations based on trust fund revenue changes. RABA provided additional spending authority in its first three years but called for a program reduction in FY2003. SAFETEA changed how RABA is calculated by using a two-year calculation and delaying calculations until FY2007. It also reduced the likelihood of spending reductions by requiring no reductions as long as the highway trust fund balance exceeds $6 billion. The regional character of transportation policy is evident in the debate over the distribution of federal highway aid among states. Congress has included provisions in surface transportation acts to address funding distribution concerns. Donor states, mainly in the South, Midwest, and West, receive less federal highway aid than their highway users contribute to the highway trust fund. Some states, mainly in the South, Midwest, and West, complain about receiving less federal highway aid than their highway users pay in taxes to the highway trust fund. Donor states advocate for a higher share rate-of-return, while donee states oppose any reduction in their existing shares. Donor states argue for equity and fairness, stating they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of infrastructure in donee states for too long. Donor states advocate for equity and fairness in federal highway funding, arguing that they have been subsidizing infrastructure repairs in donee states for too long. They claim to be more road-dependent and not benefiting from federal transit spending like some donee states. Donee states argue that fairness should consider their infrastructure needs, especially in the Northeast, and limited financial resources in large western states. Donee states argue that fairness should not be separated from needs, citing the age of their highway infrastructure, high costs of working on congested urban roads, and limited financial resources in large western states. They also emphasize the federal nature of certain transportation needs and criticize states that spend less on highways but still seek federal funds. The debate over equity remedies has broader implications, with concerns that a 95% rate of return guarantee could limit addressing other federal transportation needs. The debate over equity remedies has broader implications for federal transportation needs. Questions arise about the federal government's role as the minimum guarantee approaches 100%. Some states propose broadening the Minimum Guarantee to include Federal Transit Administration programs. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless. To overcome obstacles, previous reauthorization bills included \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares for all states. Increasing donor state shares to meet the minimum guarantee required expanding the federal highway program size significantly. The 109th Congress balanced donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless by including \"hold harmless\" provisions. This required increasing the federal highway program size significantly to bring donor state shares up to the minimum guarantee percentage. This equity remedy was costly, making the minimum guarantee program under TEA21 the largest highway program. Despite limited funding availability, a modest and gradual increase in the guaranteed rate-of-return to the states was achieved. SAFETEA replaced the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program, ensuring each state receives a minimum rate-of-return on their payments to the highway account of the HTF. The act directed the Secretary of Transportation to allocate sufficient funds for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009 to meet these minimum percentages. The SAFETEA Act replaced the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program from 2005 to 2009, ensuring each state receives a minimum rate-of-return on their payments to the highway account of the HTF. This program includes various transportation programs subject to the equity provision and new formula programs. Hold harmless provisions are also included for certain states. The SAFETEA Act replaced the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program from 2005 to 2009, ensuring each state receives a minimum rate-of-return on their payments to the highway account of the HTF. Hold harmless provisions are included for certain states based on specific criteria. Twenty-seven states qualify under these criteria. The Equity Bonus program from 2005 to 2009 guarantees a minimum rate-of-return for states on their payments to the highway account of the HTF. Twenty-seven states qualify based on specific criteria, with annual percentage floors set for each fiscal year. The program distributes funds to states annually, with the first $2.639 billion apportioned each year. The Equity Bonus Program from 2005 to 2009 ensures a minimum rate-of-return for qualifying states on their payments to the highway account of the HTF. Annual percentage floors are set for each fiscal year, with funds distributed to states annually. The first $2.639 billion is apportioned each year, with additional funds distributed to core programs based on apportionment ratios. Over the five-year SAFETEA life, the EB program distributions will cost $40.9 billion. (CRS contacts: Robert Kirk and John Fischer) SAFETEA increases the number of core programs from five to six, including interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation program, highway bridge and bridge maintenance, and congestion mitigation. Funds for these programs are apportioned to states annually using formulas in SAFETEA, costing $40.9 billion over five years. SAFETEA increases core programs from five to six: interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation program, highway bridge and bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation, and the new highway safety improvement program. Majority of funding in surface transportation bill goes to core highway programs, with additional smaller apportioned programs like metropolitan planning and recreational trails. Few new programs were included in reauthorization. SAFETEA includes new formula programs like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and the Safe Routes to School Program, in addition to existing core highway programs. Funding is primarily allocated based on apportionment formula factors set forth in Title 23 of the U.S. Code. The SAFETEA act made adjustments to existing program formulas under Title 23 of the U.S. Code, including eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside and adjusting the STP Transportation Enhancements set-aside. Funding is allocated based on factors like lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, estimated tax payments, and state shares for bridge repair and Clean Air Act compliance. The SAFETEA act made adjustments to transportation funding formulas, including setting a minimum 10% set-aside for Transportation Enhancements. It also created set-asides for ferry boat construction in Alaska, New Jersey, and Washington, and for the Territorial Highway Program. The off-system bridge program set-aside minimum is maintained at 15%, with a weighted formula distribution based on federal lane miles and vehicle miles traveled. The formula distribution for funding under the SAFETEA act is weighted based on federal lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities on federal-aid highways. The minimum payment to each state is set at 0.5%. The Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP and distributed based on the number of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state. The SAFETEA act allocates funding based on federal lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities on federal-aid highways. The Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP and distributed based on the number of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state. Additionally, $90 million annually is set aside for high-risk rural roads construction and operational improvements. Funds under SAFETEA are apportioned to states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on specific ratios of commercial truck and personal vehicle crossings. Funds under the SAFETEA act are apportioned among states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on specific ratios of commercial truck and personal vehicle crossings. The allocation formula includes factors such as incoming commercial truck crossings, personal vehicle and bus crossings, total weight of incoming cargo, and number of ports-of-entry. Additionally, funds are distributed based on the total student enrollment in primary and middle schools in each state, with no state receiving less than $1 million. Enrollment in primary and middle schools in each state contributes to the total student enrollment in all states for funding allocation. No state will receive less than $1 million. Highway programs not apportioned are allocated based on criteria in highway laws and may include congressional earmarking. SAFETEA's largest allocated program is for congressionally mandated high priority projects, with other significant programs like the federal lands program and interstate maintenance discretionary program. SAFETEA includes various large allocated programs for high priority projects, federal lands, interstate maintenance, bridge discretionary (FY2005 only), and transportation and community system preservation. It also introduces new programs like transportation improvement, national corridor infrastructure, and projects of national/regional significance, all subject to earmarking. The act outlines project selection criteria for national/regional projects. SAFETEA introduces innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs, TIFIA, and SIBs to expedite project completion and attract additional funds for highway projects. These mechanisms have specific strengths and weaknesses analyzed by GAO, CBO, and FHWA. SAFETEA introduces innovative financing mechanisms like TIFIA and SIBs, which provide federal financial assistance for transportation projects. Changes in the programs include reducing project size thresholds and providing $122 million annually for TIFIA's leveraging activities. Federal funds are used to help capitalize state infrastructure under the SIB program. The SAFETEA act introduces innovative financing mechanisms like TIFIA and SIBs, providing federal financial assistance for transportation projects. It lowers the minimum project threshold for intelligent transportation system projects to $15 million and allocates $122 million annually for TIFIA's leveraging activities. The SIB program uses federal funds to help capitalize state infrastructure revolving funds, allowing any state to establish SIBs eligible for federal funds. The act authorizes tolling programs and provisions for tolling HOV lanes. Section 1143 of the revenue title concerning private facility bonds is also expected to impact tolling. The SAFETEA act introduces innovative financing mechanisms like TIFIA and SIBs for transportation projects. It authorizes tolling programs for HOV lanes and private facility bonds. The program allows for 15 tolling projects with funding allocated for FY2005 to FY2009, including $3 million annually for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects. The Secretary of Transportation is directed to carry out 15 demonstration projects for toll collection at existing toll facilities or highways. This new program authorizes 15 demonstration projects for toll collection at existing toll facilities or highways to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or finance highway expansion. Funding will primarily go towards HOT lanes, with revenues restricted to debt service, private financing returns, and operating costs. Excess revenues can be used for federal-aid highway or transit projects if facilities are adequately maintained. The new program authorizes toll collection at existing facilities or highways to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or finance expansion. Toll facilities may vary prices based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality or manage traffic. High occupancy vehicle facilities must adjust toll prices accordingly. Fees are collected electronically only. A pilot toll program allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. The act establishes a pilot toll program for Interstate System highways, bridges, or tunnels to finance construction. States must show toll collection is the most efficient way to fund projects. Private agreements cannot prevent states from improving public roads affected by toll facility traffic. The act allows for a pilot toll program on Interstate System highways, bridges, or tunnels to finance construction. Private agreements cannot prevent states from improving public roads affected by toll facility traffic. Revenues from tolls can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and operating costs. Interstate Maintenance program funds cannot be used on toll facilities. State agencies can allow non-HOV vehicles to pay a toll to use HOV lanes. The provision allows state agencies to establish a toll program for non-HOV vehicles to use HOV lanes, with policies for enrollment, toll collection, demand management, and enforcement. It also permits tolling of low emission vehicles at a preferential rate. Additionally, the act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-exempt bonds for highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. The act allows state agencies to establish toll programs for non-HOV vehicles in HOV lanes and toll low emission vehicles at a preferential rate. It also amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-exempt bonds for highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities, with a $15 billion limit on the bonds that can be issued. The conference report does not estimate the potential infrastructure impact of the $15 billion bonding provision under Title 23 and Title 49. This provision could be significant, with California alone receiving more than $15 billion in highway assistance. While projects using private activity bonds are not required to be supported by tolls, it is likely unless another revenue mechanism is established. The Appalachian Development Highway Program aims to reduce regional isolation through road construction. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) is funded by the highway trust fund and aims to reduce regional isolation in Appalachia. Administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, funds are allocated to member states based on cost estimates for completing the approved Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). As of 2004, 85% of ADHS roads are completed or under construction. Additional federal funds of $4.47 billion are estimated to complete the system from FY2004 onwards. The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) is funded by the highway trust fund to reduce regional isolation in Appalachia. 85% of ADHS roads are completed or under construction as of 2004. Additional federal funds of $4.47 billion are needed to complete the system from FY2004 onwards. The program receives $450 million in contract authority annually under TEA-21 and $470 million annually under SAFETEA. SAFETEA prohibits the use of toll revenues as credits for non-federal matching funds on ADHP-funded projects and contains over 5,092 earmarks for congressional high priority projects. SAFETEA contains over 5,092 earmarks for congressional high priority projects (HPPs) with a value of $14.8 billion, compared to TEA-21 which had 1,849 earmarks worth $9.4 billion. Additionally, SAFETEA includes new earmarked categories for projects of national and regional significance, providing $1.8 billion for 25 projects, and national corridor infrastructure improvements. The earmarking in SAFETEA includes funding for 25 projects of national and regional significance, valued at $1.8 billion, as well as 33 earmarks for national corridor infrastructure improvements totaling over $1.9 billion. Additionally, there are 465 transportation improvement projects with dedicated funding of over $2.5 billion, which is a new program without clear distinctions from the HPP program. Individual projects may appear in multiple earmarking lists with varying funding amounts. The SAFETEA earmarking includes various projects with funding totaling over $24 billion. This includes 32 earmarks in the highway title, 25 earmarks in the research title, and 662 projects in the bus and bus facilities program. Additionally, there are 39 stand-alone earmarks in the transit title. The SAFETEA earmarking includes 662 specific projects with almost $1.6 billion in funding, along with 39 additional stand-alone earmarks valued at over $191 million. The total amount of earmarking in the bill is estimated to exceed $24 billion. Congressional discussion has focused on how earmarking affects the Equity Bonus calculation, with two types of earmarks in the bill for EB purposes. This computation significantly affects state shares due to the distribution of earmarked funds. The distribution of earmarked funds significantly impacts state shares, with some states receiving more funds than others. Transit earmarks are not included in the Equity Bonus calculation, while Transportation Enhancements program activities are similar to those under TEA-21. The TE program funds various project categories such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities, historic preservation, and scenic beautification. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program funds various project categories such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities, historic preservation, scenic beautification, rehabilitation of historic transportation buildings, and environmental mitigation. Funding for TE activities is now the greater of 10% of funds apportioned to a state under the Surface Transportation Program (STP) under SAFETEA. The TE program funding has been modified under SAFETEA, with a 10% set-aside for TE activities ensuring additional funding for enhancement projects. The TCSP program aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans, with funding authorized for projects improving transportation efficiency and reducing environmental impacts. The TCSP program aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans, with funding authorized for projects improving transportation efficiency and reducing environmental impacts. State, tribal, regional, and local governments are eligible for TCSP grants, with a total funding authorization of $270 million over six years. The TCSP program has a total funding authorization of $270 million, with $25 million authorized for FY2005 and $61.25 million authorized for FY2006-FY2009. This is more than TEA-21's $120 million authorization but less than the $454 million appropriated during TEA-21's lifespan. TCSP funding varied from $13.5 million in FY1999 to $273 million in FY2002 under TEA-21. SAFETEA provides significant funding for bicycle and pedestrian programs, with TCSP funding ranging from $13.5 million in FY1999 to $89.5 million in FY2003. The Transportation Enhancements program supports pedestrian and bicycle mobility by funding facilities, safety activities, and preservation of railway corridors for pedestrian or bicycle trails. The Transportation Enhancements program supports pedestrian and bicycle mobility through facilities, safety activities, and preservation of railway corridors for trails. Additionally, the Safe Routes to School Program encourages children to walk and bike to school, promoting a healthier transportation alternative. The Safe Routes to School Program aims to promote walking and biking to school for children, including those with disabilities, to encourage a healthy lifestyle. It will be funded at $612 million for FY2004-FY2009, with funding apportioned among states based on student enrollment ratios. Each state will receive a minimum of $1 million per year, with up to $3 million set aside for administrative expenses. The Safe Routes to School Program will provide funding to promote walking and biking to school for children. Each state will receive a minimum of $1 million per year, with up to $3 million for administrative expenses. The federal share of project costs is 100%, and funds are not transferable. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional agencies, as well as nonprofit organizations. Funds can be used for infrastructure projects to improve school accessibility. The Safe Routes to School Program provides funding for infrastructure projects to improve school accessibility for walking and biking. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional agencies, as well as nonprofit organizations. Funds can be used for various projects such as sidewalk improvements, traffic calming measures, bicycle facilities, pedestrian crossing improvements, and public awareness campaigns. The Safe Routes to School Program allows funding for noninfrastructure-related activities like public awareness campaigns, traffic education, and training for safe routes to school programs. States must allocate 10-30% of the funding for these activities and appoint a full-time coordinator. Additionally, grants are provided to a national nonprofit organization for operating a national safe routes to school clearinghouse. The Secretary is required to make grants to a national nonprofit organization for a safe routes to school clearinghouse, educational programs, and technical assistance. A task force is established to study and develop a strategy for safe routes to school programs nationwide. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed funding for transit for the five-year authorization period. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed funding for transit for the five-year authorization period (FY2005-FY2009), with a total of $52.6 billion including FY2004 funding. Congress shifted funding shares within the transit program, with the Urbanized Area Formula Program receiving a smaller share and the Non-Urbanized Formula Program receiving a larger share. The share of total transit formula funding going to four of the largest states decreased, while California's share increased. The SAFETEA act increased transit formula funding from 3.3% to 5.2%. Funding distribution shifted, with larger states receiving less and smaller states receiving more. Minor changes were made to the federal transit program, including new programs and funding categories. Additional provisions included offering transit passes to federal employees in the National Capital Region and making alternatives analysis eligible for FTA grants. The SAFETEA act increased transit formula funding and made changes to the federal transit program, including offering transit passes to federal employees in the National Capital Region and making alternatives analysis eligible for FTA grants. Additionally, earmarks were provided for the Bus and Bus Facilities Program for FY2006-FY2009, totaling $1.7 billion in additional funding for urbanized and non-urbanized areas. The Urbanized Area Formula and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs allocate funds based on population forecasts for 15 years beyond the most recent Census. Half of the funds go to states based on population ratios, while the other half is for urbanized areas with population densities over 370 persons per mile. This program aims to improve transportation services for individuals with disabilities, including job-related transportation. It is authorized at $339 million for FY2006-FY2009 and is not subject to labor protection provisions. The program authorized at $339 million for FY2006-FY2009 aims to provide transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands, including access for persons with disabilities. Additionally, a new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program, funded by a one-percent set-aside, provides approximately $150 million over the same period. A new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program, funded by a one-percent set-aside, provides additional funding for small urbanized areas under 200,000 in population to improve transit service levels. This program addresses the lack of performance factors in the formula for smaller urbanized areas, focusing on metrics such as passenger miles, vehicle revenue hours, and passengers per capita. The Urbanized Area Formula Program has introduced a new funding program for small urbanized areas under 200,000 in population to improve transit service levels. This initiative aims to address the lack of performance factors in the formula for smaller urbanized areas, which has resulted in disparities in funding allocation for areas providing higher-than-average levels of transit service. DOT's study under Section 3033 of TEA-21 identified the need for changes in the apportionment formulas to recognize and reward the extra effort of these areas. The Urbanized Area Formula Program has introduced a new funding program to reward transit-intensive areas under 200,000 in population. This change will shift 1% of funding from larger urbanized areas to smaller ones. The program, part of the New Starts program, streamlines evaluation for projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding. It is authorized at $200 million annually for FY2007-FY2009. The Small Starts program will have a streamlined evaluation process for projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding. Projects seeking less than $25 million will no longer be exempt from the evaluation process. $45 million is allocated for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on reservations. 20% of the Non-Urbanized Area Formula program funding will be based on a state's non-urbanized land area, while 80% will be based on the non-urbanized population. The act authorizes $90 million for magnetic levitation train deployment for FY2005-FY2009, with 50% allocated for a project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and 50% for a project east of the Mississippi River. Pennsylvania and Maryland had maglev projects selected under the previous deployment program. The TEA-21 deployment program authorizes funding for maglev projects in Pennsylvania and Maryland, with $90 million allocated for FY2005-FY2009. The Swift Rail Act is reauthorized, with $70 million annually for corridor development and $30 million for high-speed rail technology improvements for FY2006-2013. Additionally, $50 million is authorized for the elimination of rail-highway grade crossing hazards in high-speed rail corridors for FY2005-FY2009. The Swift Rail Act authorizes $70 million annually for corridor development and $30 million for high-speed rail technology improvements for FY2006-2013. It also authorizes $50 million for the elimination of rail-highway grade crossing hazards in high-speed rail corridors for FY2005-FY2009. Additionally, grants are directed to the Alaska Railroad for capital rehabilitation and improvements benefiting passenger transportation, with no specific amounts authorized. The Swift Rail Act authorizes funding for corridor development, high-speed rail technology improvements, and the elimination of rail-highway grade crossing hazards. It also provides grants for the Alaska Railroad's passenger operations. The act requires the Federal Railroad Administration to review rail joint bar inspection data and improve crack identification in rail joint bars. Additionally, it directs the development of regulations for pressurized tank cars and recommends ways to reduce the risk of catastrophic fracture in older tank cars. SAFETEA authorizes a new grant program for highway safety, the Highway Safety Improvement Program, which replaces the existing roadway hazard elimination program. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) under TEA-21 replaced the existing roadway hazard elimination program. It funded projects like installing barriers and guard rails, as well as eliminating hazards at rail-highway grade crossings. States were required to spend a set amount annually on hazard elimination projects, with the remainder available for other highway projects if not needed for safety measures. The HSIP Program, authorized at $1.2 billion in FY2006 and rising to $1.3 billion by FY2009, allocates funding based on lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities on federal-aid highways. States must spend a minimum amount on hazard elimination, with a set-aside of $220 million annually for rail-highway grade crossing projects. The HSIP Program allocates funding based on lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities on federal-aid highways. States must spend a minimum amount on hazard elimination, with set-asides for rail-highway grade crossing projects and high-risk rural roads. States are required to prepare a strategic highway safety plan. The overall program authorization is $1.2 billion in FY2006, rising to $1.3 billion by FY2009. Additionally, a new Safe Routes to Schools program is created to fund safety projects. The Safe Routes to Schools program, authorized at $54 million in FY2005 and rising to $183 million by FY2009, funds infrastructure projects to increase children's safety within two miles of schools. A new grant program promotes seat belt use for states enacting primary seat belt laws after December 31, 2002. The act authorizes a grant program to promote seat belt use and expands a grant program to reduce alcohol-impaired driving. Grants are available for states with primary seat belt laws or high seat belt use rates. The federal share for projects funded by these grants is 100%. The act expands a grant program to reduce alcohol-impaired driving by requiring states to carry out specified programs to discourage driving while impaired. States must meet certain criteria to receive a grant, such as having a low alcohol-related fatality rate or implementing a series of programs. The specified programs include checkpoints, prosecution programs, increased blood alcohol testing, and harsher penalties for high blood alcohol levels. The grant program aims to reduce alcohol-impaired driving by implementing various strategies such as increased blood alcohol testing, harsher penalties for high blood alcohol levels, effective alcohol rehabilitation programs, prevention of underage drinking, and administrative license revocation systems. Grants can also be used for related expenses and a portion of fines collected for driving under the influence of alcohol is returned to communities for comprehensive prevention programs. Up to 15% of the funds are set aside for grants to states with the highest rates of impaired driving-related fatalities. The grant program aims to reduce alcohol-impaired driving by implementing various strategies. Grants can be used for specified programs and related expenses. A set-aside of up to 15% of the funds is allocated for grants to states with the highest rates of impaired driving-related fatalities. The program has a total authorization of $555 million. Other new programs in the act include a motorcyclist safety grant program and an incentive grant program for child restraints. The DOT is directed to establish standards to reduce vehicle rollover crashes, increase roof strength, and enhance passenger motor vehicle occupant protection in side impact crashes. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are used to improve performance and safety in highway or transit projects by providing real-time traffic information to operators. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) provide real-time traffic information to improve safety and traffic management. Federal investment in ITS during TEA-21 was around $230 million annually, with $100 million for research and $120 million for deployment. SAFETEA allocates $110 million yearly for ITS research. The ITS deployment program ended in FY2005, with ITS project costs now eligible in core highway programs. The focus is on advancing technologies, improving standards, and testing new ITS capabilities. The SAFETEA Act provides $110 million annually for ITS research, terminating the ITS deployment program after FY2005. It focuses on advancing technologies, improving standards, and testing new capabilities to address challenges in surface transportation systems such as congestion, security, and infrastructure rehabilitation. The federal role in research and technology deployment aims to reduce various performance and operational issues. The federal role in research and technology deployment in transportation systems aims to address challenges such as congestion, security, and infrastructure rehabilitation. The FHWA, FTA, NHTSA, and RITA oversee efforts to advance safer technologies and processes. The FHWA administers a comprehensive RD and TD program focusing on all aspects of the highway system, with a budget of approximately $295 million authorized by Title V of SAFETEA. The FHWA administers a comprehensive RD and TD program with a budget of approximately $295 million authorized by Title V of SAFETEA. This includes funds for transportation research, development, and deployment, training and education, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and University Transportation Research Program. The Transportation Research Program under SAFETEA authorizes funds for research, development, and testing in transit, motor carrier activities, and other technological objectives. Research funds focus on advancing technologies for highway pavements, structures, roadway safety, and policies. FHWA's RD and TD funds are crucial for states to maximize federal aid funds. Title IX of SAFETEA addresses issues in freight rail transportation such as infrastructure capacity, rail competition, and grade crossing conflicts. Title IX of SAFETEA, \"Rail Transportation,\" focuses on infrastructure capacity, rail-to-rail competition, and grade crossing conflicts in freight rail transportation. Congress is considering assisting freight railroads in expanding their infrastructure to handle increasing trade volumes and alleviate highway congestion. Another issue is the impact of more frequent freight train traffic on towns and city neighborhoods, leading to delays for motor vehicle traffic at grade crossings. The federal government is considering assisting railroads in expanding their networks to handle increasing trade volumes. There are concerns about the impact of more frequent freight train traffic on towns and city neighborhoods, leading to delays for motor vehicle traffic at grade crossings. Congressional issues include the captive shipper question, with some Members concerned about high rail rates and poor service for shippers served by only one railroad. These issues have been debated in stand-alone legislation introduced in the 109th Congress and are reflected in SAFETEA.

These issues have been debated in stand-alone legislation introduced in the 109th Congress and are reflected in SAFETEA, which includes funding mechanisms to address these concerns. SAFETEA includes funding mechanisms to address concerns about high rail rates and poor service for shippers. The RRIF Program expands to $35 billion in total value of available loans, with $7 billion reserved for smaller railroads. Loan availability is expedited, and the Secretary of Transportation is required to approve or disapprove a loan within 90 days. The RRIF Program under SAFETEA provides loans without requiring collateral or previous loan applications. Loans can be issued for constructing rail connections between facilities and rail carriers. SAFETEA also prioritizes enhancing rail infrastructure capacity and alleviating bottlenecks. SAFETEA prioritizes enhancing rail infrastructure capacity and alleviating bottlenecks. It also creates a federal grants program for relocating or grade separating rail tracks that interfere with a community's traffic flow, quality of life, or economic development. The program authorizes $350 million annually from 2006 to 2009, with grants not exceeding $20 million each and a federal share of up to 90% of project costs. Additionally, SAFETEA funds projects like improving a rail line connecting Virginia seaports and Ohio, and planning a freight rail tunnel under New York. SAFETEA provides funding for various rail projects of national and regional significance, including improving rail connections in Virginia, Ohio, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, El Paso, and Portsmouth. It also mandates a comprehensive study of the nation's rail transportation system since deregulation in 1980. SAFETEA mandates a comprehensive study of the nation's rail transportation system since deregulation in 1980, including service levels, quality, rates, and projected demand for freight rail service. It also establishes a Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Grant Program with $6 million in grants for improving freight mobility around U.S. ports and intermodal facilities. Six projects in Oregon, Georgia, California, Alaska, and North Carolina are designated to carry out the program. The SAFETEA program designates six projects in various states to improve freight mobility around U.S. ports and intermodal facilities. It also continues the Recreational Trails Program to help states develop and maintain recreational trails for various trail uses. The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) provides funds for off-road vehicle use, with a total of $370 million authorized for FY2005-2009. Funds are allocated to states based on a legislative formula, with 30% required for motorized trail uses. Under SAFETEA, the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) funding is divided 50% equally among states and 50% based on off-road recreational fuel use. States must allocate 30% for motorized trails, 30% for non-motorized trails, and 40% for diverse trail uses. SAFETEA eliminates waivers for the 30% provision but keeps the small state exemption. The federal share for RTP projects now follows a sliding scale share model. SAFETEA amends the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) funding by changing the federal share for projects to a sliding scale model. It also expands the permissible uses of RTP funding, including trail safety and maintenance assessments. States are encouraged, but not required, to use youth conservation or service corps for trail construction and maintenance. SAFETEA expands RTP funding uses and allows pre-approval planning costs to count towards project funding. DOT must comply with NEPA for environmental review before highway or transit projects can proceed. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts of proposed actions. DOT must prepare an EIS for federally funded projects that significantly affect the environment. Projects with unclear impacts require an EA, and if impacts are significant, an EIS is needed. Projects with no significant impact are processed as categorical exclusions. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is generally carried out within the NEPA process. Section 4(f) requirements apply to the use of publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites for transportation projects. The law prohibits using these resources unless there is no feasible alternative. The law prohibits the use of parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites for transportation projects unless there is no feasible alternative. Environmental streamlining provisions aim to deliver transportation projects efficiently while protecting the environment. The FHWA defines environmental streamlining as timely delivery of federally funded transportation projects while protecting the environment. Improved interagency cooperation is crucial for success. TEA-21 mandated a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impact. This process encourages early participation by relevant federal and state agencies. SAFETEA includes provisions to further streamline the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects, focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. This legislation aims to expedite compliance with environmental regulations. SAFETEA aims to expedite compliance with environmental regulations for highway construction and transit projects by streamlining the NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. Key provisions in SAFETEA include designating DOT as the lead agency, specifying roles of agencies, and setting deadlines for decision-making. SAFETEA aims to expedite compliance with environmental regulations for transportation projects by streamlining NEPA requirements. Key provisions include establishing a new \"participating agency\" in the NEPA process, setting deadlines for collaborative development of project statements, and implementing a 180-day statute of limitations on judicial claims. SAFETEA includes provisions such as deadlines for comments, a 180-day statute of limitations on judicial claims, using transportation funds to expedite environmental reviews, a dispute resolution process for disagreements, state determination of project categories, and state pilot programs for federal compliance with environmental laws. Section 4(f) allows for the use of certain public areas if impacts are minimal. SAFETEA allows for the use of publicly owned parks, recreation areas, wildlife refuges, and historic sites with minimal impacts, requiring concurrence from relevant authorities. DOT must issue regulations clarifying factors for determining prudent and feasible alternatives under Section 4(f) requirements. The Historic Preservation Act requires DOT to issue regulations clarifying factors for determining prudent and feasible alternatives under Section 4(f) requirements. The Interstate System cannot be considered a \"historic site\" under Section 4(f) provisions, but individual elements may still be protected. ISTEA directed the Secretary of DOT to establish a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) directed the Secretary of DOT to establish and implement a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program to reduce emissions from highway travel and assist states in complying with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The CMAQ program authorized funding for projects to reduce carbon monoxide and ozone, including transportation control measures, auto emission control programs, alternative fuel vehicles, traffic flow improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. The CMAQ program, established by ISTEA, allocates funds for projects to reduce emissions and help states meet NAAQS. Funding is based on population and pollution needs, with a minimum guarantee for states without nonattainment areas. TEA-21 expanded the program to include projects targeting particulate matter, but did not change the funding formula based on ozone and CO levels. TEA-21 expanded the CMAQ program to include projects targeting particulate matter, while maintaining the funding formula based on ozone and CO levels. States with maintenance or nonattainment areas for only PM receive guaranteed minimum CMAQ funding. SAFETEA amends the CMAQ apportionment formula and program requirements, allowing projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems and transportation system improvements to be eligible for CMAQ funds. Total CMAQ funding for FY2005-FY2009 is $8.6 billion, compared to $8.1 billion under TEA-21. SAFETEA expands CMAQ funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation system improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. It also changes requirements for states receiving minimum apportionment and directs DOT to evaluate CMAQ projects' impacts on air quality and congestion levels. The DOT, in consultation with EPA, will evaluate a sample of CMAQ projects to assess their impact on air quality and congestion levels. A database will be maintained to describe project impacts, with no direct funding provided for the evaluation or database. Areas not meeting air quality standards must develop State Implementation Plans under the Clean Air Act. As of May 2005, 124 areas with a population of 159 million people must develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to reach air quality standards. The Clean Air Act prohibits federal funding for projects in these areas unless they conform to SIPs, ensuring they do not worsen air quality or delay attainment of standards. Transportation Improvement Programs (TIP) must demonstrate conformity every two years to ensure highway and transit projects do not increase emissions. The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) must demonstrate conformity every two years to receive federal funds for highway and transit projects. Conformity requirements are expected to become more challenging due to increased emissions from SUVs and light trucks, higher vehicle miles traveled, stricter air quality standards, and recent court decisions tightening conformity rules. The implementation of more stringent air quality standards will lead to additional areas being subject to conformity, potentially causing temporary suspension of highway and transit funds for numerous metropolitan areas unless emissions are reduced. A 2003 survey by the Government Accountability Office found that while only 5 metropolitan areas had to change transportation plans in the past six years to resolve conformity lapses, about one-third of local transportation planners expected difficulties in demonstrating conformity in the future. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers of conformity, with only a one-year grace period for nonattainment areas. Limited exempt projects can be funded in lapsed areas, but new projects that could reduce emissions are not allowed. Concerns include a mismatch between planning cycles and calls for less frequent but better coordinated conformity demonstrations. In 2003, the GAO recommended extending the time frame between required transportation plan updates and amending the Clean Air Act to change conformity rules. P.L. 109-59 now requires conformity demonstrations every four years instead of every two years, shortening the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. This change was supported by transportation planners and opposed by environmental groups and air quality planning officials. P.L. 109-59 requires less frequent conformity demonstrations every four years instead of every two years, shortening the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. The law also establishes a 12-month grace period following a failure to demonstrate conformity before a lapse would be declared. The local air pollution control agency must be consulted and public comments solicited if the planning horizon is to be shortened."
