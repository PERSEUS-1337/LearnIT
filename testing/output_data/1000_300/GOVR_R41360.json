    "content": "One of the most controversial issues in U.S. foreign assistance is restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. The debate revolves around whether recipients of U.S. aid perform abortions or engage in coercive practices with U.S. funds, and the impact of withholding funds on population growth and reproductive health services in developing countries. Members of Congress have debated these issues in connection with U.S. abortion policy since the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade. The debate over restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad has been ongoing since the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade. Members of Congress have introduced legislation to prohibit abortion in the United States and have sought to attach provisions to annual appropriations measures banning the use of federal funds for abortions. The controversy has expanded to include U.S. foreign assistance, leading to the enactment of restrictions on abortion and voluntary family planning services. The controversy over abortion expanded to U.S. foreign assistance after Roe v. Wade. President Reagan implemented the \"Mexico City policy\" in 1984, requiring foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they would not promote abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reinstated by different Administrations, most recently by President Barack Obama. The Mexico City policy, also known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" prohibits foreign NGOs from promoting abortion with U.S. funds. It was rescinded by President Obama in 2009 and reinstated by President Trump in 2017. The debate on abortion and family planning activities abroad continues in Congress, with some seeking to make the policy permanent law. Some legislation aims to make the Mexico City policy or its reversal permanent law. Federal funding for abortion and family planning in foreign assistance remains controversial, with ongoing congressional interest. This report examines key policies restricting U.S. funding for abortion and family planning abroad, including when and how they were introduced and their impact on different types of foreign aid. Legislation attached to U.S. funding of abortion and voluntary family planning programs abroad, known by lawmakers' names or subjects addressed, affects various types of foreign assistance. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) is the cornerstone of permanent foreign aid authorization law, divided into parts authorizing different assistance types. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) authorizes different types of foreign assistance, including development, military, and security assistance. Congress has amended the FAA since 1961 but has not comprehensively reauthorized most programs since 1985. Authorization bills have often stalled due to debates on controversial issues or foreign policy disputes. Congress annually considers appropriations measures to set spending levels for foreign aid. In the absence of regular foreign aid authorizations, Congress annually considers appropriations measures that set spending levels for various foreign assistance accounts, including family planning and abortion-related restrictions. The links among these requirements and restrictions are complex, with some provisions added for emphasis in different legislation. The Helms and Biden provisions, along with other amendments, are added to foreign assistance legislation for emphasis or to cover additional aid categories. Some restrictions stand alone, while others clarify existing ones. For example, the Leahy amendment defines \"motivate\" in the Helms amendment, and the Livingston amendment clarifies prohibitions in the DeConcini amendment. Legislative restrictions on U.S. funding of abortion and requirements for family planning programs abroad are listed chronologically by year enacted. The Helms amendment prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to motivate. The Helms amendment, enacted in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to coerce individuals to practice abortions. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. The Helms amendment, enacted in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to coerce individuals to practice abortions. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA, including development assistance. The amendment is also included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, applying to foreign assistance activities in both Title VII and Title III. The 1978 amendment to the FAA prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for involuntary sterilizations or coercion of sterilizations. This provision is also included in annual foreign operations appropriations, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes a provision prohibiting the use of funds for abortions in foreign assistance activities, with exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or coercion. This restriction has been a part of annual foreign operations appropriations since FY1979, specifically targeting Peace Corps funding to prevent money from being used for abortions. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes provisions allowing exceptions for funding abortions in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. Peace Corps volunteers can receive medical evacuation for abortions, and foreign assistance cannot be used for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization. The Biden amendment prohibits the use of funds for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization in foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. It was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes the Siljander amendment, which prohibits the use of funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. This amendment has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations acts since 1981. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds for lobbying on abortion. In 1985, Congress enacted a provision to fund family planning projects offering a range of services to counter a Reagan Administration policy. Senator Dennis DeConcini introduced an amendment to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations. Senator Dennis DeConcini introduced an amendment in 1985 to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations by funding family planning projects that offer a broad range of services. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since 1985, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. It applies to family planning assistance funded through all accounts under that act. The Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds for any country or organization if the President certifies that it violates the Helms, Biden, or involuntary sterilization amendments. This provision is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits funds from being used for organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It is part of the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized under part I of the FAA. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits funds for organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized under part I of the FAA and has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since FY1985. The provision is currently part of the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, requiring any determination regarding UNFPA to be made within 6 months of the Act's enactment, accompanied by evidence and criteria used for the decision. The United States has not funded UNFPA in 16 of the past 34 years due to concerns about its program in China violating the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Obama Administration supported funding for UNFPA, emphasizing its commitment to international family planning and women's health. Currently, the U.S. is not providing funding to UNFPA under Kemp-Kasten, following a determination by the Trump Administration in March 2017. The Trump Administration's decision highlighted the President's commitment to international family planning, women's health, and global development. Currently, the U.S. is not funding UNFPA under Kemp-Kasten due to concerns about its program in China. Congress has enacted conditions for U.S. funding of UNFPA, with recent legislation transferring funds to the Global Health Programs account for family planning and reproductive health activities. The Act requires that funds not available for UNFPA due to any law provision be transferred to the Global Health Programs account for family planning and reproductive health activities. UNFPA cannot use funds for a program in China, U.S. contributions must be kept separate, and UNFPA cannot fund abortions. The Secretary of State must report on fund withholding and budgeting for China programs. After the enactment of the act, the Secretary must report funds budgeted for UNFPA's program in China. If funds are allocated, they will be deducted from UNFPA's budget for the fiscal year. In 1986, an amendment was introduced to prevent discrimination based on religious beliefs in awarding grants for natural family planning under the Foreign Assistance Act. The Livingston amendment prohibits discrimination against organizations supporting natural family planning methods when awarding family planning grants, as long as they comply with the DeConcini amendment. The Livingston amendment prohibits discrimination against organizations supporting natural family planning methods when awarding family planning grants, as long as they comply with the DeConcini amendment. The Leahy amendment clarifies language in the Helms amendment regarding the use of funds for abortions as a method of family planning. The Leahy provision addresses concerns about violating the Helms amendment by allowing information and counseling on all pregnancy options without promoting or coercing abortions. It has been included in foreign operations appropriations since FY2018. The Tiahrt amendment, included in foreign operations appropriations since FY1999, directs voluntary family planning projects to comply with specific requirements to receive funding. The Tiahrt amendment, included in foreign operations appropriations since FY1999, requires voluntary family planning projects to meet specific criteria to receive funding, including restrictions on quotas and incentives for family planning acceptors.

Family planning acceptors must be provided with comprehensive information on health benefits and risks of chosen methods. The project for voluntary family planning must adhere to specific criteria to receive funding, including restrictions on incentives, quotas, and denial of benefits based on individual decisions. Family planning acceptors must be provided with comprehensive information on health benefits and risks of chosen methods, including conditions that might render the method inadvisable and adverse side effects. Experimental contraceptive drugs and devices can only be provided in scientific studies with participants informed of potential risks and benefits. A report must be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations if violations occur. In response to reports of forced sterilizations in Peru, Representative Tiahrt introduced an amendment to ensure that U.S. foreign assistance did not support such practices. USAID issued guidance on implementing the Tiahrt requirements for voluntary family planning projects in April 1999. The Tiahrt amendment aimed to prevent U.S. foreign assistance from supporting forced sterilizations. USAID provided guidance on implementing the requirements for family planning projects. Violations were reported in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines. An audit in 2007 found no further violations. The Tiahrt amendment was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Tiahrt amendment, included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, addresses family planning assistance and foreign NGOs involved in voluntary abortion activities. The Mexico City policy and USAID Policy Determination 3 on voluntary sterilization are executive branch policies related to abortion and family planning. The Mexico City policy restricts U.S. family planning assistance to NGOs engaged in abortion activities, while USAID PD-3 addresses voluntary sterilization. These policies have been implemented and reversed through executive branch actions. The Mexico City policy, implemented by the executive branch, restricts U.S. funds for NGOs involved in abortion activities. Republicans support the policy, while Democrats oppose it. Recently expanded by the Trump Administration, it remains a controversial issue in U.S. foreign assistance since its inception in 1984. The Mexico City policy, implemented by the executive branch in 1984, restricts U.S. funds for NGOs involved in abortion activities. Under this policy, U.S. funds cannot be used for abortions as a method of family planning or involuntary sterilizations.

Foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance must certify in writing that they do not perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning. President George H. W. Bush maintained the policy, President Clinton rescinded it in 1993, and President George W. Bush reinstated and expanded it in 2001 and 2003. Exceptions were made for cases of rape, incest, threats to the mother's life, and postabortion care. Additional exceptions were announced for funding provided through PEPFAR and intergovernmental organizations. President Obama revoked President Bush's policy in January 2009, citing overly broad conditions on grants and assistance awards that hindered efforts to promote safe family planning programs abroad. In January 2017, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy, expanding it to include global health assistance. In January 2001, President W. Bush reestablished the Mexico City policy and expanded it to include global health assistance. The expanded policy, named \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" by the Trump Administration, aims to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. This policy applies to about $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs. The Mexico City policy, expanded by President W. Bush in 2001 and renamed \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" by the Trump Administration, aims to prevent U.S. taxpayer dollars from funding organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. This policy applies to $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs, excluding assistance to governments and humanitarian activities. Exemptions include rape, incest, conditions threatening the mother's life, and postabortion care. The Trump Administration's \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy aims to prevent U.S. taxpayer dollars from funding organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. A six-month review in May 2018 highlighted challenges and the need to improve understanding, compliance, and oversight of the policy. The Trump Administration's \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy aims to prevent funding for organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. A review identified challenges in understanding, compliance, and oversight, with some recipients and subrecipients refusing to agree to the terms. USAID issued Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization in 1982 to ensure protection of individuals' needs and rights during such procedures. The USAID's Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) from 1982 outlines requirements for voluntary sterilization services funded by the U.S. government, including informed consent, ready access to other family planning methods, and no incentive payments. The USAID's Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) from 1982 outlines requirements for voluntary sterilization services funded by the U.S. government, including informed consent, ready access to other family planning methods, and no incentive payments. VS acceptors may receive recompense for legitimate extra expenses related to VS, but no financial incentives should be created for sterilization over other methods. Incentives for voluntary sterilization services must be reasonable and based on country- and program-specific circumstances. VS acceptors may receive compensation for extra expenses, VS service providers may receive per-case payment, and VS service referral agents may receive payment for informing or referring clients. PD-3 applies to family planning assistance funded by USAID and includes U.S. NGOs, foreign NGOs, public international organizations, and governments."
