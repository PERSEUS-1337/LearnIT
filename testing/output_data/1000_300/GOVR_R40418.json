    "content": "The federal government responded to the 9/11 and anthrax attacks by increasing funding for biodefense, focusing on addressing capacity shortages in diagnostic, clinical, and research laboratories. Various government departments have expanded their high-containment laboratory capacity to study dangerous pathogens, playing a crucial role in biodefense efforts. These facilities offer the potential for improved responses to biological attacks and a better understanding of the bioterrorism threat. High-containment laboratories are crucial in biodefense efforts, offering better responses to biological attacks. Federal funding has increased for research on countermeasures and diagnostics for dangerous pathogens. Funding has risen significantly from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008, supporting academic and industrial researchers. Concerns exist about aging laboratory infrastructure and limited research capacity. The increase in federal funding for high-containment laboratories from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008 has raised concerns about aging infrastructure and limited capacity. This influx of funds has led to the expansion of non-federal high-containment laboratories, driven by the threats of bioterrorism and emerging diseases. The proliferation of these laboratories internationally has sparked new policy questions regarding optimal capacity, federal investment, and consolidation versus dispersion. The increase in federal funding for high-containment laboratories has raised new policy questions regarding optimal capacity, federal investment, consolidation, and coordination of efforts. Policymakers are concerned about the risks and benefits of expanding laboratory capacity, especially in light of accidents, regulatory noncompliance, and community resistance. The federal government is interested in expanding high-containment laboratories due to reports of accidents, regulatory noncompliance, and community resistance. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommended tighter oversight. This report focuses on federal regulation of these laboratories, explaining biosecurity and biosafety concepts, oversight mechanisms, proliferation issues, and policy options for Congress to consider. Biosecurity and biosafety are closely related, with definitions varying and sometimes overlapping. Biosecurity and biosafety are closely related concepts in high-containment laboratories. Biosecurity involves securing pathogens from theft or unauthorized use, while biosafety focuses on preventing unintentional infections. The Select Agent Program is the major federal regulatory program addressing biosecurity. The Select Agent Program was established by the federal government to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. It was created in response to the threat of bioterrorism, particularly highlighted by the 2001 anthrax mailings. The Select Agent Program was established to regulate possession of pathogens and toxins with potential for malevolent use, following the 2001 anthrax mailings. Legislation like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act increased restrictions on select agents, requiring entities to develop security and biosafety plans certified by the federal government. Scientists must register to access select agents. The regulation of select agents focuses on controlling access to these agents by individuals and facilities. Scientists must register with the federal government to handle select agents, undergo background checks, and obtain nontransferable permits valid for five years. Facilities using select agents must develop security plans to prevent theft or unauthorized access, which are reviewed and audited by regulatory agencies like the CDC and USDA. Inspections are conducted to ensure compliance with security plans. The regulation of select agents involves registration, background checks, and permits for individuals and facilities. Regulatory agencies like the CDC and USDA review security plans and conduct inspections to ensure compliance. Violations can result in fines and legal consequences. About 390 entities are certified to work with select agents, with 15,300 staff approved for access. The Select Agent Program regulates work with dangerous pathogens, with 390 certified entities and 15,300 staff approved for access. State and local governments own the largest group of certified entities, including public health laboratories. The Laboratory Response Network was established to enhance testing and response capabilities in the event of a biological attack. Tensions have arisen in academia due to the increased number of academic entities and researchers involved in the Select Agent Program. The Select Agent Program regulates work with dangerous pathogens, with tensions rising in academia over the regulations. Approximately 200 entities either transferred or destroyed their select agent inventories rather than registering. Investigations by agency Inspectors General have focused on internal controls, processing applications, and regulatory compliance. The HHS and USDA Inspectors General found universities and laboratories were not fully compliant with select agent regulations. Three entities withdrew their select agent licenses. CDC suspended a certificate at Texas A&M University for failure to report exposures and lack of security risk assessments for lab workers. In 2007, the CDC suspended a select agent entity certificate at Texas A&M University for failure to report occupational exposures and allowing access to select agents without security risk assessments. Various organizations have been cited and fined for violations of select agent regulations, with fines totaling $1,887,000. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens acknowledge the risks involved and have developed best practices to mitigate them, with formal guidelines issued by the U.S. government in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. government issued formal guidelines to mitigate the risks of releasing pathogens. The guidelines, disseminated by HHS in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), establish four main levels of biosafety (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for safe handling of biological agents. Each level has specific protections, with higher levels recommended for more dangerous pathogens. Each higher biosafety level includes the protective measures of the lower levels, along with additional measures. The BMBL guidelines define four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for handling biological agents based on the pathogen's risk to human health. Higher levels include measures from lower levels with added protections. BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs are considered high-containment. Guidelines aim to protect lab workers from specific pathogen risks and help determine the appropriate biosafety level for procedures. The BMBL guidelines define four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for handling biological agents based on the pathogen's risk to human health. Biosafety levels are linked to a combination of pathogen and experiment, with primary and secondary barriers to infection. Researchers and lab workers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing the lab. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its transmission potential, treatment, and research. The BMBL guidelines establish four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for handling biological agents based on the pathogen's risk to human health. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its potential for transmission, and the research procedure being conducted. Procedures are categorized from BSL-1 to BSL-4 based on the severity of potential diseases and the risk of laboratory infections. Procedures with high individual risk of aerosol-transmitted infections should be conducted at BSL-4. Pathogens can be handled at lower biosafety levels for certain activities. Some select agent pathogens can be handled outside high-containment facilities, following BMBL guidelines. For example, anthrax can be handled at BSL-2 for certain activities and at BSL-3 for others. BSL-2 is used for activities with clinical materials and diagnostic quantities of infectious cultures, while BSL-3 is for work involving production quantities or high concentrations of cultures. Some select agents require BSL-4 containment. BSL-4 facilities in the US work with select agents, while BSL-3 facilities may not. Only some work in BSL-3 facilities uses select agents. Some BSL-2 facilities fall under the Select Agent Program. Some BSL-3 facilities work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is typically voluntary but widely adopted as facility policy. Noncompliance with guidelines can lead to loss of federal funding. Some federal agencies require compliance with BMBL guidelines in their laboratories. Health and safety officials in various laboratories ensure the proper operation of protective equipment. The guidelines are also considered in biosafety plans for facilities under the Select Agent Program and incorporated into building design standards and federal requirements for DNA research. Federal facilities, including those built with federal funds, adhere to design standards established by the agency funding construction. These standards, often based on BMBL guidelines, cover ventilation, utilities, and access controls. NIH issues checklists for high-containment labs to ensure compliance before occupancy, a process known as certifying or commissioning. The NIH issues checklists for high-containment laboratories to ensure compliance before occupancy, a process known as certifying or commissioning. Other agencies also have similar processes in place, contracting out the commissioning of laboratories at specific biosafety levels. The NIH Model Commissioning Guide recommends using specialized individuals for this process, separate from those involved in the facility's design or construction. The NIH recommends commissioning or certifying high-containment laboratories through specialized individuals not involved in design or construction. These individuals should be licensed Professional Engineers with extensive experience in facility systems. Non-compliance with biosafety guidelines could result in the withdrawal of federal funding. The federal government requires laboratories to adhere to biosafety guidelines set forth in the BMBL to receive and maintain federal funding. Non-compliance could result in funding withdrawal. Grant recipients must demonstrate compliance with health and safety standards. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research require the creation of an institutional biosafety committee (IBC) to oversee compliance with federal guidelines. The IBC determines biosafety levels for research activities and can mandate specific precautions. Some suggest expanding the IBC's oversight to other research with biosafety concerns. The BMBL recommends IBCs help scientists determine protection levels for experiments, but some experts argue the mechanism is insufficient. The BMBL recommends that IBCs oversee research with biosafety concerns and determine protection levels for experiments. Some experts argue that the IBC mechanism lacks sufficient oversight. The Select Agent Program regulations require compliance with BMBL guidelines for entities possessing select agents. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories is believed to have increased in recent years. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in the United States has increased significantly in recent years, with a twelve-fold increase in BSL-4 space since 2004. This expansion is due to federal construction, increased funding for research requiring high-containment labs, and a focus on public health. The federal government is investing in the construction of high-containment labs across various departments. The federal government is investing in the construction of high-containment laboratories across different departments, creating both government and private infrastructure. The Department of Defense has maintained high-containment labs for many years, conducting offensive and defensive research activities. The Department of Defense has modernized its high-containment laboratories, focusing on defensive research activities since President Nixon discontinued the offensive biological weapons program in 1969. The USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is the only DOD location with BSL-4 laboratory space, with other sites having BSL-3 space. The DOD is expanding its facilities at USAMRIID with a $683 million investment to increase BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory space. The DOD is expanding its facilities at USAMRIID with a $683 million investment to increase BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory space. Other DOD laboratories have also increased their BSL-3 capacity since 2001 for research on infectious diseases and bioforensic analysis. President Bush assigned bioforensic responsibility to the Department of Homeland Security in 2004. The federal government assigned bioforensic responsibility to the Department of Homeland Security in 2004, leading to the establishment of the National Bioforensics Analysis Center at USAMRIID. Permanent facilities, including BSL-4 and BSL-3 laboratories, are under construction in Frederick, MD, expected to be fully operational by 2010. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS, which is now establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Kansas to replace it. The NBAF will be a BSL-4 laboratory focused on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the decision to establish the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Kansas, which will take over research projects at PIADC and expand research capabilities for animal pathogens. The NBAF will be a BSL-4 laboratory and part of the DHS's efforts to enhance biocontainment capabilities. Additionally, the DHS has invested in constructing BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) to support biodefense research and public health efforts during emergencies. The National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) are being built in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX, respectively, to support biodefense research and public health efforts during emergencies. The HHS has also established the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) to coordinate a network of laboratories for responding to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. The LRN is an integrated network of laboratories for responding to bioterrorism and public health emergencies, including federal and state facilities, medical institutions, and others with BSL-3 capabilities. The USDA is building new BSL-3 laboratories in Ames, IA, and Fort Collins, CO, while academic institutions are investing in high-containment facilities. Academic institutions and private sector companies are investing in high-containment laboratory facilities for biodefense research, product evaluation, and medical testing purposes. Universities like the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University are constructing additional BSL-3 laboratory space to enhance their research capabilities and compete for federal funding. Pharmaceutical companies also maintain high-containment facilities for animal efficacy studies and product development. Pharmaceutical companies and other organizations use high-containment laboratories for medical testing, product development, and animal studies. Some companies have in-house facilities, while others contract with firms like Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and Battelle Memorial Institute. The expansion of these labs raises concerns about capacity, oversight, and balancing increased risk with the need for additional capacity. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers recognized the need for additional high-containment laboratory space to meet national needs. Congress and the administration decided to construct more facilities, with the understanding that federal support was necessary due to high capital and maintenance costs. It is crucial to avoid over-building capacity and fully utilize existing resources to balance the desire for increased laboratory capacity with its associated risks. Decisions to build and support high-containment laboratories were made across multiple agencies and budget cycles. The decision to build and support high-containment laboratories was made across multiple agencies and budget cycles without a national needs assessment or coordinated expansion plan. Concerns have been raised that the new laboratory capacity may exceed national needs or safety limits due to a lack of information on existing capacity. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 domestic BSL-3 laboratories, but the survey had methodological shortcomings. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 domestic BSL-3 laboratories, but its survey had methodological shortcomings. DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, drawing criticism from experts. Nongovernmental estimates show significant increases in high-containment laboratory capability. Entities registered to work with select agents may or may not use high-containment laboratories, with nongovernmental estimates showing a significant increase in capability. The Government Accountability Office noted an increase in BSL-3 laboratories but could not determine the exact number. There is a need for a government-wide assessment to determine if ongoing construction surpasses national needs, with questions raised about capacity utilization and the need for increased funding. The construction of high-containment facilities raises questions about capacity utilization and the need for increased funding. Agencies may struggle with justifying larger research budgets to cover operations and maintenance costs for expanded facilities. Interagency federal planning efforts could help manage overcapacity costs but would require agreement on prioritization and shared use. Individual agencies may request larger research budgets to cover operations and maintenance costs for expanded facilities. Interagency federal planning efforts could help manage overcapacity costs but would require agreement on prioritization and shared use of agency facilities. Coordination of high-containment laboratory use may need to be addressed at a multi-agency level. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Events like laboratory infections and improper shipping of select agents have led to a reexamination of oversight frameworks. Consensus on the best approaches to overseeing these laboratories has not been reached. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Improper shipping of select agents and inadequate biosafety levels have led to a reexamination of oversight frameworks. There is no consensus on the best approaches to overseeing these laboratories, with some experts suggesting mandatory biosafety training and others advocating for enhanced self-regulatory approaches. Increased high-containment laboratory capacity presents both opportunities and challenges. Increased high-containment laboratory capacity allows for greater diversity of biodefense research and more efficient public health sample testing. However, it also raises concerns about theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens. Legislation has been passed to enhance physical security of stored pathogens, and more facilities have registered to possess select agents. The Select Agent Program aims to improve physical security in high-containment facilities storing pathogens. Investigations have revealed security weaknesses, and regulatory focus on compliance could reduce risks. Despite planning, accidents can occur, overwhelming safety controls. Each high-containment facility carries inherent risks. The GAO has testified that high-containment facilities have inherent risks that can be increased with the construction of additional facilities. The incremental risk is difficult to measure and may vary depending on compliance with best practices and regulations. Factors contributing to the risk include accidental releases, subsequent illness, and the total number of laboratories. Policymakers may need to rely on estimates for a cost/benefit analysis of research benefits versus costs of infectious releases. Policymakers may need to perform a cost/benefit analysis for high-containment laboratories, considering potential benefits like biodefense breakthroughs and costs like infectious releases. Federal policymakers may overlook subtle effects like national sampling laboratory networks, leading to policy driven by high-profile incidents rather than actual risk assessment. The proliferation of high-containment laboratory techniques may be overlooked by federal policymakers, leading to policy driven by high-profile incidents rather than actual risk assessment. Concerns include personnel surety and the potential for malicious intent among trained technicians and scientists. The increase in high-containment capacity could have international ramifications. The DOJ believes the 2001 anthrax mailings were done by a government scientist skilled in high-containment techniques. The increase in high-containment capacity may be seen as excessive by other countries, potentially leading to suspicions of offensive biological weapons development by the United States. This perception could harm U.S. efforts to promote adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention and may result in other countries building similar facilities. International proliferation of high-containment laboratories could increase the risk of misuse of high-containment techniques and information. The increase in high-containment capacity in the U.S. may lead to international proliferation of similar facilities, potentially affecting biosafety regulations and the location of pharmaceutical companies. This could impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. The location of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies could affect national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. Countries relying on foreign production of treatments may face restricted access during international crises. Differences in biosecurity regulations between countries may hinder international collaborations among scientists, potentially impacting industry investments in research. Scientists believe that international collaborations are crucial for the scientific process, but perceived barriers may lead to industry investing in countries with lower barriers. The impact of biosecurity regulations on international collaboration remains unclear, with the presence of U.S. standards potentially influencing other countries to adopt similar policies. Local resistance to high-containment laboratories in the U.S. varies, with some groups supporting them for economic benefits and mission importance. Local resistance to building high-containment laboratories in the United States varies, with some groups supporting them for economic benefits and mission importance, while others oppose them due to public health and quality of life concerns. Policymakers have options to consider, including deeming current efforts sufficient and not requiring further action. The high-paying jobs will be available to the existing local workforce rather than individuals recruited from elsewhere. Policymakers have options to consider, such as stepping up oversight of facilities, pathogens, or personnel to balance security controls with research productivity. Scientists support measures to reduce the threat of terrorists acquiring deadly pathogens while also promoting scientific progress. One scientist highlighted the potential trade-offs between additional oversight and scientific progress in high-containment laboratories. Policymakers may find current oversight sufficient, as some in the scientific community support relying on existing mechanisms. Supporters of the status quo argue that focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists may provide more security than securing laboratories. Supporters of the status quo argue that focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists may provide more security than securing high-containment laboratories in the United States. Additional resources dedicated to developing intelligence on potential bioterror groups could allow for disruption of their activities at a lower cost than implementing an overarching regulatory framework. Policymakers may choose to defer action until they have a fuller understanding of policy options and their impacts. Since 2005, the Bush Administration created expert groups to examine biosafety and biosecurity issues. GAO is investigating high-containment laboratories, and Congress may wait for their recommendations before taking action. Some policymakers may require additional studies. President Bush created the Working Group on Strengthening Biosecurity. President Bush created the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States in 2009 through an Executive Order. The group consists of various government officials and is tasked with reviewing and evaluating laws, regulations, and practices related to biosafety and making recommendations to the President. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight was formed in 2007 to review existing laws and regulations related to biosafety. It aims to address gaps in oversight of high-containment laboratories and provide recommendations for improvement. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight, co-chaired by HHS and USDA, includes staff from various federal agencies. The task force aims to address gaps in oversight of high-containment laboratories and provide recommendations for improvement. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies for dual-use research and effective biosafety measures. The Board is developing policies for dual-use research, oversight, code of conduct, and biosafety training. Multiple working groups are analyzing and providing recommendations. The GAO will release a report in 2009 on high-containment laboratory issues with potential legislative and executive branch recommendations. Congress may benefit from waiting for these recommendations to avoid duplication and generate new policy ideas. The Board is developing policies for dual-use research, oversight, code of conduct, and biosafety training. The GAO will release a report in 2009 on high-containment laboratory issues with potential legislative and executive branch recommendations. Congress may benefit from waiting for these recommendations to avoid duplication and generate new policy ideas. Previous efforts to determine the number and capacity of high-containment laboratories have failed to produce a reliable inventory. Multiple sources have called for a comprehensive inventory to address this issue. Multiple sources have called for a comprehensive inventory of non-federal high-containment laboratories, located in various institutions and facilities. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be sufficient to gather information about their capacity, and concerns about industrial competitiveness and reporting burden may hinder obtaining a complete inventory. Efforts to incentivize self-reporting or mandate registration of all high-containment laboratories could provide the government with a comprehensive list of available laboratory capacity, current use, geographic distribution, and availability. This approach could address concerns about industrial competitiveness and reporting burden, potentially increasing participation and providing valuable information for policymakers. A registry of high-containment laboratories could offer the government valuable information on available capacity, current use, and geographic distribution. Registration, even without additional security measures, could be required. Limiting the survey to federal facilities could streamline reporting to Congress, aiding in efficient planning and potential expansion of federal capacity. The government could efficiently plan for the use and expansion of high-containment facilities by requiring reporting to Congress. A government-wide needs assessment could help allocate resources effectively. Congress should consider the economic costs and quality of information obtained through self-reporting or mandatory reporting frameworks. Congress may need to evaluate the economic costs and benefits of surveying high-containment laboratories under different reporting frameworks. Some policymakers suggest a moratorium on new construction to assess the need for laboratory capacity. In considering a moratorium on new laboratory construction, policymakers must weigh the benefits of building the right amount of laboratory capacity against the potential costs to research and other priorities. Without a government-wide assessment of capacity needs, constructing additional laboratories may lead to over-building or redundant operations. Incremental increases in high-containment laboratory capacity may be more beneficial than constructing large amounts of new space, suggesting expansion of existing facilities. Incremental increases in high-containment laboratory capacity may yield greater return than constructing large amounts of new laboratory space. Some agencies argue that existing infrastructure is dated and not suitable for expansion, but without a government-wide assessment, synergies or available infrastructure in other agencies may be overlooked. Enacting a construction moratorium could impact the federal government's ability to meet national goals. Enacting a construction moratorium could delay national goals like establishing a permanent bioforensics capability and expanding high-containment laboratory facilities. Some analysts suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment labs, as currently only those handling select agents are required to register with the federal government. Some analysts suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment labs, either by applying Select Agent Program requirements universally or establishing a separate program with its own regulations. Establishing a separately administered program for licensing high-containment laboratories could allow for flexibility in requirements, distinguishing between those handling select agents and those that do not. However, challenges in implementation and acceptance from the scientific community may arise. This approach may not cover all laboratories of concern, as select agents could be manipulated outside of high-containment facilities. A more comprehensive approach to oversight would involve monitoring all laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment, capturing all locations with sufficient biosecurity for select agent use. However, this would lead to overseeing a significantly larger number of facilities, including public health, diagnostic, hospital, industrial, and academic laboratories. Alternatively, focusing on the pathogens of concern rather than the facilities handling them could be another approach. Expanding the select agent list to include more dangerous pathogens like SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever could lead to more high-containment facilities being regulated under the Select Agent Program. Some experts argue that the current list does not capture all potentially dangerous pathogens that could be used as biological weapons. Some scientists are concerned about expanding the select agent list to include more pathogens as biological weapons. They argue that the current taxonomic definition may not accurately differentiate between pathogens of concern and similar ones not of concern. The NIH has requested the National Academies to identify scientific advances needed to identify select agents based on other features beyond taxonomy. Regulatory impacts would only affect entities using pathogens of concern, not all high-containment facilities. The NIH has requested scientific advances to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy. Regulatory impacts would only affect entities using pathogens of concern, not all high-containment facilities. Current Select Agent Program personnel background checks could be expanded to all personnel using BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities. The DOJ Inspector General has identified the need for background checks for personnel at high-containment facilities, which may vary in rigor depending on the level of access. Implementing enhanced personnel oversight may face challenges, such as resistance to government documentation by laboratory researchers. The implementation of enhanced personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may encounter challenges, such as resistance to government documentation by laboratory researchers. Some scientists may prefer to leave research fields requiring high-containment laboratories rather than obtain the necessary government clearance. The extent of this resistance is unclear, and ensuring effective personnel screening may be difficult. The Department of Defense has more extensive personnel oversight programs than required for access to select agents, but the DOJ has highlighted instances where even with increased oversight, security breaches occurred. The Select Agent Program mandates worker training before accessing select agents and annual retraining, tailored to individual needs. The Select Agent Program requires worker training before accessing select agents, with a focus on individual needs and risks. Experts suggest expanding biosafety training to meet current demand, potentially through mandatory federal certification. The development of training standards could ensure core competencies are met, although the effects of such training may be challenging to assess. Expanded biosafety training, whether voluntary or federally mandated, could reduce laboratory acquired infections. However, it may not address biosecurity vulnerabilities or the dual-use nature of pathogens in high-containment labs. Lessons from incidents in these labs could inform improvements in addressing specific challenges. The lack of reporting incidents in high-containment laboratories involving select agents may be due to fear of penalties, loss of reputation, or embarrassment. This hinders the sharing of information that could improve practices and prevent future events. Experts suggest enhancing the reporting system in high-containment laboratories to establish a database of accidents and corresponding remediation. This database could provide warnings to scientists to prevent future accidents, with penalties for reporting minimized to encourage reporting. Experts recommend establishing a database for reporting accidents in high-containment laboratories, with entries being either affiliated with the reporting entity or anonymous after processing. Penalties for reporting to this database should be minimized to encourage reporting. Policymakers need to balance increasing oversight with regulatory burden, as increased federal oversight may face resistance from scientists and stakeholders. The benefits of increased oversight may be challenging to quantify but could reduce opportunities for misuse. Increasing federal oversight, such as expanding the Select Agent Program, may face resistance from scientists and stakeholders. Critics argue that expanding the program could hinder public health response and international collaboration by creating barriers to the transfer of materials between laboratories. The scope of the program, with its requirements for certification, could further increase these barriers. The expansion of the Select Agent Program may create barriers to collaboration and hinder public health response. International collaboration on regulated pathogens could be impeded due to differing security regimes in foreign countries. Licensing and certification requirements may have significant impacts on regulated entities, affecting scientific productivity and increasing costs for public health laboratories and hospitals. The expansion of the Select Agent Program may hinder collaboration and public health response. Licensing requirements could impact scientific productivity and increase costs for public health facilities. Identifying the appropriate oversight agency is a key issue, with USDA and HHS being considered suitable regulators due to their technical knowledge and relationship with the scientific community. Historical concerns focused on laboratory worker safety and preventing pathogen accidental releases. USDA and HHS are considered appropriate regulators due to their technical knowledge and relationship with the scientific community. As homeland security concerns increase, policymakers may consider DHS as a more suitable agency. Oversight could be performed by the agency with existing statutory authority or new authorities could be developed. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones is crucial. Harmonizing new oversight authorities for high-containment laboratories is crucial for smooth implementation. Additional funding and staffing may be needed for agencies to meet new mandates. The 111th Congress is considering legislation on the Select Agent Program. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to extend the Select Agent Program and address issues related to high-containment laboratory capacity. Bills like H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to expand criteria for select agents, require biosafety training, and mandate improvements recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. The HHS Secretary would develop minimum biosafety and biosecurity training for access to select agents. Guidance on improving select agent monitoring and inventory procedures would be issued. The bills also require reporting on current and planned capacity, sharing of lessons learned, improving laboratory infrastructure guidance, and establishing a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories for operation and maintenance. It also requires a report detailing integration of the RBL network and the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity. Biocontainment technologies are globally dispersed and used by many scientists. The need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity to respond to biodefense or infectious disease emergencies is a global concern. International harmonization is crucial to address the threat of high-containment laboratories being used for bioterrorism. Congressional policymakers face the challenge of defining the goal of enhanced oversight for these laboratories, which can impact policy decisions. A registry of existing high-containment laboratory capacity may aid in planning and coordination but may not provide significant security benefits. When considering policy options for high-containment laboratories, policymakers must balance security benefits with regulatory burden, cost, and impact on scientific progress. Multiple national needs must be reconciled when addressing these complex policy issues."
