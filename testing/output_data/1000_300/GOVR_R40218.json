    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. States have developed independent living programs with funding from CFCIP to help youth attain self-sufficiency. Federal law also requires child welfare agencies to assist older youth in transitioning from care with written case plans. Despite these efforts, research shows that current and former foster youth face challenges compared to the general population. Research has shown that current and former foster youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood, including difficulties in higher education, poor health, homelessness, and reliance on public support. Efforts by policy makers and child welfare advocates have brought attention to these challenges, leading Congress to focus on ensuring youth have support systems in place even after reaching legal adulthood. The 110th Congress passed the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351), addressing challenges faced by youth transitioning from care and providing support beyond age 18. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) and the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) are significant laws that address child welfare, specifically focusing on older youth in foster care. These laws aim to protect older youth, promote normalcy, and respond to children at risk of sex trafficking. This report discusses issues affecting older youth transitioning from foster care into adulthood, focusing on the implementation challenges of P.L. 110-351 and P.L. 113-183. One key issue is the difficulty states may face in extending foster care to older youth due to cost concerns, despite federal assistance being available. States are required to support youth in developing independence. One challenge in implementing provisions for older youth transitioning from foster care is the cost concern for states, despite federal assistance. States must assist youth in developing a transition plan within 90 days of exiting care. Policy makers and advocates are worried about the challenges older foster youth face during the transition to adulthood, including difficulties in forming permanent connections with caring adults. Policy makers and advocates are concerned about challenges faced by older foster youth and those who have aged out during the transition to adulthood. Emancipated youth encounter obstacles in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Little is known about youth transitioning from foster care, but a new national database may provide insight into their outcomes in education, employment, and contact with social services and the criminal justice system. There is also a concern about youth in foster care being vulnerable to child sex trafficking, with policies required by P.L. 113-183 to serve these youth. Congress may need to monitor the implementation of these policies. Child welfare agencies must have policies in place to serve youth vulnerable to child sex trafficking. Congress should monitor state implementation of these requirements and identify best practices for serving victims. The report will discuss the implementation of P.L. 110-351 and ongoing issues related to transitioning youth from foster care. The number of children in foster care has decreased over the past decade. In FY2002, there were 523,000 children in foster care, compared to 397,122 in FY2012. The percentage of older children in care increased but then slightly declined. Children aged 13-17 made up 29% of the caseload in FY2002, 35% in FY2010, and 34% in FY2012. The number of older youth aging out of foster care increased from just over 20,000 in FY2002 to higher numbers in subsequent years, reaching a peak in FY2010. In FY2002, over 20,000 children aged out of foster care, making up 7% of all children who exited care that year. This number increased in subsequent years, reaching a peak of slightly over 26,000 youth in FY2010. However, the number of youth emancipating reached a low of 23,396 in FY2012. Research shows that youth who spend their teenage years in foster care tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. The Midwest Evaluation study tracks outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Surveyed youth entered care before age 16 and responded to questions in five data collection waves. Results at age 26 showed similarities with peers but more challenges for former foster youth. The most recent results of the Midwest Evaluation study, based on survey data of youth at age 26, found that former foster youth experienced more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to youth in general. Former foster youth were less likely to have attained a four-year college degree (2.5% versus 23.5%) and had lower current employment rates (48.3% versus 79.9%), with a mean annual income of about $13,000. Former foster youth have lower educational and employment outcomes compared to youth in general. They are less likely to have a four-year college degree and have lower current employment rates, with a mean annual income of about $13,000. The state child welfare agency is responsible for the care and placement of children removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect. Federal and state funds are used to help children reunite with their parents or find a permanent home. The primary federal funding source for foster care is Title IV-E, which aims to promote safety, permanency, and well-being for children in foster care. States must have a written case plan detailing the child's placement and services to establish a permanent home. The plan is reviewed every 6 months by a judge or panel and annually by a judge considering the child's permanency plan. The case plan for children in foster care must be reviewed regularly, with a review every 6 months by a judge or panel and annually by a judge considering the child's permanency plan. For youth aged 14 and older, the plan must include programs and services for a successful transition to adulthood, along with a document listing rights related to education, health, visitation, and court participation. For children in foster care aged 14 and older, the state child welfare agency must include a document in their case plan listing rights related to education, health, visitation, and court participation. The child must acknowledge receipt of this document. Additionally, the child must be consulted in the development and revisions of their case plan and permanency plan, and can choose up to two members for the planning teams. The child in foster care aged 14 and older has the right to be involved in the development of their case plan and permanency plan. They can choose up to two members for the planning teams, including an advisor and advocate for the \"reasonable and prudent parenting standard.\" States must also assist youth in creating a transition plan for housing and other needs after emancipation from foster care. Permanence for children in foster care may involve returning to their parents or finding alternative safe arrangements. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares youth aging out of foster care for independence. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act addresses concerns in the child welfare system. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, including provisions for older youth in foster care. States can now extend foster care to youth aged 18 and older, up to age 19, 20, or 21. The 113th Congress has also focused on the needs of older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking, leading to the passage of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. [missing number]). The 113th Congress passed the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, which provides protections for older youth in foster care and addresses child sex trafficking. It promotes normalcy for children in foster care and requires agencies to respond to sex trafficking of children. Federal child welfare law includes provisions for older youth in care and those aging out under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, states and Indian tribes can receive federal funds for room and board costs for eligible children in foster care. The federal government is obligated to reimburse states for eligible expenditures on behalf of children in care who meet specific criteria. Eligibility includes being a citizen or qualified alien, meeting income/assets tests, age requirements, and family structure rules. Under Title IV-E, states and tribes receive federal funds for eligible children in foster care who meet specific criteria, including citizenship, income/assets tests, age, and family structure rules. The state must provide foster care maintenance payments for eligible children in licensed settings to ensure their care. The state or tribal child welfare agency must provide a \"foster care maintenance payment\" for every Title IV-E eligible child in foster care, covering food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, insurance, visitation travel, and school-related travel. Federal reimbursement is available for children in licensed care settings. Federal reimbursement for children in foster care is available for those placed in licensed child care institutions or foster care homes. Eligible young people in extended care may be placed in independent living settings. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety, permanency, and well-being for all youth in care. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments are available until age 18 or 19 if still in school, with the option to extend payments until age 21 starting in FY2011. States can seek reimbursement for youth over 18 who are Title IV-E eligible and completing high school or a program. States and tribes can seek reimbursement for youth in foster care until age 21 if they are completing high school, enrolled in post-secondary education, participating in employment programs, or have a medical condition preventing participation. States can seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions, including those over 18. Child care institutions must be licensed and exclude detention facilities or training schools. States can seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions, including those over 18. Beginning in FY2011, states may also seek reimbursement for youth ages 18 or older who remain in foster care and are placed in a supervised independent living setting. HHS encourages states and tribes to extend federal foster care assistance to eligible youth until age 21, with the option to extend to a lower age if they provide a rationale in their Title IV-E plan. States and tribes must submit a description of the rationale for extending federal foster care assistance to youth until age 21 in their Title IV-E plan. They must establish criteria for determining eligibility based on education, employment, or medical conditions. Verification of continued eligibility is also required. Examples of eligible activities include finishing high school and preparing for general education. States and tribes must establish criteria for extending federal foster care assistance to youth until age 21 based on education, employment, or medical conditions. Eligible activities include finishing high school, preparing for the GED exam, enrolling in post-secondary education, attending Job Corps programs, and working part-time or full-time. States and tribes have the flexibility to set specific requirements for extended foster care, such as providing assistance only to those enrolled in post-secondary education. The guidance advises states and tribes to consider providing extended assistance to youth aged 18 and older in foster care, with a focus on post-secondary education. Program instructions address eligibility criteria for Title IV-E foster care, including for youth who continue in care or reenter care before age 21, and for those who enter foster care at age 18 or older. The AFDC Program Criteria for federal foster care eligibility states that youth aged 18 or older entering or reentering care must meet Title IV-E requirements without regard to their parents or legal guardians. Youth in extended care must have entered care via a court order or voluntary placement agreement. The program instructions address removal criteria for youth aged 18 or older in extended care, including court determinations or voluntary placement agreements as guardians. The program instructions address requirements for voluntary placement agreements for older youth in extended care, including judicial determination for Title IV-E payments beyond 180 days. Placement can be in supervised independent living or foster family homes. HHS does not currently have regulations on living arrangements. The program instructions allow for older youth in extended care to be placed in supervised independent living settings or licensed foster family homes. HHS does not have specific regulations on independent living arrangements, leaving it up to states and tribes to determine suitable settings. Examples of eligible settings include host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies are advised to ensure youth in supervised independent living settings form connections with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be paid directly to young people in independent living. States and tribes must apply case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care as they do for children under 18. Child welfare agencies must apply case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care, including those in independent living settings. The case plan should be developed jointly with the youth, include benchmarks for achieving independence, and involve periodic reviews every six months to ensure the youth's safety. States and tribes are also required to make efforts to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth in court-ordered placements. States and tribes must make efforts to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth in court-ordered placements, which may include preparing the young person for emancipation or independence. The court can determine the plan without a hearing if authorized. States and tribes extending care to ineligible youth are not required to fulfill certain federal foster care requirements. The guidance advises states and tribes extending care to ineligible youth that they are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements, including case planning and data collection. Nearly half of jurisdictions have amended their plans to extend the maximum age of foster care, with 18 states already approved by HHS. As of May 2014, nearly half of jurisdictions have extended foster care age limits, with 18 states approved by HHS. Most states allow care until age 21, except for Indiana and Nebraska. Nebraska recently passed legislation to extend care to 21. Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia have approved plan amendments allowing youth to remain in care under certain conditions. Nebraska enacted legislation in 2013 to extend foster care to age 21, with HHS reviewing this change. Except for Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia, jurisdictions with approved plan amendments allow youth to remain in care under specific conditions. Other states considering extending care need to evaluate outcomes, costs, and which youth are eligible. Nebraska extended foster care to age 21 in 2013, with HHS reviewing the change. States considering extending care must evaluate outcomes, costs, and eligibility criteria for youth. Research on youth who emancipate from care is limited, with the Midwest Evaluation showing slightly better outcomes for those in care past age 20. The Midwest Evaluation study found that youth who remained in foster care past age 20 had more positive outcomes, such as higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin were compared in the study, with Illinois showing that staying in care until age 21 was associated with better outcomes. The Midwest Evaluation study in Illinois showed that youth who remained in foster care until age 21 had higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after age 18 was linked to a $470 increase in annual earnings, with a total increase of $924 for those who stayed longer. Additionally, youth in care were 38% less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19. Youth in Illinois who remained in foster care until age 21 had higher earnings and a reduced risk of pregnancy between ages 17 and 19. They were more likely to receive transitional living services funded through the CFCIP. However, the benefits of staying in care seemed to diminish by age 23, as they were no more likely than their peers to have earned a two- or four-year degree. This could be due to losing access to the services and supports that helped them pursue their educational goals. Researchers suggest that youth who aged out of foster care at 21 were not more likely to earn a two- or four-year degree compared to their peers. This could be due to losing access to supportive services and focusing on meeting basic needs like housing. Despite some financial assistance programs, these young people may lack academic and social/emotional support in school. States face challenges in extending care due to budget constraints. In a review of state policies on extending federal foster care in 2014, budget constraints were cited as the main reason for 17 states not extending care. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests convening a planning group of stakeholders, reviewing federal requirements, considering existing supports, and reaching agreement on key design issues when deciding whether to extend care. The advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 are significant, as shown by studies. Key steps to consider when deciding to extend care include convening a planning group, reviewing federal requirements, seeking input from young people, reaching agreement on design issues, projecting costs, and considering next steps. Extending foster care or providing transitional living services can offset costs like state prison admissions and welfare payments. A study in Illinois estimated the annual cost of extending care to be around $20,800, with benefits to youth. Researchers estimated the annual cost of extending foster care in Illinois to be around $20,800, with potential benefits to youth including increased wages from attending college. The analysis found an average return of about $2 for every $1 spent on youth in care, resulting in approximately $72,000 additionally earned over their lifetime. The study did not consider costs to state child welfare agencies or courts. The analysis did not consider the costs to state child welfare agencies or courts, such as additional time caseworkers spend on these cases and hiring more personnel. It also did not examine potential benefits of extending care, like higher tax revenues and reduced homelessness. Providing foster care to eligible youth after age 18 is a significant consideration for most states, with only about half of children meeting criteria for federal payments. State foster care expenditures may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government. State foster care expenditures may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government for eligible children and youth, based on specific criteria for Title IV-E eligibility. The reimbursement rate is tied to a state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The federal government reimburses states for foster care maintenance payments based on the state's FMAP, ranging from 50% to 73%. States may choose to only cover youth who are IV-E eligible due to the high costs involved. Non-IV-E eligible children's costs must be covered by the state or other funding sources. States extending care may cover only IV-E eligible youth, with states bearing costs for non-eligible youth. This selective approach could lead to equity concerns, potentially resulting in varying levels of reimbursement, services, and supports for eligible and non-eligible youth. Federal law allows eligible youth to remain in care past age 18 if they meet certain criteria. Federal law allows eligible youth to remain in care after age 18 by meeting specific criteria, such as attending school or working. States seeking federal reimbursement for extending foster care may restrict eligibility based on certain activities, potentially raising equity concerns. For example, limiting extended care to only those in post-secondary education could exclude youth pursuing other opportunities specified under the law. Federal law allows eligible youth to remain in care after age 18 by meeting specific criteria, such as attending school or working. States seeking federal reimbursement for extending foster care may restrict eligibility based on certain activities, potentially raising equity concerns. For example, limiting extended care to only those in post-secondary education could exclude youth pursuing other opportunities specified under the law. State courts play a crucial role in overseeing the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, ensuring each child has an appropriate permanency goal, regardless of IV-E eligibility or the circumstances of entry into care. A case review must be conducted at least every six months. State courts play a crucial role in overseeing the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, ensuring each child has an appropriate permanency goal. A case review must be conducted at least every six months, and a permanency plan must be established within 12 months of a child entering foster care. This plan is determined at a permanency hearing and reviewed at least every 12 months thereafter. The permanency plan for children in care must be determined at a court hearing or by a court-appointed/administrative body. The plan must be reviewed at least every 12 months for the child's entire stay in care, with consultation with the child in an age-appropriate manner. HHS requires case review system protections for all children under 18, regardless of IV-E eligibility, and for IV-E eligible children aged 18 and older. Children ineligible for IV-E may not be subject to the same court oversight. In contrast to children eligible for IV-E, those ineligible may not have the same level of court oversight or required services and supports, potentially leading to varying levels of care. The oversight and services for non-IV-E eligible youth may not be as comprehensive as for IV-E eligible youth, potentially leading to varying levels of care. There is a concern about the lack of information on these young people, hindering policymakers from ensuring all young adults in extended care have their needs met. The issue of jurisdiction for older youth in care and recommendations from the American Bar Association are also important considerations. The American Bar Association recommends legislation for juvenile courts to extend involvement beyond age 18, ensuring accountability for child welfare agencies. They suggest older youth in care should be present and involved in their hearings, with young adults taking a lead role. Stakeholders emphasize the need for different support systems for youth aged 18 and older in foster care. States are urged to rethink current models for older youth in care. Some stakeholders advocate for rethinking support systems for youth in foster care aged 18 and older, emphasizing the need for different models than those used for younger youth. The Jim Casey Foundation highlights the challenges faced by foster youth transitioning to independence at age 18, urging states to reconceptualize their current approaches. Young people in foster care face challenges when they age out of the system at 18, transitioning from having little say in their lives to being on their own. Simply extending traditional foster care is not enough to support their development. Stakeholders call for extended care to be developmentally appropriate, taking into account trauma and loss, and involving young adults in decisions about their lives based on research on adolescent brain development. Extended care for young adults in foster care is crucial for their development, taking into account trauma and involving them in decisions about their lives based on research on adolescent brain development. This approach emphasizes the need for social support, opportunities to learn from mistakes, and developing skills for healthy relationships. Extended care for young adults in foster care focuses on helping them identify and maintain permanent connections while developing skills for healthy relationships. This approach empowers young people to choose who they want to connect with and may involve graduated levels of supervision and support. Case planning is redesigned to involve the youth in decision-making and provide experiences that increase autonomy. Research also looks at factors that help young people stay in extended care, such as building social networks and support systems. The Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago conducted a study on youth in foster care in Illinois. In Cook County, over 81% of youth remain in care beyond age 18, compared to the three other regions where only 54% of youth stay in care. The study aimed to determine factors influencing why some youth leave care before age 21. The study by Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago found that nearly 60% of youth in Cook County remain in foster care beyond age 18, compared to 54% in other regions. Factors influencing early exit from care include juvenile courts actively retaining youth, lack of understanding of laws and policies, and limited appropriate foster care placements for older youth. Factors influencing youth staying in care beyond age 18 include stakeholders' understanding of laws and policies, availability of foster care placements, stable relationships with adults, and youth attitudes towards remaining in care. These factors may be relevant to states that do not extend care beyond age 18. In states that extend foster care, youth age 18 or older who emancipate from foster care may later determine they would like to return to care due to challenges living on their own. HHS permits states to extend foster care assistance allowing youth to stay in care continuously or return after attaining age 18, up to age 19, 20, or 21, depending on the state. States that extend foster care allow youth to stay in care continuously or return after turning 18, up to age 19, 20, or 21, depending on the state. The Government Accountability Office found that all 19 states with extended foster care policies enable young people to leave and re-enter care. In some states, youth can remain in care under voluntary placement agreements, and those over 18 may live independently in a supervised setting. States that extend foster care allow youth to stay in care continuously or return after turning 18, up to age 19, 20, or 21, depending on the state. The law does not provide clear guidance on independent living settings for older youth in care, leaving states to establish their own protocols for supervision. Regardless of the setting, advocates emphasize the importance of young adults in care learning essential life skills. States can establish distinct protocols for supervising older youth in care in independent living settings. Key considerations include whether to purchase independent living units, screening individuals living with youth in care, determining rent and utilities responsibilities for youth, frequency of case worker visits, and the level of youth responsibility in the setting. In independent living settings for youth in care, key considerations include rent and utilities responsibilities, frequency of case worker visits, youth responsibility for lease violations, and transitioning support back into the home. In states with extended care for youth, supervised independent living settings are provided to help with transitioning back into the home. Challenges include finding appropriate housing options. Youth in Minnesota can live in apartments, homes, dorms, and other settings. The state is working on assisting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Youth may live with roommates but not with parents or significant others they were removed from. Independent living settings are not required to be licensed. The state provides supervised independent living settings for youth transitioning out of foster care, allowing them to live with roommates but not with parents or significant others they were removed from. Independent living settings are not required to be licensed, and each county has discretion on handling background checks for roommates and safety concerns. Monthly federal assistance is generally not available for youth who have reached 18 and left foster care for adoption or kinship guardianship, but states can choose to provide subsidies for eligible children. States and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21, enrolled in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. Assistance can continue until the child turns 21, especially for those with medical conditions preventing participation in these activities. States and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday, as long as they are under 21, enrolled in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. Assistance can continue until the child turns 21, especially for those with medical conditions. The child must have been residing for at least six consecutive months in the home of the prospective relative guardian for kinship guardianship. HHS's July 2010 program instructions direct states to provide adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth age 18 and older if they opt to extend foster care beyond age 18. The July 2010 program instructions advise states to extend foster care beyond age 18 and provide adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth age 18 and older. The term \"relative\" for kinship guardianship assistance can include biological, legal, tribal, extended family, and friends. States and tribes can establish conditions for guardianship, such as requiring a child to be in care for more than six months and targeting certain age groups for guardianship. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) funds services to assist youth expected to emancipate from foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) funds services to assist youth expected to emancipate from foster care, targeting certain age groups for guardianship, such as children over age 12. The program aims to support youth in transitioning to self-sufficiency, obtaining employment, and entering postsecondary education. It also provides personal and emotional support through mentors and helps former foster youth ages 18 to 21 achieve self-sufficiency through various services. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) aims to support youth in transitioning to self-sufficiency, obtaining employment, and entering postsecondary education. It provides personal and emotional support through mentors and helps former foster youth ages 18 to 21 achieve self-sufficiency through various services. P.L. 110-351 enables states and tribes to provide independent living services to youth who leave foster care after attaining age 16. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) added a purpose area to the Chafee program to ensure children likely to remain in foster care until 18 have opportunities for age-appropriate activities. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) was enhanced in September 2014 to include a purpose area ensuring children likely to stay in foster care until 18 have opportunities for age-appropriate activities. States and tribes receive funding based on their foster care population share, with a minimum allocation of $500,000 or the amount received in FY1998. States must provide a 20% match for the capped entitlement program, which has an annual ceiling of $140 million. This funding, along with other sources, supports independent living programs for youth, offering services like housing, education, career exploration, counseling, and mentoring. States have developed independent living programs, funded by the CFCIP, to provide services like housing, education, career exploration, counseling, and mentoring to youth. To be eligible for funds, states must describe their program in their Child and Family Services Plan, ensuring statewide coverage and serving children of various ages. Funding must meet certain requirements, such as limiting the use of funds for room and board for youth ages 18 to 21. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually for youth who have emancipated from care or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. Congress authorized $60 million in discretionary funds for the program, allocated to states based on their foster care population. Approximately $45 million is appropriated each year for the program. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program provides vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually for eligible youth in foster care. The program authorizes funding for full-time or part-time attendance at higher education institutions. Students must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program. States can also provide independent living services to youth who have left foster care before age 18. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program allows eligible foster youth to receive vouchers for higher education. States can offer independent living services to youth who have left foster care before age 18, including those who were adopted or under kinship guardianship. States have discretion in defining which youth are likely to remain in foster care until age 18. States may need to assess the capacity of independent living programs to serve additional youth and prioritize who to serve in the program. States have discretion in defining which youth are likely to remain in foster care until age 18. They may need to assess the capacity of independent living programs to serve additional youth and prioritize who to serve in the program. Child welfare law requires a transition plan for youth turning 18, including options for housing, education, mentors, and employment services to be implemented 90 days prior to their birthday. The transition plan for youth turning 18 must be directed by the youth and include options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services. It must be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday, and must also address the designation of another individual to make health care decisions if needed. The transition plan for youth turning 18 must address the designation of another individual to make health care decisions if needed, and provide options for executing a health care power of attorney. It is distinct from a case plan for children in foster care, but they complement each other. The case plan for youth in care describes placement and care, while the transition plan focuses on services for independence after leaving state custody. It includes housing options and support for independent living. The transition plan for youth leaving state custody involves identifying specific options for independent living, including housing options. It is directed by the youth in consultation with others and can be detailed as desired. The plan is not reviewed by a court but is guided by program instructions issued by HHS to assist young people in transitioning from foster care. The transition plan for youth leaving state custody involves building on earlier efforts to assist young people in transitioning from foster care. Child welfare agencies are encouraged to engage youth in the transition plan process well in advance of the 90-day period before their 18th birthday. This raises questions about youth who emancipate at age 17 and may leave care less prepared than their peers. Youth emancipating from care at age 17 may leave less prepared than those emancipating at 18 or older. States and tribes may not provide transition plans for youth leaving care between ages 18 and 19, 20, or 21. Social work professionals are developing guidance on engaging youth in the transition planning process to achieve permanency. The guidance emphasizes engaging youth and stakeholders in a transition plan focused on achieving permanency with caring adults. Plans should consider the strengths of young people, involve their input, and encourage collaboration among service providers. States have adopted policies to involve youth in transition planning and provide essential supports during the transition from foster care. In a 2014 report, GAO found that states have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning from foster care. Nearly all jurisdictions require documented youth input and key document inclusion in the plan. Some jurisdictions face challenges like staff training and engaging supportive adults in the process. Several jurisdictions face challenges with transition planning, including a lack of staff training or time to effectively engage youth, identifying and engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing for youth transitioning from care. Hawaii and Nebraska have developed detailed transition planning processes, such as holding \"circles\" in Hawaii to celebrate the young person becoming an adult and assisting them in planning for their future. These conferences involve the youth and their support system to generate options and resources for decision-making and goal achievement. Transition planning conferences are driven by youth and their support system to help them make decisions about their future. Foster Club in Nebraska has a transition planning kit for older youth in foster care, outlining roles of the transition plan team and courts. It includes a transition proposal checklist revisited at six months and 90 days before aging out, as well as a \"permanency pact\" for identifying supportive individuals and types of assistance. The transition planning process for older youth in foster care involves a \"permanency pact\" to identify supportive individuals and types of assistance before aging out. Concerns remain about challenges faced by older foster youth as they transition to adulthood, including difficulties in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. The transition of older youth in foster care involves challenges in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. A new national database may provide insight into their outcomes in education, employment, and contact with social services and criminal justice systems. Congress is focusing on increasing protections for vulnerable children in foster care, including those at risk of going missing or being victims of sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act aims to address these issues. The Midwest Evaluation on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth shows that youth who aged out of foster care have challenges in forming permanent relationships with caring adults and remain estranged from their biological families. At age 26, these youth were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents compared to their peers. Alumni reported varying levels of closeness with their biological family members. Former foster youth who aged out of care were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents compared to their peers. Alumni reported varying levels of closeness with their biological family members, suggesting that some did not have strong relationships with relatives after leaving care. This highlights the need for policies to improve the transition to adulthood by promoting strong connections to caring adults. Young people in care advocate for policies that improve the transition to adulthood by fostering strong connections to caring adults. These connections can provide emotional, financial, and other support for better outcomes. Child welfare agencies in some areas actively work to ensure permanent adult connections for youth aging out of foster care. Permanency for youth in care involves having at least one committed adult who offers a safe, stable, and secure relationship, unconditional commitment, and legal ties where possible. Practitioners suggest reevaluating the need for \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" and assisting youth in identifying permanent connections. Practitioners emphasize the importance of developing lasting relationships for youth in care, including reconsidering the need for \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" and assisting youth in forming permanent connections with adults. It is advised to be cautious in designing policies to avoid harmful or unsustainable relationships for these young individuals. Advocates urge policy makers and practitioners to initiate permanency planning before youth leave care, emphasizing the need for healthy relationships between foster youth and their family members. Permanency goals include returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. The judge determines the permanency plan for the child, which can include returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. If none of these options are possible, \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) may be chosen with a compelling reason documented. APPLA was added as a permanent arrangement for children in long term foster care to address stability concerns. Advocates envisioned APPLA as a permanent arrangement for a child, involving a specific adult or couple to care for the young person in a stable and caring role. Concerns have been raised that APPLA is being used as a default permanency goal for some children in foster care, cautioning against certain settings like group care unless necessary evidence is present. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth issued a white paper in December 2010, highlighting the importance of permanency for children in foster care. They noted that youth often do not understand what permanency means and recommended eliminating APPLA as a case goal. The white paper recommended eliminating APPLA as a case plan goal or restricting it to older teenagers after intensive family finding efforts. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA. The law prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA. If a child is assigned this plan, the state must meet additional requirements during annual permanency hearings and periodic reviews to find a permanent family for the child. The agency continues to search for a permanent family for children with an APPLA designation, while the court reevaluates the appropriateness of APPLA as a permanency plan. The transition plan requirement aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood by considering local mentoring opportunities. Proposed changes to federal child welfare law could assist youth in achieving permanency by including steps to ensure a permanent living arrangement if they emancipate. Proposed changes to federal child welfare law could include amending written case plan requirements to ensure youth have a permanent living arrangement after emancipation. The plan should document efforts to find a permanent placement with family or adult connections for older youth. GAO found that 36 jurisdictions require intensive transition planning to establish adult connections for young people aging out of foster care. In the transition process for youth aging out of foster care, states require intensive efforts to establish adult connections. In Texas, youth are assisted in identifying caring adults for support after leaving care. The Foster Club's Permanency Pact helps connect youth with supportive adults for lifelong commitment. The Permanency Pact by Foster Club aims to connect youth aging out of foster care with caring adults for lifelong support. Efforts to support permanency include Adoption Opportunity Grants to demonstrate effective strategies for adoption and securing permanent connections for older youth. The federal government funded 10 projects nationwide to promote open adoption and secure permanent connections for youth. Additional changes at the federal level could include funding for mentoring programs for foster children, with legislation introduced to authorize grants for this purpose. Legislation proposes grants for mentoring foster children to support networks of community entities. State and local child welfare agencies aim to ensure safety and well-being for all children, including victims of sex trafficking. Foster care children, especially runaways, are at risk of trafficking, with limited agency capacity to address their needs. Youth who run away from foster care are vulnerable to trafficking, with limited capacity for child welfare agencies to respond. States may lack mechanisms to identify sex trafficking cases involving children not under parental care. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across various sectors to combat child sex trafficking. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across sectors to combat child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act was passed in the 113th Congress to address child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) requires state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and assist children at risk of sex trafficking. The procedures must involve collaboration with various agencies and organizations and provide training for caseworkers. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to establish procedures within one year of enactment and implement them within two years. Agencies must report child sex trafficking victims to law enforcement within 24 hours and annually report the total number to HHS, which will then report to Congress and the public. HHS must report annually to Congress and the public the total number of children and youth reported as sex trafficking victims by state child welfare agencies. HHS is also required to submit a report to Congress summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide specialized services for these victims. Additionally, HHS must establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within 180 days of the bill's enactment. The National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking must be established by HHS within 180 days of the bill's enactment. The committee will advise the HHS Secretary and the Attorney General on policies for improving the response to domestic sex trafficking of minors from the child welfare system and developing best practices for states to combat domestic sex trafficking of minors. Congress should monitor state implementation of these requirements when they take effect one to four years after the law's enactment. State child welfare agencies are required to serve only children and youth victims who are already in the child welfare system, not necessarily those who may come to the agency as a victim. Congress may consider the extent to which state agencies should screen in victims. Pending legislation, such as H.R. 5081, would require state child welfare agencies to identify and assess reports involving children who are sex trafficking victims. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited federal guidance on serving missing children. Children in foster care homes may go missing due to abuse and neglect. Federal guidance on serving missing children is limited, with a focus on those who run away from placements. Some child welfare stakeholders advocate for a more uniform response to missing children in care. A 2004 survey by the Child Welfare League of America found that many states have policies in place to prevent and recover missing foster children, but implementation varies across jurisdictions. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act directs state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care and addressing factors contributing to their disappearance. Implementation of these policies varies across jurisdictions within states. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care, addressing factors contributing to their disappearance, and reporting information to authorities and the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children. The Child Welfare League of America recommends that state child welfare agencies have procedures in place to address issues related to missing children from care, such as recruiting and training a competent workforce and maintaining caseload standards. State child welfare agencies should have procedures in place to address issues related to missing children from care, including involving key stakeholders in decision-making and examining and correcting deficiencies in foster care facilities. States also need to define \"missing\" children and decide whether to report all cases to law enforcement agencies. States vary in how they define and report missing children, including whether to involve law enforcement. Some states include children whose whereabouts are known but are not at their foster care placements in their definition of \"missing.\" This raises questions about when to report missing children to law enforcement, considering their competing demands and resources. Law enforcement agencies may not respond as vigorously to certain types of missing incidents, such as frequent runaways, due to various factors. Law enforcement agencies may not have dedicated staff for missing persons cases, leading to varying responses to different types of missing incidents. Even children with known whereabouts may still be at risk. Coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and courts is crucial in preventing children from going missing. Federal child welfare policy outlines general requirements that could serve as a starting point for collaboration. The CWLA Best Practices and NCMEC guidelines emphasize the importance of collaboration between law enforcement and child welfare agencies in addressing missing children. State child welfare agencies are required to report on children who run away from foster care placements, but little is known about children missing from foster care. Child welfare agencies are required to report on children who run away from foster care placements, but there is limited information on children missing from foster care due to abductions or negligence. Stakeholders have concerns that safety policies may restrict foster youth from engaging in age-appropriate activities. Child welfare stakeholders are concerned about restrictions on foster youth participating in normal activities due to safety policies. Witnesses testified about limitations such as no sleepovers, dating, driving, working, and sports without background screenings for adults. Youth naturally seek independence and may want to take on more risks. Witnesses testified that youth may engage in risky behaviors as they seek independence, with changes in brain development during adolescence leading to increased risk-taking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) addressed the need to promote normalcy for youth in foster care by including provisions for their participation in activities. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) includes provisions to promote normalcy for youth in foster care, such as establishing a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for caregivers. Congress will monitor the law's implementation one year after enactment, with HHS assisting states in identifying best practices for foster parents. Training on children's developmental stages is required for prospective foster parents. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires child welfare agencies to provide training to prospective foster parents on children's developmental stages and the reasonable and prudent parent standard. States must revise licensing standards for foster homes to reflect provisions around normalcy. Concerns for youth aging out of foster care include lack of adequate housing, with studies showing varying rates of homelessness among former foster youth. A major concern for youth aging out of foster care is the lack of adequate and affordable housing. Studies have found varying rates of homelessness among former foster youth, with estimates ranging from 11% to 36%. The Midwest Evaluation reported that 24% of 23-year-olds had experienced homelessness since exiting care. Additionally, many emancipated youth resort to couch surfing, staying temporarily with family and friends due to a lack of permanent housing. Individual characteristics such as financial support, family ties, and early parenthood can impact the housing status of former foster youth. Estimates show that a significant percentage of emancipated youth couch surf due to various factors such as lack of financial support, ties to family, early parenthood, and involvement with the juvenile justice system. The transition to adulthood for former foster youth is often challenging, with difficulties in securing affordable housing leading to issues in education and employment. While states can allocate funds for room and board for these youth, it is noted that these funds may not be sufficient to cover housing costs adequately. Former foster youth face challenges in securing affordable housing, with funds allocated by states often insufficient. Nonprofit organizations offer housing programs in collaboration with developers or property management agencies. These programs provide various housing options like single-site locations, scattered-site locations, and host homes. The focus is on providing independent living support to former foster youth. None of the housing programs for former foster youth have been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing homelessness or improving housing stability. States offering extended foster care options under P.L. 110-351 struggle to find suitable housing options for these youth, including those in college who lack accommodations during school breaks. The Higher Education Act addresses housing challenges for former foster youth in college by requiring public universities in some states to provide housing during school breaks. This includes services specifically for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth, such as housing services. The Higher Education Act (HEA) addresses housing challenges for former foster youth in college by authorizing services for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth, including temporary housing during breaks in the academic year. The law allows additional uses of funds to establish demonstration projects that provide comprehensive support services for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13, including housing when educational institution housing is closed. The Higher Education Act authorizes support services for former foster youth in college, including temporary housing during breaks. Projects can provide housing for students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13 when educational institution housing is closed. Federal law allows owners of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit properties to designate units for low-income students who were in foster care. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, lacking support networks. Youth in care and other vulnerable groups are at higher risk of disconnection. Those who age out of care have low employment rates and earnings. Youth who have aged out of care tend to have low rates of employment and earnings. A study in three states showed that at age 24, about three out of five emancipated youth were working, earning substantially less than their counterparts nationally. These young people also face challenges in education, such as multiple school placements and lack of consistent support. Young people who have aged out of foster care face challenges in education and employment. A study showed that by age 26, only about 7% of foster care alumni attained a degree, compared to one-third of the general youth population. This suggests the need for additional support in completing their education, such as academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance. Young foster care alumni may require additional academic, social/emotional, and logistical support, including year-round housing, to facilitate completing their education. Federal child welfare law addresses the educational needs of youth in foster care, requiring state agencies to consider proximity to the child's school when placing them in foster care and include education-related records in the child's case plan. The child welfare agency must include education-related records in the child's case plan, work with education authorities to keep the child in the same school or ensure immediate enrollment in a new school if needed. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin\" and must assure education for children in foster care. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of vulnerable youth populations, including current foster youth. The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Education convened a summit in November 2011 to discuss this issue. The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Education held a summit in November 2011 to address the education needs of foster youth. Despite collaboration, federal education law does not currently cater to these needs. Legislation like S. 1094 aims to improve access to education for children in foster care. S. 1094 aims to improve education access for children in foster care by amending federal education law to ensure they remain in the same school or enroll in a new one if necessary. It also requires state education agencies to have policies for transferring school credits. The Higher Education Act includes provisions for supportive educational services for foster youth, including eligibility for federal Trio programs that offer mentoring, tutoring, and other support services for disadvantaged students aiming for higher education. The Trio programs provide mentoring, tutoring, and support services for disadvantaged students aiming for higher education. The FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to identify if they are or were in foster care, and to provide information about federal educational resources. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is a major source of funding for these services. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in care or aging out, but little is known about their effectiveness. Studies have not shown significant improvements in outcomes for foster youth, and there is a lack of national data on their transition to adulthood. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is the main source of funding for independent living services for youth transitioning out of foster care. A national database called the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) will provide insight into the lives of these youth, but full implementation may take several years. States receive $140 million annually for the program, with a 20% match requirement. Most states utilize their maximum CFCIP funding. States receive funding for independent living services based on their share of children in care, with a 20% match requirement. A 2008 survey found that 68.9% of states spend additional funds on independent living programs. Federal funding alone may not be sufficient for states to fully implement these programs. Research on effective independent living services is limited, but evaluations of innovative programs are conducted by HHS as required by law. The research literature on independent living programs is scarce. HHS contracted with the Urban Institute to evaluate the effects of programs funded by P.L. 106-169 on foster youth outcomes. 1,400 foster youth were randomly assigned to programs in California and Massachusetts to assess key outcomes such as educational attainment, employment rates, interpersonal skills, and delinquency rates. The evaluation involved randomly assigning 1,400 eligible foster youth to four programs in California and Massachusetts\u2014an employment services program in Kern County, CA; a one-on-one intensive, individualized life skills program in Massachusetts; and a classroom-based life skills training program and tutoring/mentoring program, both in Los Angeles County, CA. The youth were surveyed at three points: baseline, one year after baseline, and two years after baseline, with in-person interviews and focus groups conducted with various stakeholders. The evaluation of foster youth programs in California and Massachusetts involved interviews with various stakeholders and analysis of state administrative data. The programs in Los Angeles and Kern County showed no significant impacts, while the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care had positive effects on education outcomes. The Outreach program helps youth prepare for independent living and establish permanent connections with caring adults. The Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care, known as Outreach, aims to assist youth in achieving education outcomes, preparing for independent living, and establishing permanent connections with caring adults. The program provides tailored services with a focus on youth empowerment and positive decision-making. Social workers oversee small caseloads and have regular interactions with the youth to support their development. The Outreach program empowers youth to make positive life decisions through close relationships with social workers. Workers assist with tasks like obtaining licenses, applying for college, and gaining employment. Evaluation shows Outreach youth have higher college enrollment rates and better outcomes transitioning to adulthood. The Outreach program helps youth transition to adulthood by providing support in various areas. Outreach youth have higher college enrollment rates and are more likely to stay enrolled. They also receive more help in educational and employment assistance, money management, and housing. Remaining in care and enrolling in college are closely linked. However, Outreach youth did not show better outcomes in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or preparedness for tasks compared to the control group. The evaluation of the Outreach program raises questions about the efficacy of independent living programs and classroom-based instruction in helping youth transition to independent living. Despite higher college enrollment rates and support in various areas, Outreach youth did not show better outcomes in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or preparedness for tasks compared to the control group. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks demographic and outcome information of foster youth, providing insight into their outcomes. States have reported information to the database as required by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) was established to develop outcome measures for assessing state performance in independent living programs for foster youth. States were required to collect data on youth starting in FY2011. The NYTD was established to collect data on youth receiving independent living services, tracking their outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21. States began data collection in FY2011, as required by P.L. 106-169. The NYTD collects data on outcomes of foster youth at ages 17, 19, and 21, with financial penalties for states that do not meet data requirements. States can track a sample of youth to reduce the burden of data collection."
