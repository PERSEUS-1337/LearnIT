    "content": "The Great Lakes watershed, spanning 300,000 square miles across eight U.S. states and one Canadian province, holds nearly 90% of the U.S. surface freshwater and 20% of the world's. It supports 40 million people with jobs, drinking water, and recreation, making it a vital international natural resource. The Great Lakes basin supports 40 million people with jobs, drinking water, and recreation. Development has degraded water quality, posing threats to wildlife and human health. Restoration activities are being implemented by governments in the basin. The Great Lakes basin faces threats from development, including degraded water quality and endangered species. Governments in the US and Canada are implementing restoration activities, with Congress enacting laws to fund mitigation and improve habitat. However, there is no detailed plan like the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan in Florida. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force was created in 2004 to provide strategic direction on federal Great Lakes policy. Chaired by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it includes 10 agency and cabinet-level officers. The task force collaborates with various groups in the Great Lakes region to work on restoration efforts. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration, established by the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, aims to restore and protect the Great Lakes through a strategy released in December 2005. It serves as a forum for addressing regional issues and coordinates the implementation of the Strategy. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration aims to address regional issues related to the protection and restoration of the Great Lakes through a Strategy that includes recommendations for actions in eight issue areas. These recommendations are intended to be implemented over the next five years and represent the highest priorities for restoration. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy includes recommendations for actions in eight issue areas, such as pollutants, indicators, and sustainable development. Recommendations range from supporting existing programs to creating new ones, with estimated costs provided for implementing the recommendations over five years. Goals and interim milestones are also outlined for each issue area, relying on existing authorities, programs, and funding at various government levels. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy outlines recommendations for actions in eight issue areas, relying on existing resources but also requiring some new actions and funding. Coordination among stakeholders is emphasized, with some recommendations feasible with existing resources while others will need additional funding. The Strategy does not aim to fully restore the Great Lakes ecosystem. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy highlights the need for substantial new expenditures to address issues such as invasive species. It aims to prevent new introductions and control existing invasive species in the ecosystem. Economic losses from invasive species were estimated at $5.0 billion annually in 2005. The goals of addressing invasive species in the Great Lakes basin include preventing new introductions and controlling existing species. This involves preventing spread through canals, waterways, and ballast water, as well as implementing research and management programs. Habitat loss and species declines have been caused by development, agriculture, pollutants, and invasive species. The ecosystem provides valuable services and supports a significant recreation industry. Recommendations include increasing funding for habitat conservation and species management by $288 million annually. The recommendations for improving fisheries and habitat restoration in the Great Lakes include increasing funding by $288 million annually. Water quality issues in coastal areas have led to outbreaks of disease among humans, beach closings, and drinking water advisories. Recommendations include implementing wet weather programs, improving wastewater treatment systems, regulating pollution sources, and managing waters used for recreation. In 1987, the United States and Canada identified 43 Areas of Concern in the Great Lakes. The recommendations for improving drinking water quality in the Great Lakes include implementing wet weather programs, improving wastewater treatment systems, regulating pollution sources, and managing waters used for recreation. Contaminated sediments are a common reason for degradation in Areas of Concern (AOCs), resulting from toxic pollutants settling in sediment. The goal is to restore all AOCs in the United States through funding programs under the Great Lakes Legacy Act and developing sediment treatment technologies. Nonpoint source pollution is also a significant issue. The goal is to restore all Areas of Concern (AOCs) in the United States by reauthorizing and funding programs under the Great Lakes Legacy Act. Nonpoint source pollution, such as excessive levels of nutrients, is a major contributor to impaired waters in the Great Lakes ecosystem. Reducing sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen loading into the ecosystem is a key focus. The Great Lakes face nonpoint source pollution issues, including excessive nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen. Goals include reducing nutrient loading, restoring wetlands and buffer habitat, and decreasing soil loss into waterways. Persistent toxic substances (PTS) are also a concern, with the aim to eliminate their discharge and increase scientific understanding. Recommendations involve reducing PTS like mercury, PCBs, and pesticides from the ecosystem. The Strategy aims to virtually eliminate the discharge of Persistent Toxic Substances (PTS) into the ecosystem and increase scientific understanding. Recommendations include reducing PTS such as mercury, PCBs, and pesticides; creating a research program for monitoring PTS in the Great Lakes; and increasing public education. Ecosystem monitoring, research, and indicator development are underfunded, with goals to establish a monitoring network and conduct coordinated research. Actions include developing science-based indicators, doubling research funding, and coordinating scientific information. The Strategy aims to enhance ecosystem health in the Great Lakes by developing science-based indicators, doubling research funding, and coordinating scientific information. It emphasizes balancing economic, social, and ecological factors for sustainable development. Funding for the Strategy is a contentious issue, with an estimated $20 billion needed from federal and nonfederal sources. The Great Lakes Strategy calls for $20 billion in funding over five years, with the majority allocated to coastal health issues. Some argue that this amount is too high compared to other ecosystem restoration projects like the Florida Everglades, which has a total estimated cost of $10.5 billion. Some argue that $20 billion over five years for restoring the Great Lakes ecosystem is excessive compared to the $10.5 billion cost of the Florida Everglades restoration. The Interagency Task Force suggests funding the Strategy from existing programs and current federal and state government funding. Existing programs related to water quality in the Great Lakes already spend around $523 million federally and $100 million from state, local, and tribal sources annually. No specific federal spending figures were provided for other ecosystem aspects. Some proponents argue that the proposed $20 billion for Great Lakes ecosystem restoration is justified due to its vast size compared to other initiatives. The Chesapeake Bay restoration may cost $15-19 billion. Inadequate funding is seen as a barrier to restoration efforts in the Great Lakes. Data on current spending for various components is lacking, making it challenging to separate new funding from existing programs. Inadequate funding is a barrier to restoration in the Great Lakes, with challenges in separating new funding from existing programs. The Strategy lacks data on current spending for all components, making it hard to identify funding gaps. The Collaboration and Strategy aim to improve coordination among federal, state, and local stakeholders for ecosystem restoration activities in the Great Lakes. The Strategy for ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes focuses on coordination among federal, state, and local stakeholders. Some view the Interagency Task Force and Collaboration as facilitating coordination, but governance issues and specific plans for coordination are lacking in the Strategy. Coordination of restoration activities is a stated function of the task force, but questions about leadership, federal and state roles, and governance of the Strategy remain unanswered. The Strategy for ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes lacks specifics on federal and state roles, governance, and implementation. The task force is responsible for coordinating restoration activities, with the executive committee planning to oversee Strategy implementation and promote accountability among stakeholders. The committee will direct activities of the GLRC, implement mechanisms for accountability, identify implementation issues, and facilitate coordination of restoration activities among stakeholders. Governance and coordination in large-scale ecosystem restoration initiatives have been addressed in federal and state laws, as seen in the Everglades example. Some argue that implementing all programs outlined in the Strategy may not be financially feasible within the five-year time span. Some suggest setting priorities for implementing programs within the Great Lakes Restoration Strategy to address financial feasibility concerns. Priorities discussed include restoring and protecting near-shore and coastal waters, controlling invasive species, and addressing nonpoint source pollution. The Strategy could serve as a basis for federal legislation for Great Lakes restoration, with pending legislation reflecting two main authorization approaches. The Great Lakes Restoration Strategy could be a platform for federal legislation, with pending legislation proposing grant programs or reauthorizing existing programs to fund restoration activities. Proposed authorizations for federal funding range from $4 billion to $6 billion, targeting ecosystem restoration projects. The Strategy does not specify funding sources for its recommendations. Reauthorizing existing federal programs like the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006 could be an alternative approach to fund restoration activities. The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-537; as amended) is reauthorized through 2012 with amendments to increase reporting requirements and allow regional projects by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In the 110th Congress, new programs are authorized alongside existing ones to support the Strategy, including the establishment of a task force within the EPA, an executive committee for progress reporting, and a Collaboration for long-term restoration efforts. The Strategy for restoring the Great Lakes includes the establishment of a task force within the EPA, an executive committee for progress reporting, and a Collaboration for long-term restoration efforts. It aims to be the first step towards restoration but questions remain about the process, cost, and timeline for complete restoration. The Strategy for restoring the Great Lakes includes the establishment of a task force within the EPA, an executive committee for progress reporting, and a Collaboration for long-term restoration efforts. Questions remain about the process, cost, and timeline for complete restoration, as well as the roles, governance, and funding levels needed for success. The answers to these questions are not addressed in the Strategy but may come from the collaborative process that created it."
