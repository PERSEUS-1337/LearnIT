    "content": "Irrigation has been crucial for the development and economy of the United States, especially in settling the West and revitalizing agriculture after the Dust Bowl. Technological advancements have modernized irrigated agriculture, but come with costs like infrastructure, federal programs, and potential impacts on water users and the environment. Key measurements of irrigation include water withdrawals and consumption. The primary measurements of irrigation water use are water withdrawals and consumption. Irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23% since 1980, with a 9% drop nationally from 2005 to 2010. It is uncertain if the decline in withdrawals has led to a decrease in water consumption due to improved irrigation efficiency. Since 1980, irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23%, with a 9% drop nationally from 2005 to 2010. The decline in withdrawals may not necessarily lead to reduced water consumption due to improved irrigation efficiency. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003. Eastern states like Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee have significantly increased irrigated acres by 50% since the 1980s, shifting from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation. Since the 1980s, seven states (Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee) increased irrigation by 50%, shifting to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation. In the West, irrigated land increased by 1.7 million acres while applied irrigation water decreased by 1.37 million acre-feet. There has been a decline in water application since 1998, with groundwater withdrawals increasing by 740,000 AF. Since 1998, irrigation withdrawals from on-farm surface water and water delivered to farms in the West have decreased, while groundwater withdrawals have increased. Irrigation withdrawals remain highest in the western-most portions of the United States. In the East, irrigated land has grown significantly since 1984, primarily relying on groundwater withdrawals. This increase in irrigated acres in the East is attributed to factors such as increased commodity prices, drought episodes, and low-cost access to groundwater. Irrigation withdrawals in eastern states have increased by 4.3 million AF since 2003, mainly due to factors like higher commodity prices, droughts, and easy access to groundwater. This has led to a rise in irrigated acres but has also caused a decline in aquifer levels and raised environmental concerns. Irrigation efficiency is defined as the percentage of applied water that is beneficially used and not lost, influenced by factors like system performance, water application uniformity, and crop response to irrigation. Efficient irrigation systems are influenced by factors like evapotranspiration rates, climate conditions, and water conveyance systems. While efficient systems aim to leave additional water in the hydrological system for downstream use, studies have shown that they may lead to greater water consumption in some cases. Efficient irrigation systems aim to maintain crop production levels while conserving water for downstream use. However, some studies suggest that increasing water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation may lead to higher water consumption and crop yield. The efficiency of microirrigation compared to gravity irrigation is debated, with gravity irrigation typically consuming less water due to water return through runoff and deep percolation. Efficient irrigation systems may not always result in less water consumed overall, as gravity irrigation typically consumes less water than microirrigation. Water not taken in by plants through evapotranspiration in gravity irrigation can be returned to surface or groundwater sources. Additionally, adopting more-efficient irrigation technologies may lead to growing more profitable, water-intensive crops. Adopting efficient irrigation technologies may not always reduce overall water consumption. Irrigation systems are classified into pressure and gravity systems, with precision technologies enhancing efficiency. Best management practices focus on improved water management on farms, including conveyance and scheduling methods. Best management practices (BMPs) for irrigation involve improved water management on farms, including conveyance, scheduling, and application methods. These practices are based on select practices identified by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and can apply to both pressure and gravity irrigation systems. Pressure systems pump water through tubing or pipes for application through sprinklers or microirrigation systems. Pressure systems pump water through tubing or pipes to apply water to crops using sprinkler or microirrigation systems. Sprinkler irrigation uses high- to medium-pressure systems to create artificial precipitation, while microirrigation applies water directly to the root zone of crops. Pressure irrigation systems make up roughly 58-65% of irrigation systems in the US, including center pivot, linear move tower, solid set, slide roll, big gun, hand move, and drip systems. These systems are more efficient than gravity systems and can be used to grow most crops. Linear move tower, solid set, slide roll, wheel move, big gun, traveler, hand move, and drip, trickle, or low-flow micro sprinklers are pressure irrigation systems that are more efficient than gravity systems. They require intentional preparation to manage water application for appropriate soil moisture levels, reduce soil erosion, maximize plant growth, lower energy consumption, and increase water efficiency. These systems may include various irrigation Best Management Practices (BMPs) such as microirrigation, sprinkler irrigation, ditch lining, land leveling, and tailwater recovery. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation are common types of pressure irrigation systems. Microirrigation and sprinkler irrigation are efficient irrigation systems that provide adequate soil moisture for crops. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation spray water over a crop area. Microirrigation includes surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation, applying water directly to the root zone of crops. This enhances standard center pivot systems to low-energy precision application (LEPA) irrigation systems. LEPA irrigation systems are more efficient than sprinkler and gravity systems as they apply water directly to the root zone of crops. Gravity systems divert water to flood over a crop area through land-forming measures, while controlled flooding methods increase efficiencies. Uncontrolled flooding, the simplest form of irrigation, is less efficient. Irrigation methods like basin, border, and furrow irrigation use land-forming measures to increase efficiencies. Gravity systems are generally less efficient than pressure systems and are suited for close-growing crops like rice. Land leveling can increase gravity irrigation efficiency, reduce erosion, and prevent water logging of soil or crops. Furrow irrigation systems may be used for row crops like potato and corn. Land leveling can increase gravity irrigation efficiency and prevent water logging of soil or crops. Irrigation ditch lining can limit water loss during transit to the crop area. Tailwater recovery systems can reuse excess water from gravity irrigation to prevent water contamination. Precision technologies, such as satellite data, sensor networks, data analytics, and drones, have been rapidly incorporated into the agricultural industry, especially in irrigation. Tailwater recovery systems can convey excess water back to the irrigation system for reuse, while irrigation reservoirs provide storage for water used in irrigation. The size of the reservoir depends on water availability and crop needs, and it can be maintained by surface or groundwater. The incorporation of precision technologies in agriculture, such as satellite data and drones, has increased irrigation efficiency. Technology companies are offering services to help farmers maximize profits. A collaborative project between NASA and USDA launched the SMAP satellite to gather soil moisture data globally. The SMAP satellite, part of the mission Soil Moisture Active Passive, collects soil moisture data globally using radar and radiometer technology. Despite radar transmission issues in 2015, the project continues with supplemental data. This data can help governments and agricultural producers make informed decisions on irrigation. Drones can provide aerial imagery for trend analysis, while sensor networks monitor plant water status and soil water content. Data analytics utilize real-time data for energy consumption and environmental conditions. Sensor networks can monitor plant water status, evapotranspiration, and soil water content for irrigation adjustments. Data analytics use real-time data to improve decisions on water application. Regional weather data combined with precipitation and soil moisture information helps establish accurate irrigation schedules. Remote monitoring systems transfer real-time data for efficient irrigation operations and reduce water usage. Poly-pipe is commonly used in irrigation systems. The implementation of irrigation BMPs, such as using poly-pipe in furrow irrigation and optimizing hole sizes with computer software, can increase irrigation efficiency. This can reduce water usage, prioritize field visits, and ensure even watering, leading to higher yields and the ability to grow higher value crops. Irrigation also extends growing seasons and reduces production costs. Irrigation BMPs enhance production by ensuring even watering, leading to higher yields and the ability to grow higher value crops like fruits, vegetables, and nuts. It also reduces costs by allowing water to flow only when needed, preventing issues from overwatering. Additionally, irrigation systems can be used for applying nutrients and pesticides, reducing costs and providing more precise application. Efficient irrigation systems can reduce costs and provide more precise application of nutrients and pesticides. Implementation choices vary in the United States due to factors like cost, crop type, climate, and water availability. The adoption of efficient irrigation systems is often driven by potential economic gains rather than water conservation. Growers of high-value crops were among the first to adopt drip irrigation technology. Efficient irrigation systems are adopted for economic gains rather than water conservation. High-value crop growers are more likely to invest in costly systems like drip irrigation, while low-value crop growers are less inclined. The USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey found that some respondents couldn't finance system improvements, and high-efficiency systems can be more expensive than gravity systems. Agricultural producers also consider the cost of developing a water supply, including drilling wells. High-efficiency pressure irrigation systems, such as micro sprinklers and sub-surface drip, are more costly than gravity systems like furrow irrigation. The cost of developing a water supply, including drilling wells and operating pumps, is a significant consideration for agricultural producers when choosing an irrigation system. Groundwater supply development costs, influenced by pumping depth and energy costs, are generally higher than surface water supply costs. Therefore, areas heavily reliant on groundwater tend to adopt high-efficiency pressure systems, while areas with ample surface water resources are more likely to use gravity irrigation due to lower water development expenses. Areas heavily reliant on groundwater tend to adopt high-efficiency pressure irrigation systems, while areas with adequate surface water supplies are less likely to use efficient irrigation systems due to lower water development costs. Irrigation system adoption is also influenced by the type of crop being grown, with perennial tree crops better suited for drip irrigation systems to prevent fruit decay. Close-growing crops like rice typically require gravity irrigation, while widely spaced field crops may not benefit from total field soil saturation. Many farmers in the United States face challenges in adopting more efficient irrigation systems due to the nature of their crops. Recent survey data shows that many farmers in the United States face challenges in adopting more efficient irrigation systems due to crop type, physical field conditions, and climate factors. Drip and surface irrigation are more effective in windy conditions, while sprinkler irrigation in arid climates leads to high evaporation levels. Soil type and crop evapotranspiration rates also influence the choice of irrigation system. Soil salinity issues can result from irrigation. Climate conditions impact crop evapotranspiration rates, influencing the choice of irrigation system. Soil type plays a role in selecting the appropriate irrigation method, with sandy soils requiring sprinkler or microirrigation, and clay soils being ideal for gravity irrigation. Soil surveys aid in designing irrigation systems. Labor-technology trade-off is a factor in choosing between pressure and gravity systems. Soil surveys help in designing irrigation systems by evaluating soil characteristics. The labor-technology trade-off between pressure and gravity systems is important when selecting an irrigation method. Gravity irrigation is labor-intensive but requires fewer technological inputs, while automated sprinkler and drip systems need technical knowledge and less labor. Water quality and quantity, including sediment-heavy water, can limit irrigation choices. Salinity and selenium concerns can be managed better with sprinkler or drip irrigation. The Clean Water Act addresses water quality concerns in various bodies of water, benefiting agriculture indirectly. State water rights laws largely determine the legal water availability for farmers. Political, legal, and societal factors related to water rights are not extensively discussed in this report. For more information, refer to CRS Report. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers for water resource management. Programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA offer funding and support for irrigation BMPs adoption. Assistance for irrigation BMPs adoption is provided through farm bill conservation programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA, which award funding or technical support to qualified agricultural producers implementing conservation practices. Between 2009 and 2014, $564 million out of $1.2 billion in funding went towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems. States in the West, particularly California and Texas, received the highest funding amounts, with some southeastern states also in the top 10 recipients. The funding for irrigation BMPs in the West is significant, with California and Texas receiving the most funding. Three southeastern states, including Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, are also among the top recipients. Groundwater depletion is a concern, with aquifers in the High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley being depleted at unsustainable rates. It is unclear if irrigation BMP funding is helping to reduce groundwater depletion or exacerbating the problem. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation BMPs. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) awards financial and technical assistance contracts for irrigation BMPs, including Conservation Activity Plans (CAPs) and Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG). The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) also provides funding for irrigation BMPs based on conservation performance. CSP funds traditional practices and precision technologies for irrigation. The USDA provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation BMPs through programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). CSP funds traditional practices and precision technologies for irrigation, while EQIP focuses on conservation performance. Additionally, the Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) program funds similar irrigation BMPs as EQIP but is limited to 16 states with low participation in the Federal Crop Insurance program. Technical assistance is provided by USDA for the adoption of irrigation technologies. The USDA provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation BMPs through programs like EQIP and CSP. Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) helps irrigators adopt conservation plans by offering technical assistance. CTA does not offer financial assistance but can be used to qualify for financial assistance programs. The USDA provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation BMPs through programs like EQIP and CSP. Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) offers technical assistance to farmers and groups supporting them, funded over $5.7 billion between 2003 and 2013. USDA provides information resources through ARS, ERS, and NIFA for improving irrigation management and policy studies on agriculture. Recent ARS irrigation studies focus on improving irrigation management, optimizing scheduling, and managing deficit irrigation. ERS conducts economic and policy studies on irrigation water use and conservation, while NIFA administers federal funding for agriculture-related research, including irrigation programs like AFRI Water for Agriculture Challenge Area and NWQP. National-level monitoring and reporting efforts for irrigation are limited. National-level monitoring and reporting efforts for irrigation are limited, with grant programs like AFRI Water for Agriculture Challenge Area and NWQP. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provide national data on irrigation water use, but comparisons are challenging due to differing methodologies. NASS conducts surveys of producers every five years to assess irrigated agriculture, while USGS assesses water use in the United States. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) conducts a national assessment of irrigated agriculture every five years. This assessment evaluates trends in water use categories, including irrigation practices like sprinkler systems. These practices qualify for funding from the NRCS EQIP program. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation spray water over crops for soil moisture. They also provide crop cooling, frost protection, and dust control. Other irrigation components include microirrigation, irrigation pipelines, pumping plants, and land leveling for efficiency. A pumping plant delivers water at a predefined pressure and flow rate for irrigation needs. Irrigation land leveling reshapes land to increase efficiency and prevent erosion. Water wells extract groundwater, with considerations for neighboring wells and environmental impacts. Structures for water control regulate flow rates and water levels. Irrigation reservoirs store water for agricultural use. Irrigation structures like flashboard risers, check dams, and water measurement devices are used to regulate water flow and levels. An irrigation reservoir is built to provide a reliable water supply for agriculture. Irrigation water management involves planning efficient irrigation schedules to manage soil moisture and promote plant growth. An irrigation system includes earthwork, pipelines, and water-control structures to convey water while reducing water loss and erosion. Irrigation System, Surface and Subsurface \u2014 Code 443 involves earthwork, pipelines, and water-control structures to convey water while reducing water loss, erosion, and energy use. Irrigation Ditch Lining \u2014 Code 428 is a lining made of impervious material to improve water conveyance, reduce water loss, and prevent erosion. Irrigation System, Tailwater Recovery \u2014 Code 447 captures irrigation runoff for reuse to conserve water. Dam, Diversion \u2014 Code 348 diverts surface water into irrigation canals. Irrigation Field Ditch \u2014 Code 388 conveys water from a primary source to irrigation areas. An irrigation water management plan (Code 118) aims to optimize crop yield, reduce water contamination, minimize soil erosion, manage soil salinity, and decrease energy use. Dryland farming (Code 134) is a method used in areas with limited precipitation and severe resource constraints. Transitioning from Irrigation to Dryland Farming and Ranching (Code 134) focuses on sustainable crop yield and water conservation in areas with limited precipitation and severe resource constraints. The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) offers funding for eligible irrigation practices. Regional Weather Networks (WQT07) track crop evapotranspiration for irrigation scheduling, while Irrigation System Automation (WQT01) adjusts water application rates based on field conditions. Irrigation System Automation (WQT01) uses GPS-guided technology to adjust water application rates based on field conditions like soil, topography, and crop type. Remote Monitoring Notification of Irrigation Pumping Plants (WQT05) wirelessly transfers real-time information to operators for maintenance prioritization. Decrease Irrigation Water Quantity or Conversion to Nonirrigated Crop Production (WQT08) requires reducing water use or switching to nonirrigated crops. The curr_chunk discusses various practices for conserving water and reducing energy use in irrigation systems, including reducing irrigation water quantity, using mulching for moisture conservation, high-level irrigation water management, and removing end gun sprinklers from center pivot systems. These practices aim to improve water efficiency and energy conservation in agricultural operations. The curr_chunk discusses enhancements for irrigation systems to improve water conservation and increase efficiency. This includes removing end gun sprinklers, converting to low energy precision application systems, optimizing hole sizes for poly-pipe, and implementing intermittent flooding of rice fields. The curr_chunk discusses techniques for water conservation and efficiency in agriculture, including computerized hole selection for poly-pipe in furrow irrigation, intermittent flooding of rice fields, and resource-conserving crop rotations. Improved Resource Conserving Crop Rotation \u2014 CCR98 is an enhancement to reduce erosion, improve soil fertility, interfere with pest cycles, and conserve soil moisture and water.
