    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Commission to Support Law Enforcement Act.\" Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that law enforcement officers face increasing challenges in the war against drugs and crime, with a rise in violent crime and drug use. The support from the Federal Government has not kept pace with these evolving problems, and a review is needed to address current issues highlighted by the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice in 1965. A review twenty-five years later is needed to evaluate current problems in law enforcement, including drug-related crime, violence, racial conflict, and decreased funding. A comprehensive study on law enforcement issues, such as the role of the Federal Government in supporting officers, working conditions, and responsibility for crime control, would help redefine relationships between the Federal Government, the public, and law enforcement officials. A national commission called the \"National Commission to Support Law Enforcement\" is established. The Commission's duties include evaluating current problems in law enforcement and studying issues like the role of the Federal Government in supporting officers and responsibility for crime control. The National Commission to Support Law Enforcement will study and recommend changes regarding law enforcement agencies and issues at all levels, including funding, employment conditions, information-sharing systems, research and training, equipment and resources, and cooperation among Federal, State, and local agencies. The National Commission to Support Law Enforcement will conduct surveys and consult with focus groups to gather information and advice on important law enforcement issues, including equipment, resources, cooperation among agencies, responsibility, and the impact of the criminal justice system.
