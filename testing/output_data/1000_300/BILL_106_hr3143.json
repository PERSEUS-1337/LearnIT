    "content": "The Act titled \"High Performance Schools Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of improving school performance. The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, more than on books and computers combined. Educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy, naturally lit environment. Over half of K-12 schools are over 40 years old and need renovation for efficiency and comfort. Inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures are common issues in school buildings. Over the next 10 years, 6,000 new schools will be needed to accommodate the growing number of students. Issues like inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures can affect students' ability to concentrate and excel. Inefficient water use is common in older schools. Designing new schools with a whole building approach can result in high-performance school buildings. Adoption of whole building concepts has shown positive results. Adopting a whole building approach in school construction can lead to high-performance buildings with improved student and teacher performance. It also results in lower life-cycle costs compared to conventionally designed buildings. Energy conservation measures can save a significant portion of current energy costs, allowing more resources for teachers and educational materials. Using renewable energy sources like daylighting and solar power further enhances the sustainability of school buildings. Using renewable energy sources like daylighting, passive solar heating, photovoltaics, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power in school buildings can significantly reduce energy costs, leaving more resources for teachers and educational materials. Implementing environmentally preferable products and ensuring adequate fresh air supply improves indoor air quality and promotes healthier school environments. However, many school districts lack the knowledge of cutting-edge design and technologies to incorporate optimal efficiency in new school construction or renovations. Congress is considering legislation to support school districts in building new schools and renovating existing ones. The legislation aims to assist school districts in creating high-performance, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly school buildings through cutting-edge design and technologies for new construction or renovations. The legislation aims to assist school districts in creating high-performance, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly school buildings through cutting-edge design and technologies for new construction or renovations. Program establishment and administration. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements beyond 30% of the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels. Grants aim to promote participation in the program and assist in implementing its purpose. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements exceeding 30% of the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels. Grants are awarded to districts with demonstrated need for responding to enrollment increases or facility renovations, lack adequate funds, and commit to developing high performance school buildings. Additionally, grants for administration are also available. The grants awarded under the High Performance Schools Program are to be used for developing high performance school buildings according to an approved plan. Grants for administration can also be used for evaluating compliance, distributing information, organizing programs, and promoting the concept of high performance school buildings. The High Performance Schools Program grants can be used for developing school buildings, organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and collecting data. Grants may also support promotional activities to encourage participation in high performance school projects. The High Performance Schools Program grants can be used for promotional and marketing activities, facilitating financing, promoting energy service companies, working with school administrations, students, and communities, and coordinating public benefit programs. Grants are provided to school districts with feasible plans approved by the State agency, which encourages districts to supplement grant funds with other sources. The State agency encourages qualifying school districts to supplement their High Performance Schools Program grants with funds from other sources for implementation of their approved plans. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. The State agency encourages school districts to supplement grants with other funds for approved plans. Funds appropriated for this Act will be provided to Governors of States to determine the agency administering assistance to school districts. Allocation of funds under section 5: 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain funds to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program. The Secretary of Education may retain up to $300,000 per year to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program for high performance school buildings. These funds can be used to develop reference materials defining principles and criteria for the program. SEC. 5. Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 3(b): $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, $210,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $220,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, and necessary sums for subsequent 6 fiscal years. SEC. 6. Definitions. The Act defines \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It also defines \"high performance school building\" as one that maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, uses environmentally friendly materials, and enhances indoor quality. The Act defines \"renewable energy\" as energy from solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass sources."
