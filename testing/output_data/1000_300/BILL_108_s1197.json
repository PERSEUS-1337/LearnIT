The Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003 outlines findings regarding the significant impact of medical imaging and radiation therapy on public health and safety in the United States. Over 300,000,000 such procedures are conducted annually, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing them each year. It emphasizes the need to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure by ensuring personnel have appropriate education and credentials. The Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003 emphasizes the importance of minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure in medical imaging and radiation therapy. It highlights the need for personnel to have appropriate education and credentials to ensure public health and safety. The Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003 emphasizes the importance of demonstrating competence through education, training, and experience. It states that both State and Federal Governments are responsible for protecting public health and safety in medical imaging and radiation therapy. Facilities engaging in these procedures impact interstate commerce, with patients crossing state lines for services and facilities purchasing supplies in an interstate market. In 1981, Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, setting Federal standards for accreditation and certification of individuals in medical imaging and radiation therapy. Despite this, 13 States do not require licensure for these professionals. Twenty-two years after the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, 13 States do not require licensure for medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals. 37 States regulate radiographers, 28 States license radiation therapists, 22 States license nuclear medicine technologists, 8 States license medical physicists, and no States regulate medical dosimetrists. The Act aims to ensure accreditation of education programs and licensure or certification of these professionals. The Act aims to ensure accreditation of education programs and licensure or certification of persons involved in medical imaging and radiation therapy to guarantee safety and accuracy. No States regulate medical dosimetrists. SEC. 3. QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION THERAPY. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to address the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, accreditation, and other requirements. Exemptions apply to physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Individuals must pass a national examination approved by the Secretary before performing or planning such imaging or therapy. The Secretary will certify organizations for accreditation of educational programs and examinations for individuals in medical imaging or radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards and requirements for certifying organizations or agencies to accredit educational programs and examinations in medical imaging or radiation therapy. Organizations must provide assurances of compliance with these standards to be certified. The Secretary will establish standards for certifying organizations to accredit educational programs and exams in medical imaging or radiation therapy. Approved bodies must comply with these standards, notify the Secretary of any changes, and provide required information. The Secretary can withdraw certification if the body fails to meet the standards. If the Secretary withdraws certification of an approved body, individual accreditation or exam completion remains valid for a reasonable period. State standards prior to new regulations are compliant unless deemed inadequate by the Secretary. The Secretary will periodically evaluate approved bodies' performance and include the results in reports to relevant committees. Within 18 months of enactment, the Secretary must ensure delivery and payment for services. The Secretary must promulgate regulations within 18 months to ensure medical imaging and radiation therapy programs comply with established standards. Alternative standards may apply for payment in rural areas determined by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board. The Secretary must promulgate regulations within 18 months to ensure compliance with established standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy payment in rural areas. Alternative standards may be developed for rural areas to guarantee access to quality medical imaging. In this section, regulations will be implemented by the Secretary to ensure compliance with standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy payment in rural areas. Definitions for terms like 'approved body', 'medical imaging', and 'perform' are provided. The regulations implemented by the Secretary ensure compliance with standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy payment in rural areas. The term 'perform' in medical imaging or radiation therapy refers to directly exposing a patient to radiation or a magnetic field and positioning them to receive the exposure. The term 'plan' involves preparing for the procedure by evaluating site-specific information and customizing the dose distribution. The performance of radiation therapy involves customizing the procedure for the patient based on site-specific information and dose distribution. Radiation therapy is defined as any procedure intended for disease treatment through radiation emission."
