Section 2 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act by adding a Coeur d'Alene Basin Management Conference. The Coeur d'Alene Basin Management Conference is established to develop a pollution prevention and restoration plan. The conference includes representatives from the EPA, Coeur d'Alene Indian tribe, and Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. Steering committees are appointed for management and technical advisory roles. The Management Conference appoints steering committees for advisory roles and includes ex officio members, such as the Member of the United States House of Representatives. A pollution prevention, control, and restoration plan must be published within one year. The Management Conference appoints steering committees for advisory roles and includes ex officio members. Within one year of enactment, a water pollution prevention, control, and restoration plan (referred to as the `Plan') for the Coeur d'Alene Basin must be published. The Plan clarifies duties of Federal and State agencies, suggests timetables for adoption, and outlines funding methods and schedules. The Plan must describe funding methods, incorporate environmental management concepts, and include a strategy for water pollution prevention in the Coeur d'Alene Basin. Public review and comment are required by the Administrator. The Administrator, in cooperation with the Management Conference, shall provide for public review and comment on the draft Plan for pollution prevention in the Coeur d'Alene Basin. The Plan will be approved if it meets the requirements and will be deemed an approved management program for water pollution prevention. Upon approval of the Plan, it will be considered an approved management program for water pollution prevention under section 319(h) and a comprehensive conservation and management plan under section 320 of the Act. Grants may be provided for the development of the Plan, including research. Grants under this subsection are for assisting development of the Plan, including research, surveys, studies, modeling, and technical work. The federal share of grants shall not exceed 70% of the development costs, with the condition that non-Federal sources provide the remaining share. The Administrator may establish terms and conditions for grant administration. The non-Federal share of costs for grants may be provided through in-kind services. The Administrator has the authority to set terms and conditions for grant administration. The term 'Coeur d'Alene Basin' refers to a specific watershed in northern Idaho. This section does not impact the jurisdiction or powers of any US department, agency, state, or entity related to the Coeur d'Alene Basin.

SEC. 4. RESTORATION PLAN. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management, will develop a restoration plan for public lands in the Coeur d'Alene Basin to reduce human and environmental risks by creating a geographical information system inventory of mining sites and contaminated areas. The plan includes developing an information system inventory of abandoned mining sites and contaminated areas, cleaning up these sites, restoring damaged natural resources, implementing stream restoration plans, and monitoring restored areas in the Basin. The plan involves rebuilding stream structures, placing wood debris and habitat rocks, stabilizing banks, and planting riparian vegetation in the Basin. It also includes monitoring restored areas, developing a land management plan with various stakeholders, and creating a geographical information system for cultural and ecological resources. The plan aims to address human health and environmental risks by developing a geographical information system for cultural and ecological resources, creating wildlife and fishery habitat management plans, and monitoring wildlife management areas for effectiveness. The plan includes developing cooperative wildlife management areas, monitoring wildlife management areas for effectiveness, creating an integrated public recreation management plan, and implementing a lake and river information program in the Basin. The Bureau of Land Management is authorized to carry out activities related to data collection, inventory of mining waste areas, resource information management, restoration activities, and design and maintenance of contaminated lands for minimizing health and natural resource risks in the Basin. The Bureau of Land Management is authorized to carry out activities related to restoring and managing mining contaminated lands to minimize health and natural resource risks. This includes designing, constructing, and maintaining restoration projects and management facilities, overseeing construction of repositories for mine waste, providing public information on lakes and rivers, developing long-term restoration plans, and managing restored public lands. Authorization of appropriations is provided to the Department of the Interior for these activities. The Bureau of Land Management is authorized to restore and manage mining contaminated lands to reduce health and environmental risks.
