    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tar Creek Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to the restoration project. The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, was a lead and zinc mining area from the early 1900s to the 1970s. Mining operations on Indian land required pumping water from the Boone Aquifer. The site is flood-prone and part of the Tri-State Mining District. Mining at the Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma on Indian land controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs was significant during World War I and World War II, accounting for a large portion of the nation's wartime lead and zinc consumption. The mining operations created millions of tons of waste tailings, known as chat, which were recommended to be stockpiled aboveground for later reprocessing. Congress also passed the Small Producers Lead and Zinc Mining Stabilization Act in 1960 to encourage production at the site. In 1979, acid mine water started discharging at the surface from various locations at the Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma. The Environmental Protection Agency began remediation work on the acid mine water in 1984 after the site was placed on the National Priorities List in 1983. In 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that it was impossible to remediate the acid mine water at the Tar Creek Superfund Site due to the presence of open mine shafts and stockpiled chat laced with toxic heavy metals like lead. The stockpiled chat at the Site is contaminated with heavy metals, including lead, contributing to flood problems in the area. It also recharges underground mine workings and has been used in construction, leaving residential areas polluted. The use of chat in construction has contaminated residential areas with heavy metals, including lead. The Environmental Protection Agency remediated yards with unsafe lead levels in 1994. Studies show elevated blood lead levels in children at the Site, causing health problems. Dust from stockpiled chat poses a health risk. Mining activities have led to repeated cave-ins at the Site. The stockpiled chat at the Site poses a danger to human health due to repeated cave-ins and subsidence dangers, with no remediation efforts by the US Government. The Site has not undergone comprehensive epidemiological studies and can never be made safe for human habitation. The curr_chunk states \"SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE.\" The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to residents in the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma. The EPA will continue to be responsible for the cleanup of the site and will collaborate with other agencies for a comprehensive resolution. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will collaborate with other agencies to seek a comprehensive resolution for the environmental and health problems at the Tar Creek Superfund site."
