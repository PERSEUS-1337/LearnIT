The Veterans Benefits Administration is responsible for processing veterans' compensation and pension claims accurately and timely. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy of claims processing, with new measurements showing lower accuracy rates than previously reported. Additionally, the Administration may face a significant loss of workforce due to retirement by 2003. The Veterans Benefits Administration faces challenges in accurately processing veterans' claims, with initial reviews being accurate only 64% of the time. There is a potential loss of up to 30% of its workforce to retirement by 2003, highlighting the need for adequate training for claims adjudicators. The Administration must take more aggressive steps to ensure timely and accurate processing of claims to avoid delays in providing compensation and pension benefits to veterans. The expected appeals processing time for a claim is 621 days, and as of September 2001, there was a backlog of 533,029 claims. SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF PROCESSING OF VETERANS BENEFITS CLAIMS.
