    "content": "The U.S. Navy's Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) aircraft has faced controversy and delays in determining its roles and requirements. Congressional members have proposed actions to move the program forward. A report details the history of UCLASS requirements development, based on open-domain information. Table 1 summarizes changes in requirements over time. In 1999, the Navy and DARPA began research on an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). The Navy's UCAV was designed for reconnaissance missions and identifying targets for manned aircraft attack waves. Northrop Grumman independently built a single X-47A air vehicle for testing. The UCAV program, initially focused on reconnaissance missions to identify targets for manned aircraft, led to the development of the X-47A air vehicle by Northrop Grumman. In 2003, the Navy and Air Force merged their efforts into the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program to demonstrate technical feasibility and military utility. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program was created in 2003 to demonstrate the feasibility and military value of networked high-performance unmanned air vehicles for various missions. However, the program was terminated in 2006, with the Air Force shifting focus to a new bomber and the Navy tasked with developing a longer-range carrier-based unmanned system. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review called for the termination of the J-UCAS program and the development of a new bomber by the Air Force. The Navy was mandated to develop the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) for operating from aircraft carriers with capabilities for persistent surveillance and strike in high-threat areas. The Navy initiated the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration (UCAS-D) program in 2006 to demonstrate technical feasibility. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in the UCAS-D program to demonstrate unmanned air combat systems' feasibility on aircraft carriers. Following UCAS-D, the Navy received approval to plan for the UCLASS acquisition program, focusing on turning lessons learned from N-UCAS into the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program. The Navy invested in the UCAS-D program to demonstrate unmanned air combat systems on aircraft carriers. This led to the development of the UCLASS program, aimed at addressing sea-based surveillance gaps and enhancing Navy operations in contested environments. The JROC approved the UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document, defining it as a carrier-based ISR and precision strike asset. In 2012, the JROC revisited the UCLASS requirement. The JROC revisited the UCLASS requirement in 2012, altering the requirements to heavily favor permissive airspace ISR capabilities due to budget constraints. The Navy emphasized affordability and adaptability in redefining the scope of the program. The Navy redefined the scope of the UCLASS program to prioritize affordability and adaptability, emphasizing the need for a platform supporting various missions. The JROC set an affordability KPP for the program, limiting the recurring fly-away cost of air vehicles to $150 million for one 600 nautical mile orbit. Funding for system development is limited, putting pressure on industry to deliver mature systems. The Navy established an affordability KPP for the UCLASS program, limiting the cost of air vehicles for one 600 nautical mile orbit to $150 million. Industry is pressured to provide mature systems due to limited funding. The draft RFP emphasized affordability, timely fielding, and endurance, with goals to provide two ISR orbits over uncontested airspace. The UCLASS program aims to provide two intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7 over uncontested airspace, with a light strike capability. The goal is to have an autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike in a contested environment, allowing for capability growth. The UCLASS program aims to provide autonomous aircraft capable of precision strike in contested environments, with extended range intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, tanking, and maritime domain awareness capabilities. Delays in procurement have been experienced due to changes in requirements and ongoing reviews of airborne surveillance systems and carrier air wing future. The Navy's UCLASS program schedule has been delayed due to capabilities coming into question. DOD is conducting a review of airborne surveillance systems and carrier air wing future, resulting in a 3-year delay in the air system contract award. Early operational capability is now expected in fiscal year 2022, a 2-year delay. Milestone A review is now scheduled for fiscal year 2017, also delayed by 3 years. The UCLASS program schedule has been delayed by around 3 years, with technology maturation efforts expected in fiscal year 2017. Further reviews and changes in DOD priorities may lead to evolving requirements."
