    "content": "Regulation is a fundamental government function, with federal agencies issuing thousands of rules annually on various topics. The costs of complying with these regulations are not included in the federal budget process. Some policymakers are interested in measuring total regulatory costs and benefits, as seen in the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Creation and Sunset and Review Act of 2011. This act would require an annual report on the costs and benefits of all existing federal regulations. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required by Congress to issue an annual report on the total costs and benefits of federal regulations. However, accurately measuring these costs and benefits is challenging due to various factors. Some doubt the possibility of obtaining an accurate measure. In 2010, the Small Business Administration (SBA) released a report questioning the accuracy of measuring total regulatory costs and benefits. The Small Business Administration (SBA) released a report in 2010 questioning the accuracy of measuring total regulatory costs and benefits. The report estimated federal regulatory costs in 2008 at $1.75 trillion, with previous estimates ranging from $416 billion to $1.1 trillion in different years. In 2001, W. Mark Crain and Hopkins estimated annual regulatory costs in 2000 at $843 billion. By 2005, Crain estimated costs in 2004 at $1.1 trillion. A $1.75 trillion estimate of regulatory costs has been widely cited, sparking calls for regulatory reform. Critics argue it overstates federal regulations' total cost. The report examines how Crain developed the $1.75 trillion estimate in 2008, comparing it to the $1.1 trillion estimate in 2004 and OMB's estimates for 2008. The $1.75 trillion estimate for 2008 regulatory costs by Crain and Crain includes economic regulations, environmental regulations, tax compliance, and regulations for safety and homeland security. Economic regulations make up over 70% of the total cost, affecting businesses' operations and products. The Crain and Crain report highlights the impact of economic regulations on businesses, both domestically and internationally. These regulations include quotas and tariffs on imports, limiting competition and raising prices. They used a Worldwide Governance Index to estimate the cost of economic regulations, measuring governments' ability to implement sound policies. The WGI regulatory quality index, developed by Aart Kraay, Massimo Mastruzzi, and Daniel Kaufmann, measures governments' ability to implement policies for private sector development. The index ranges from -2.5 to +2.5, with +2.5 representing minimal regulation. In 2008, the US scored +1.579. Crain and Crain analyzed the impact of regulatory quality on GDP per capita, considering variables like population and education. Crain and Crain analyzed the impact of the WGI regulatory quality index on real GDP per capita, finding that a one-unit change in the index represented a 9.4% change in GDP. They concluded that the 0.921 difference between the US score of +1.579 and the maximum of +2.5 resulted in an 8.7% reduction in GDP due to economic regulations. This analysis was based on variables like population and education. The WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States in 2008 was determined by aggregating expert-based measures and surveys, resulting in a reduction of real GDP per capita by about $1.236 trillion due to economic regulations. The Economist Intelligence Unit scored 0.70 based on 16 factors. The Economist Intelligence Unit scored 0.70 based on 16 factors, including protectionism, access to capital markets, corporate taxes, labor regulations, and ease of starting a business. Global Insight Business Conditions and Risk Indicators scored 0.94 based on tax effectiveness and legislation. Global Insight Business Conditions and Risk Indicators scored 0.94 based on tax effectiveness and legislation, while Global Risk Service scored 0.95 based on export and import regulations, business laws, and ownership restrictions. The Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom scored 0.73 based on export and import regulations. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative institute in Washington, scored 0.73 on the Index of Economic Freedom based on foreign investment and banking/finance. The Institutional Profiles Database, provided by the French government, scored 0.89 based on ease of starting a business, administered prices, competition, and market entry. Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide scored 1.00 based on expert judgment. Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide scored 1.00 based on experts' judgment of investment profile, summarizing the investment environment. The regulatory quality index was developed using surveys from the Institute for Management Development World Competitiveness Yearbook, scored at 0.50, based on business people's feedback on various factors affecting business conduct. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report, scored at 0.62, surveyed domestic and foreign-owned firms on factors like administrative regulations, tax system, import barriers, competition, ease of starting a company, and anti-monopoly policy. The report is based on business people's feedback on various aspects affecting business conduct. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report surveyed firms on administrative regulations, tax system, import barriers, competition, ease of starting a company, and anti-monopoly policy. Some observers question the accuracy of WGI indices, but authors have defended their methodology. The WGI indices were correlated with an index of economic regulations developed by the OECD. Crain and Crain used the WGI regulatory quality index in their study because it covered more countries for a longer period of time and used various sources. The WGI authors mentioned that the regulatory quality index is useful for broad cross-country comparisons but may not be specific enough for governance reforms in individual countries. Detailed and country-specific diagnostic data is needed for such reforms. The validity of Crain and Crain's estimate of the cost of economic regulations depends on the interpretation of the WGI index of \"regulatory quality\" and whether it can accurately measure the cost of regulations. Aart Kraay, a lead economist at the World Bank, raised concerns about the use of the regulatory quality index in specific country contexts for governance reforms. Aart Kraay, a lead economist at the World Bank, raised concerns about the interpretation of the WGI regulatory quality index by Crain and Crain in their report on regulatory costs. Kraay highlighted that the index measures perceptions of the regulatory environment's overall quality, not just stringency. Aart Kraay, a lead economist at the World Bank, disputed the interpretation of the WGI regulatory quality index by Crain and Crain. Kraay emphasized that the index measures perceptions of the regulatory environment's overall quality, not just its stringency. He also pointed out that the WGI indicators have margins of error, indicating imprecision in country rankings. Additionally, Kraay noted that comparing the United States' score to a specific value may be a misinterpretation of the units of the WGI. Aart Kraay, a lead economist at the World Bank, disputed the interpretation of the WGI regulatory quality index by Crain and Crain, highlighting the imprecision in country rankings due to margins of error. Kraay pointed out that comparing the United States' score to a specific value may be a misinterpretation of the units of the WGI. The WGI regulatory quality index may have imprecision in country rankings due to margins of error. A more relevant comparison would be between the US and Denmark, rather than a specific value like 2.5. Kraay noted that the WGI authors periodically revise data, explaining discrepancies in values cited. The WGI regulatory quality index may have imprecision in country rankings due to margins of error. Kraay explained discrepancies in values cited by the authors. Using 2008 data, Ireland had the highest regulatory quality index at +1.915, while the US had a value of +1.579. The difference between the two suggests a 3.16% reduction in GDP in the US compared to Ireland. The difference in regulatory quality indices between Ireland and the United States suggests a 3.16% reduction in GDP in the US compared to Ireland. This would result in a monetary cost of about $448 billion, which is less than previously calculated. Kraay raised concerns about the quality of the regression analysis by Crain and Crain, stating that higher scores on the regulatory quality index do not necessarily reflect less stringent regulations. Kraay expressed doubts about the quality of Crain and Crain's regression analysis, highlighting the challenge of isolating the impact of regulatory quality on GDP per capita from other influencing factors. Kraay suggested that the correlation between regulatory quality and GDP per capita may be influenced by various other policies and institutions. Crain and Crain acknowledged Kraay's concerns but emphasized that their analysis still captures the effects of regulation on economic output. Crain and Crain defended their regulatory quality index, stating that it reflects changes in the stringency of regulation in practice. They emphasized that the index captures stakeholders' perceptions of regulation and the impact on businesses, without comparing the US to other countries. Crain and Crain defended their regulatory quality index, stating that it reflects changes in the stringency of regulation in practice. They emphasized that the index captures stakeholders' perceptions of regulation and the impact on businesses. They did not compare the US to other countries to estimate the total cost of regulations. The SBA Office of Advocacy had the study peer reviewed by economists Bob Litan and Richard Williams, who provided positive feedback on the study. Richard Williams of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University expressed concerns about the study's estimate of the costs of economic regulations, questioning the accuracy of the Regulatory Quality Index and suggesting that it may overstate the costs of regulation. Richard Williams from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University raised concerns about the accuracy of the Regulatory Quality Index in estimating the costs of economic regulations. He suggested that the index might overestimate costs and recommended better explanation and control for other types of regulation to avoid overestimation. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized the study and called for the withdrawal of SBA's sponsorship. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized the Crain and Crain study for its flawed estimate of economic regulatory costs, highlighting issues with the lack of clear definitions, simplistic regression analysis, and misleading impressions of regulatory quality in the United States. The Crain and Crain report analyzed data for 25 OECD countries to assess the impact of economic regulation on GDP per capita. It is criticized for its simplistic regression analysis and misleading impression of regulatory quality in the United States, despite the US ranking 11th out of over 200 countries. Economists believe that a country's standard of living is influenced by various factors, including resources, labor, technology, and government interventions like taxes and regulations. Most economists believe that government interventions, such as taxes and regulations, can impact a country's standard of living. Crain and Crain used linear regression analysis to study the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index, considering factors like country population, foreign trade, education, and broadband subscribers. These control variables may not capture all factors affecting GDP per capita. The Crain and Crain report analyzed the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index using linear regression analysis. They considered factors like country population, foreign trade, education, and broadband subscribers. The control variables used may not capture all factors affecting GDP per capita, and the estimation strategy used was non-standard. The Crain and Crain report analyzed the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index using linear regression analysis. They included country-specific and year-specific control variables in their panel data set. However, they omitted statistically insignificant year-specific control variables from their reported results. The two-stage estimation strategy used by the authors has not been explored in peer-reviewed journals. Despite requests, the authors did not provide their data for further analysis. The Crain and Crain report analyzed the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index using linear regression analysis. Despite requests, the authors did not provide their data for further analysis. A sensitivity analysis by CRS using different data and methods showed that the regulatory quality index had no discernable independent effect on GDP per capita. This suggests that the analysis is highly sensitive to the choice of control variables and measures. Most economists believe that economic regulation can affect a country's standard of living, but these effects may be too subtle for a seven-year cross-country panel to detect due to the slow evolution of a country's regulatory environment. The Crain and Crain report analyzed the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index using linear regression analysis. They developed cost estimates for environmental regulations following OMB's approach. The effects of economic regulation on a country's standard of living may be subtle and require more focused empirical tools. In the first quarter of 2000, the authors used OMB's estimate of environmental costs from its 2001 report to Congress, converted into 2001 dollars. They then used estimates from subsequent OMB reports for environmental regulations issued from April 1999 through September 2001. By converting all cost estimates to 2009 dollars, they concluded that environmental regulations cost between $175 billion and $280 billion in 2009. The authors chose to use the $280 billion estimate for the cumulative cost of all regulations. The authors concluded that environmental regulations cost between $175 billion and $280 billion in 2009. They used the $280 billion estimate to develop the cumulative cost of all regulations, citing a lack of cost estimates for important environmental regulations. Crain and Crain utilized a mix of academic and agency estimates to calculate the costs of environmental rules, with a focus on major rules with significant economic impact issued between 1987 and 2008. The unit of analysis for the costs of major rules issued from April 1999 through September 2008 varies, with methodologies differing before and after 1988. OMB criticized the approach of summarizing total costs and benefits of regulations due to varying quality and methodology of studies. There is a concern about potential double counting in the time periods covered by cost estimates. The cost estimates of regulations analyzed by Crain and Crain may overlap in some years, leading to the possibility of double counting. In two one-year periods, there were discrepancies in recording environmental regulatory costs from OMB reports. The authors incorrectly recorded environmental regulatory costs from OMB reports, with discrepancies in two one-year periods. OMB's estimates differed from what was reported by the authors, who did not include OMB's estimates of regulatory benefits. The authors did not include OMB's estimates of regulatory benefits in their research on environmental rules. Table 1 shows that in most time periods, the estimated benefits exceeded the estimated costs. Crain and Crain assumed OMB's coverage of environmental regulations was comprehensive, with only one time period showing higher costs than benefits. Peer reviewer Richard Williams commented that the estimate of environmental regulatory costs should be noted as an assumption. Crain and Crain used OMB's upper estimate of environmental costs due to a belief that cost estimates were lacking for some regulations. They mentioned that government agencies tend to be conservative in estimating regulatory costs. Several regulatory experts have also noted similar conclusions about OMB's environmental cost estimates, although there is ongoing debate. Studies cited by Crain and Crain suggest that government agencies often overestimate benefits and underestimate costs, with some exceptions. Crain and Crain cited studies showing government agencies tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate costs. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized agencies for relying on industry estimates, which may inflate costs. CPR also questioned the accuracy of agency cost estimates, citing studies that found initial estimates to be too high. CPR criticized agencies for relying on industry estimates and questioned the accuracy of agency cost estimates, citing studies that found initial estimates to be too high. OMB noted the theory that agency estimates tend to understate costs and overstate benefits due to agency self-interest in regulation, but acknowledged limited documentation to support this view. OMB acknowledged the theory that agency estimates tend to understate costs and overstate benefits due to agency self-interest in regulation. Limited documentation is available to support this view, as regulated entities may overstate costs to influence decision makers. Competitive firms often find cost-effective ways to comply with regulations, and there is literature showing agencies tend to overestimate costs. The authors compiled data from the IRS and Tax Foundation to estimate the costs of complying with federal tax paperwork, finding that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent about 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork in 2008. The authors estimated that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork in 2008, costing about $159.6 billion. They used data from the IRS and Tax Foundation to arrive at these figures. The authors estimated that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork in 2008, costing about $159.6 billion. The government-wide paperwork burden in FY2008 was about 9.71 billion burden hours, with the Department of the Treasury accounting for about 7.78 billion burden hours. If the same ratios applied in 2008, IRS paperwork would have been about 7.5 billion burden hours\u2014about 3.2 billion hours higher than in the Crain and Crain report. The Crain and Crain report estimated that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork in 2008, costing about $159.6 billion. The IRS paperwork burden would have been about 7.5 billion burden hours, 3.2 billion hours higher than in the Crain and Crain report. Certain aspects of how Crain and Crain monetized IRS burden hours are unclear, such as assumptions about who completes tax paperwork and where hourly rates were derived. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, tax preparers earned an average salary of $17.34 per hour in May 2009. The total cost of tax compliance, including benefits and overhead, could be around $23 per hour. Multiplying 7.5 billion burden hours by $23 per hour gives a total cost of about $172.5 billion. OMB does not include tax paperwork in its annual reports on regulatory costs. The OMB does not include tax paperwork in its annual reports on regulatory costs, as filling out tax forms is considered a result of the tax code itself. The IRS paperwork burden is mainly driven by the complexities of the Tax Code to ensure taxpayer compliance. The IRS paperwork burden is primarily driven by the complexities of the Tax Code, which requires the collection of a significant amount of information to ensure taxpayer compliance. The continuous revisions to the Tax Code, with 84 tax laws passed in the 15 years following the 1986 overhaul, have increased reporting and recordkeeping requirements, adding to taxpayer burden. Additionally, changes made to the 1040 schedules to implement the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 further increased the burden on taxpayers by 47 million hours. Other factors, such as economic and population growth, also contribute to the increasing number of tax filings. The Tax Code complexities and continuous revisions have increased the IRS paperwork burden. The 2001 Tax Relief Act added 47 million hours to taxpayer burden. Factors like economic and population growth also contribute to the rising number of tax filings. The regulatory costs mentioned focus on workplace safety and health regulations, primarily from OSHA and homeland security. The estimated cost of these regulations prior to 2001 was over $64.3 billion in 2009 dollars. The authors estimated the total cost of occupational safety and health regulations and homeland security regulations in 2008 to be about $75.2 billion. This included costs from 2001 to 2008 for occupational safety and health regulations, as well as all homeland security costs through 2008. The authors estimated the total cost of occupational safety and health regulations and homeland security regulations in 2008 to be about $75.2 billion, including costs from 2001 to 2008 for occupational safety and health regulations. The estimate was obtained from OMB's 2009 report to Congress, with costs associated with four rules estimated at between $362 million and $389 million in 2001 dollars. The authors estimated the total cost of homeland security regulations in 2008 to be about $75.2 billion, including costs from 2001 to 2008. They obtained the estimate from OMB's 2009 report, with costs for four rules estimated at $362 million to $389 million in 2001 dollars. Crain and Crain used the upper end of OMB's estimated cost range for these regulations. Since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, 17 major homeland security regulations have been finalized, imposing an annual cost on the economy ranging from $4.2 billion to $8.6 billion. Converting these costs to 2009 dollars yields a range of $5.1 billion to $10.4 billion. The authors of a report used the upper end of cost estimates, citing a lack of cost estimates for important regulations. However, OMB has stated that agencies' cost estimates are not overly conservative. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized the overestimation of compliance costs in regulatory estimates, particularly in occupational safety and health costs. They pointed out that the Johnson study inflated OSHA's original cost estimates by 5.5 times, including fines for violations as regulatory costs. CPR argued that this approach of counting fines as regulatory costs enables opponents to argue for less regulation based on increased costs due to lawbreaking. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized the overestimation of compliance costs in regulatory estimates, particularly in occupational safety and health costs. They argued that counting fines for violations as regulatory costs inflates the estimates, enabling opponents to push for less regulation based on increased costs due to lawbreaking. W. Mark Crain estimated total federal regulatory costs in 2004 at about $1.11 trillion, increasing to about $1.75 trillion in 2008, with a significant portion attributed to a change in methodology for estimating economic regulations. The increase in total estimated cost of federal regulations between 2004 and 2008 was mainly due to a change in methodology for estimating economic regulations. Congress has required OMB to submit annual reports on the costs and benefits of federal regulations for nearly 15 years. Since 1997, Congress has mandated OMB to report on the costs and benefits of federal regulations annually. In 2001, the Regulatory Right-to-Know Act made this requirement permanent, specifying that OMB must provide estimates of total costs and benefits of federal rules and paperwork in the President's budget, categorized by agency, program, and major rule. The OMB is required to report on the costs and benefits of federal regulations annually, including quantifiable and nonquantifiable effects. Estimates of total regulatory costs and benefits have varied over the years, with substantial differences in benefits estimates. In 1997, OMB estimated federal regulatory costs at $279 billion and benefits at $298 billion. In 1998, costs were estimated between $170 billion and $230 billion, with benefits between $260 billion and $3.5 trillion. In 1997, OMB estimated federal regulatory costs at $279 billion and benefits at $298 billion. In 1998, costs were estimated between $170 billion and $230 billion, with benefits between $260 billion and $3.5 trillion. The dramatic increase in benefits was mainly due to including an EPA estimate for the Clean Air Act, which raised serious questions. In 2000 and 2001, OMB estimated social regulation costs between $146 billion and $229 billion, with benefits between $254 billion and nearly $1.8 trillion. The drop in upper-bound benefits was primarily caused by a decrease in the EPA estimate. The cost of social regulations in 1996 was estimated between $146 billion and $229 billion, with benefits ranging from $254 billion to nearly $1.8 trillion. The drop in upper-bound benefits was mainly due to a decrease in the EPA's estimate for the Clean Air Act. OMB highlighted the challenges in accurately estimating the total costs and benefits of federal regulations. The OMB highlighted methodological problems in estimating the total costs and benefits of federal regulations, including unclear baselines, standard business practices, difficulty in attribution, and technological changes affecting accuracy of estimates. The difficulty in attributing costs and benefits to federal regulations compared to other regulatory systems is highlighted. The accuracy of estimates is affected by technological changes, and aggregating results from different studies is problematic due to varying methodologies. OMB excluded \"transfer\" rules and costs associated with tax paperwork in estimating total regulatory costs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) excluded costs associated with tax paperwork and rules published after 1987 without cost-benefit analyses in estimating total regulatory costs. OMB's reports since 2001 focus on regulations with costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually. OMB has provided cost and benefit estimates for regulations meeting specific criteria, such as those with costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually. The total costs of rules reviewed ranged from $37 to $53 billion, with benefits ranging from $48 to $101 billion. In its 2003 report, OMB estimated costs and benefits of regulations meeting specific criteria from October 1992 to September 2002. Total costs ranged from $37 to $43 billion, with benefits ranging from $146 to $230 billion. EPA rules accounted for a significant portion of the benefits. Each report since 2003 has provided data on rules from the previous 10 years. OMB's decision to focus on specific rules within a limited timeframe was due to outdated studies used for aggregate estimates. The OMB's decision to focus on specific rules within a limited timeframe was driven by the inconsistent and aged nature of studies used for aggregate estimates. OMB stated that estimates for regulations issued over ten years ago are unreliable for informing current policy decisions. Therefore, they chose not to reproduce aggregate estimates in the draft report. The total costs and benefits of federal rules in effect were estimated to be significantly larger than previously reported. John D. Graham further emphasized the questionable relevance of estimates prepared for rules adopted prior to the 10-year period. In 2003, OMB highlighted the unreliability of estimates for regulations issued over ten years ago. John D. Graham emphasized the questionable relevance of past estimates, such as the Crain and Hopkins estimate of $843 billion, stating they are not accurate enough for regulatory accounting. The estimate is seen as a rough indicator of regulatory activity's overall impact on the macro economy. The estimate of the overall impact of regulatory activity on the macro economy, produced in 2001 under contract for the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, is based on previous estimates dating back to the 1970s. These estimates, mainly done by academics using various techniques, may no longer be accurate or appropriate due to changes over the years. The cost estimates combine different types of regulations, some imposing real costs and others causing income transfers. The cost estimates for regulatory activity combine various types of regulations, some imposing real costs and others causing income transfers. Information by agency and program is limited, with nonexistent benefit information. Many studies relied upon for these estimates lack transparency, making reproducibility difficult. As a result, recent Reports to Congress focus on reporting costs and benefits of major regulations prepared by agencies and reviewed by OMB over the last decade. OMB's 2009 report to Congress provided estimates of the total annual benefits and costs of 98 regulations reviewed over a 10-year period. These regulations were those estimated to generate benefits or costs of approximately $100 million in any one year, with a substantial portion of the benefits and costs quantified and monetized. The 2009 OMB report to Congress estimated the costs and benefits of 98 regulations from January 1, 1998, to September 30, 2008. The estimated costs ranged from $51 billion to $60 billion, while benefits were between $126 billion and $663 billion. OMB noted that these estimates were not a complete account of all regulations during that period. The 2009 OMB report estimated costs and benefits of regulations from 1998 to 2008, but it was not a complete account. OMB stated that aggregating benefit and cost estimates of regulations provides insight, but the resulting estimates are not precise or complete due to varying assumptions and methods used in regulatory impact analyses. Comparing OMB's estimates with Crain and Crain's estimates is difficult because they were constructed differently. Comparing OMB's and Crain and Crain's estimates of regulatory costs is challenging due to different methodologies and presentation categories. Crain and Crain's estimates for 2008 were higher as they included costs of all rules, while OMB's estimates only included major rules over a 10-year period. Additionally, Crain and Crain included costs of \"economic regulations,\" which OMB did not. The OMB's estimates of regulatory costs only included major rules issued over a 10-year period, while Crain and Crain's estimates for 2008 were higher as they included costs of all rules, including \"economic regulations\" and tax paperwork. Decision makers should be cautious when using studies of aggregate regulatory costs and benefits for public policy, considering the conceptual and methodological differences in these estimates. The validity and reliability of Crain and Crain's $1.75 trillion estimate of total federal regulatory costs in 2008 depend on the individual elements used. The estimate heavily relies on the WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States, which may have been misinterpreted by the authors. Comparing the US regulatory quality index to a country like Ireland would have reduced Crain and Crain's estimate. The United States' regulatory quality index in 2008 was compared to Ireland, which significantly reduced Crain and Crain's estimate of economic regulatory costs. Concerns were raised about the index's accuracy in measuring costs and the regression analysis used. Crain and Crain defended their use of the index, stating it reflects a country's economic regulations' stringency. The regulatory quality index is used to measure a country's economic regulations' stringency. The World Bank cautions that this index may not be precise for specific governance reforms. Crain and Crain's estimates for various regulations were based on a mix of old academic studies and outdated agency cost estimates. The method of combining different studies to calculate regulatory costs has been criticized by the OMB. OMB has criticized the method used by Crain and Crain to estimate regulatory costs, stating that combining diverse sets of individual studies is flawed. Crain and Crain only used the highest cost estimates from OMB reports, believing government agencies underestimate regulatory costs. OMB disputes this view, citing a lack of documentation and unresolved issues in empirical studies of agencies' regulatory cost estimates. OMB has criticized the method used by Crain and Crain to estimate regulatory costs, stating that combining diverse sets of individual studies is flawed. They believe government agencies tend to be conservative in estimating regulatory costs. OMB has concluded that estimates of costs and benefits of regulations issued more than 10 years earlier are of \"questionable relevance.\" Their annual reports to Congress on major rules only include information from the previous 10 years, as older estimates are deemed unreliable for informing policy decisions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) criticizes older estimates of regulatory costs as unreliable for policy decisions. OMB notes that incremental costs of regulations tend to decrease over time as businesses adapt. Safety features in automobiles and environmentally responsible behavior have become standard due to consumer demand and business practices. This \"rising baseline\" phenomenon benefits the bottom line. Automobile companies and businesses are concerned about product liability and environmental regulations. Environmentally responsible behavior is now beneficial for the bottom line. OMB criticizes older estimates of regulatory costs as unreliable, stating that compliance costs would likely not be significantly reduced if regulations were to disappear overnight. Crain and Crain estimated the cost of tax paperwork based on data from the IRS and the Tax Foundation, but OMB's data suggests the number of hours may be higher. Their assumptions on the cost per hour may also be too high. OMB does not include tax paperwork in its reports on regulatory costs. The authors Crain and Crain did not include tax paperwork in their study on regulatory costs, despite OMB's data suggesting higher hours and potentially lower costs per hour. They focused solely on costs, not benefits, as required by the SBA Office of Advocacy. The authors Crain and Crain did not include regulatory benefits in their study as required by the SBA Office of Advocacy. Executive Order 12866 mandates assessing both costs and benefits of regulations to justify their implementation. OMB reports generally show that benefits exceed costs. OMB reports to Congress indicate that regulatory approaches should maximize net benefits. The estimated benefits of federal regulations generally exceed the costs, as shown in reports covering major rules from 1999 to 2010. For example, in 2010, aggregate costs were $43-55 billion, while benefits were $128-616 billion. In FY2009, costs for major rules were $3.7-9.5 billion, with benefits at $8.6-28.9 billion. In the draft report for 2011, the costs and benefits of major rules reviewed by OMB were estimated. The aggregate costs ranged from $44 billion to $62 billion, while the aggregate benefits ranged from $136 billion to $651 billion. In FY2010, costs for 18 major rules were estimated between $6.5 billion and $12.5 billion, with benefits estimated between $23.3 billion and $82.3 billion. Some rules only quantified or monetized costs or benefits, not both. Each year, agencies quantify or monetize benefits or costs of rules, but not both. Crain and Crain's estimate of $1.75 trillion in federal regulations costs in 2008 has been cited for regulatory reform. However, they clarify that their report is not a decision-making tool for lawmakers. Information on regulatory costs alone provides only one piece of information for policymakers. As Crain and Crain suggest, information on regulatory costs alone provides only one piece of information for policymakers to consider when determining how to proceed with regulations. If the monetized benefits of regulations exceed the costs, policymakers may deem the costs justified. Conversely, if benefits are less than costs, policymakers may need to assess non-monetized costs and benefits before making a valid policy decision. After considering information on both costs and benefits, policymakers may need to assess non-monetized costs and benefits before making a valid policy decision. In an effort to assess the sensitivity of Crain and Crain's results, CRS ran a linear regression using data from 30 OECD countries over the period 2002-2008. The study by Crain and Crain analyzed the impact of various independent variables on GDP per capita. They used data from OECD website and found a negative coefficient for primary school enrollment. CRS added two demographic variables to account for this effect: proportion of population under 14 and over 65. In the CRS analysis, demographic effects were accounted for by adding variables based on population age groups. The study used data from the U.S. Census Bureau international population statistics and ran a regression analysis using Stata 11 xtreg procedure. The estimated coefficient on the World Governance Indicators regulatory quality was a key focus. The estimation output in Table A-1 shows that the coefficient on the World Governance Indicators regulatory quality index is very small and not significantly different from zero. The coefficient on population is also statistically insignificant, while other coefficients have expected signs and are statistically significant. Shifting the US regulatory quality index value to Ireland's level could result in a $2.14 increase in per capita GDP. The shift from the 2008 regulatory quality index value to Ireland's level could potentially increase per capita GDP by $2.14. However, the imprecise estimate of the effect of the regulatory quality index makes this calculation uncertain. The high intercountry correlation suggests that estimating the effects of variables like regulatory environment in economically advanced countries using panel estimation methods may be challenging. Estimating the effects of variables like regulatory environment in economically advanced countries using panel estimation methods may be challenging due to high intercountry correlation. Other econometric approaches focusing on specific changes in regulatory environment may be more effective in understanding the effects of regulation on economic activity."
