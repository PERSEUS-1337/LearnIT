The Private Security Officer Quality Assurance Act of 1997 acknowledges the rapid growth of private security officers in the US, their role in crime prevention, and the opportunities they provide for job seekers.

The growth of private security services has outpaced the number of public sector law enforcement officers, leading to increased contact with private security personnel. Despite differences in duties, the public struggles to differentiate between private security and sworn law enforcement officers. The demand for qualified and well-trained private security personnel is high. The American public demands well-trained private security personnel as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, sworn law enforcement officers. Private security officers should undergo thorough screening, especially since many carry weapons. SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS.
