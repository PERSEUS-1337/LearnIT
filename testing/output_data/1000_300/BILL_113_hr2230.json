    "content": "The \"Track It to Prevent It Act\" includes provisions for improved climate assessments, tracking of results, service-wide assessments, health welfare inspections, and reviews of security and diversity management in the military. Congress found an increase in reported sexual assault cases in the Armed Forces in fiscal year 2012, with a significant rise in anonymous reports. Female members experienced unwanted sexual contact, with a majority also facing sexual harassment, while male members also reported similar experiences. In fiscal year 2012, 1.2 percent of male Armed Forces members experienced unwanted sexual contact, with 52 percent also facing sexual harassment. Sixty-two percent of those who experienced unwanted sexual contact perceived some form of retaliation. Commanders must comply with climate assessments to create a safe environment. Improved performance assessments and reporting are needed to identify trends in harmful behavior like sexual harassment and assault. Improved performance assessments and better reporting by commanders at all levels are necessary to identify trends in harmful behavior like sexual harassment and assault. Members often choose not to report incidents due to fear of inaction or negative impact on their military career. Commanders condoning or ignoring sexual misconduct perpetuates this behavior in the military, hindering cultural change. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"sexual harassment\" is defined in Department of Defense Directive 1350.2, and \"sexual assault\" refers to offenses described in section 920 of title 10, United States Code. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that command climate assessment results are shared with relevant commanders and higher levels of command. Each military department must include a designated form in performance evaluations for senior commanders to indicate if required climate assessments were conducted. Failure to conduct assessments will be noted in evaluations and considered during promotion considerations. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense will develop a tracking system to monitor commanders' compliance with conducting climate assessments. Unit commanders, in collaboration with the Inspector General, will compile climate assessments and create compliance reports detailing concerns, perceptions of leadership, and strategic plans for addressing issues. The Secretary of Defense mandates the inclusion of reprimands, counseling statements, and actions related to sexual harassment or assault in performance evaluations to increase visibility, identify trends of misconduct early, and prevent the transfer of offenders. Additionally, there will be service-wide 360 assessments implemented. SEC. 6. SERVICE-WIDE 360 ASSESSMENTS. The Secretary of each military department will adopt a 360-degree assessment program modeled after the Department of the Army's MSAF Program. A report on the feasibility of including the 360-degree approach in performance evaluations will be submitted to Congress. Individual counseling will be part of the performance evaluation process. SEC. 7. HEALTH WELFARE INSPECTIONS. The Secretary of each military department conducts monthly health welfare inspections to maintain security, military readiness, and discipline. Results are shared with commanders. SEC. 8. REVIEW OF SECURITY OF MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, INCLUDING BARRACKS AND MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENCES. The Secretary of Defense will review security measures on military installations, focusing on barracks and multi-family residences to ensure the safety of Armed Forces members and their dependents. This includes identifying security gaps and evaluating the use of 24-hour electronic monitoring or security personnel at entry points. Results must be submitted within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Defense will submit a report to Congress within 90 days, detailing the costs to address security gaps in barracks and multi-family residences on military installations, including implementing 24-hour security monitoring. The Secretary of Defense will conduct a review of the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity to evaluate resource gaps, the role in sexual harassment cases, and collaboration with the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal year 2014 to carry out this review."
