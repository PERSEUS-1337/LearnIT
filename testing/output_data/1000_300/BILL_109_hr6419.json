SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the threat of terrorists acquiring and using a nuclear weapon is urgent and poses a significant risk to national and global security. Efforts to secure nuclear stockpiles and prevent nuclear terrorism have made progress, but additional measures are necessary to further reduce this threat. The White House's 2006 National Strategy for Combating Terrorism emphasizes the grave danger of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists, while the United Nations Secretary-General has warned of the catastrophic impact of a nuclear terror attack. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan emphasizes the catastrophic impact of a nuclear terror attack, stating it would cause widespread death, economic devastation, and push millions into poverty. UN Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) directs countries to adopt laws prohibiting non-state actors from acquiring and using nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency warns of the urgent need to prevent terrorist attacks using nuclear weapons. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency emphasizes the importance of preventing nuclear terrorism. The sense of Congress is that the threat of nuclear terror is the most horrific the US faces. A comprehensive approach is needed to reduce this danger, including efforts to eliminate terrorist groups seeking nuclear weapons, secure nuclear weapons worldwide, and prevent terrorist efforts to manufacture or transport nuclear explosives. High priority must be placed on ensuring the security of all nuclear weapons and materials. The comprehensive strategy to prevent nuclear terrorism includes securing all nuclear weapons and materials worldwide, prioritizing the prevention of a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States, and accelerating programs to combat nuclear smuggling and secure special nuclear material. The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a vital role in coordinating international efforts to protect nuclear materials. The International Atomic Energy Agency coordinates global efforts to protect nuclear materials and combat nuclear smuggling. Legislation by Senators Lugar, Domenici, and Nunn has led to programs preventing nuclear weapons from falling into terrorist hands. The National Security Act of 1947 is amended to include a new section for a senior advisor to the president for the prevention of nuclear terrorism. This role aims to coordinate global efforts to protect nuclear materials and combat nuclear smuggling, building on existing legislation to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into terrorist hands. The National Security Act of 1947 is amended to include a Senior Advisor to the President for the Prevention of Nuclear Terrorism. The advisor is appointed by the President with Senate approval and is responsible for advising on nuclear terrorism matters, formulating prevention policies, and developing plans to prevent nuclear terrorism. The Senior Advisor to the President for the Prevention of Nuclear Terrorism is responsible for finding and fixing gaps in existing programs, overseeing program implementation and budget requests, and identifying new initiatives to prevent nuclear terrorism. They also coordinate United States efforts to implement these policies. The Senior Advisor to the President for the Prevention of Nuclear Terrorism appoints necessary personnel, coordinates US efforts, and is a member of the National Security Council. \"Sec. 101B. Senior Advisor to the President for the Prevention of Nuclear Terrorism. SEC. 6. ANNUAL REPORT.\" The President must submit an annual report to Congress on the security of strategic special nuclear material, including a program for removal and security of nuclear weapons and materials worldwide. The President must submit an annual report to Congress on the security of strategic special nuclear material, including a program for removal and security of nuclear weapons and materials worldwide. This includes a survey of facilities worldwide containing nuclear weapons, special nuclear material, and radiological materials, a list of high-priority sites for removal or security measures, and a comprehensive plan involving technical and diplomatic efforts.

SEC. 7 outlines the minimum security standard for nuclear weapons and strategic special nuclear materials. The United States policy is to ensure the security and accountability of all nuclear weapons and special nuclear materials. In line with international standards, the President will work towards a global agreement on nuclear security to effectively protect these materials. The United States aims to establish a global standard for nuclear security that effectively protects nuclear weapons and special nuclear materials from terrorists and criminals. This agreement should consider equipment and human limitations, be verifiable, and involve international efforts to convince all countries with such materials to comply. The United States aims to work with other countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure that all countries with nuclear weapons or special nuclear materials upgrade their security to meet global standards. Financial and technical assistance will be provided to accelerate security upgrades, and effective nuclear security rules will be promoted through international cooperation.
