    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Existing law requires landlords to provide written notification to tenants before applying pesticides in certain ways without a licensed pest control operator. The bill aims to ensure that owners and tenants in common interest developments are notified in writing before pesticides are applied by the homeowner association or its agents, similar to the notification required if applied by a licensed pest control operator.Adjacent separate interests are defined as those directly beside, above, or below a specific separate interest or common area. Section 4777 of the Civil Code defines terms related to pesticide application in common interest developments, including \"adjacent separate interest,\" \"authorized agent,\" \"broadcast application,\" \"electronic delivery,\" \"licensed pest control operator,\" and \"pest.\" A licensed pest control operator is someone authorized by the state to apply pesticides. A pest is a living organism that causes damage or transmits diseases. A pesticide is any substance used to control pests, excluding certain types defined by federal law. (7) \u201cPesticide\u201d is a substance used to control pests, excluding certain types defined by federal law. An association must provide written notice to affected owners and tenants when applying pesticides without a licensed pest control operator, including information on the pests to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used. State law requires that you be given information on the pest to be controlled and the pesticide product proposed for use. CAUTION \u2013 Pesticides are toxic chemicals. Certain pesticides can be used without a license if proper conditions are followed. Risk depends on exposure, so minimize exposure. If experiencing symptoms after pesticide application, contact a physician or the California Poison Control System. For more information, contact the County Health Department for health questions or the Department of Pesticide Regulation for regulatory information. Prior to pesticide application, the association must provide notice to owners and tenants at least 48 hours in advance. The notification should include the approximate date, time, and frequency of the application, with a disclaimer that these details are subject to change.

Notice to tenants of separate interests can be provided through first-class mail, personal delivery to tenants 18 years or older, or electronic delivery if an electronic mailing address is provided. Upon receipt of written notification, the owner or tenant can agree to immediate pesticide application. The association or authorized agent may agree to immediate pesticide application orally if requested before the 48-hour notice period.
