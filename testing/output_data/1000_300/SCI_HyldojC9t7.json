It utilizes random features to build a kernel specified by the distance measure, improving generalizability over universal Nearest-Neighbor estimates. The D2KE methodology proposes using random objects to create feature embeddings for each instance, showing better generalizability than universal Nearest-Neighbor estimates. It subsumes the representative-set method and relates to the distance substitution kernel, while also extending Random Features methods to handle complex structured inputs. Our proposed framework excels in classification experiments across various domains like time series, strings, and histograms for texts and images. It outperforms existing distance-based learning methods in testing accuracy and computational time. It is often easier to specify dissimilarity functions for structured inputs like real-valued time series or discrete structures such as strings, histograms, and graphs, rather than constructing feature representations. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of applying distance-based methods to structured inputs with varying sizes and the limitations of Nearest-Neighbor Estimation (NNE) due to high variance when neighbors are far apart. This contrasts with the prev_chunk, which highlights the success of a proposed framework in classification experiments across different domains like time series, strings, and histograms. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of using nearest neighbors for prediction due to high variance when neighbors are far apart. Research has focused on global distance-based machine learning methods to address this issue, drawing connections to kernel methods. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of using similarity matrices in machine learning methods, focusing on the issue of non-positive definite kernels. Various approaches have been proposed to estimate a positive-definite Gram matrix that approximates the similarity matrix while preserving information. The challenges of using similarity matrices in machine learning methods include issues with non-positive definite kernels. Approaches such as clipping, flipping, or shifting eigenvalues of the similarity matrix, or learning a PD approximation, may lead to a loss of information. Another common approach involves selecting a subset of training samples as a representative set, but this can be outperformed by a more general framework that offers a richer family of kernels. In this paper, a novel general framework called D2KE is proposed to construct a family of positive definite kernels from a dissimilarity measure on structured inputs. This approach draws from Random Features literature but builds novel kernels specifically designed for a given distance measure. The kernels ensure Lipschitz-continuity with respect to the distance measure in the corresponding Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). The D2KE framework introduces a novel feature map tailored for a distance measure, ensuring Lipschitz-continuity in the RKHS. It offers a tractable estimator with improved generalization compared to nearest-neighbor methods. The framework provides a feature embedding for each instance, enhancing classification and regression models' performance across various domains. In classification experiments, it outperforms existing distance-based learning methods in accuracy and computational efficiency, especially with large datasets or structured inputs. The proposed methodology constructs a family of PD kernels via Random Features from a given distance measure for structured inputs, improving testing accuracy and computational time. It generalizes Random Features methods to complex structured inputs, accelerating kernel machines across various domains such as time-series, strings, and histograms. This study introduces a novel approach using Random Features to accelerate kernel machines on structured inputs like time-series, strings, and histograms. Existing methods for Distance-Based Kernel Learning have limitations, but this new method aims to improve testing accuracy and computational efficiency. The text discusses various dissimilarity measures and approaches for building positive-definite kernels on structured inputs like text and time-series. It also mentions a theoretical foundation for an SVM solver in Krein spaces and the use of Euclidean embedding to approximate dissimilarity matrices. Approaches for building positive-definite kernels on structured inputs like text and time-series involve modifying distance functions to kernels. Randomized feature maps are used to approximate non-linear kernel machines, reducing training and testing times for kernel-based learning algorithms. Various explicit nonlinear random feature maps have been constructed for different types of kernels. Random Fourier Features (RFF) method and its variants accelerate Gaussian Kernel function approximation for kernel-based learning algorithms, using structured matrices for faster computation and less memory consumption. D2KE is a method that takes structured inputs of different sizes and computes the Random Fourier Features (RF) with a structured distance metric. Unlike existing RF methods, D2KE constructs a new PD kernel through a random feature map, making it computationally feasible via RF. The differences between D2KE and existing RF methods are listed in table 1. D2KE constructs a new PD kernel through a random feature map, making it computationally feasible via RF. A recent work developed a kernel for computing embeddings of single-variable time-series but cannot be applied to discrete structured inputs. In contrast, we offer a unified framework for various structured inputs and provide a theoretical analysis regarding KNN and other distance-based kernel methods for estimating a target function from samples. The text discusses the estimation of a target function from samples using dissimilarity measures between input objects instead of feature representations. It emphasizes the importance of a metric dissimilarity measure for the learning task. The text emphasizes the importance of a metric dissimilarity measure for estimating a target function from samples. It discusses the properties that an ideal feature representation and dissimilarity measure should possess for effective learning. The text discusses the importance of a metric dissimilarity measure for estimating a target function from samples and defines Lipschitz Continuity and covering number N(\u03b4; X, d) to measure the size of the space implied by a given dissimilarity measure. It also explores how these quantities affect the estimation error of a Nearest-Neighbor Estimator. The text discusses the effective dimension in structured input spaces with a distance measure, extending the analysis of k-nearest-neighbor estimation error. It provides an example of effective dimension in the context of measuring Multisets using the modified Hausdorff Distance. The text introduces the concept of effective dimension in structured input spaces with a distance measure, extending the analysis of k-nearest-neighbor estimation error. It discusses the modified Hausdorff Distance for measuring Multisets and provides a bound on the estimation error of the k-Nearest-Neighbor estimate of a target function. The text introduces an estimator based on a RKHS derived from a distance measure, with improved sample complexity for higher effective dimension problems. It aims to convert a distance measure into a positive definite kernel, addressing the challenge of estimation error scaling with the number of samples exponentially in the effective dimension. The text introduces an estimator based on a RKHS derived from a distance measure, with improved sample complexity for higher effective dimension problems. It aims to convert a distance measure into a positive definite kernel using a simple but effective approach called D2KE. This approach constructs a family of positive-definite kernels from a given distance measure by parameterizing the kernel with a distribution over structured objects and a parameter \u03b3. The kernel in Equation (4) is derived from the distance of x to all random objects \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126, parameterized by p(\u03c9) and \u03b3. It can be interpreted as a soft version of the distance substitution kernel, always positive definite by construction. The kernel in Equation (4) is always positive definite by construction and can be approximated via Random Features for practical use in large-scale settings with a large number of samples. Our kernel, defined via a random feature map, can be used in large-scale settings with a large number of samples. The RF approximation allows for learning a target function as a linear function of the RF feature map by minimizing domain-specific empirical risk. This approach is different from recent work that selects random features in a supervised setting. The RF based empirical risk minimization for D2KE kernels is outlined in Algorithm 1. The RF based empirical risk minimization for D2KE kernels is outlined in Algorithm 1, where random feature embeddings are computed using a structured distance measure and exponent function. This approach contrasts with traditional RF methods and will be further analyzed in Section 5. The relationship to the representative-set method is also discussed. The estimator in Algorithm 1 in Section 5 is analyzed and compared to K-nearest-neighbor. A naive choice of p(\u03c9) links this approach to the representative-set method (RSM). By interpreting Equation (8) as a random-feature approximation, a Random-Feature embedding is obtained by holding out part of the training data as samples from p(\u03c9). This is equivalent to a 1/ \u221a R-scaled version of the embedding function in the representative-set method. The representative-set method (or similarity-as-features method) involves computing each sample's similarity to a set of representatives as its feature representation. By interpreting Equation (8) as a random-feature approximation to the kernel, a better generalization error bound is obtained even with a large representative set. The choice of p(\u03c9) in the kernel plays a crucial role, with \"close to uniform\" choices showing better performance in various domains compared to the data distribution p(\u03c9) = p(x) used in the representative-set method. The choice of p(\u03c9) in different domains yields better performance than the data distribution p(\u03c9) = p(x) in the representative-set method. Examples include time-series with DTW, string classification with edit distance, and vector sets with Hausdorff distance. Random distributions outperform the Representative-Set Method (RSM) in these cases. When classifying sets of vectors with the Hausdorff distance, a synthetic distribution p(\u03c9) outperforms the Representative-Set Method (RSM) due to the ability to generate unlimited random features and capture semantic objects effectively. The proposed framework analyzes error decomposition in the context of RKHS and risk minimization. It compares population and empirical risks, and introduces a random feature approximation for estimating functions. The risk decomposition in the context of RKHS and function approximation is discussed, focusing on the terms related to function approximation error, Lipschitz continuity, and smoothness constraints within the RKHS norm. The goal is to find the best function within this class by minimizing the empirical risk. The RKHS imposes smoothness constraints on functions to minimize the approximation error. The estimation error is bounded by a tuning parameter \u03bb, with a goal of minimizing it as a function of n. The RKHS assumption leads to a qualitatively better estimation error. The estimation error in RKHS estimator is bounded by a tuning parameter \u03bb, with a goal of minimizing it as a function of n. The error has a better dependency on n compared to the k-nearest-neighbor method, especially for higher effective dimension. Random Feature Approximation introduces error terms that can be bounded using the same estimation error bound. Random Feature Approximation introduces error terms that can be bounded using the same estimation error bound. The focus is on analyzing the approximation error of the kernel for empirical risk minimization. The uniform convergence is guaranteed under certain conditions, ensuring a specific probability threshold. Proposition 2 provides an approximation error in terms of kernel evaluation, leading to a bound on the empirical risk difference between optimal solutions. Proposition 2 gives an approximation error in terms of kernel evaluation for empirical risk minimization. By the Representer theorem, a bound on the empirical risk difference between optimal solutions can be obtained. Corollary 1 states that with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4, having a certain number of Random Features proportional to the effective dimension can achieve an approximation error. The proposed framework can achieve -suboptimal performance by combining error terms. Claim 1 shows that the random feature approximation can achieve suboptimal performance compared to the desired target function. The proposed method is evaluated in various domains such as time-series, strings, texts, and images, with discussions on dissimilarity measures and data characteristics for each experiment. The proposed method is evaluated in different domains including time-series, strings, texts, and images. Various dissimilarity measures are discussed for each experiment, such as Dynamic Time Warping for time-series, Edit Distance for strings, Earth Mover's distance for semantic distance between Bags of Words in texts, and (Modified) Hausdorff distance for semantic closeness of Bags of Visual Words in images. For representing documents and images, (Modified) Hausdorff distance is used to measure semantic closeness of Bags of Visual Words. C-MEX programs were adapted for distance measures due to computational complexity. Four datasets were selected for experiments in each domain, including multivariate time-series and string data with varying lengths and alphabets. The curr_chunk discusses datasets used in the study, including string, text, and image data with varying characteristics such as alphabet size, string length, document length, and SIFT feature vector size. The datasets were divided into train and test subsets, and properties are summarized in TAB5 in Appendix B. The study compares D2KE against 5 state-of-the-art baselines, including KNN. The study divided datasets into train and test subsets and compared D2KE against 5 state-of-the-art baselines, including KNN, DSK_RBF, DSK_ND, KSVM, and RSM. Baselines have quadratic complexity in both the number of data samples and the length of the sequences. The study compared D2KE against 5 baselines with quadratic complexity in data samples and sequence length. D2KE has linear complexity in both, using random samples for performance close to an exact kernel. Parameters were optimized through 10-fold cross validation, with R ranging from 4 to 4096 for accuracy improvement. The new method D2KE uses random samples to achieve performance close to an exact kernel. It outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy while requiring less computation time. D2KE is shown to be a strong alternative to KNN and performs better than distance substitution kernels and KSVM. In this work, D2KE outperforms KNN and other methods, showing that a representation induced from a positive-definite kernel makes better use of data. Random samples used by D2KE perform significantly better than other methods. More detailed experimental results are provided in Appendix C. The framework proposed in this work derives a positive-definite kernel and feature embedding function from a dissimilarity measure for structured input domains. It subsumes existing approaches and suggests a new direction for creating embeddings based on distance to random objects. An extension could involve developing distance-based embeddings within a deep architecture for end-to-end learning systems.

In all experiments, multithreading with 12 threads was used for distance computations. Gaussian distribution with bandwidth parameter \u03c3 was applied to all datasets. D2KE outperforms other baselines in classification accuracy and computation time for multivariate time-series. D2KE achieves significantly higher performance than KNN, which is sensitive to data noise in real-world applications. D2KE outperforms KNN by 26.62% on IQ_radio due to its insensitivity to data noise. Compared to DSK_RBF, DSK_ND, and KSVM, D2KE shows significantly better performance, utilizing data more effectively. RSM is similar in feature matrix construction but D2KE's random time series sampling performs significantly better. The random time series sampling method used by D2KE outperforms RSM in feature matrix construction. D2KE samples short random sequences to denoise and find patterns in the data, providing a more abundant feature space compared to RSM. Additionally, D2KE's method is not limited by the number of data points that can be sampled, unlike RSM, which may suffer from noise and redundant information in time-series data. Levenshtein distance is chosen as the distance measure for generating random strings in D2KE. The best parameters for \u03b3 and the length of random strings are searched for. D2KE consistently outperforms other distance-based baselines, showing a clear advantage. Levenshtein distance is used in D2KE for generating random strings, leading to improved performance over baselines. DSK_RBF shows similar performance to D2KE, possibly due to producing a c.p.d. kernel. D2KE achieves better results on large datasets with lower computational complexity compared to other baselines. D2KE achieves higher accuracy with significantly less runtime compared to DSK_RBF and DSK_ND, and much less than KSVM, due to higher computational costs for kernel matrix construction and eigendecomposition.
