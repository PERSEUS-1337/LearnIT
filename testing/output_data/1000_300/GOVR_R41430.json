    "content": "Inland waterways, managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, cover 25,000 miles and handle half of all inland waterway freight. The Corps maintains infrastructure like navigation channels and regulates channel depths through dredging. Maintenance and construction costs are funded by the Corps and commercial user industry. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages inland waterways, including harbors, locks, and dams, through dredging and water management. Costs for maintenance and construction are funded by the Corps and the commercial user industry. Congress is considering future financing for inland waterway system investments, as the current revenue source is insufficient to cover major capital expenditures. The current revenue source for funding inland waterway projects is inadequate, leading to federal taxpayers covering over half of the costs. This shortfall is hindering new construction projects, and changes to the financing system are needed. Proposals have been made to replace the fuel tax with lock usage fees or increase the fuel tax along with the federal share for costs. The user industry proposed a plan for inland waterway costs, combining an increase in fuel tax with a higher federal share. Inland waterways have been used for commerce since before the nation's founding, with federal support beginning in the early 1800s. While rail and highway transport have reduced reliance on waterways, they still play a significant role in commercial freight transportation. The federal government has historically supported inland waterways for commerce, although rail and highway improvements have reduced their reliance. Inland waterways still account for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually and remain important for transporting bulk goods over long distances, especially for grain and oilseed exports. Inland waterways are crucial for transporting bulk goods over long distances, including grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, metals, cement, sand, and gravel. Despite projections of increased traffic, actual usage has remained relatively flat over the past 20 years. Overall freight tonnage is expected to double in the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic growing at a slower rate. Shipping increased at an average annual rate of 1.2% from 1997 to 2007 and is expected to continue growing. The Department of Transportation projects that overall freight tonnage will double in the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic increasing at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. The federal government invests in inland waterways due to their national value, with the majority of tonnage passing through the Mississippi and Ohio River System via bulk shipping on barges. The federal government invests in inland waterways through bulk shipping on barges. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s changed the funding system for inland waterway projects, creating user cost-sharing requirements. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established the current financing system for Corps inland waterway projects. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established a fuel tax on commercial barges and cost-share requirements for inland waterway projects. These laws created the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to hold revenues and fund construction investments, shifting financial responsibility to commercial operators on the inland waterway system. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 established a fuel tax on commercial barge traffic, creating the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The act was later amended by WRDA 1986, which increased the fuel tax to $0.20 per gallon by 1994 and implemented a cost-sharing process for waterway construction projects. WRDA 1986 increased the fuel tax to $0.20 per gallon by 1994 and established a cost-sharing process for inland waterway construction projects. Projects funded by the IWTF require authorization and annual appropriations from Congress. WRDA 1986 authorized projects funded by the IWTF with 100% federal funding for inland waterway costs excluding construction and major maintenance. O&M costs exceed construction costs and are a topic of policy discussions. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by WRDA 1986 as a federal advisory committee to represent shipping interests on inland waterways. The board, made up of 11 members, meets regularly to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress on IWTF projects. The IWTF balance has varied between 1986 and 2011. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) advises on federal decision-making for IWTF projects, meeting three times a year to recommend investments. From 1986 to 2011, IWTF balance fluctuated, peaking at $413 million in 2002. Proposals to increase user fees and fund operations were not enacted, but appropriations rose significantly from FY2005 onwards. Beginning in FY2005, appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly as the Bush Administration requested and Congress appropriated greater investments in IWTF-funded projects. These increasing expenditures significantly exceeded annual fuel tax collections going into the IWTF and interest on the IWTF balance. Some projects exceeded their original cost estimates, causing balances to fall sharply from 2005 to 2010. To prevent the balance from falling to unsustainable levels, Congress took \"stopgap\" measures, such as exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements in FY2009 (P.L. 110-329). Congress has implemented various \"stopgap\" measures in previous years to address the increasing expenditures from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF). These measures include exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements, limiting projects with access to the IWTF, providing construction funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and prohibiting new contracts requiring IWTF funding. These actions have helped limit costs to the IWTF and maintain the trust fund balance. The Congress has restricted new contracts requiring IWTF funding since FY2009, stabilizing the trust fund balance. Funding for new projects is expected to be limited, with most going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River. Concerns about IWTF financing and other issues have been raised in recent years. Inland Waterway Financing Proposals are discussed to address issues with the IWTF financing system. Concerns have been raised about structural inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments. Reforms were implemented in FY2006 to improve project delivery, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for projects with a high risk of cost overruns. While some improvements were recognized, concerns still persist among users. In FY2006, the Corps implemented reforms to its project delivery process, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. Advocates call for additional structural reforms, citing cost overruns at the Olmsted Locks and Dam project as evidence of ongoing planning and oversight issues. The project's estimated cost increased significantly over time, from $775 million to $2.9 billion in FY2014. The project's cost increased from $775 million to $2.9 billion in FY2014 due to design changes. The project was 49% complete as of January 1, 2013, with lock components finished. Concerns about funding led to proposals by the Bush and Obama administrations, with a new recommendation to raise revenues. The Obama Administration proposed raising revenues for the IWTF in 2009 and 2010, but Congress rejected the proposals. Recently, the Administration presented a new recommendation to Congress. The user industry, represented by the IWUB, has its own proposal which includes increasing the fuel tax and requiring a higher federal share for some inland waterway investments. Past administrations, including Bush and Obama, have also proposed increasing commercial user fees on inland waterways. In 2008, the Bush Administration suggested a lock usage fee to generate additional revenue for the IWTF. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee in 2008 to address potential IWTF shortfall, phasing in charges for commercial barges and tying IWTF balances to user fees after 2012. The proposal aimed to improve equity in waterborne commerce investments by shifting the focus of user fees towards lock users. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee in 2008 to address potential IWTF shortfall, phasing in charges for commercial barges and tying IWTF balances to user fees after 2012. The Obama Administration's budget requests to Congress have each proposed some form of new user fee for inland waterways, with the FY2010 budget including a proposal similar to the Bush Administration's, but with an option for the Corps to further increase fees. The Obama Administration has consistently proposed user fees for inland waterways in its budget requests to Congress. These fees aim to replace or supplement the fuel tax and increase revenues, with recent budgets requesting appropriations based only on fuel tax revenues. Congress has generally rejected these user fee proposals but has supported limiting revenues as a short-term solution for inland waterways financing. The Obama Administration has proposed user fees for inland waterways in its budget requests to Congress, aiming to replace or supplement fuel tax revenues. Congress has generally rejected these proposals but has agreed to limit revenues as a short-term solution for inland waterways financing. Recent budgets assumed new revenues from an unspecified user fee, but none have been enacted. The 2011 Obama Administration plan for deficit reduction included a detailed proposal for a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers. The Obama Administration proposed a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers on inland waterways to generate additional revenue. The fee would be set by the Corps to achieve a revenue target, with vessels using locks paying a higher fee. The proposal did not specify the fee amount but aimed to generate approximately $1 billion in additional revenues for the IWTF over 10 years. The Obama Administration proposed a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers on inland waterways to increase revenue. The proposal aimed to generate approximately $1 billion in additional revenues for the IWTF over 10 years, without specifying the fee amount. The proposal also included adding 39 new segments to the inland waterway system, but faced opposition from the user industry and was not enacted. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) proposed a Capital Investment Strategy Team report as an alternative to the Obama Administration's fee proposal for commercial shippers on inland waterways. The IWUB report, although not formally endorsed by the Corps or the Administration, has been introduced as legislation in Congress. The IWUB report, not formally endorsed by the Corps or the Administration, recommended increasing user fees and the federal share of inland waterway costs. The report suggested raising the IWTF fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon and modifying cost-share requirements for inland waterway investments. The IWUB report recommends increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, depending on future fuel tax revenues. It also suggests modifying cost-share requirements for inland waterway investments and increasing overall spending on inland waterways. Other recommendations include increasing IWUB involvement in project planning and construction. The IWUB report proposes increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, depending on future fuel tax revenues. This would generate approximately $112 million per year in fuel tax revenues for the IWTF, allowing for replenishing balances and shifting more project costs to the federal government. The tax increase would not be indexed for inflation or include a capital recovery mechanism. The IWUB report proposes a fuel tax increase of $0.20 per gallon for inland waterways, without indexing for inflation or including a capital recovery mechanism. It suggests shifting more project costs to the federal government, exempting certain expenses from cost-sharing requirements, and capping the use of IWTF funds to discourage construction cost overruns. Critics argue that this could lead to additional hidden costs. The IWUB report proposes a \"cap\" on IWTF funds to discourage cost overruns, affecting cost-share for projects. It suggests increasing federal share to 70% for some projects over 25 years. The report also calls for more funding for inland waterways from IWTF and General Revenue fund. The IWUB report proposes an overall increase in funding for inland waterways, with full funding requiring annual expenditures of approximately $380 million, a significant increase over historical averages. Most of the increase would come from the General Revenue fund to allow the trust fund balance to rebuild. The IWUB report proposes increased funding for inland waterways, with most of the increase coming from the General Revenue fund. Federal funding would cover 74% of the required investments over the first five years, gradually shifting to trust fund contributions. More new funding is needed from the federal government than the IWTF. Reforms are suggested to improve cost-effectiveness of IWTF projects overseen by the Corps. The IWUB report proposes reforms to increase cost-effectiveness of IWTF projects overseen by the Corps, recommending more involvement of IWUB in project delivery process and appointing representatives to project design teams. The IWUB seeks increased oversight on planning and status updates for projects funded by IWTF. The IWUB report recommends reforms to enhance cost-effectiveness of IWTF projects overseen by the Corps, emphasizing increased involvement in project delivery and providing status updates. The report also outlines specific projects prioritized for funding based on asset condition and system performance improvement. The IWUB report recommends reforms to enhance cost-effectiveness of IWTF projects overseen by the Corps, emphasizing increased involvement in project delivery and providing status updates. It prioritizes specific projects for funding based on asset condition and system performance improvement, without proposing mandatory funding. The final decision on funding allocation would still need to be made by Congress or the Corps. Some have suggested shifting costs away from the federal government to increase user-financed share of inland waterway costs. Some advocate for shifting costs away from the federal government to increase user-financed share of inland waterway costs, citing inequalities in spending and the need for a user fee structure to cover true operational costs and increase economic efficiency. The CBO recommended a user fee structure to recover true costs for inland waterway operations, increasing economic efficiency. This would raise costs for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios, as federal costs exceed fuel tax receipts. Proposals include increasing user contributions to achieve savings for the federal government, with estimates of $1 billion in savings over five years. The CBO and environmental groups proposed increasing user fees for inland waterways to cover costs, with estimated savings of $1 billion over five years. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested making waterways \"self-funding\" for $500 million in savings. CBO's budget options report projected $4 billion in savings over 10 years by raising user fees. These proposals aim to shift more financial responsibility to users. The proposals aim to increase user fees for inland waterways to save $4 billion over 10 years. They suggest various forms of new user fees, such as annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees, to better reflect the cost of operating individual segments of inland waterways. These proposals would fundamentally change the current financing system for waterways. The proposals aim to increase user fees for inland waterways to save $4 billion over 10 years by suggesting new investment levels and revenue sources. Congress faces questions on the level of investment needed, potential changes to fuel tax, and cost-share arrangements for projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made limited changes to inland waterways financing. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121) made changes to inland waterways financing, including project delivery recommendations, federal responsibility for rehabilitation costs under $20 million, reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project, and efforts to provide more information on policy options. It did not alter the inland waterways fuel tax. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to inland waterways financing, including reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. Efforts were also authorized to provide more information on policy options, such as studying revenue collection efficiency and exploring new financing methods. The House Appropriations Committee funded the Olmsted Project with a 15% cost-sharing requirement from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, allowing for significant funding for other construction projects. The WRRDA reduced cost-sharing requirements for the Olmsted Project to 15% from the IWTF, allowing more funding for other inland waterways projects. However, many believe these changes will not be enough to finance all necessary upgrades in the long-term. Legislation like H.R. 1149 (WAVE4 Act) has been proposed to address the IWTF's long-term solvency by implementing project delivery recommendations and a fuel tax increase. The WAVE4 Act and RIVER Act propose authorizing recommendations from the IWUB proposal, including project delivery changes and fuel tax increases. The bills would also adjust cost-sharing for dam construction and rehabilitation expenses, with the federal government taking on more responsibility. These proposals aim to address long-term solvency issues with the IWTF and funding for inland waterways projects. The federal government would cover 100% of dam construction and rehabilitation costs under the proposed bill. Congress faces issues regarding infrastructure investments on federal waterways, with commercial users advocating for increased funding due to aging infrastructure and capacity needs. Opposition from taxpayer and environmental groups exists against additional federal funding for inland waterways. Despite disagreements, most agree that current financing for inland waterways is insufficient for future needs. The Corps is expected to have funding for only one lock replacement project through at least FY2016. Additional funding or revenue sources are needed to address these infrastructure challenges. The Corps is expected to have appropriations for just one ongoing lock replacement project (Olmstead Lock on the Ohio River) through at least FY2016 under its current baseline for IWTF revenues. Without new revenue or federal appropriations, new or ongoing IWTF construction projects may be delayed, despite the urgent need for increased investment in aging inland waterway facilities. The majority of locks in the United States are now past their intended design age of 50 years, leading to a decline in efficiency and increased lock unavailability on inland waterways. User industries are in favor of new lock construction and expansion to address these challenges. The Corps has noted an overall decline in efficiency due to aging infrastructure on inland waterways, with increased lock unavailability. Some user industries prefer new lock construction over maintenance. Environmental groups argue against new investments, stating that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks at a lower cost. They believe the costs of new construction outweigh the benefits. Environmental groups argue against new lock construction, stating that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks at a lower cost. They believe the costs of new construction greatly exceed the benefits and advocate for small-scale and nonstructural improvements to overcome aging infrastructure issues on inland waterways. The Corps has highlighted the challenges of predicting future traffic forecasts for new navigation alternatives, which depend on various variables like commodity prices and shippers' price sensitivity. Total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by approximately 70% by 2020, but specific projections for inland waterway freight have been avoided recently. The Corps has noted that total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by approximately 70% by 2020, with projections showing an annual 2% increase in waterway traffic between 2010 and 2035. Shipping interests suggest that improving the efficiency of inland waterways could reduce pressure on highways and railways. Future lock upgrades or new construction may boost demand for inland waterways, but the impact would depend on various factors. Some groups have criticized industry requests for new lock construction on inland waterways, noting flat or decreasing traffic at certain locks. The Corps has been cautious about using projected traffic increases to justify investments in waterways. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways due to their value compared to other forms of freight shipping. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways, citing studies that show barge shipping is more efficient and environmentally friendly than rail or highway transportation. Benefits include reduced fuel consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and less highway congestion and noise pollution. Inland waterways have lower greenhouse gas emissions and benefits like reduced highway congestion and noise. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy of industry fuel-efficiency calculations and the need to consider factors like river flow constraints. Environmental groups suggest using a conversion factor for circuity to compare fuel efficiency accurately between barge and rail shipping. Environmental groups caution that inland waterway projects can harm riparian habitat and species by altering natural flows through structural changes like locks, dams, and levees. Increased construction and expansion of waterways may lead to negative environmental effects, including bank erosion. Congress must consider the environmental impact when deciding on additional investments and potential changes to financing systems. Increased construction and expansion of inland waterways can have negative environmental effects. Congress may consider changes to financing systems, including options like an increase to the fuel tax, new annual fees, lock usage fees, or a toll system. The proposed fuel tax increase aims to rebuild trust fund balance, fund new investments, and generate additional revenue. The IWUB proposes a new system of user fees and revenue collection to rebuild trust fund balance and fund new investments. Some groups argue that the associated increases to federal cost share responsibilities are unacceptable. The user industry's acceptance of fuel tax increases without changes to cost-sharing arrangements is uncertain. The Obama Administration's 2011 proposal included new fees for commercial users on the inland waterway system. The Obama Administration proposes new fees for commercial users on the inland waterway system, including fuel taxes and additional fees for non-lock users. Lock users would pay a higher fee, and new waterway segments would be added to the fuel-taxed list to increase revenues. The Administration argues that commercial shippers, as primary beneficiaries, should cover costs for capital investments, with lock users paying the most. The IWUB and Congress have opposed lock usage fees and the new proposal, citing unfair burdens on waterway users. The Obama Administration proposes new fees for commercial users on the inland waterway system, including fuel taxes and additional fees for non-lock users. Lock users would pay a higher fee, with the IWUB and Congress opposing the new proposal due to unfair burdens on waterway users. The IWUB argues against targeting users of individual segments, noting the interconnected benefits of the inland waterways system. Major fee increases are expected to impact shippers operating within the system, and the user industry is against the proposed fee delegation authority to the Secretary of the Army. The Obama Administration proposes new fees for commercial users on the inland waterway system, including fuel taxes and additional fees for non-lock users. Various options such as lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and lock charges have been considered as means to raise revenues on inland waterways. A separate financing concept called \"capital recovery\" was discussed but not enacted in the final bill. The Obama Administration proposes new fees for commercial users on the inland waterway system, including fuel taxes and additional fees for non-lock users. A financing concept called \"capital recovery\" was discussed but not enacted in the final bill. User fees would automatically adjust to recover capital investments by the government, potentially reducing future shortfalls in the trust fund. The Obama Administration proposed user fees tied to trust fund balances after FY2022, with concerns raised about the difficulty of planning for changing taxes. Congress could explore ways to enhance revenue reliability, such as an inflation adjustment in fuel taxes or lockage fees. Some argue that automatic adjustments could lead to hidden tax increases in the future. If no long-term solution is enacted to address the IWTF revenue shortfall, Congress may need to take measures to ensure the trust fund's solvency, such as capping withdrawals or putting a hold on new contracts. Options like exempting IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements could also be considered, but would come at an additional cost to taxpayers. Congress may consider exempting IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, similar to the exemption provided in FY2009 appropriations. This exemption would incur additional costs to taxpayers from the General Revenue account. The balance of the current cost-share arrangement for inland waterway projects is a key question before Congress, as established by WRDA 1986 and modified by WRDA 1992. The IWUB proposal aims to significantly modify these requirements. The IWUB proposal aims to redefine cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, shifting funding for dams and minor rehabilitation to 100% federal funding. It also proposes a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation, distinguishing it from routine operations and maintenance. The IWUB proposes a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation, increasing federally funded maintenance and rehabilitation projects. Cost overruns for IWTF construction projects would become 100% federal responsibility, potentially adding hidden costs to the federal government. The IWUB's proposed changes would shift the cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects towards the federal government, with estimates showing a shift from 50/50 to approximately 68% federal, 32% non-federal. Critics argue that this would add hidden costs to the federal government, despite the support the IWTF already receives. Taxpayer and environmental groups highlight the significant federal support the IWTF receives, with federal funding covering 100% of investigations and operations. This support amounts to an additional $500 million-$650 million annually with no cost-sharing requirements. CRS predicts that federal costs for inland waterways could exceed 90% under the proposed changes, up from the current 80%-85%. Obama Administration proposals have suggested altering user fees but not the overall cost-share between federal and nonfederal expenditures. The Obama Administration's proposals recommend changing user fees but not the overall cost-share between federal and nonfederal expenditures for inland waterways. Some groups argue for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance costs. They suggest that waterway users should pay for not only 50% of construction and major rehabilitation costs but also some or all operations and maintenance costs. Some groups, including environmental and taxpayer interest groups, argue that waterway users should pay for 50% of construction and major rehabilitation costs, as well as some or all operations and maintenance costs. Congress has previously rejected these proposals but may reconsider them in cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB has requested Congress to reform Corps IWTF planning processes to increase involvement and improve project prioritization, aiming to reduce cost overruns identified in previous studies. The Corps' method for prioritization of inland waterway projects is under scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest. Previous studies have identified factors contributing to cost overruns, including inaccurate schedules and funding. There is a lack of formal criteria for decision-making among investments competing for IWTF funds, leaving decisions largely to the Corps and the Administration. The IWUB report proposes a priority ranking system for IWTF investments, aiming to replace the current practice of decision-making by the Corps, Administration, and Congress. If implemented as a regulation, this system could change Congress's role in project selection and funding for Corps inland waterway projects. The IWUB report suggests a priority ranking system for Corps inland waterway projects, which could potentially limit Congress's role to providing project authorizations and funding levels. This would be a departure from Congress's previous involvement in directing Corps projects."
