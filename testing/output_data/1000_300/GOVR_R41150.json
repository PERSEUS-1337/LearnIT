President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget was $35.3 billion. H.R. 1 extended funding through March 18, 2011, with reduced levels for some programs. The House passed H.R. 1 on February 19, 2011, with a funding level of $29.9 billion. The Senate rejected both the House-passed version of H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149, which proposed $32.4 billion in funding. H.R. 1473 was passed on April 14, 2011, with a funding level of $35.0 billion. The Energy and Water Development funding bill, H.R. 1473, was passed on April 14, 2011, with a budget of approximately $32.2 billion. It includes funding for various programs such as civil works projects, the Department of Energy, and independent agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Energy and Water Development funding bill, H.R. 1473, passed on April 14, 2011, with a budget of $32.2 billion. It includes funding for civil works projects, the Department of Energy, and independent agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Tables provide budget details for different titles and key issues in major programs. Funding in H.R. 1, S.Amdt. 149, and P.L. 112-10 is included in the overall tables. Army Corps of Engineers budget requests are typically below final levels. The FY2011 budget request for the Army Corps of Engineers was $4.88 billion, $564 million below the FY2010 level. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $5.32 billion, slightly below the FY2010 appropriation. The House Appropriations Subcommittee proposed $5.28 billion. The House-passed Continuing Resolution would have reduced funding to approximately $4.8 billion, $641 million below FY2010 levels. The House-passed Continuing Resolution, H.R. 1, proposed reducing funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to approximately $4.8 billion, which is $641 million below the FY2010 enacted level. The Continuing Resolution, P.L. 112-10, provided $5.05 billion for the Corps, an increase of $152 million over the President's requested level but $411 million below the FY2010 enacted level. Federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program, with about 85% of appropriations directed to specific projects identified in the budget request or added during congressional deliberations. The Army Corps of Engineers receives funding for specific projects, with appropriations typically not provided for studies, projects, or activities without prior authorization. Estimates of the backlog of authorized projects range from $11 billion to over $80 billion, leading to questions about the alignment between authorization and appropriations processes and how to prioritize among authorized projects. The Army Corps of Engineers faces a backlog of authorized projects, raising questions about the alignment between authorization and appropriations processes. Since Hurricane Katrina, the Corps has received significant supplemental appropriations, including funds for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. For example, in the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008, the agency received $5.76 billion for Louisiana hurricane protection. The Army Corps of Engineers received significant supplemental appropriations post-Hurricane Katrina for Louisiana hurricane protection and Gulf Coast region projects. This included funds for barrier island and ecosystem restoration. The Corps also received additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Congress closely monitors construction funding for the Corps due to numerous authorized projects awaiting appropriations. The FY2011 Obama Administration request proposed $1.69 billion for construction, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $1.69 billion for construction, with a reduction of $341 million from the previous year. The request included two new construction starts, following the previous administration's policy of limiting new starts to focus on completing ongoing activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for construction, utilizing unobligated balances from prior year appropriations for FY2011 activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for construction, using $120 million in unobligated balances for the Continuing Authorities Program. The House subcommittee bill would have funded construction at $1.851 billion, while P.L. 112-10 provided $1.78 billion, slightly more than the Administration's request. The bill also included a provision barring the Corps from new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund is facing a deficit as expenses exceed incoming collections. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) is experiencing a deficit as expenses surpass incoming collections. Current law designates federal responsibility for construction and rehabilitation of inland waterways, with funding split between IWTF and federal general revenue. Additional federal funding has been provided in recent years to maintain IWTF solvency. Proposals have been made to increase revenues into the IWTF by replacing the current fuel tax. The FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations included federal funding to support the IWTF's solvency. Previous Administrations proposed increasing revenues by replacing the fuel tax with a user fee, but Congress criticized this. The FY2011 Budget limited IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the user fee approach and agreed to budget only current year fuel tax revenues. If a solution is not reached soon, action may be necessary. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the user fee approach in FY2011 and agreed to budget only current year fuel tax revenues. Concerns about funding levels for Corps activities in the Everglades and progress in restoration efforts are discussed in a CRS report. The Obama Administration requested funding for the Corps' component of the south Florida Everglades. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $180 million for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration, the same as FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed reducing it to $155 million due to the Corps' inability to use the original amount. Since FY2006, there have been no across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage in individual accounts. Since FY2006, there have been no across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage in individual accounts within the Corps' budget. The practice of proposing an S&S rate for various Corps accounts was discontinued in FY2006 to decrease the need for reprogramming allocations among projects. The FY2011 budget request continued this practice by not including reductions to individual accounts for S&S. In FY2006, Congress stopped applying an S&S rate to reduce reprogramming allocations among projects. The FY2011 budget request did not include reductions to individual accounts for S&S, but the Senate Appropriations Committee markup included reductions for various Corps accounts. The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account in FY2011, $1 million more than FY2010. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation was $1.064 billion, $22 million less than FY2010, with an offset of $49.9 million for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund. The Bureau of Reclamation's FY2011 budget totaled $1.064 billion, $22 million less than FY2010. The net discretionary authority was $1.015 billion, with an additional $167 million from other funds, totaling $1.182 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion. The enacted bill appropriated $1.094 billion for these programs. The 2010 enacted bill allocated $1.129 billion, with the Senate bill proposing $1.133 billion and the House subcommittee's bill suggesting $1.108 billion for Title II programs. Reclamation's main account, Water and Related Resources, includes various programs like construction, operations, Dam Safety, and Wildlife Management. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for this account in FY2011, a decrease from FY2010. The House-passed Continuing Resolution proposed funding at $911.6 million, below the FY2010 level. The House-passed Continuing Resolution for FY2011 proposed funding the Water and Related Resources Account at $911.6 million, which is $39 million below the FY2010 enacted level. The bill included amendments that would eliminate funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin and bar funding for biological opinions related to the Central Valley Project and the California State Project. Funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act would also be prohibited. The House-passed Continuing Resolution for FY2011 proposed funding cuts for water resources, including barring funding for dam removal study in the Klamath basin and biological opinions related to the Central Valley Project and California State Project. The Bureau of Reclamation manages numerous dams and water diversion projects in the West, providing water for irrigation and reclaiming arid lands. Reclamation manages dams and diversion projects in the West, supplying water to farmland and a population of 31 million. It is the largest water supplier in 17 western states and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation facilities also offer flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but face controversy over their impact on species and water users. The agency's budget relies on project funding, and it has been criticized for becoming a \"caretaker agency.\" In FY2010, the House Committee on Appropriations criticized Reclamation for not exerting leadership in water supply management in the West. The committee highlighted the challenges of balancing needs, increasing demand, and changing hydrology. The Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, one of Reclamation's largest projects, has faced water delivery limitations due to drought and environmental restrictions. This has led to amendments in appropriations bills to address the issue. In FY2010, Reclamation faced criticism for not leading in water supply management in the West. The Central Valley Project (CVP) has had water delivery limitations due to drought and environmental restrictions, leading to amendments in appropriations bills. Recent amendments aimed to prevent Reclamation from implementing new Biological Opinions on project operations affecting fish species like Delta Smelt and salmon in California. These species are protected under the Endangered Species Act. The 2004 Operations Criteria and Plan (OCAP) increased pumping from the Delta, endangering Delta Smelt and salmon in California, protected under the Endangered Species Act. Factors like invasive species, pollution, and water withdrawals also contribute to fishery declines. Low Delta Smelt numbers led to court limits on pumping, prompting a review of project impacts. Low water deliveries exacerbate unemployment in certain water districts. The court-imposed limit on pumping at certain times led to a new review of project operations and impacts on the economy and species. Low water deliveries to specific water districts are worsening unemployment in an area already facing economic challenges. Proposed FY2010 amendments were not enacted, but a bill included a two-year authorization for water transfers among certain CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account for FY2011, equal to the enacted level for FY2010. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (Bay-Delta, or CALFED) for FY2011, with funds targeted at water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Funding for conveyance declined, while funding for water use efficiency and science increased. The enacted Continuing Resolution provided the same amount as the President's FY2011 budget request. Reclamation proposed an allocation of $72.1 million for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011, an increase of $56.2 million over FY2010. The Fund was authorized by the enactment of Title X of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-11), the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. The Fund is to be used to implement fisheries restoration and water management provisions of a stipulated settlement agreement for the Natural Resources Defense Council et al. v. Rodgers lawsuit. The allocation of $72.1 million for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011 is proposed by Reclamation, an increase of $56.2 million over FY2010. The fund will be used to implement fisheries restoration and water management provisions of a settlement agreement for the Natural Resources Defense Council et al. v. Rodgers lawsuit. Funding will come from various sources, including a reallocation of Central Valley Project Restoration Fund receipts and accelerated payment of Friant water users' obligations. Planned actions for FY2011 include releasing interim flows from Friant Dam and completing planning and design for structural improvements. The Senate Appropriations Committee markup included an additional $8 million for San Joaquin River restoration, in addition to the $72 million allocated for FY2011. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) includes a provision to withhold funding for the settlement agreement implementation in the remainder of FY2011. Reclamation has not provided any comments on this matter yet. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) includes a provision to withhold funding for the settlement agreement implementation in the remainder of FY2011. Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program for FY2011, focusing on water conservation, re-use, and planning in conjunction with the U.S. Geological Survey. The program includes WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects. The WaterSMART proposal by the U.S. Geological Survey includes WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects. Reclamation proposed $62 million for WaterSMART in FY2011, with funding levels decreased by the Senate Appropriations Committee. P.L. 112-10 did not specify programmatic funding levels for WaterSMART. The Energy and Water Development bill funds DOE programs, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons. FY2010 appropriations allocated $27.1 billion, with an additional $38.7 billion from ARRA for selected DOE programs. Formerly, programs for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, and energy statistics were included in a different appropriations bill. The FY2010 appropriations for DOE programs totaled $27.1 billion, with an additional $38.7 billion from the ARRA. The Obama Administration requested $29.6 billion for FY2011, but the final legislation appropriated $26.3 billion. DOE administers various programs with different functions and missions, including EERE programs which requested $2,355.5 million for FY2011. DOE's FY2011 request sought $2,355.5 million for EERE programs, with a proposed increase of $85.6 million. However, P.L. 112-10 provided $1,825.6 million for EERE, a reduction of $416.9 million. Additionally, DOE requested $189.5 million for EDER programs, with a proposed increase of $13.9 million, but P.L. 112-10 provided $144.7 million, a cut of $27.3 million. The DOE also sought $50 million for a new science and engineering education program, RE-ENERGYSE.

The DOE requested $15 million for a technical training, education, and outreach subprogram to support the development of training programs at community colleges and K-12 education activities aimed at educating students and educators about clean energy careers and sustainable energy practices. The DOE proposed a RE-ENERGYSE program with $115 million in funding in FY2010, but Congress did not approve it. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $7.5 million for a study to define education and workforce needs instead. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal, with no funding provided in the conference report. For FY2011, the committee again recommended zero funding, while the Solar Program saw a net funding increase of $55.4 million, representing a 22% increase over the FY2010 appropriation. The Solar Program in FY2011 would have received a $55.4 million funding increase, with the majority going to the Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) subprogram for a demonstration project. The project aims to accelerate CSP deployment in the desert Southwest by 2-3 years, adding about 1,000 megawatts of new capacity. This is the first major CSP demonstration project proposed by the DOE since the early 1980s, reflecting the significant CSP resource potential. Assessments show a significant CSP resource potential, with firms competing intensely for development permits at the Bureau of Land Management. Water issues could pose a serious barrier to CSP development. The PV R&D Program would receive a $23.5 million increase for the PV Manufacturing Initiative to accelerate technology cost reduction. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $50.0 million for the CSP demonstration project, while the Wind Program would see a net increase of $42.5 million, with $49.0 million allocated for offshore wind development commercialization. Various barriers, including financial, regulatory, technical, environmental, and social, may impact progress. The Department of Energy (DOE) is allocating $49.0 million for a competitive solicitation for an offshore wind demonstration project to address barriers and accelerate market deployment of over three gigawatts of planned offshore projects. This is the first major wind demonstration project proposed by the DOE since the early 1980s. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for at least two offshore wind demonstration projects off the Atlantic Coast. Additionally, the Geothermal Program would receive an $11.0 million increase to support two activities.

Research efforts will focus on lithium-based batteries for stationary applications, new electrolytes, power conditioning systems, and identifying locations for pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage systems. The Senate Committee recommended funding for the Industries of the Future program with a focus on cross-cutting technology efforts. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the exact amount of the request for programs, but added $4.3 million for six congressionally directed projects. P.L. 112-10 cut the EDER total appropriation to $144.7 million. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totaled $824.1 million, with P.L. 112-10 providing $732.1 million for those programs. An additional $88.2 million was requested for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho nuclear facilities. The nuclear energy R&D program includes technologies for generation, safety, waste storage, and security to meet energy and climate goals. The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget includes funding for nuclear energy R&D programs, focusing on generation, safety, waste management, and security technologies. Critics argue that the program provides unnecessary subsidies to the nuclear industry, which they believe should be phased out due to safety and economic concerns. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program has ended, with a new Reactor Concepts Research, Development, and Demonstration Program established in its place. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program ended in FY2010 with no further funding.

The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation will be moved to NEET from the Generation IV program. The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation, previously part of the Generation IV program, will be moved to NEET with increased funding of $24.3 million. The Obama Administration requested $586.6 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development in FY2011, representing a 12.7% decrease from the previous year's appropriation. This decrease is due to cuts in funding for Natural Gas Technologies, Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies, and Cooperative Research. The DOE Office of Fossil Energy plans to restructure the FY2012 Coal subprogram to focus more on carbon capture and storage technologies. In FY2009, the House Appropriations Committee directed DOE to merge FutureGen and the Clean Coal Power Initiative into a single solicitation for a Carbon Capture Demonstration Initiative, funded at $1.52 billion by ARRA. The DOE Office of Fossil Energy restructured the FY2012 Coal subprogram to focus on carbon capture and storage technologies. The FutureGen project, originally aimed at demonstrating clean coal-based power generation with CO2 capture, has been abandoned. Instead, $1 billion in funding will be used to refit an existing plant for CO2 capture. The Clean Coal Technology program is in its final stages, with no further funding requested for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in the Fossil Energy budget. The Clean Coal Technology program at an Ameren 200-MW unit in Meredosia, IL is in its final stages with no further funding requested for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in the Fossil Energy budget, including funding for Fuels and Power Systems, Natural Gas Technologies program, and a new Unconventional Fossil Energy program. The committee also supports research projects for high-quality fuels derived from coal/biomass feedstocks with higher carbon lifecycle emissions than conventional petroleum fuels. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 to provide an emergency source of crude oil. It consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas and is currently filled to its capacity of 727 million barrels. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of refined home heating oil. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) established during the Clinton Administration stores 2 million barrels of refined home heating oil in above-ground facilities in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994. Beginning in 2000, additions to the SPR were made with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil acquired by the Department of Energy in lieu of cash royalties paid on production from federal offshore leases. Congress passed legislation in May 2008 ordering DOE to suspend RIK fill unless the price of crude oil dropped below $75/barrel. In 2009, the Bush Administration announced plans to purchase nearly 10.7 million barrels for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to replace oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The SPR reached capacity with over 6.1 million barrels delivered by January 2010. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced the phasing out of the Royalty-In-Kind (RIK) Program in September 2009 as contracts expire. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced the phasing out of the RIK Program in September 2009, leading to the cancellation of upcoming natural gas sales. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the expansion of the SPR to its authorized maximum of 1 billion barrels, with a possible additional 160 million barrels capacity in Richton, MS. However, the Administration proposed suspending spending on SPR expansion in its FY2011 request. The Administration proposed redirecting $71 million in balances previously appropriated for SPR expansion to fund non-expansion operations and maintenance activities in its FY2011 request. This reduced the FY2011 request for the SPR to $138.9 million, a sharp decrease from the $243.8 million appropriated for FY2010. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, and the Administration proposed the same amount for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $209.9 million for the SPR and did not support the cancellation of $71 million. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and is a significant federal funder of research in the physical sciences. For FY2011, DOE requested $5.121 billion for the Office of Science, an increase from previous years. DOE is a major federal funder of basic research and physical sciences, requesting $5.121 billion for the Office of Science in FY2011.

The committee expressed concern about the cost and schedule of ITER and U.S. leadership in fusion materials science. ARPA-E was authorized to support energy technology research projects and received $179.6 million in FY2011, less than the requested $300 million. President Obama's budget called for termination of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The FY2011 request for ARPA-E was $300 million, but only $179.6 million was appropriated. President Obama's budget called for terminating DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, including the Yucca Mountain repository project. No funding for Yucca Mountain or OCRWM was requested for FY2011. The DOE FY2011 budget justification states that Yucca Mountain repository is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal, leading to no funding being requested for it. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, which was rejected by an NRC licensing panel. The full NRC commission is now considering the withdrawal, opposed by states with defense-related waste. Alternatives to Yucca Mountain will be evaluated by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established by DOE in March 2010. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established by the DOE in March 2010, is evaluating alternatives to Yucca Mountain for nuclear waste disposal. Congress provided $5 million for the Commission to study options for temporary storage, treatment, and permanent disposal of highly radioactive waste. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead future waste management activities and conduct research on disposal technologies. The Office of Nuclear Energy will lead all future waste management activities, with substantial funding requested for research on nuclear waste disposal technologies. DOE has faced legal challenges for failing to meet waste removal deadlines, with potential liability payments estimated at $11 billion by 2020. (For more information, see CRS Report R40202, Nuclear Waste Disposal: Alternatives to Yucca) The DOE estimates liability payments could reach $11 billion if waste removal from reactor sites does not begin by 2020. Congress established the DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program to support energy projects using new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Estimated future government costs from the loan guarantees must be paid upfront by each project. The DOE's loan guarantee program supports energy projects with new technologies to reduce emissions. Project owners must pay upfront for estimated future government costs. The program had $47 billion in loan guarantee authority in FY2009, allocated to various energy sectors. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed a significant increase in loan guarantees. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed significant increases in loan guarantees for various energy sectors, including $18.5 billion for nuclear power, $18.5 billion for energy efficiency and renewables, $6 billion for coal, $2 billion for carbon capture and sequestration, and $2 billion for uranium enrichment. The DOE announced the first preliminary nuclear loan guarantee for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, totaling $8.33 billion for two reactors. The conditional guarantee agreement for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia would provide $8.33 billion in financing for two reactors, contingent on receiving an NRC license. Critics argue that tripling nuclear loan guarantees could divert resources from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) created a temporary loan guarantee program for renewable energy and electric transmission projects. $6 billion was allocated for subsidy costs, with $2 billion transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program and $1.5 billion rescinded for other purposes. The remaining $2.5 billion should support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion. President Obama also requested an additional $500 million for the program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $6 billion for subsidy costs for a temporary loan guarantee program. $2 billion was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program, $1.5 billion was rescinded, and the remaining $2.5 billion was to support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion. President Obama also requested an additional $500 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees. The loan guarantee authority for Section 1703 non-nuclear technologies was reduced to $7.3 billion by P.L. 112-10. The total loan guarantee ceiling for non-nuclear projects is now about $9.3 billion, while nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion and uranium enrichment at $4 billion. P.L. 112-10 also provides $170 million with no expiration for subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program, along with authority for up to $1.183 billion in additional loan guarantees for such projects. The Section 1703 program under P.L. 112-10 provides up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy and efficiency projects. This additional loan guarantee authority is available to projects that applied before February 24, 2011. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, established by P.L. 110-140, received $7.5 billion in FY2009 to issue up to $25 billion in direct loans for automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers to improve fuel economy. The DOE requested $10 million in FY2011 for administrative expenses related to the program providing loans to automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for investments in plant capacity to produce vehicles with improved fuel economy. Congress established the Stockpile Stewardship Program in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act to preserve the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons. The Stockpile Stewardship Program ensures the preservation of the United States' nuclear weapons capabilities without underground testing. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and funded through the Weapons Activities account. The program aims to maintain the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, managed by NNSA, aims to maintain the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile. P.L. 111-84 established a \"stockpile management\" program to effectively manage the weapons in the stockpile, increase reliability, safety, and security, and reduce the likelihood of nuclear testing. The stockpile management program supports the Stockpile Stewardship Program at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories and four production sites managed by NNSA. The program aims to maintain the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground nuclear weapons testing. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) manages and sets policy for eight sites, including the Y-12 Plant in TN and the Nevada Test Site. The FY2011 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP) for FY2012-FY2015. Despite Cold War reductions, Congress has pushed for further changes in the Complex for increased efficiency, security, and cost reduction. In response, NNSA submitted a plan called \"Complex 2030\" in January 2007, which was met with displeasure by the House Appropriations Committee in FY2008. The House Appropriations Committee expressed displeasure with NNSA's plan for transforming the Complex in January 2007, demanding a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy, specific nuclear stockpile details, and a long-term expenditure plan before considering further funding for Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the inadequate linkage between warheads, the Complex, and strategy. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the inadequate linkage between warheads, the Complex, and strategy, rejecting the Department's premature deployment of the NNSA Complex 2030 consolidation effort. Congress agreed to the direction in the House and Senate reports, requiring the Administration to develop a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA announced its plan, Complex Transformation, to modernize the Complex by retaining existing sites, reducing the weapons program footprint, closing or transferring structures, reducing the number of weapons workers, dismantling weapons more rapidly, and building. Transformation, formerly known as Complex 2030, aims to modernize the nuclear weapons complex by reducing the footprint, closing structures, cutting the number of workers, dismantling weapons faster, and constructing new facilities like the Uranium Processing Facility and Weapons Surveillance Facility. The House Appropriations Committee supports these changes and requires a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy before funding new programs or the Reliable Replacement Warhead. The House Appropriations Committee in December 2008 reiterated its stance on modernizing the nuclear weapons complex by focusing on a 21st-century deterrent strategy, determining the stockpile size and nature, and the weapons complex needed to support it. They recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead and other programs in their FY2009 report. The House Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead and other programs in their FY2009 report, aligning with a modernizing strategy for the nuclear weapons complex. The Senate Appropriations Committee also suggested cutting RRW funds in their FY2009 report, with no RRW funds allocated in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The FY2010 and FY2011 budgets did not request RRW funds, citing a shift towards a nuclear-free world. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, vs. FY2010 appropriations of $6,384.4 million. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010, outlining the role of U.S. nuclear forces and plans for sustaining the nuclear arsenal. The President provided Congress with a classified report on maintaining delivery platforms, ensuring a safe nuclear weapons stockpile, and modernizing the nuclear weapons complex. The Administration plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex, including maintaining delivery platforms and a safe, secure, and reliable U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. The projected costs for weapons stockpile and infrastructure are outlined for each fiscal year from FY2011 to FY2020. In the 112th Congress, there was a contentious reduction in the proposed increase for funding, which was part of a compromise to gain Senate Republicans' support for the New START treaty. The Administration proposed a contentious reduction of $312.4 million in the requested increase for funding to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and maintain nuclear weapons. This reduction was part of a compromise with Senate Republicans to gain support for the New START treaty. The President's FY2012 budget request called for increased funding for Weapons Activities to ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The President's FY2012 budget requested an increase in funding for Weapons Activities to ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The budget called for $7,629.7 million for Weapons Activities, with a reduction from the FY2011 request raising concerns about funding. The issue was resolved in P.L. 112-10, which provided $6,946.4 million for Weapons Activities, including work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, maintenance, repairs, refurbishment, R&D, and dismantlement. The Defense Stockpile Work (DSW) involves monitoring, maintaining, repairing, and conducting R&D for specific warheads. Life Extension Programs (LEPs) aim to extend the life of existing warheads through design, certification, and component replacement. An LEP for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs was completed in FY2009, and ongoing work on the W76 warhead for the Trident II missile is termed the W76-1. Funding for DSW in FY2010 was $223.2 million, with a request of $249.5 million in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for the NNSA program involving routine maintenance, replacement of limited-life components, and ongoing assessment for all weapon types in the stockpile. The FY2011 request was $649.4 million, with significant increases for the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead. B61 funds fall into two categories: B61 system sustainment and LEP. The FY2011 budget includes substantial increases for the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead. B61 funds are allocated for system sustainment and a phase 6.2/6.2A study, which aims to extend the life of components and enhance safety features for compatibility with modern aircraft like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Stockpile Systems, with a focus on surveillance activities to monitor the status of nuclear weapons. A robust surveillance program is crucial for maintaining confidence in the performance of nuclear weapons. The study on the B61-12 variant, aiming to consolidate most B61 variants into a single version, was controversial in the FY2010 appropriations cycle. The B61 bomb has various variants, with a controversial study on a new variant, the B61-12, aiming to consolidate them into a single version. The House bill recommended no funds for this redesign without a clear nuclear weapons strategy. The Senate bill included the requested amount, and the conference bill allocated $92.0 million for B61 stockpile systems activities, including $32.5 million for a study on nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12. Upon completion of the Nuclear Posture Review, an additional $15,000,000 may be reallocated for the B61-12 if deemed necessary. The bill authorizes the reallocation of $15,000,000 for the B61-12 non-nuclear upgrade study, with no funds to be used for nuclear components without approval. Two reports on the B61-12 are required, with a focus on life-extending individual B61 variants. The appropriations language authorizes reallocating $15,000,000 for the B61-12 nonnuclear upgrade study, with reports required on safety features and cost-benefit analysis. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for FY2011 and directed NNSA to submit a revised analysis of B61 LEP alternatives. The President and Congress aim to reduce the nuclear stockpile while maintaining national security. The Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) process involves storing, dismantling, and disposing of warheads. The FY2010 appropriation is $96.1 million, with a decrease in FY2011 to $58.0 million due to reduced dismantlements and component dispositions. The FY2010 appropriation for Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) is $96.1 million, decreasing to $58.0 million in FY2011. The decrease is due to reduced dismantlements and component dispositions, returning to baseline funding after a one-time Congressional increase in FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million, with $27.5 million allocated to restore weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex. Components of WDD have been relocated within DOE or to different budget categories within Weapons Activities in recent years. The major activity for FY2009, the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), was moved to the Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities account for FY2010. The major activity for FY2009 in Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) was the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which converts plutonium pits into plutonium oxide for use in nuclear reactors. The Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) was transferred to the DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy in FY2008. The Waste Solidification Building (WSB) converts liquid wastes from PDCF and MFFF into solids for disposal off-site, now under the Fissile Materials Disposition Program in Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation for FY2010.

In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 rescinded $22.7 million in unobligated balances for DOE's Office of Environmental Management, including funds from Defense Environmental Cleanup, Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, and Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup accounts. Cleanup challenges exist at nuclear weapons production facilities like Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. The Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory are nuclear weapons production facilities with complex cleanup challenges. They have the greatest funding needs among DOE's Office of Environmental Management facilities, representing over half of the total funding. Cleanup at these sites is expected to continue for decades, with completion estimated as late as 2062 for Hanford, 2040 for Savannah River Site, and 2044 for Idaho National Laboratory. The lengthy timelines are due to the treatment and disposal of high-level radioactive wastes stored at these sites, with 54 million gallons estimated at one point in 2009. The DOE estimates that Hanford has 54 million gallons of high-level wastes, Savannah River Site has 33 million gallons, and Idaho National Laboratory has nearly 1 million gallons. These wastes need to be treated and disposed of in a geologic repository, but technical difficulties and delays in waste treatment facilities pose environmental risks. Some tanks at Hanford have leaked wastes. The Hanford repository faces challenges with delays in waste treatment facilities, raising concerns about environmental risks from potential untreated waste releases. Some tanks at Hanford have leaked wastes into groundwater that flows into the Columbia River. The DOE monitors water quality in the river for contaminants. There is also interest in funding for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to clean up uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. Congress authorized special assessments from nuclear utilities and payments from the federal government to finance the fund. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to clean up uranium enrichment facilities. Congress authorized assessments from nuclear utilities and federal payments for the fund, which have been continued through annual appropriations since 2007. Reauthorization of utility assessments and federal payments has been an ongoing issue. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund has insufficient funds for future cleanup costs. The fund currently has $4.5 billion available, but DOE estimates cleanup costs to be between $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in the FY2011 budget to increase cleanup resources. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in the FY2011 budget to increase cleanup resources. OMB estimated $200 million in assessments for FY2011 and $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. Legislation is needed for the federal government to resume collection of assessments. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced but not enacted to reauthorize the assessments. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstatement considering the balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. In FY2011, the President requested $730.5 million from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup, assuming $200 million in offsetting receipts from nuclear utility assessments. However, Congress only approved $507.0 million, citing the lack of reauthorization for the assessments. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, noting the lack of legislation for $200 million in offsetting receipts. The committee also highlighted a surplus in the fund exceeding the request by billions of dollars. P.L. 112-10 allocated $33.6 million for the fund in FY2011, significantly lower than the President's request of $496.7 million. The federal payment for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is $496.7 million, transferred from the Defense Environmental Cleanup Account. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires DOE to cover cleanup costs even if the fund is depleted, potentially necessitating additional federal funds in the future. The cleanup of federal uranium enrichment facilities is completed under DOE's Office of Environmental Management or the FUSRAP program of the Corps. Responsibility for long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management, which also manages pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel. Funding for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2011 was recommended at $188.6 million by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $188.6 million for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2011, the same as the President requested but slightly less than the $189.8 million appropriation enacted for FY2010. Funding needs for the Office of Legacy Management are likely to rise over time as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. PMAs prioritize \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and cooperatives, selling power at low rates to cover expenses and repay debt. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power to public bodies at low rates to cover expenses and repay debt. The FY2011 budget request for PMAs was $118.5 million, with a decrease of $4 million compared to FY2010. SWPA and WAPA require discretionary funding in addition to their receipts, while SEPA's receipts are expected to cover all operating costs in FY2011. In FY2011, SWPA and WAPA requested discretionary funding totaling $118.2 million, with SEPA's receipts expected to cover all operating costs. P.L. 112-10 appropriated the requested amount with a 0.2% rescission. BPA, a self-funded agency, receives no appropriations but funds activities through permanent borrowing authority, increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003. BPA funds activities through permanent borrowing authority, increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003. ARRA increased BPA's borrowing authority under the Transmission System Act to $7.7 billion. The FY2011 budget proposed expenditures for operating expenses, projects funded in advance, capital investments, and capital transfers. ARRA provided non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA for activities authorized in section 402 of the act. ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA for power transmission activities. WAPA now has borrowing authority from the United States Treasury up to $3.25 billion for building new transmission lines. Other agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Denali Commission. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, a decrease of $13.3 million from the previous year. The budget included $272.5 million for new reactor activities to handle new nuclear power plant license applications. No new commercial reactor construction applications had been submitted to NRC since the 1970s. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, including $272.5 million for new reactor activities to handle new nuclear power plant license applications. Electric utilities and generating companies have applied for licenses for 30 reactors since 2007 due to volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The NRC's proposed budget also included $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, including $272.5 million for new reactor activities to handle new nuclear power plant license applications. The NRC's FY2011 budget request also included $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's previously planned Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The requested amount would cover costs related to adjudicating the license withdrawal motion and activities for an orderly closure of Yucca Mountain licensing support. The NRC's FY2011 budget request of $531.6 million for operating reactors included activities such as safety inspections, license renewals, and security oversight. Homeland security spending within the NRC is set to increase by $3.8 million. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees, with exceptions for certain expenditures. The FY2011 request would result in a net appropriation of $138.3 million. The NRC's FY2011 budget request of $531.6 million for operating reactors includes safety inspections, license renewals, and security oversight. Expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund for waste repository licensing, homeland security, and DOE defense waste oversight are not subject to offset. The FY2011 request would result in a net appropriation of $138.3 million, a $16.4 million decrease from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including the inspector general's office."
