    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly since the 9/11 attacks, with new technologies like advanced X-ray systems and whole-body scanners, along with policy changes such as requiring laptop removal and liquid screening. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) oversees these changes, mandated by the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA) to ensure comprehensive security screening for all passengers and property on airline flights. Trusted traveler programs and expedited security measures are also implemented by TSA. The Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA) mandated TSA to provide comprehensive security screening for all airline passengers and property. Congress also directed TSA to check all passengers against terrorist watchlists. Despite challenges in implementing risk-based screening, TSA has mostly relied on a uniform risk assumption for airport checkpoint screening. The TSA has faced challenges in passenger screening, leading to a reliance on a uniform risk assumption for airport checkpoint screening. This contrasts with risk-based strategies used in other areas of aviation security. While technology like whole-body imagers has improved threat detection, constraints such as budget limitations have hindered a solely technology-driven approach. TSA personnel have limited resources for passenger screening. The TSA faces challenges in airport screening due to technology limitations, budget constraints, and other factors. Limited resources and space constraints at airports have led to cumbersome procedures for passengers, potentially affecting public perception of TSA. The TSA has faced criticism for inflexible security methods and unpredictable wait times at airports, leading to a shift towards risk-based screening. This approach has been controversial, with some initiatives supported by Congress while others have faced skepticism. The controversy surrounding risk-based screening at airports stems from differing views on what constitutes risk and how it should be assessed. The focus on security efforts should prioritize the main point to effectively mitigate potential threats, as advised by Frederick the Great and echoed by former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff. In a free and open society, perfect security is impossible. Security measures should be informed and designed to minimize risk by understanding the nature of security risks and identifying strategies to mitigate them. Risk in aviation security is a complex interaction of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. The focus should be on effectively mitigating potential threats rather than trying to protect against every risk. In aviation security, risk is a complex interaction of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Specific probability values for threats and vulnerabilities are limited, so categorical techniques are used to quantify security risk. Risk-based passenger screening focuses on detecting and managing threats by identifying individuals who may pose risks and using detection technologies to screen for weapons. The screening process in aviation security focuses on detecting and managing threats by identifying individuals who may pose risks and using detection technologies to screen for weapons and explosives. Vulnerabilities are addressed through multiple layers of security measures, such as reinforcing cockpit doors and deploying air marshals. Consequences are primarily mitigated by emergency management and response activities. The TSA focuses on risk assessment and security strategies for aviation, with emergency management and response activities primarily mitigating consequences. Risk scoring is used for air cargo security, but not for individual passengers in commercial aviation. Defining acceptable risk levels is a key challenge in establishing effective security measures. The TSA primarily uses categorical processes for risk assessment of airline passengers, including checking biographical data against databases and behavioral indicators. The validity of behavioral-based risk scores has been questioned, and there is a lack of agreement on specific risks to mitigate. The TSA's risk-based security strategy has faced criticism for not adequately considering all potential risks. This was highlighted when the agency proposed allowing small knives and sports equipment onboard aircraft in 2013, citing reduced threats and other security measures in place. Critics argued that risks beyond hijacking and terrorism, such as unruly passengers with knives, were not properly addressed. Critics, including flight attendants, pilots, and airlines, opposed TSA's proposal to allow small knives, golf clubs, and baseball bats on planes. Legislation was introduced to prevent TSA from lifting the ban, leading TSA to backtrack on its decision. Former TSA administrator Hawley raised concerns about the focus on small items during passenger screening, highlighting the risk of missing the bigger picture. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli expert Ron criticize the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in airport security. They argue that focusing on small items may lead to missing the bigger picture and that terrorists can exploit detection technology's limitations. Ron highlights that the box cutters used in the 9/11 attacks were not prohibited items at the time, showing the system's inability to adapt to evolving threats. Ron and Hawley criticize the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in airport security. They argue that terrorists can exploit technology's limitations and that a more proactive, flexible approach is needed. Israel's risk-based security model is highlighted as a successful alternative. Advocates of risk-based security point to Israel's successful approach, which includes demographic profiling, intelligence databases, and extensive security interviews to identify high-risk passengers. Despite ongoing threats, Israel has not experienced major terrorist attacks in over 40 years. Implementing a similar approach in the United States is seen as challenging due to legal and practical concerns. Implementing an Israeli-style approach to aviation security in the United States is considered problematic due to legal and practical concerns. Research suggests that a risk-based approach tailored to the U.S. aviation security framework would be more effective, politically feasible, socially acceptable, and legally defensible. Risk-based screening is part of a comprehensive security strategy, interacting with physical screening measures. Risk-based aviation security framework is part of a comprehensive approach to aviation security, interacting with physical screening measures. It allows TSA to focus resources on unknown and elevated risk passengers and modify security postures based on threats. Risk-based programs have been used since the early 1970s, influencing decisions on behavioral detection officers and air marshal deployment. Details about the interaction of these security components have not been publicly disclosed. Risk-based approaches to airline passenger screening have been utilized since the early 1970s, with the FAA using rudimentary passenger profiles before implementing 100% screening in 1973. In the late 1970s, walk-through metal detectors and X-ray scanners became mandatory, leading to a shift away from risk-based profiling techniques. However, the FAA continued to use profiling tools to analyze passenger name records for potential threats. In the late 1980s, concerns over aircraft bombings prompted airlines to ask all passengers two basic questions. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask passengers basic security questions to address concerns over aircraft bombings. The questions aimed to target elevated-risk checked baggage and increase passenger awareness of security threats. Despite criticism for being obvious, they served as rudimentary security screening measures. In 2006, TSA stopped using basic security questions for passengers, which were initially implemented after the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing in 1988. Instead, the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system was developed in the late 1990s to identify potential security threats based on flight reservation data patterns. The CAPPS system, implemented in the late 1990s, uses flight reservation data to identify potential security threats. Indicators may include purchasing one-way tickets or paying with cash. The \"no-fly\" list, developed by the FAA and FBI, had only 12 names on it on the day of the 9/11 attacks, none of them the hijackers. ATSA directed TSA to establish trusted traveler programs and expedite screening for participating passengers after 9/11. After the 9/11 attacks, the ATSA directed TSA to establish trusted traveler programs and expedite screening for participating passengers, focusing on risk-based screening to enhance security measures. This was in response to recommendations made by the Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team. The Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team recommended risk-based screening for passengers and baggage post-9/11 attacks. TSA initiated CAPPS II to enhance security measures by integrating identity authentication, watch list checks, and expanded risk assessments. CAPPS II was developed as a follow-on system to CAPPS, aiming to include identity authentication, watch list checks, and risk-based assessments of passengers. However, due to controversy over privacy and data protection, the TSA scrapped CAPPS II in 2004. In 2004, the 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists for air passengers to be screened against terrorist watchlists. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required TSA to take over passenger watchlist screening from air carriers and utilize the Terrorist Screening Database administered by the FBI. In 2004, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (P.L. 108-458) mandated TSA to assume passenger watchlist screening from airlines and utilize the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB). TSA implemented the \"Secure Flight\" program in 2009 for domestic flights and 2010 for international flights, fully operational since 2011, screening passenger information against terrorist watchlists. TSA is prohibited from using algorithms for risk scores or commercial data beyond airline passenger records. Secure Flight has been fully operational since 2011, screening passenger biographic information against terrorist watchlists, including the TSDB which contains fewer than 400,000 names. The Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) has grown to include about 875,000 names, serving as a principal data source for foreign terrorist identities in the TSDB. The expansion of TIDE to 875,000 names was due to increased reliance post-bombing attempt in 2009. TSDB has over 500,000 identities as of 2012, focusing on timely and accurate watchlist practices. Secure Flight compares passenger data against watchlists for airport security. Secure Flight compares airline passenger data against watchlists to determine access through airport checkpoints. It also checks for public health concerns. Records are destroyed within seven days if no match is found, but potential matches are retained for 7 years. Watchlist matches can be kept for up to 99 years. Secure Flight matches passenger data against watchlists for airport checkpoint access and public health concerns. Records are destroyed within seven days if no match is found, potential matches are kept for 7 years, and watchlist matches can be retained for up to 99 years. The system benefits from experience with the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) and collects data from airlines for international flights to the US. CBP cross-checks passenger data against law enforcement, customs, and immigration databases and terrorist watchlists using APIS. CBP uses the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) to assess risk on international travelers before arrival in the United States. The system compares passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify potential threats. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) assesses risk for international travelers by comparing passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify potential threats. The system uses risk scoring methods for cargo screening and retains data for up to 15 years, with passenger name record data depersonalized within six months and retained for up to five years in an active database. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. The data of international travelers is transferred to a dormant database for up to 10 years. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. CBP checks this information against various databases for potential threats. Secure Flight uses risk-based analysis from government and airline data to assess passenger status. TSA's SPOT program observes airport behavior to identify potential threats. The TSA's Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) program aims to identify potential threats by observing behavior at airports. Despite deploying almost 3,000 Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) at 176 airports by FY2012, the program has faced controversy over its high annual cost of $200 million and questions regarding its scientific validity and operational effectiveness. TSA claims that SPOT is based on scientifically validated behaviors to detect individuals who may pose a threat to the transportation network, utilizing law enforcement techniques such as criminal profiling and behavioral observation. The TSA's SPOT program aims to identify potential threats by observing behavior at airports. SPOT is rooted in law enforcement techniques, including criminal profiling and behavioral observation. While similar to law enforcement behavior analysis tools, SPOT focuses on interpreting non-verbal cues to detect individuals who may pose a threat to the transportation network. The TSA's SPOT program uses extensive interviewing methods to detect potential threats through behavioral observation. Unlike law enforcement, SPOT heavily relies on non-verbal cues and a formal scoring system to rate suspicion. Law enforcement combines these techniques with interrogation practices, while SPOT focuses on non-invasive observation techniques. The TSA's SPOT program utilizes behavior detection officers to quickly observe passengers for potential threats. Despite TSA's claims of effectiveness, the Government Accountability Office found that known terrorists had passed through checkpoints where BDOs were stationed without being identified. The SPOT program's effectiveness in identifying specific threats to aviation remains questionable. The GAO found that the SPOT program, which utilizes behavior detection officers at airports, was implemented without proper validation or cost-benefit analysis. TSA conducted validation studies showing behavior detection techniques were effective, but has not publicly released the results for independent review. TSA has taken steps to address GAO recommendations for improving behavior assessment methods and program management. Despite not publicly releasing the study for independent analysis, TSA has implemented specific steps to address GAO recommendations for improving behavior assessment methods, performance metrics, data collection, and program management. Additionally, TSA has collaborated with international counterparts to exchange information and refine the SPOT program. Despite positive validation study results, doubts about behavior detection techniques persist, with both GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General questioning the validity and utility of TSA's methods. In 2013, GAO found that TSA's behavior detection techniques lacked evidence to support their validity and utility. The metrics used by TSA to evaluate the program did not directly relate to deterring terrorism. GAO also noted significant individual differences among Behavior Detection Officers in terms of referrals to law enforcement, questioning the training and operational use of behavioral indicators. The SPOT program's effectiveness in achieving mission objectives has been questioned due to wide individual differences among Behavior Detection Officers in referrals to law enforcement. The metrics used to support SPOT's effectiveness were found to not directly relate to aviation security objectives, with significant lapses in records-keeping and a lack of consistent refresher training for officers. The TSA's SPOT program has faced criticism for not providing consistent refresher training for behavior detection officers, leading to questions about the program's efficacy. Despite concerns raised by the GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General, Congress has not taken specific action to address these issues. Despite criticism of behavioral detection approaches, TSA's Pre-Check program, aimed at expediting processing for low-risk passengers, has received positive feedback. Launched in 2011 and fully operational in 2012, Pre-Check is expanding its availability. It is free for select frequent flyers and members of trusted traveler programs, with others able to apply for a fee at TSA enrollment centers. The Pre-Check program, launched in 2011, expedites processing for low-risk passengers. It is free for select frequent flyers and trusted traveler program members, with others able to apply for a fee at TSA enrollment centers. The program is similar to the former Registered Traveler program, which was discontinued in 2009. The Registered Traveler program, launched in 2007, conducted extensive background checks on applicants. However, as it expanded in 2008, TSA eliminated the background check process, stating it was not essential for determining threats. The program was dismantled shortly after. In contrast, the Pre-Check program, launched in 2011, has resurrected extensive biographic-based background checks, indicating a reversal in TSA's stance on the value of these checks. Unlike Registered Traveler, Pre-Check does not issue a biometric credential. TSA has revived biographic-based background checks for the Pre-Check program, unlike the previous Registered Traveler program. Pre-Check participants receive a known traveler number for expedited screening, but random thorough physical screenings may still occur. Concerns exist over TSA's ability to authenticate boarding passes and traveler documents. TSA's reliance on boarding passes for Pre-Check authentication raises concerns due to limited ability to authenticate them. Deployment of authentication technologies faces challenges, potentially compromising access control to Pre-Check lanes. Applicants must provide biographic and biometric data for the Pre-Check program. The SORN outlines the process for individuals to apply for the Pre-Check program, requiring biographic and biometric data submission for security threat assessments. TSA conducts criminal history checks through the FBI and accepts applications from U.S. citizens, nationals, and legal permanent residents. Ineligibility criteria include recent criminal convictions or insanity findings. The Pre-Check program requires biographic and biometric data submission for security threat assessments. TSA conducts criminal history checks through the FBI and accepts applications from U.S. citizens, nationals, and legal permanent residents. Ineligibility criteria include recent criminal convictions or insanity findings. Applicants must pay a non-refundable processing fee of $85 and may be rejected based on criminal convictions, terrorist watchlists, Interpol data, and other law enforcement information. Approved travelers receive a Pre-Check Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Applicants must pay a non-refundable processing fee of $85 for the Pre-Check program. Once approved, travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Those who are not qualified can appeal within 30 days by providing supporting records. TSA opened the first enrollment center in Indianapolis in December 2013. TSA opened the first Pre-Check enrollment center for the general public in December 2013 at the Indianapolis airport. There may eventually be up to 300 enrollment centers nationwide with an online application process. Early feedback from frequent travelers indicates high satisfaction with Pre-Check, but rapid expansion could limit its benefits. The Pre-Check program has received positive feedback from users, with almost 54% being very satisfied or extremely satisfied, compared to less than 7% of frequent travelers satisfied with general TSA screening. However, the rapid expansion of the program could lead to longer wait times in Pre-Check lanes as more travelers join. Non-participating travelers may also benefit from occasional selection for expedited screening. Managed inclusion is a TSA initiative that identifies low-risk passengers for random selection to use Pre-Check lanes. Canine teams and behavioral detection officers screen passengers for potential threats, with those not flagged as high risk eligible for managed inclusion. Passengers are screened for potential threats and those not flagged as high risk may be randomly selected for Pre-Check lanes. Military servicemembers and cleared personnel can also use Pre-Check lanes for official and personal travel, along with family members under 12 years old. Military personnel, including active duty members, reservists, and National Guard members, can use Pre-Check screening lanes for official and personal travel. Family members under 12 years old can also use Pre-Check lanes when traveling with cleared military personnel. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard will be allowed to participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Pre-Check lanes are used to expedite screening for uniformed airline crewmembers as well. The Known Crew Member identification initiative allows airline crewmembers to undergo expedited screening by checking their airline-issued identification credentials against a secure database. This process includes fingerprint-based criminal history record checks and security threat assessments, ensuring eligibility for expedited screening similar to Pre-Check applicants. Airline crew, military personnel, and defense personnel undergo extensive background screening for expedited screening eligibility. TSA considers them lower risk compared to the general population and comparable to trusted travelers vetted by TSA or CBP. The credentialing process for these individuals provides secure means of verifying identity and eligibility for expedited screening. The TSA uses random selection for certain sub-populations like airline crews and military personnel for expedited screening. This adds an unpredictable element to screening in line with a risk-based security approach. Various forms of identifying data are collected and retained for each risk-based screening program, including biographic, biometric, and intelligence sources. The TSA collects identifying data from various sources for risk-based screening programs. Data retention rules vary, with records of potential threats kept longer than others. Data voluntarily submitted by individuals not considered threats are retained throughout their participation in programs. The TSA collects identifying data for risk-based screening programs, retaining information voluntarily submitted by individuals not considered threats. Data may be shared among DHS agencies for counterterrorism efforts and with law enforcement agencies for investigating potential violations. The TSA collects data for risk-based screening programs and shares it with various agencies for counterterrorism efforts and investigations. Data is protected according to the Privacy Act of 1974 and appeals procedures are in place for individuals identified as security threats. The TSA collects data for risk-based screening programs and shares it with agencies for counterterrorism efforts. Individuals identified as security threats can appeal and have their records modified. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 required DHS to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress for those wrongly identified as threats. The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program allows individuals to file complaints online or by mail for redress. The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) was established to address situations where individuals claim they were wrongly singled out. Passengers can file complaints online or by mail, and DHS will request supporting information within 30 days. A control number is provided for tracking the inquiry status. If a traveler was delayed due to misidentification, DHS will outline steps to resolve the issue, such as presenting a response letter during check-in. If dissatisfied, passengers can appeal the decision. The DHS TRIP program addresses issues where travelers claim they were wrongly singled out. Passengers can file complaints online or by mail, and DHS will request supporting information within 30 days. If a traveler disagrees with the resolution decision made by DHS, they may appeal. TSA decisions based on Secure Flight program records are exempt from judicial review. TSA sought information in 2013 to expand expedited screening by using third-party prescreening of passengers. The TSA is using data elements to assess the risk posed by individuals in the aviation system and share the information with Secure Flight. Third parties can use legally available data services, but accuracy and security are concerns. There are plans to use commercial databases for passenger risk assessments, raising privacy and data accuracy issues. The use of commercial data for passenger risk assessments has raised privacy and accuracy concerns. Non-federal government and private databases may already be used for passenger prescreening, including CBP's ATS, Secure Flight, Pre-Check applications, and TSA's Transportation Security Enforcement Records System. Details of specific programs utilizing commercial data have not been publicly disclosed. Congress previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening, but TSA systems may still utilize commercial data for risk assessments, raising privacy concerns. Congressional oversight and potential legislative action may be needed to address this issue. Congress may need to address potential privacy concerns related to TSA's use of commercial data in risk-based assessments for airline passenger prescreening. Congressional oversight is crucial to review the effectiveness, efficiency, and data security of TSA's risk-based approach. Congressional oversight is essential for reviewing TSA's risk-based approach to airline passenger screening to ensure effectiveness, efficiency, and data security. Experts suggest that risk-based screening should be part of a comprehensive security strategy. It is important to assess how well these programs align with a broader risk-based framework. The risk-based approach to passenger screening, including programs like Pre-Check, is important for addressing shifting threats. The evolution of processes for terrorist watchlist information dissemination has been a key issue since the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. The evolution of processes for consolidating and disseminating terrorist watchlist information has been a key issue for the intelligence community since the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. Specific changes made in response have not been publicly acknowledged, including any evolution of behavioral detection methods by TSA. The adaptation of TSA's risk-based strategy and intelligence practices to shifting threats, resource changes, and new technologies may be of interest for congressional oversight. Identifying suitable metrics to assess the effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies has been challenging. The effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies is a key issue for congressional oversight. Identifying suitable metrics has been challenging due to the secrecy surrounding security measures and limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism. Concerns over false alarms arise from the limited number of terrorist encounters. TSA's choice of metrics for programs like Pre-Check has been questioned, with an emphasis on efficiency rather than security effectiveness. TSA's focus on efficiency metrics over security effectiveness in programs like Pre-Check raises concerns about false alarms and potential misidentification of threats. The limited number of terrorist encounters increases the frequency of false alarms, which could lead to misallocation of screening resources and complications for individuals mistakenly targeted. Efforts to reduce false positives may create gaps in threat detection capabilities. The effectiveness of initiatives to reduce false alarms in aviation passenger pre-screening, such as systematic database checks and a redress process for falsely targeted individuals, has not been publicly disclosed. Assessing efficiency gains from risk-based screening initiatives is crucial for TSA oversight and appropriations, with anticipated savings of $120 million and potential staffing reductions. The TSA anticipates $120 million in savings and 1,500 staffing reductions through risk-based screening initiatives. Congressional oversight will examine security effectiveness and privacy protections in TSA operations. The TSA's implementation of a risk-based approach to passenger screening raises concerns about the integration of privacy protections and data security measures. Questions persist about the adaptability of the approach to changes in the threat landscape, resource availability, and new procedures and technologies. Additionally, there are doubts about the identification of appropriate metrics for assessing the effectiveness of risk-based programs in detecting and mitigating threats to civil aviation. Despite elaborate security measures post-9/11, the potential for large-scale aviation attacks remains. Balancing privacy with effective risk-based security strategies is crucial for aviation security policy. The debate over balancing privacy with effective risk-based security strategies in aviation security policy is likely to remain a central issue for possible congressional oversight."
