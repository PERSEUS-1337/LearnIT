    "content": "The Clean Air Act of 1970 established different approaches for existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were given state discretion to set emission ceilings, while new sources had to adhere to EPA-set standards to prevent new pollution problems. The Clean Air Act of 1970 gave states discretion to set emission ceilings for existing sources of air pollution, while new sources had to follow EPA-set standards to prevent new pollution issues. New sources must undergo NSR before being built in areas cleaner or dirtier than national standards, requiring permits with emission limits based on technology standards. The Clean Air Act of 1970 allows states to set emission limits for existing sources, while new sources must undergo NSR before construction. This process includes obtaining permits with emission limits based on technology standards like \"best available control technology\" or \"lowest achievable emission rate.\" The act also applies NSPSs and NSR to modifications of existing sources, triggering requirements for major new sources or modifications in PSD and nonattainment areas. The Clean Air Act of 1970 allows states to set emission limits for existing sources, while new sources must undergo NSR before construction. NSR applies to modifications of existing sources in PSD and nonattainment areas, triggered by proposals for major new sources or modifications. The definition of \"modification\" under the CAA includes any physical change that increases air pollutant emissions or results in the emission of new pollutants. The Clean Air Act of 1970 allows states to set emission limits for existing sources, while new sources must undergo NSR before construction. NSR applies to modifications of existing sources in PSD and nonattainment areas, triggered by proposals for major new sources or modifications. The definition of \"modification\" includes any physical change that increases air pollutant emissions or results in the emission of new pollutants. This definition determines changes subject to NSPSs and triggers NSR, covering changes that increase emissions. The definition of \"reconstruction\" involves replacing components of an existing facility to such an extent that the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds. EPA defines a \"reconstruction\" as a replacement of components exceeding a certain cost threshold. The EPA defines \"reconstruction\" as the replacement of components in an existing facility exceeding a certain cost threshold, triggering NSPSs and NSR. Unlike modifications, a change in a facility can constitute a reconstruction regardless of emission increases. EPA also outlines six types of changes in a stationary source that are not considered modifications. The EPA outlines six types of changes in a stationary source that are not considered modifications, including maintenance, repair, and replacement (RMRR) activities. The RMRR exemption was previously determined through case-by-case analysis, following a common-sense approach approved in the Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly case. The EPA's case-by-case approach, approved in Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly, determines if proposed work triggers NSPS and PSD-area NSR permits. In WEPCO, extensive renovations were proposed, including turbine generators and boilers. EPA ruled the proposal was not RMRR, upheld by the Seventh Circuit. The EPA's case-by-case approach, as seen in Wisconsin Electric Power Co. v. Reilly, determines if proposed work requires NSPS and PSD-area NSR permits. In WEPCO, extensive renovations were proposed for a power plant, with the court ruling that the work went beyond routine maintenance due to its substantial nature, high cost, and infrequency. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point in recent years, especially after CAA enforcement actions were taken against electric utilities for exceeding routine maintenance without installing NSR controls. In response to CAA enforcement actions against power plants in the Midwest and South, President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group directed EPA to review the impact of NSR regulations. EPA's June 2002 report recommended specifying certain activities as \"routine maintenance\" and issued final regulations on emission calculations for NSR purposes in December 2002. EPA also proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exemption on the same day. On December 31, 2002, EPA published final regulations for NSR purposes, including changes in emission calculations and amendments to NSR rules. A proposed rule was also introduced to clarify the RMRR exception. The Eleventh Circuit's decision in EPA v. Whitman addressed violations of the CAA by TVA in rehabilitation projects at coal-fired power plants. The EPA issued an administrative compliance order (ACO) affirmed by the Environmental Appeals Board, endorsing the agency's multi-factor test for RMRR as applied in WEPCO. The Eleventh Circuit found that the CAA allows EPA to issue administrative compliance orders (ACOs) as law, but cannot impose severe penalties without proving violations in district court. This decision did not address the RMRR exception itself, which was later reshaped by EPA in October 2003. The October, 2003 final rule reshaped the contours of the RMRR exception by declaring certain equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR, providing greater regulatory certainty without sacrificing environmental protection. EPA's new approach addresses criticism of the old case-by-case method, aiming to support safe and efficient plant operation. The new rule specifies that replacing components with identical ones or functional equivalents constitutes RMRR if the cost is less than 20% of the unit's value, doesn't change design parameters, and meets emission limits. EPA's approach aims to provide regulatory certainty and support plant operation efficiency. The new rule allows for component replacement under more circumstances than the former case-by-case approach, with higher thresholds making the old approach uncommon. No recordkeeping requirements are imposed, relying on existing business records and EPA's authority for enforcement. The new rule allows for component replacement under more circumstances than the former case-by-case approach, with higher thresholds making the old approach uncommon. The rule imposes no recordkeeping requirements, relying on existing business records and EPA's authority for enforcement. It applies only to conduct after the rule's effective date and does not constitute a defense to pending CAA enforcement actions. Multiple lawsuits argue that the equipment-replacement RMRR rule goes beyond EPA's authority under the CAA. The State of New York v. Environmental Protection Agency case involves challenges to the equipment-replacement RMRR rule, which has been temporarily suspended by the court pending a full review. The court granted a stay based on the petitioners demonstrating irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits. This decision indicates a potential challenge for the EPA in defending the rule, which was set to take effect on December 26, 2003. The court also declined to consolidate these actions with other cases but designated the same panel for the equipment-replacement rule. The court declined to consolidate the above actions with another group of cases challenging the December, 2002 final rule but designated the same panel for the equipment-replacement rule cases due to their related nature."
