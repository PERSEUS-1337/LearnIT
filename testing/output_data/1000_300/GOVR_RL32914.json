    "content": "Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a concern for Navy officials and Members of Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that funding levels for the Navy's shipbuilding plan may need to be significantly higher than current levels. This has led to reduced ship procurement rates and concerns about the future size of the Navy and shipyards. Congress must decide how to address these rising costs, which could impact Navy capabilities and the shipbuilding industry. The issue for Congress is how to respond to rising Navy ship procurement costs, which could affect future Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. Options include increasing funding, changing budget allocation, utilizing multiyear procurement, adjusting acquisition strategy, reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs, improving efficiency, building ships without some equipment, and considering foreign construction. The report focuses on reducing Navy ship procurement costs by shifting to designs with lower unit costs, including options for lower-cost attack submarines, aircraft carriers, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants. This approach is considered in response to rising Navy ship procurement costs and aims to address future Navy capabilities and funding requirements. The report discusses options for lower-cost designs for attack submarines, aircraft carriers, larger surface combatants, and smaller surface combatants. It reviews recent legislative activity related to rising Navy ship procurement costs and includes proposals from various reports on the future of the Navy. Options for lower-cost Navy ship designs can include reducing ship size and shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion, as suggested by reports from the CBO, DOD's Office of Force Transformation, and the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. These changes can help reduce procurement costs for various types of Navy ships. Shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion can significantly reduce Navy ship procurement costs by using commercial-like hulls instead of military survivability standards. This strategy, initially proposed for smaller Navy surface combatants, can be applied more widely to submarines and aircraft carriers. The Navy is considering using commercial-like hulls for its Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) squadron to reduce costs and improve production economies of scale. This strategy can be applied more widely to multiple ship classes, such as using a common hull design for the DDG-1000 destroyer and CG(X) cruiser. The OFT report suggests building four large surface ships with a common merchant-like hull design. The Navy is considering using commercial-like hulls for its Maritime Prepositioning Force (Future) squadron to reduce costs and improve production economies of scale. The OFT report proposes building four large surface ships\u2014an aircraft carrier, a missile-and-rocket ship, an amphibious assault ship, and a small-craft \"mother\" ship\u2014using a common merchant-like hull. Lower-cost ship designs using these approaches will be individually less capable than the currently planned ship designs. The Navy is currently procuring one Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) per year at a cost of about $2.6 billion. Potential lower-cost options include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The discussions in the report outline these options for cost reduction. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs. To support this, they may need to procure 35 boats between FY2007-FY2022. One option for cost reduction is a non-nuclear-powered submarine with AIP, while another is a reduced-cost SSN using new technology. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs. To support this, they may need to procure 35 boats between FY2007-FY2022. Options for cost reduction include non-nuclear-powered submarines with AIP systems or reduced-cost SSNs using new technology like \"Tango Bravo.\" Non-nuclear-powered submarines are cheaper due to smaller size and different propulsion systems. The OFT report suggests including AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines in the future Navy fleet. The OFT report proposed including air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines in the future Navy fleet. AIP submarines could be procured alongside Virginia-class boats, with the possibility of substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in each carrier strike group. This could result in an average unit procurement cost of roughly $600 million to $750 million for an AIP submarine. The potential inclusion of air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines in the Navy fleet could allow for the procurement of four AIP submarines for the cost of one Virginia-class submarine. This could result in an average unit procurement cost of $600 million to $750 million for an AIP submarine, potentially reducing the equal-cost ratio of substitution to three to one or even closer to two to one. This could make the annual cost of procuring one Virginia-class SSN plus one, two, or three AIP submarines equal to or less than that of procuring two Virginia-class boats per year. New technologies may now allow for the design of a new SSN with higher capability standards. The Navy and DARPA are developing new technologies under the Tango Bravo program to design a smaller, less expensive submarine with capabilities equivalent to the Virginia class. This initiative aims to reduce platform infrastructure and production costs while increasing payload capacity. The Navy and DARPA are collaborating on the Tango Bravo program to develop a smaller, cost-effective submarine with capabilities similar to the Virginia class. The focus is on reducing platform infrastructure and production costs, while increasing payload volume. The program aims to overcome technology barriers in shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal array alternatives, simplified submarine systems, and automation for reduced crew workload. If successful, these technologies could lead to the design of a new submarine. The Navy and industry officials are considering developing a new submarine, referred to as \"Tango Bravo,\" with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost. This submarine could potentially be procured at a rate of two per year, making it more feasible within available resources. The idea of designing a submarine with equivalent capabilities to the Virginia class and lower costs has been discussed as an alternative to procuring AIP submarines. The Navy and industry officials are considering developing a new submarine, referred to as \"Tango Bravo,\" with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost. Virginia-class procurement could continue at one per year until the Tango Bravo submarine is ready for procurement, at which point Virginia-class procurement would end. Design work on the Tango Bravo submarine is being pursued for potential lower-cost options, including medium-sized, conventionally powered carriers based on different hull designs. The Navy is exploring potential lower-cost options for carriers, including medium-sized, conventionally powered designs. The current large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers have a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons and can embark an air wing of 75 CTOL airplanes and helicopters. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is part of the new CVN-21 class and is scheduled to be procured in FY2008. The cost of the next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is estimated at $10.5 billion, with procurement scheduled for FY2008. It is part of the new CVN-21 class and is planned to enter service in 2015. The Navy is also considering lower-cost options for carriers, including medium-sized, conventionally powered designs. The Navy is considering lower-cost options for aircraft carriers, including medium-sized, conventionally powered designs based on different hull designs. The CSBA report recommended procuring CVN-21-class carriers as needed to maintain a force of 10 large carriers. The CSBA report recommended procuring CVN-21-class aircraft carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers. Additionally, it suggested acquiring four medium-sized carriers based on the LHA(R) design, with a unit cost of approximately $3 billion each. The OFT report proposed a medium-sized carrier with a displacement of 57,000 tons, capable of carrying 30 Joint Strike Fighters and 6 other manned aircraft. The OFT report recommended a carrier design with a displacement of 57,000 tons, capable of carrying 30 Joint Strike Fighters, 6 MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, and 15 UAVs. It also suggested substituting two of these carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers. Alternatively, a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons was proposed as an option. The OFT report recommended a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons to replace the Navy's current large carriers. The ship would carry a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft and 8 UAVs, with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. It would be slightly larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton aircraft carrier and smaller than Spain's 17,000-ton carrier or the UK's three existing 20,600-ton carriers. The OFT report recommended a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons to replace the Navy's current large carriers. It would be faster than existing carriers and could potentially substitute eight of these carriers for each current large carrier. Other potential designs discussed include a large, conventionally powered carrier displacing about 100,000 tons. A large conventionally powered carrier design is being considered, with a potential displacement of 100,000 tons and a procurement cost lower than that of CVN-78. Another option is a medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull design, with a displacement of about 40,000 tons and the ability to embark two dozen VSTOL JSFs. The CSBA-recommended conventionally powered carrier based on the LHA(R) design might displace about 40,000 tons and embark two dozen VSTOL JSFs. A nuclear-powered version of this ship would cost more than $3 billion and be similar to France's Charles de Gaulle carrier. Additionally, the Naval War College developed a conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons and an air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs. The Naval War College developed a conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons, a maximum speed of 60 knots, and an embarked air wing of about seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters. The table shows different options for aircraft carriers based on size, propulsion type, and hull type, including medium-sized carriers that can operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft. Small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. The Navy has procured nuclear-powered cruisers in the past, but combining a nuclear propulsion plant with a commercial-like hull for a small carrier may be contradictory in design. The current design includes the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser. The Navy's current design includes the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser. Potential lower-cost options are the roughly 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD) and the roughly 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)). The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the CG(X) being larger and more expensive than the DDG-1000. The first two DDG-1000s are to be procured in FY2007 using split funding. The DDG-1000 would have a full-load displacement of about 14,500 tons, making it 50% larger than the Navy's current Aegis cruisers. The Navy plans to procure two DDG-1000s in FY2007 using split funding. The DDG-1000 would be 50% larger than the Navy's current Aegis cruisers, with a full-load displacement of about 14,500 tons. The estimated cost for the first two ships is $3.3 billion each, with the following ships costing around $2.5 billion each. There are concerns that procurement costs may be higher than Navy estimates. Initially, the Navy planned to acquire 16 to 24 DDG-1000s, but now aims for a 313-ship fleet. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) believes DDG-1000 procurement costs may be higher than Navy estimates. The Navy plans to procure a total of 7 DDG-1000s as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, and a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. A lower-cost surface combatant option could be a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, smaller than the DDG-1000 but larger than the Arleigh Burke class destroyers. This ship, potentially named the smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD), could incorporate advanced technologies, cost less to procure, and have reduced crew size for lower operation costs. A lower-cost surface combatant option could be a new-design ship called the smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD), incorporating advanced technologies and having reduced crew size for lower operation costs. The SCD would carry a payload smaller than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but larger than current Ticonderoga (CG-47) Aegis cruisers or DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers. It could have a land-attack oriented version with two Advanced Gun Systems (AGSs) like the DDG-1000, or an air- and missile-defense version preserving CG(X) radar capabilities. A smaller, less expensive new-design ship called the FFG(X) has been suggested as an alternative to the DDG-1000/CG(X) effort and the Littoral Combat Ship program. The FFG(X) could displace about 6,000 tons with a unit procurement cost of around $800 million. It may not be equipped with the AGS, limiting its naval gunfire capability compared to the DDG-1000, but it could perform non-gunfire missions similar to both the DDG-1000 and the LCS. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) could serve as a replacement for the Navy's FFG-7 class frigates and DD-963 class destroyers, offering a middle ground in size and capability. It may not have the AGS for naval gunfire support like the DDG-1000, but could still perform various missions. Another option proposed is a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship, potentially equipped with one or two AGSs. A third option for a smaller, less expensive, new-design ship is suggested by CBO and CSBA - a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the San Antonio (LPD-17) amphibious ship. This option would involve placing one or two AGSs on the basic LPD-17 hull design, with estimated costs of about $1.9 billion for the initial ship and $1.5 billion for subsequent ships. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. The LCSs are small, fast surface combatants with modular weapon systems. The Navy aims for a procurement cost of no more than $220 million per LCS sea frame. The average ship procurement cost, including mission modules, is estimated to be around $387 million. The Office of Force Transformation (OFT) report recommended procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant as an alternative to the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). This ship would have a maximum speed of 40 to 50 knots, standard interfaces for modular mission packages, and self-deployment capabilities. The report also suggested supporting this ship in theater with larger types of ships. Additionally, the OFT report proposed an alternative option of a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces. The OFT report recommended procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for accepting modular mission packages. These ships would be supported in theater by a \"mother ship\" based on a 57,000-ton hull used for OFT's proposed medium-sized aircraft carrier. The potential lower-cost ship designs can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. The potential ship designs can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. Developing and designing a large Navy ship can cost billions of dollars, and switching to a lower-cost design may save money in the long run if the financial break-even point is reached compared to continuing with the current design. The decision to switch to a lower-cost ship design could save money in the long run if the cumulative procurement savings exceed the additional development costs. Stopping an existing ship acquisition program early could expedite reaching the break-even point with a new design. Utilizing existing technologies for the new design could significantly reduce development costs. By utilizing existing technologies for a lower-cost ship design, development costs can be reduced through the learning curve process. Building more ships to the same design decreases labor hours required, making the switch to a new design potentially more cost-effective in the long run. Utilizing a lower-cost ship design can reduce development costs through the learning curve process. Building more ships to the same design decreases labor hours required, making the switch potentially more cost-effective in the long run. Navy ships are expensive to operate and can remain in service for many years. Navy ships are costly to operate and can stay in service for decades. Ship life-cycle O&S costs can exceed procurement costs, with crew size reduction and automation technologies being ways to lower O&S costs. Design features that increase procurement costs may help reduce O&S costs in the long term. Reducing crew size and implementing automation technology can lower ship O&S costs. However, adding technology may increase procurement costs if it is more expensive than building extra crew-related spaces. Maintenance costs can also be reduced by using more durable materials or increasing the size of certain ship spaces for easier access during maintenance. Alternative ship designs may have lower procurement costs but higher life-cycle O&S costs due to incorporating features that increase maintenance expenses. Alternative ship designs may have lower procurement costs but higher life-cycle O&S costs due to features that increase maintenance expenses, such as using more durable materials or increasing space for easier maintenance access. Nuclear-powered ships have higher initial costs due to the inclusion of the fuel core, like in the case of a nuclear-powered attack submarine costing about $158 million in 2004 for a 33-year lifespan. The cost of the nuclear fuel core for a nuclear-powered ship is significant, with a core for a submarine costing about $158 million in 2004 for a 33-year lifespan, and a core for a carrier costing about $300 million for half of its 50-year lifespan. Despite higher initial procurement costs, nuclear-powered ships do not incur fuel-related O&S costs over their lifetime, unlike conventionally powered ships. The difference in cost between a nuclear-powered submarine and a conventionally powered submarine is smaller when considering procurement and life-cycle O&S costs. The same applies to comparing a nuclear-powered carrier to a conventionally-powered carrier if the cost of the nuclear-powered carrier's second core is less than the conventionally powered carrier's fuel costs. Higher oil prices make nuclear power more cost-effective. The higher oil costs are expected to be, the more cost-effective nuclear power might be for powering ships. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to transport the reactor compartment to a storage area. This disposal work could cost around $30 million to $35 million for a nuclear-powered submarine. The cost of disposing of nuclear-powered ships is high due to the need to defuel, cut out, and seal the reactor compartment for transport to a storage area. This process can cost around $30 million to $35 million for a submarine and up to $570 million for a carrier. Lower-cost ship designs may have reduced capabilities compared to higher-cost counterparts, except for the Tango Bravo SSN which could match the Virginia-class design in capability. Factors to consider in ship capability include payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and the value of ship numbers in naval operations. The Navy-DARPA Tango Bravo program focuses on advanced ship technologies, considering ship payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and the value of ship numbers in naval operations. As Navy combat ships decrease in size, their total payload decreases, impacting their capabilities. Factors like propulsion play a role, with larger ships requiring less horsepower per ton to move through water at a certain speed. This results in smaller ships being not just less capable than larger ones, but proportionately less capable. As ship size increases, the amount of horsepower needed decreases, allowing for more payload capacity. For example, a medium-sized carrier with a 40% reduction in size may only carry 40% of the aircraft weight compared to a larger carrier. Transferring the air wing to a larger carrier can increase sortie generation due to its larger flight deck. Reducing ship size can limit payload capacity and equipment capabilities. For instance, a carrier smaller than a certain size may not be able to operate certain aircraft, while a smaller surface combatant may lack essential radar, sonar, and missile-launching capabilities. Reducing ship size can limit payload capacity and equipment capabilities. The total cost of combat-related equipment at sea can increase as ship size decreases, leading to higher total procurement costs. If crew size and fuel consumption do not decrease proportionately with ship size, total fleet operation and support costs may also rise. The use of new technologies could help mitigate these challenges. The OFT report argues that new technologies can increase payload capacity for smaller surface combatants by improving precision-guidance technology for weapons. This allows for reducing weapon size without compromising capability, as smaller warheads can achieve the same damage as larger ones. Additionally, advancements in sensor technology could further reduce weight and volume, leading to cost savings in fleet operation and support. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them no more detectable by enemy sensors than smaller ships. They also claim that larger ships built to military standards can better withstand hits and continue operations after being attacked. Supporters of smaller ships or ships built with commercial-like hulls argue that larger ships may be more survivable after a hit, but making them less detectable increases costs. They believe a fleet of small ships can overwhelm the enemy with targets and that even large military-grade ships can be sunk or disabled. Supporters of smaller ships argue that a fleet of small ships can overwhelm the enemy with targets and have superior overall fleet survivability compared to larger ships. They also suggest that U.S. leaders may be hesitant to risk expensive Navy ships in high-threat situations, reducing their effectiveness. Equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant fundamentally changes its mobility and operational capabilities. Supporters argue that nuclear power is essential for a true submarine, as it allows for extended underwater operations. An AIP system, like a fuel-cell or closed-cycle diesel engine, extends the submerged endurance of a non-nuclear-powered submarine. A conventional diesel-electric submarine can stay submerged for a few days, while an AIP-equipped submarine can last up to two or three weeks. However, an AIP system does not significantly increase the high-speed submerged endurance of a non-nuclear-powered submarine, which is limited to 1 to 3 hours due to battery capacity. A non-nuclear-powered submarine, whether equipped with a conventional diesel-electric propulsion system or an AIP system, has limited high-speed submerged endurance due to battery capacity. In contrast, a nuclear-powered submarine can remain submerged for weeks or months, operating at high speeds whenever needed. Non-nuclear-powered submarines are not well suited for missions requiring long, completely stealthy transits or extended submerged periods. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of submarines, especially those equipped with AIP systems, for missions requiring long, stealthy transits or extended submerged periods. The report suggests transporting AIP submarines to overseas theaters of operation aboard a transport ship to maintain stealth. In contrast, nuclear-powered submarines can operate for weeks or months at high speeds, making them more suitable for certain missions. Additionally, having an SSN in a carrier strike group allows for flexibility in mission deployment without alerting others. The potential advantage of having an SSN in a carrier strike group is the ability to redirect it to a different theater for a separate mission without alerting opposing forces. This allows the SSN to operate in two theaters simultaneously, maximizing military effectiveness. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in a carrier strike group would depend on the types of operations it needs to perform. Nuclear-powered carriers have significant advantages, such as high-speed transits without refueling, immediate combat readiness upon arrival, and more space for aircraft fuel and ammunition storage, allowing for longer sustained combat operations. Advocates of higher-speed ships like the LCS argue that their increased speed allows for rapid location shifts and makes them harder to track. Skeptics question the benefits of speeds exceeding 30 knots. Advocates of a larger fleet argue for lower-cost ship designs to increase the number of ships available for deployment. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that having more ships would allow for better presence in multiple locations and quicker response to crises. They suggest that a fleet with a greater number of less-capable ships could offer more flexibility and cost efficiency in deploying naval forces. Additionally, they believe that the force's capability grows with a larger number of ships under the theory of network-centric warfare. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships can enhance presence in various locations and improve response times to crises. They believe that a fleet with more ships, even if less capable individually, can offer greater flexibility and cost efficiency in deploying naval forces. Additionally, they argue that the force's overall capability grows with a larger number of ships, aligning with the theory of network-centric warfare. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships can enhance presence in various locations and improve response times to crises. They believe that a fleet with more ships, even if less capable individually, can offer greater flexibility and cost efficiency in deploying naval forces. Additionally, they argue that the force's overall capability grows with a larger number of ships, aligning with the theory of network-centric warfare. On the other hand, defenders of a smaller fleet of more-expensive ships argue that current ship designs already provide adequate flexibility for creating naval formations with appropriate capability levels. They also highlight the Navy's efforts to increase the fraction of the fleet that is deployed or ready to be deployed at any given time, mitigating the effects of having a limited total number of ships. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that increasing the number of ships can enhance presence in various locations and improve response times to crises. They believe that a fleet with more ships, even if less capable individually, can offer greater flexibility and cost efficiency in deploying naval forces. Additionally, they argue that the force's overall capability grows with a larger number of ships, aligning with the theory of network-centric warfare. On the other hand, defenders of a smaller fleet of more-expensive ships argue that current ship designs already provide adequate flexibility for creating naval formations with appropriate capability levels. They could also argue that when numbers of aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and distributed sensors are taken into account, a fleet consisting of a smaller number of more-expensive ships would still have an adequate number of nodes for engaging in network-centric warfare. Some lower-cost options that might pose technical risks for the Navy include the AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarine, the Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarine, the 13,500-ton high-speed carrier, and the 1,000- and 100-ton surface combatants due to new technologies intended to increase their payload fractions. Smaller ships might offer a wider range of capabilities. Homeporting a nuclear-powered carrier or submarine can be more complex than conventionally powered ships due to unique requirements. Forward-homeporting a Navy ship in a foreign country can be politically difficult if it is nuclear-powered and faces anti-nuclear sentiments. Lower-cost ship designs may offer a wider range of homeporting possibilities. Forward-homeporting a Navy ship in a foreign country, especially if it is nuclear-powered, can be politically challenging due to anti-nuclear sentiments. Lower-cost ship designs could impact the Navy shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of work among shipyards, depending on the funding available for Navy ship procurement. The shift to lower-cost ship designs could impact Navy shipbuilding work volume depending on funding availability. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding, reduced total shipbuilding work, or increased funding leading to more shipbuilding work. The lower-cost ship designs in the report could impact the distribution of shipbuilding work among various shipyards, including General Dynamics' Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman Newport News. The division of work between the two yards for building submarines may change. The division of work between General Dynamics' Electric Boat (GD/EB) and Northrop Grumman Newport News (NGNN) for building submarines may change if both are involved in a program for designing and building AIP-equipped non-nuclear powered submarines. This could potentially impact U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers if AIP submarines are procured instead of nuclear-powered submarines. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers, while other shipyards like Ingalls or Avondale could potentially build medium-sized conventionally powered carriers. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers, while other shipyards like Ingalls or Avondale could potentially build medium-sized conventionally powered carriers. Shipyards with experience in building SES/catamaran hulls, such as Avondale and General Dynamics' National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, could also potentially construct high-speed carriers. The procurement of conventionally powered carriers instead of nuclear-powered ones could impact the workload for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. In terms of workload, a carrier nuclear propulsion plant is equivalent to five submarine nuclear propulsion plants. DDG-1000 destroyers to be built at NGSS and GD/BIW. Smaller surface combatants like LCS to be built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA shipyard. Other surface combatants could be built at these yards or others. The LCS will be built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA shipyard. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of H.R. 5122 limit procurement costs for various ships. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about rising costs and production schedules of defense programs. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about the rising costs and lengthening production schedules of major defense acquisition programs, leading to more expensive platforms fielded in fewer numbers. This could result in an over-reliance on costly ''mega'' systems, limiting the number of platforms purchased and creating a ''high demand, low density'' situation. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about rising costs and lengthening production schedules of major defense acquisition programs, leading to more expensive platforms fielded in fewer numbers. This could result in a ''high demand, low density'' situation with higher operational tempos, increased stress on military personnel, and limited strategic depth for US forces. The committee also raised concerns about the affordability and executability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan. The House Armed Services Committee raised concerns about the affordability and executability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan, citing unrealistic assumptions and a significant increase in shipbuilding funds required. The plan also assumes that ship acquisition programs can avoid cost growth, creating uncertainty about the future of naval shipbuilding. The House Armed Services Committee raised concerns about the affordability and executability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan, citing unrealistic assumptions and a significant increase in shipbuilding funds required. The committee is concerned about the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding plan, which has created uncertainty about the future of naval shipbuilding. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing the capacity of the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. The House Armed Services Committee raised concerns about the affordability and executability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan. They directed the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing the capacity of the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. The committee expressed deep concerns about the process used for establishing the Navy's ship cost estimates, noting inaccuracies and unrealistic estimates in the past. The committee raised concerns about inaccurate ship cost estimates in prior years and recommended revising the process to include all major known elements. They directed the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for specific ship classes to ensure affordability and executability of the Navy's shipbuilding plan. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for specific ship classes, including CVN-21, LHA Replacement program ships, and San Antonio class amphibious ships. The revalidated costs must be approved by the Under Secretary of Defense, with a report due by July 1, 2006, certifying that all major cost elements are included. (Page 71) The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for specific ship classes, including CVN-21, LHA Replacement program ships, and San Antonio class amphibious ships. The revalidated costs must be approved by the Under Secretary of Defense, with a report due by July 1, 2006, certifying that all major cost elements are included. Regarding the DDG-1000 program, the committee expressed concerns about affordability and the ability to meet original requirements due to budget constraints. The Navy proposed reducing the number of next-generation destroyers from 32 to 7 to make the program more affordable, but the committee questions if the original requirements can still be met. Reducing the requirements for the DD(X) could allow for the procurement of a smaller, less expensive destroyer in greater numbers. The committee supports the construction of up to two DD(X)s to demonstrate technologies that could be incorporated into future, more affordable, major surface combatants. The budget request contained no funds in PE 78730N for the maritime technology program, aimed at reducing the cost of naval ship construction. The committee supports the construction of up to two DD(X)s to demonstrate technologies for future surface combatants. The maritime technology program aims to reduce naval ship construction costs by enhancing efficiency and competitiveness. Incentive clauses in recent contracts have successfully lowered construction costs, encouraging their expansion to all ship procurements. The committee supports cost-saving efforts in naval ship construction through incentive clauses, grants, and loan guarantees. These initiatives aim to improve productivity and lower costs for ship procurements, including the T-AKE class program. The Navy will work with shipbuilders to identify and finance process changes, equipment investments, and facilities improvements to achieve savings in ship construction. The committee recommends funds for finance process changes, equipment investments, and facilities improvements to lower Navy ship procurement costs, including the T-AKE class ships. They also recommend funds for the shipbuilding industrial base improvement program and the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industrial base enhancement. Additionally, $120.0 million is recommended for the maritime technology program. The committee supports the national shipbuilding research program for collaborative improvements in shipbuilding processes. The committee recommends $20.0 million in PE 78730N for the national shipbuilding research program (NSRP), which operates on a 50-50 cost share between government and industry. The committee also emphasizes the importance of sustaining viable and efficient shipbuilding and ship repair industries in the United States. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants to support U.S. shipyards in developing innovative technologies and infrastructure for naval vessel construction. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of U.S. shipyards. Additionally, Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes incremental funding for aircraft carriers and Section 123 increases the cost limit for CVN-77. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends increased funding and economic order quantity purchases for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers, with a cost limit increase for CVN-77 to $6,057 million. The committee emphasizes the need for stable ship requirements, higher shipbuilding budget funding, and flexibility in funding large capital ships to address cost growth concerns. Increased funding and economic order quantity purchases for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers, along with a cost limit increase for CVN-77 to $6,057 million, are recommended by the Senate Armed Services Committee. Stable ship requirements, higher shipbuilding budget funding, and flexibility in funding large capital ships are crucial to address cost growth concerns. The committee also highlights the shipbuilder's proposal for program savings through a stable procurement plan and procurement of economic order quantity material for future aircraft carriers. The committee recommends a $50.0 million increase in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement to achieve potential program savings. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends increased funding and economic order quantity purchases for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers. They also suggest a cost limit increase for CVN-77 to $6.057 billion. The committee emphasizes the importance of stable ship requirements, higher shipbuilding budget funding, and flexibility in funding large capital ships to address cost growth concerns. Additionally, they recommend a $50.0 million increase in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement to achieve potential program savings. The report states that the procurement cost for CVN-77 has increased to $6.057 billion due to various factors. The Navy has implemented cost containment measures for CVN-77, including deferring upgrades and minimizing contract change orders. The Navy has implemented cost containment measures for CVN-77, including deferring upgrades and minimizing contract change orders. Despite these actions, the Navy projects the cost to exceed the baseline cap by over 30%. Visibility into cost performance is crucial to assess the effectiveness of these measures. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to provide quarterly reports to congressional defense committees starting December 1, 2006, on the CVN-77 ship construction contract, including contract target cost, Program Manager's Estimate at Completion, contractor's Estimate at Completion, contract ceiling price, end of period actual costs, and percent progress. This is to improve visibility into completion cost performance and assess the effectiveness of cost containment measures for CVN-77. The report highlights the cost risks associated with the construction of lead LCS vessels at two shipyards until completion in 2007 and 2008. Emphasizing cost control, the Navy should pursue competition, commonality, and learning curves in procuring this 55-ship class. The committee supports the Navy's approach to rapidly field this capability for the global war on terror, stressing the need for heightened program risk management to ensure affordability. The committee is concerned about apparent cost growth and lack of clear acquisition strategy for the LCS program. Affordability appeal is overshadowed by budgeting issues and uncertainties regarding added costs for training, maintenance, and supply support for LCS vessels. The Navy has assessed the added costs for training, maintenance, configuration management, planning, engineering, and supply support for two flight 0 ship classes. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report on the LCS program by December 1, 2006, outlining the acquisition strategy, competition plan, flight strategy, cost containment strategy, R&D, procurement costs, and added life cycle costs for two dissimilar flight 0 LCS designs. (Page 113) The report highlights the importance of the National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP-ASE) in reducing shipbuilding costs and improving efficiency through collaboration between the Navy and industry. The program has achieved savings, cost avoidance, and a high research-to-implementation transition rate. The committee emphasizes the significance of continuing the NSRP-ASE for enhancing the affordability of shipbuilding. The committee recommends increasing funding by $10.0 million in PE 78730N to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain to reduce material costs, exploring secondary markets for private shipbuilders, and broadening the business base for naval shipbuilding. The committee recommends increasing funding to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain to reduce material costs, exploring secondary markets for private shipbuilders, and broadening the business base for naval shipbuilding. Additionally, H.R. 5122 authorizes incremental funding for aircraft carriers and establishes unit procurement cost caps for various classes of ships. Section 125, 126, and 215 of H.R. 5122 establish unit procurement cost caps for LHA(R) amphibious assault ships, LPD-17 class amphibious ships, and Navy shipbuilding technology proposals. Section 1016 directs the Navy to assess naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. The new procurement cost caps can be adjusted for inflation. Section 122 does not allow the Secretary to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program. The report in Section 122 states that the Secretary cannot adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program. However, the conferees direct the Secretary to include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional action on program costs in the annual notice to the congressional defense committees. The CVN-21 class budget represents the Navy's assessment of the cost for completing design and construction of nuclear powered aircraft carriers, with uncertainties remaining for the next 15 years. The conferees acknowledge uncertainties in the design and construction of the future nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, allowing for adjustments to cost limitations to mitigate risks. Compliance with this provision may require trade-offs in procurement costs that could impact various aspects of the CVN-21 class project. The provision requires cost trade-offs in the design and construction of the CVN-21 class, with potential impacts on capabilities, system performance, safety, crew quality of life, and future growth margin. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reduction that could affect safety or crew quality of life. (Page 552) The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reduction that could affect safety or crew quality of life in the CVN-21 class. The amendment does not allow the Secretary to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program. Congressional actions may have a significant impact on program costs, and the Secretary is directed to assess any negative impact in the annual notice to defense committees. The LHA-6 budget reflects the Navy's assessment of costs for the future LHA Replacement ship. The conferees recognize uncertainties in completing LHA-6 design and construction, allowing adjustments to cost limitations for risk reduction. Navy expected to manage program within budget estimate, requiring procurement trade-offs for cost management. The conferees expect the Navy to manage program execution within budget constraints, allowing for procurement cost trade-offs that may impact various aspects of the LHA Replacement ship. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reductions that could affect safety or crew quality of life. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of cost control in Navy ship design and construction, noting the lack of a plan to meet cost targets. Cost growth in ongoing shipbuilding programs is a concern, with no initiatives in place to address it. Navy leadership acknowledges the need for cost control in shipbuilding programs but has not provided a plan to meet cost targets. The Committee urges the Navy to set firm cost targets, develop initiatives for cost control, and sign contracts to prevent cost growth. The report recommends reducing Navy's FY2007 procurement funding by $141.4 million to address cost growth in prior years. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs, with ongoing issues in ship construction contracts and a gap between public statements and actions. The Navy estimates an $867.9 million overrun in the CVN-77 production effort over the next 3 years, requiring Congressional legislation for funding. The Navy is facing cost overruns in shipbuilding programs, with the CVN-77 production effort estimated to have an overrun of $867.9 million over the next 3 years. Congressional legislation is needed to raise the cost cap on the program to address these issues. The U.S.S. Texas and U.S.S. North Carolina are also experiencing cost growth and performance challenges, jeopardizing the Navy's ability to meet contract goals and increase submarine production rates. The Committee is hesitant to provide additional appropriations without sufficient justification. The Committee is hesitant to provide increased appropriations for cost overruns in shipbuilding programs without compelling justification or a detailed cost control plan. The recommended funding for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs is $436,449,000, a reduction of $141,400,000 from the request, with allocations for various ship programs. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to increase annual funding. One option for addressing rising Navy ship procurement costs is to increase annual ship-procurement funding to an average of roughly $14.4 billion per year in constant FY2007 dollars. However, increasing funding substantially may be challenging due to finite defense funding, potentially requiring cuts in other Navy or DOD priorities. The Navy has tried to operate more efficiently to redirect savings to procurement programs, but rising costs in other areas have offset these efforts. Another option is to modify the way procurement is done. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to increase annual funding to around $14.4 billion per year. However, this may be challenging due to limited defense funding. Efforts to operate more efficiently have been offset by rising costs in other areas. Another option is to modify the way new Navy ships are funded, such as using incremental funding or advance appropriations. Multiyear procurement (MYP) could also be used more in Navy ship-procurement programs. One option to address rising Navy ship procurement costs is to increase annual funding to around $14.4 billion per year. Another option is to make greater use of multiyear procurement (MYP) in Navy ship-procurement programs, which could marginally increase the number of ships procured. However, not all programs may meet the legal requirements for MYP, and it could limit flexibility in adjusting ship-procurement plans in the future. Another option is to change the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships, such as having all DDG-1000 destroyers built by a single yard instead of dividing them between two yards. Changing the acquisition strategy for building Navy ships, such as having all DDG-1000 destroyers built by a single yard, could reduce costs by $3 billion for 10 ships. However, this could eliminate competition and innovation in design, quality, and cost control. Another option is to increase competition in Navy ship acquisition processes. To spur design innovation, constrain costs, maintain production quality, and ensure adherence to scheduled delivery dates, the Navy could make greater use of competition in ship acquisition. This would involve using competition between shipyards for building follow-on ships in each class, similar to practices in the 1980s. However, this approach requires a high annual procurement rate to support awarding contracts without risking the financial health of the shipyards. The awarding of contracts for building follow-on ships requires a high annual procurement rate to support contract awards without risking the financial health of shipyards. The government may need to consider giving ships to one yard or have the losing yard permanently withdraw from building that type of ship. Another option is to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs by eliminating excess capacity among yards building Navy ships. One way to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs is by eliminating excess capacity among yards building Navy ships. This can be achieved by increasing other types of work at the yards, such as construction for other government agencies or commercial ships, and improving operating efficiency through advanced design and production processes. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to improve the operating efficiency of yards building Navy ships by incorporating advanced design and production processes. A DOD report in May 2005 compares the efficiency of U.S. yards to foreign shipyards and makes recommendations for improvement. Another option is to build Navy ships without some planned equipment to reduce costs, although this may impact the ship's capabilities. Building a ship without some planned equipment may reduce costs but also impact its capabilities. Adding the equipment later would increase procurement costs, potentially exceeding the cost of building the ship with all planned equipment from the beginning. Another option is to build Navy ships in foreign shipyards to lower construction costs. Building a ship without planned equipment may reduce costs but affect capabilities. Adding equipment later could increase procurement costs, potentially exceeding the cost of building the ship with all planned equipment. An option is to construct Navy ships in foreign shipyards to lower construction costs, subject to authorization under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 for national security interests. The President must notify Congress of determinations related to national security interests before making contracts, with exemptions for inflatable boats. DOD appropriations act prohibits using funds for construction of naval vessels in foreign facilities. The RAND Corporation report discusses the increased cost of Navy ships today compared to decades ago and suggests options for reducing these costs."
