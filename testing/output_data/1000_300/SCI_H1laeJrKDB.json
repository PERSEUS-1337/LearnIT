    "content": "Recent deep generative models can provide photo-realistic images and content embeddings for computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Recent works have focused on studying the semantics of the latent space of generative models to improve interpretability. A new method is proposed in this paper to find meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control over specific properties of generated images. This weakly supervised method is suitable for identifying directions that encode simple transformations in the generated images. The method proposed in the paper allows for precise control over specific properties of generated images, such as position or scale, through weakly supervised learning. This approach is particularly effective for simple transformations like translation, zoom, or color variations in both GANs and variational auto-encoders. The increasing use of generative models for tasks like image in-painting and dataset synthesis highlights the need for better control over generated images. Generative models like GANs and variational auto-encoders lack control over generated images, limiting their use in tasks like dataset synthesis and deep-fakes. Attempts to improve control include modifying attributes of generated images by adding learned vectors to latent codes or combining latent codes of two images. Studying the latent space of generative models provides insights into their structure, which is valuable for learning unsupervised data representations. Generative models like GANs and variational auto-encoders lack control over generated images, limiting their use in tasks like dataset synthesis and deep-fakes. Radford et al. (2015) observed that latent spaces in auto-encoders exhibit a vector space structure encoding factors of variations in datasets. Images result from factors like objects, positions, and lighting. Factors of variations are categorized as modal (discrete values) and continuous (range of values). Humans naturally describe images using factors of variations, suggesting efficiency. The latent space of generative models can be explained through factors of variation, which are efficient representations of natural images. While control over image generation is often limited to discrete factors, a method is proposed in this paper to provide precise control over continuous factors of variations described by a real parameter. In this paper, a method is proposed to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over specific continuous factors of variations in image generation. The method does not require labeled data or an encoder model and can be applied to factors like vertical position, horizontal position, and scale. Our method allows for precise control over factors like vertical position, horizontal position, and scale in generative models without the need for labeled data or an encoder model. It can be adapted to other variations like rotations, brightness, contrast, and color. The effectiveness of our method can be quantitatively measured, and it reveals insights about the latent space structure. Key contributions include finding interpretable directions in the latent space and demonstrating precise control over generated image properties. The main contributions of the proposed method include finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, controlling properties of generated images precisely, introducing a novel reconstruction loss for inverting generative models, and discussing the challenges of inverting generative models with optimization. The study also explores the impact of disentanglement on controlling generative models, highlighting the ease of modifying image properties compared to obtaining labels for those properties. The proposed method aims to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models to control properties of generated images precisely. It involves a novel reconstruction loss for inverting generative models and discusses the challenges of inverting generative models with optimization. The study emphasizes the ease of modifying image properties compared to obtaining labels for those properties. The text discusses finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models to control properties of generated images. It involves a novel reconstruction loss for inverting generative models and addresses challenges with optimization. The goal is to determine the latent code of an image by minimizing a reconstruction error between the original image and its projection. The text discusses the choice of reconstruction error in optimizing generative models to avoid producing unrealistic and blurry images. Pixel-wise Mean Squared Error and cross-entropy are commonly used but lead to blurry images. Alternative reconstruction errors have been proposed but are computationally expensive. The poor performance of pixel-wise mean square error is attributed to favoring the expected value solution. The text explores the limitations of using pixel-wise Mean Squared Error in image reconstruction, attributing the poor performance to favoring expected value solutions and the inability to capture high-frequency texture details due to the limited capacity of the generator's latent space. The text discusses the limitations of using pixel-wise Mean Squared Error in image reconstruction, proposing a loss function that reduces the weight of high frequencies to generate sharper results with more details and realistic textures. The text proposes a loss function that allows for a larger range of possibilities in image generation, leading to more realistic and detailed images. It compares reconstruction errors and different choices of parameters, as well as quantitatively evaluates the performance using the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). The optimization problem of finding the optimal z for a given transformation is discussed, highlighting the challenges of using an L2 penalty due to the difficulty in choosing the hyper-parameter \u03b2. The text discusses using a centered Gaussian prior on the distribution of z for image generation, highlighting the challenge of choosing the hyper-parameter \u03b2 for the L2 penalty. It introduces Algorithm 1 for creating trajectories in the latent space corresponding to transformations in the pixel space, with parameters \u03b4t controlling the degree of transformation. In practice, initializing the problem of image generation can be challenging, with slow convergence possible due to unlucky initializations. Zhu et al. (2016) suggested using an auxiliary network to estimate z T for initialization, but training a specific network for this task is costly. The highly curved nature of the manifold of natural images in pixel space can lead to small gradients that slow down convergence. To address this, optimization is guided to improve convergence. In practice, the optimization of image generation can be challenging due to slow convergence caused by small gradients in pixel space. To address this, transformations are decomposed into smaller steps for sequential optimization. This approach does not require extra training and can be used directly. The undefined regions in transformed images are ignored when computing the loss function. When optimizing image generation, transformations are broken down into smaller steps for sequential optimization to address slow convergence. Undefined regions in transformed images are disregarded when calculating the loss function. Generative models may struggle to produce arbitrary images, leading to outliers that are mitigated by discarding latent codes with high reconstruction errors. To reduce outliers in image generation, latent codes with high reconstruction errors are discarded. Algorithm 1 is used to generate trajectories in the latent space, followed by defining a model to encode factors of variations. The model assumes that a factor's parameter can be predicted from the latent code coordinate along an axis. The model assumes a factor's parameter can be predicted from the latent code coordinate along an axis using a parametrized model g \u03b8 with trainable parameters. The model uses a parametrized model g \u03b8 to estimate parameters from latent code coordinates, training f (\u03b8,u) to minimize the MSE between \u03b4 t and f (\u03b8,u) (z \u03b4t ) \u2212 f (\u03b8,u) (z 0 ). This method allows for the estimation of image distribution generated by G using Equation 6. The method involves using gradient descent on a dataset produced by Algorithm 1 to estimate the distribution of images generated by G. By knowing g \u03b8, one can control how images are sampled, for example transforming z \u223c N (0, 1) using a specific distribution \u03c6. These results provide control over both individual outputs and the overall distribution of a generative model's outputs, which can help identify biases in the training dataset. Experiments were conducted on two datasets, including dSprites with binary 64 \u00d7 64 images. The experiments were conducted on two datasets: dSprites, consisting of binary 64 \u00d7 64 images with varying shapes, and ILSVRC, containing 1.2M natural images. The experiments were implemented using TensorFlow 2.0 and a BigGAN model, with code available for reproduction of results. The BigGAN model takes a latent vector and a one-hot vector as inputs for image generation. The study utilized a BigGAN model with TensorFlow-Hub weights for image generation. The model takes a latent vector and a one-hot vector as inputs, with the latent vector split into six parts for style modification. Additionally, \u03b2-VAEs were trained to explore disentanglement importance. Training was done on dSprites with an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps. The study focused on evaluating the effectiveness of the \u03b2-VAE architecture on complex datasets, specifically analyzing factors of variation like position and scale. Saliency detection was used for natural images generated by the BigGAN model to estimate the position of objects. Saliency detection was utilized to extract the barycenter from generated images using a model implemented in PyTorch. The evaluation involved sampling latent codes, generating images, and estimating the factor of variation. An alternative method proposed by Jahanian et al. (2019) relied on an object detector for quantitative evaluation. The proposed approach for quantitative evaluation relies on an object detector and allows control over object position and scale. Results show precise control for selected ILSVRC categories. A common direction was learned from merged datasets to determine independence from category of interest. The directions found in the latent space are shared between all categories, as shown in Figure 2. The latent code in BigGAN is split into six parts, and we examined which parts encode position and scale. The squared norm of each part is reported in Figure 4 for horizontal and vertical position. The latent code in BigGAN is split into six parts, with spatial factors mainly encoded in the first part. Results on geometric transformations for training and validation datasets are shown in Figure 4, with a note on algorithm limitations for large scales. The algorithm shows limitations for large scales in geometric transformations due to poor performance of the saliency model. Testing the effect of disentanglement on performance, \u03b2-VAE models with different \u03b2 values were trained on dSprites dataset. The study tested the impact of disentanglement on model performance by training \u03b2-VAE models on dSprites dataset with varying \u03b2 values. Results showed that higher \u03b2 values led to more control over object position in generated images, indicating the importance of disentangled representations for precise image generation. Our work focuses on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models to control the generative process. We distinguish between GAN-like models and auto-encoders, with conditional GANs allowing users to choose object categories or image properties but requiring labeled data. VAEs suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and sample quality. Our method aims to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models without the need for labeled data. Unlike other approaches, we show that it is possible to identify meaningful directions in various generative models without altering the learning process. Our method focuses on disentangling the latent space in generative models to find meaningful directions without the need for labeled data. Unlike other approaches, we can identify these directions without altering the learning process, even in models like InfoGAN. Additionally, we provide a procedure to find the latent representation of an image when an encoder is not available. Our method focuses on disentangling the latent space in generative models to find meaningful directions without labeled data. We introduce a procedure to find the latent representation of an image without an encoder, improving reconstruction quality significantly for complex datasets like ILSVRC. The reconstruction loss is adapted to improve quality in complex datasets like ILSVRC. White (2016) suggests using spherical interpolation to reduce blurriness in latent space arithmetic. A new algorithmic data augmentation method called \"synthetic attribute\" generates less blurry images with a VAE. Recent works on finding interpretable directions in generative model latent spaces show high interest in the community. Recent works on finding interpretable directions in generative model latent spaces have shown high interest in the community. A recent study by Goetschalckx et al. (2019) and Jahanian et al. (2019) focused on interpreting directions in the latent space of the BigGAN model. While their method shares similarities with ours in terms of using transformations and linear trajectories in the latent space, our approach differs in the training procedure. We first generate a dataset of interesting trajectories before training our model, unlike their direct training method. Additionally, our evaluation procedure involves using a saliency model instead of a MobileNet-SSD v1 Liu et al. (2016) trained on specific categories of the ILSVRC dataset, allowing for more comprehensive performance measurement. Our model allows for precise control over the generative process and can be adapted to more cases, unlike previous works. Generative models lack interpretability in their latent representations, but our approach offers insights on using auto-encoders and disentangled representations in the latent space of BigGAN. Additionally, we propose an alternative reconstruction error for inverting generators. Our method aims to extract meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models like BigGAN to control specific properties of generated images. By interpreting a linear subspace in the latent space as intuitive factors of variation, such as translation and scale, we enhance the understanding of these models' representations. In Section 2.1, we introduce a target image I and a generated image \u00ce = G(\u1e91) determined by a reconstruction loss L. Using the Plancherel theorem with the usual MSE, we establish a relationship between the Fourier transforms of \u00ce and I. Our method focuses on extracting meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models like BigGAN to control specific image properties. In Section 2.1, a target image I and a generated image \u00ce = G(\u1e91) are determined by a reconstruction loss L. The Fourier transform relationship between \u00ce and I is established using the Plancherel theorem with the usual MSE. The contribution to the total loss L depends on the magnitude r in the Fourier space. The optimization process favors images \u00ce = G(\u1e91) with smaller r values. The \u03b2-VAE framework aims to discover interpretable latent representations for images without supervision. A simple convolutional VAE architecture was designed for generating 64x64 images, with a decoder network consisting of transposed convolutions and ReLU filters. The architecture for generating 64x64 images includes transposed convolutions with ReLU filters, dense layers, and a constraint on the latent space z. The reconstruction results using their method show artifacts without constraining z, as demonstrated in Figure 6. The study evaluates the reconstruction results of their method with and without constraining the latent space z. Results show that constraining z to a ball of radius \u221a d prevents artifacts, leading to accurate reconstructions. Comparison with classical Mean Square Error (MSE) and Structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) methods is also presented. The study evaluates the reconstruction results of their method with and without constraining the latent space z to a ball of radius \u221a d. Results show accurate reconstructions with the proposed approach, and a quantitative evaluation using the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metric indicates perceptual closeness to target images. The optimization problem of Equation 2 is challenging due to the curvature of the natural image manifold. The study shows that images reconstructed using their method are perceptually closer to the target image compared to MSE or DSSIM. The curvature of the natural image manifold complicates the optimization problem, especially for non-linear transformations like translation and rotation. By analyzing trajectories of images undergoing transformations, they demonstrate the curved nature of pixel space. The study demonstrates the challenges in optimizing latent codes for image transformations due to the curved nature of pixel space. Large translations, rotations, and scaling result in near orthogonality in pixel-space, affecting the gradient of the reconstruction loss. This problem does not occur for linear transformations like brightness changes. When optimizing latent codes for image transformations, near orthogonality in pixel space can slow down optimization progress. This occurs when the gradient of the error with respect to the latent code is small, affecting large translations, rotations, and scaling in the generated image. When optimizing latent codes for image transformations, near orthogonality in pixel space can slow down optimization progress, affecting large translations, rotations, and scaling in the generated image. For example, in an ideal GAN scenario, moving a small white circle from left to right on a black background may result in minimal reconstruction error if the circles do not intersect. Additional qualitative examples show results for various geometric transformations and brightness adjustments using the BigGAN model. The text discusses optimizing latent codes for image transformations using the BigGAN model. It shows qualitative examples for position, scale, and brightness adjustments, with a focus on controlling brightness in images. The direction for position and scale is learned on specific categories, while brightness adjustments are made on the top five categories."
