    "content": "Pakistan's stability and efforts to combat religious militancy are crucial to U.S. interests due to its involvement in various urgent policy areas such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and regional tensions with India. Despite initial cooperation in counterterrorism efforts post-2001, doubts about Islamabad's commitment to U.S. interests have deepened, potentially altering the nature of the relationship. Pakistan's cooperation with U.S.-led counterterrorism efforts post-2001 has been praised, but doubts about Islamabad's commitment to core U.S. interests have deepened. The country's mixed record on battling Islamist extremism includes tolerance of Afghan insurgents and anti-India militants. Pakistan's economic and political challenges, along with security threats and difficult relations with neighbors, present serious challenges for U.S. decision makers. Islamist radicalism has spread in the country, with the border region near Afghanistan becoming a haven for insurgents. Islamabad claims the \"war on extremism\" has cost over 37,000 civilian lives and nearly 6,300 security personnel. Islamabad claims that the \"war on extremism\" has cost Pakistan over 37,000 civilian lives, nearly 6,300 security forces, and $78 billion in financial losses. The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center reports a high number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan, with Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden found to have been hiding in the country. This led to a strained relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan, with public accusations from top U.S. military officials. The killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan led to increased U.S. scrutiny of the relationship with Pakistan, with accusations of support for Afghan insurgents. In 2011, tensions escalated with public accusations from top U.S. military officials and a deadly NATO airstrike on Pakistani soldiers. Following a deadly NATO airstrike on Pakistani soldiers at Salala, which resulted in 24 casualties, a Pentagon investigation blamed poor coordination and miscommunication. Pakistan expressed fury, suspecting an intentional strike, leading to the scrapping and renegotiation of bilateral agreements with the United States. Islamabad demanded a full apology from Washington for restored cooperation, with the closure of Pakistani supply lines into Afghanistan being the most contentious action taken. Islamabad demands apology from Washington for restored cooperation, leading to closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies. Negotiations stall over proposed $5,000 per truck fee hike, overshadowing a NATO summit in Chicago. U.S. officials refuse perceived \"extortion\" and \"price gouging.\" The U.S. officials are refusing to entertain a fee hike for NATO supplies, calling it \"extortion\" and \"price gouging.\" A Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, leading to anger from American officials. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved docking $1 million from U.S. aid funding for each year of the sentence unless the doctor is freed. The cooperative aspects of bilateral relations have remained frozen in 2012. The cooperative aspects of bilateral relations between the US and Pakistan have remained frozen since 2012. Anti-American sentiments are prevalent among ordinary Pakistanis, while Americans have increasingly negative views of Pakistan. The State Department warns of high travel risks in Pakistan, with American diplomats facing restrictions and civilians being abducted, including the execution of Daniel Pearl. Islamist extremism and militancy are ongoing concerns in the region. The State Department warns of high travel risks in Pakistan, with American diplomats facing restrictions and civilians being abducted, including the execution of Daniel Pearl. Islamist extremism and militancy in Pakistan are central U.S. foreign policy concerns, hindering progress towards key goals such as defeating Al Qaeda and stabilizing Afghanistan. There are worries about American citizens being recruited for Islamist terrorism in Pakistan, where several most-wanted enemies of the United States are believed to reside. The United States faces travel risks in Pakistan due to Islamist extremism and militancy. Key enemies like Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be in Pakistan, possibly receiving protection from elements of the government. Congress questions the effectiveness of U.S. policy and aid to Pakistan, with calls to curtail assistance and impose new conditions on aid and military reimbursements. In May 2012, Congress is considering reducing aid to Pakistan and imposing new conditions on aid and military reimbursements. Pakistan received $2 billion in direct aid in FY2012, making it a top recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. The closure of Pakistani GLOCs to Afghanistan has not had the expected negative impact, leading to concerns about Pakistan's diplomatic isolation. Pakistan's closure of routes to Afghanistan has strained relations with the United States, risking diplomatic isolation. The civilian government's domestic pressures may lead to losing foreign assistance and influence in post-war Afghanistan. President Obama urged Pakistan to increase efforts in securing the region and neutralizing terrorist safe havens. Defense Secretary Panetta acknowledged the challenges in the relationship. The United States will continue to press Pakistan to expand its role in securing a peaceful future for the region and to neutralize terrorist safe havens. Despite acknowledging challenges in the relationship, Secretary of Defense Panetta emphasized the necessity of maintaining ties with Pakistan. The US has increased nonmilitary aid to improve the lives of the Pakistani people as part of its strategy for stabilizing Afghanistan. The US has increased nonmilitary aid to Pakistan to stabilize Afghanistan, but has suspended security assistance due to concerns about Islamabad's cooperation in combating militancy and fostering democratic institutions. Over $1 billion in approved reimbursements also remains undisbursed. The approved \"coalition support fund\" reimbursements to Pakistan are still undisbursed due to disagreements. Observers believe Pakistani behavior won't change due to long-held geostrategic perspectives. Pakistan's foreign policy is influenced by the military's strategic interests, leading to calls for strong U.S. support for civilian authorities to reduce conflict. Analysts advocate strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian government to reduce conflict. However, Pakistan's civilian leaders have not shown willingness to address security policies and blame the U.S. for extremism. The Pakistani civilian leaders shirk responsibility for extremism, blaming the United States. Official Pakistani support for Islamist militancy is acknowledged, with concerns over U.S. favoritism towards India causing anxiety among Pakistani officials. President Obama's visit to India without stopping in Pakistan exacerbated tensions. The Pakistani officials are concerned about a perceived \"pro-India\" tilt in Washington's policies, especially regarding Kashmir and civil nuclear cooperation. They feel threatened by the US's alignment with India and Afghanistan, fearing strategic encirclement and potential dismemberment of their country. The Salala incident in 2011 further fueled Pakistani fury. Pakistan's security institutions fear strategic encirclement by external forces and anticipate a shift towards a more narrow, transactional relationship with the US, following the tumultuous events of 2011. Pakistan seeks a formal, business-like relationship with agreed-upon limits. Pakistan's top military spokesman in January 2012 emphasized the need for a formal, business-like relationship with agreed-upon limits. The movement of FY2013 congressional legislation indicates potential new restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance to Pakistan. Analysts suggest a \"transactional\" relationship as a realistic alternative to noncooperation. Ambassador Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's envoy to the U.S., outlined Islamabad's prerequisites for resetting the relationship. Ambassador Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's envoy to the U.S., outlined Islamabad's prerequisites for \"resetting\" the bilateral relationship, including apologizing for the Salala incident, releasing suspended CSF reimbursements, increasing counterterrorism intelligence sharing, halting drone strikes, and shifting to a policy of \"trade not aid\" by enhancing Pakistan's access to U.S. markets. Former U.S. diplomats suggest forging a more normal, constructive relationship by reducing mutual expectations, better targeting economic aid programs, fostering substantive business ties, and offering discreet U.S. support. The past decade has seen suggestions for a more normal and constructive relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan, including reducing mutual expectations, better targeting economic aid programs, fostering business ties, and offering discreet support for initiatives promoting regional stability. Optimism is found in the humble status of the Pakistani military and improvements in Pakistan-India relations, urging the Obama Administration to consider these factors and avoid a purely security-oriented approach that could fuel anti-American sentiment. The Obama Administration is advised to consider positive trends in Pakistan-India relations and not focus solely on security, as this could increase anti-American sentiment. Some U.S. analysts criticize Pakistan's stance on GLOCs and the Salala incident, calling it a missed opportunity for cooperation. Pressure on Islamabad for counterterrorism is recommended, with one commentator calling Pakistan's stance a \"catastrophic mistake.\" Some analysts suggest a shift to a more adversarial posture towards Pakistan, advocating for focused hostility, targeting individuals for sanctions, and cutting military aid. Others go further, proposing that Pakistan should be considered an enemy of the United States in terms of Afghanistan policy. Some analysts recommend a more adversarial approach towards Pakistan, suggesting targeted sanctions and reduced military aid. Others argue that labeling Pakistan as an enemy of the United States in terms of Afghanistan policy could benefit both countries. A Washington-based Pakistani analyst criticizes the idea of a \"two Pakistans\" approach, suggesting a more passive U.S. strategy focused on providing security assurances and strengthening civilian governance in Pakistan. The analyst questions whether Pakistan's recent economic rapprochement with India is a tactical move or a strategic shift in perspective. Pakistan's recent economic rapprochement with India is seen as a tactical move to ease security and international pressure, but it may hinder the country's geostrategic status. Commentators suggest that Pakistan should focus on energy and trade cooperation with neighbors instead of conflict with India and \"strategic depth\" in Afghanistan to overcome perpetual insecurity. The assassination of Punjab province governor Salman Taseer in 2011 highlighted the challenges faced by Pakistan's civilian leaders in pursuing more robust policies due to the influence of security services and conservative elements in society. Taseer, a liberal politician, was killed for criticizing blasphemy laws, with his assassin being hailed as a hero by some segments of Pakistani society. The assassination of Punjab province governor Salman Taseer in 2011, who criticized blasphemy laws, was a major blow to liberal forces in Pakistan. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the killing. Additionally, Minorities Minister Shabaz Bhatti, a Christian member of the federal cabinet, was shot to death for advocating tolerance towards religious minorities and reform of blasphemy laws. Clinton expressed shock and outrage at Bhatti's killing, calling it an attack on values of tolerance and respect championed by Pakistan's founding father. President Zardari addressed the assassinations of Taseer and Bhatti, stating that a minority is trying to undermine Pakistan's founding principles of tolerance. The events were seen as evidence of increasing Islamist radicalism in the country. In a separate incident, Raymond Davis, an American working at the U.S. Consulate in Lahore, shot and killed two men in self-defense. Subsequent events in Pakistan showed a rise in Islamist radicalism. Raymond Davis, an American working at the U.S. Consulate in Lahore, shot and killed two men in self-defense. Despite claims of diplomatic immunity, Davis was revealed to be a CIA contractor tracking militant groups. The controversy surrounding his legal status led to discussions in Congress about reducing U.S. assistance to Pakistan. Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor tracking militant groups in Pakistan, shot and killed two men in self-defense. The controversy over his legal status led to discussions in Congress about reducing U.S. aid to Pakistan. Senator Kerry visited Islamabad to ease tensions, and after negotiations and a payment of $2.3 million in diyat, Davis was released. Top U.S. officials denied any quid pro quo arrangement. After political pressure and a $2.3 million diyat payment, Raymond Davis was freed. Osama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, raising doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism and leading to calls to cut U.S. aid. The circumstances of Osama bin Laden's death raised doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism, leading to calls to reduce U.S. aid. Questions arose about Pakistan's role in harboring bin Laden, with some suggesting complicity or incompetence within the country's military and intelligence services. Pakistan's military and intelligence services faced criticism for their inability to detect top Al Qaeda leaders and for failing to intercept a foreign military raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The Army Chief warned against future incursions, and Parliament condemned the U.S. raid while threatening to close vital supply lines for NATO troops. Parliament strongly condemned the U.S. raid and threatened to close vital supply lines for NATO troops in response to the incursion that killed Osama bin Laden. Public demonstrations turned anti-American, leading to increased bilateral distrust and calls for greater oversight of future U.S. assistance to Pakistan. Despite some skepticism, senior Members advocated for continued engagement with Pakistan. Despite skepticism and calls for greater oversight, senior Members advocated for continued engagement with Pakistan following the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden. President Obama and top U.S. officials maintained a positive posture towards Pakistan, despite questions about bin Laden's refuge. The U.S. government reportedly has no conclusive evidence of official Pakistan's awareness of bin Laden's whereabouts. On May 22, 2011, heavily armed militants attacked Pakistan's naval base near Karachi, killing security personnel and destroying U.S.-supplied aircraft. The Pakistani Taliban claimed it was revenge for Osama bin Laden's killing. The attack on Pakistan's naval base near Karachi by militants, believed to have inside help, resulted in the destruction of two U.S.-supplied aircraft. The breach raised concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons and materials. A former navy commando was arrested in connection with the attack. The attackers at the naval base had inside help, as they avoided detection and took cover effectively. A former navy commando was arrested. Three navy officers, including the base commander, face court-martial for negligence. ISI is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who linked the attack to Al Qaeda infiltration in the navy. Shahzad had received threats from ISI before his disappearance. The Mehran attack was linked to Al Qaeda cells in the Pakistan Navy. Journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who had criticized the Pakistani establishment, was allegedly killed by senior ISI officials to silence critics. Despite a government inquiry, the culprits behind Shahzad's murder remain unidentified. In January 2012, an official Commission of Inquiry reported to the Pakistani government that it was unable to identify the culprits behind journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad's murder. The commission recommended that intelligence agencies be made more law-abiding and accountable through various mechanisms. Additionally, the Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million worth of scheduled counterinsurgency training and equipment for Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence. The Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million worth of scheduled counterinsurgency training and equipment for Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence and delays in visa processing. This move was seen as a message to Islamabad about the consequences of lack of cooperation. Pakistani military downplayed the impact, stating it wouldn't affect their combat operations. The Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million in counterinsurgency training and equipment for Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence and visa processing delays. Pakistani military downplayed the impact on their combat operations, suggesting reprogramming U.S. security assistance towards development projects. Observers believe this decision may lead to resentment rather than cooperation from Pakistani leaders and validate the perception of the U.S. as an unreliable ally. Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz referenced a memo allegedly \"dictated\" to him by then-Pakistani Ambassador Husain Haqqani, requesting assistance from J.C.S. Chief Adm. Mullen. The op-ed piece referenced a memorandum allegedly \"dictated\" to Mansoor Ijaz in May 2011 by then-Pakistani Ambassador Husain Haqqani, requesting U.S. assistance to avert a military coup and install friendly leaders for cooperation with U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The \"Memogate\" scandal led to Haqqani losing his job and pressure on President Asif Zardari, both denying involvement. Ijaz was deemed a less-than-credible witness. The \"Memogate\" scandal involving Ambassador Haqqani and Mansoor Ijaz led to Haqqani losing his job and pressure on President Zardari. Despite Ijaz being a less-than-credible witness, the investigation did not find evidence of wrongdoing by civilians. The civil-military clash raised concerns of a potential military overthrow of President Zardari. Army and intelligence officers confirmed the memo's authenticity, prompting Prime Minister Gilani to warn against conspiracies to destabilize the government. Prime Minister Gilani warned of conspiracies against the elected government and emphasized the military's accountability to parliament. Despite rumors of a military coup, the army publicly pledged support for democracy. The civilian government was angered by the army and intelligence chiefs bypassing them in engaging the court, calling it unconstitutional. The Pakistani public showed reluctance towards direct military rule. Despite Prime Minister Gilani's claims of the military's unconstitutional actions, the Pakistani public is against direct military rule. With an assertive judiciary and watchdog media, the likelihood of a military coup is low. Parliament reaffirmed its supremacy and urged the army and Supreme Court to stay within constitutional limits. Gilani later softened his criticisms, and the crisis atmosphere subsided. In November 2011, U.S. ground forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border faced heavy fire. In November 2011, U.S. ground forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border faced heavy fire from hilltop positions inside Pakistan. Despite initial confusion, U.S. forces engaged with air assets, resulting in the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers. This incident caused outrage among Pakistanis. The incident in November 2011 near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border led to the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers, causing outrage among Pakistanis. Prime Minister Gilani condemned the attacks as a breach of sovereignty and violation of international law, leading to the closure of NATO's ground logistics routes through Pakistan and the eviction of U.S. personnel from the Shamsi airfield. Pakistani anger persisted, resulting in a boycott of a December Bonn conference on Afghanistan and the continued closure of supply routes for over five months. The incident in November 2011 near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border resulted in the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers, leading to outrage and demands for a formal apology from the U.S. Despite Islamabad's intention to reopen supply routes, they have remained closed for over five months. The Pentagon's investigation concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense with no intentional targeting of Pakistanis, citing miscommunication and poor coordination as central factors. The incident near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in November 2011 resulted in the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers. The Pentagon's investigation concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense, with no intentional targeting of Pakistanis. Pakistan's military criticized NATO for blaming Pakistan and highlighted miscommunication as a central issue. The incident near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in November 2011 resulted in the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers. The Pentagon's investigation found the \"fundamental cause\" was the failure to share operation details with Pakistan. The Obama Administration considered apologizing for the incident, but Pentagon figures opposed, fearing it would be seen as admitting fault. In late February, Secretary Clinton was set to apologize to Foreign Minister Khar in London, but the plan was aborted after U.S. military personnel burned Korans in Afghanistan. Later, with coordinated insurgent attacks in April blamed on the Haqqani Network, those in the Administration arguing for an apology fell silent. U.S.-Pakistan relations were further strained in February 2012 when a hearing on Baluchistan was held, with calls for the partition of Pakistan into substates. Baluchistan, a Pakistani province with a violent separatist conflict, sparked congressional attention with a resolution for self-determination. This angered the Islamabad government and led to criticism from the Pakistani media. The Obama Administration distanced itself from supporting Baluchistan's independence. The resolution for self-determination in Baluchistan sparked tensions between Pakistan and the United States, with the Obama Administration distancing itself from supporting Baluchistan's independence. The Islamabad government froze relations with the U.S. pending a review by Parliament, seen as a rare assertiveness by the civilian government. The 14-point \"Guidelines for Revised Terms of Engagement with the United States\" were unanimously approved in April 2012. The 14-point \"Guidelines for Revised Terms of Engagement with the United States\" were unanimously approved on April 13, 2012. Key demands included immediate cessation of U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan, stopping infiltration into Pakistani territory, and seeking an unconditional apology for the NATO/ISAF attack. The 14-point \"Guidelines for Revised Terms of Engagement with the United States\" approved on April 13, 2012 demanded an apology for the NATO/ISAF attack, justice for those responsible, and an end to covert operations in Pakistan. Additionally, no foreign bases or private security contractors are allowed in Pakistan, and a civil nuclear deal similar to India's was requested from the United States. The review's authors surprisingly requested a civil nuclear deal for Pakistan similar to India's. Despite expressions of respect for Pakistani sovereignty, drone strikes have continued. Talks between the US, Pakistan, and Afghanistan did not result in any breakthrough, dashing hopes for a reset in the bilateral relationship. Pakistan's demands for a cessation of drone strikes remain a major point of contention, with analysts believing the CIA will be unwilling to stop targeting \"high-value targets\" or conducting \"signature strikes\" that may result in civilian deaths. Pakistani leaders may refuse to open NATO's ground supply lines until drone strikes are ended. Pakistan's demands for an unconditional apology for the inadvertent deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala remain unresolved, with the U.S. government withholding military reimbursements. The NATO summit in Chicago focused on future engagement decisions. Pakistan's President Zardari attended the NATO summit in Chicago after receiving a personal call from the NATO Secretary-General. However, President Obama reportedly refused to meet with him, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan. At the NATO summit in Chicago, President Obama snubbed President Zardari, causing embarrassment for Pakistan. Despite this, Foreign Minister Khar remained positive, emphasizing Pakistan's importance at the summit. Urdu-language editorials praised Zardari for standing up to international pressure. On May 23, 2012, a tribal court in northwestern Pakistan convicted Shakil Afridi of treason and sentenced him to 33 years in prison for working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. The sentence sparked outrage in the United States, with officials calling it \"shocking and outrageous.\" The Obama Administration and Senate officials in the United States expressed outrage over Shakil Afridi's 33-year prison sentence for working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. Islamabad insists the process was legal, but concerns remain about the lack of legal representation and unclear appeal rights. The Obama Administration and Senate officials expressed outrage over Shakil Afridi's 33-year prison sentence for working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. Some Pakistani commentators question the conviction due to lack of legal representation and unclear appeal rights. The biannual assessment of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy noted static progress against U.S. objectives, with improved cooperation in counterinsurgency efforts but no progress in executing the COIN cycle in certain regions. The last quarter of 2010 showed no progress in effectively executing the COIN cycle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. There was a lack of 'hold' and 'build' planning to complement clearing operations, hindering the path towards defeating the insurgency in Pakistan. Secretary Clinton's certification in March 2011 confirmed Pakistan's sustained commitment to combating terrorist groups, allowing the release of security-related aid. In March 2011, Secretary Clinton certified Pakistan's efforts in combating terrorist groups, allowing the release of security-related aid. However, skepticism arose due to concerns about Pakistan's actions against terrorist networks like the Haqqani Network. The certification of Pakistan's efforts in combating terrorist groups in the FATA region was met with skepticism, seen as driven by political considerations. The Secretary explained the certification was based on legal requirements. No similar certification was made for FY2012. The Administration's assessment in September 2011 showed little progress in enhancing civilian control and stable government in Pakistan. Indicators and metrics for enhancing civilian control and stable government in Pakistan remained static. Pakistan's COIN capabilities showed a decline due to decreased bilateral security cooperation. International community involvement in stabilizing Pakistan saw limited progress in funding. The IMF Stand-By Arrangement remains on hold since August 2010, with limited progress in funding the World Bank Multi-Donor Trust Fund and the U.N. Pakistan Humanitarian Response Plan. The Pentagon's report to Congress highlighted positive trends in Afghanistan but emphasized that the Taliban insurgency and its al Qaeda affiliates operate from sanctuaries in Pakistan, posing a critical threat to the U.S.-led effort. The security situation in eastern Afghanistan is volatile, with Kabul facing persistent security threats planned in and controlled from Pakistan. The city of Kabul faces security threats planned and controlled from Pakistan, undermining security in Afghanistan. Pakistan's desire for a Pashtun-led Afghan government with limited Indian influence motivates its support for insurgent sanctuaries. U.S.-Pakistan relations are strained over issues like freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan. U.S.-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan and the revelation of U.S. citizens working for the ISI to influence U.S. Kashmir policy. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and the Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010. President Obama has not traveled to Pakistan since taking office, and the bilateral Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010. High-level interactions, especially among military and intelligence officials, have continued to be frequent. In October 2011, Secretary Clinton led a high-level delegation to Islamabad to address the issue of militant safe havens in western Pakistan. The United States warns Pakistan about militant safe havens in western Pakistan and threatens action if they are not addressed. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue has been postponed indefinitely, but engagement continues at other levels. Secretary Clinton met with Foreign Minister Khar in February 2012 to discuss bilateral relations and counterterrorism efforts. Secretary Clinton expressed U.S. eagerness to resume cooperation with Pakistan, focusing on counterterrorism and Afghanistan. Khar mentioned the need to address Senate elections before Parliament's recommendations. Amb. Grossman emphasized the desire for an honest and mutually beneficial relationship with Pakistan. President Obama reiterated the importance of shared interests like counterterrorism and stability in Afghanistan during a meeting with Prime Minister Gilani. In March and April, U.S. and Pakistani officials held talks to improve cooperation on counterterrorism and stability in Afghanistan. President Obama and Secretary Clinton welcomed Pakistan's parliamentary review process and potential participation in the NATO summit. Deputy Secretary of State Nides expressed optimism for achieving a balanced approach respecting Pakistan's sovereignty and U.S. national security concerns. In April, U.S. officials continued efforts to improve ties with Pakistan through civilian assistance and development support. Amb. Grossman's visit to Islamabad for the Trilateral Core Group meeting did not result in breakthroughs on major points of disagreement, with focus on reopening GLOCs and Pakistan's opposition to drone strikes. Amb. Grossman's visit to Islamabad with Foreign Secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani did not lead to breakthroughs on key issues. The U.S. emphasized the need to reopen GLOCs, while Pakistan reiterated its opposition to drone strikes. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi. Missile strikes by American UAVs in Pakistan have been controversial but effective against militants. President Obama reportedly approves the targeting \"kill list\" for these strikes. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), overseen by the CIA and approved by President Obama, have been effective in targeting Islamist militants in western Pakistan. The drone strikes have significantly impacted Al Qaeda and other extremist groups, but also face criticism for civilian casualties and violating Pakistani sovereignty, leading to anti-American sentiment. The Pakistani government regularly protests the strikes. The Pakistani government protests drone strikes as a violation of sovereignty, fueling anti-American sentiment. Despite official rejection, there is debate within Pakistan on the effectiveness of the drone campaign against Al Qaeda. Debate surrounds the effectiveness of drone strikes in Pakistan against Al Qaeda and its allies. The tactic is seen as necessary by some analysts, with messaging to Pakistan being a key aspect of the program. There are differing opinions within the Administration on the wisdom of continuing UAV strikes, with some urging a reduction in their pace. Despite widespread agreement on their tactical effectiveness, there are calls for a more judicious use of drone attacks. Some State Department and Pentagon officials are urging the CIA to reduce UAV strikes in Pakistan due to concerns about the strained relationship with the country. A White House review in mid-2011 reaffirmed support for the drone program but implemented changes such as greater State Department involvement in strike decisions and giving advanced notice to Pakistani officials. This led to a reduction in \"signature strikes\" against large groups of suspected militants. The drone program in Pakistan has been under scrutiny, with claims of reduced \"signature strikes\" against suspected militants. President Obama defended the program, stating it had minimal civilian casualties, but independent analysts dispute this, estimating hundreds of civilian deaths. Despite targeting militants, violence in western Pakistan has not decreased significantly. Analysts estimate that 145-535 civilians, including children, have been killed in missile strikes in western Pakistan. Despite the deaths of militants and commanders, violence has not subsided. The U.S. government may continue using this tactic due to the upcoming NATO troop drawdown in Afghanistan. U.S. has had close ties with Pakistan's ISI since the 1980s, but mutual mistrust exists. Concerns about ISI's support for Islamist militant proxies have been raised. In 2008, doubts about ISI's activities and aims were compounded. The agency is implicated in extralegal abductions, manipulation of domestic politics, and using Islamist militant proxies. The Director-General, a three-star general, is under the direct control of the army. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam replaced Lt. Gen. Pasha in 2012 and is seen as more open and moderate. He may be a candidate for the Chief of Army Staff position after Kayani's retirement in 2012. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, previously commander of V Corp in Karachi, received military training in the U.S. in 2002-2003. He is considered more open and moderate than his predecessors and a potential candidate for the COAS position after Kayani's retirement in 2012. U.S. officials have accused the ISI of supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance, allowing them to sustain their insurgency. Reports suggest increased ISI-Taliban contacts in late 2011, with the ISI allegedly encouraging more violence and supplying new explosives. The ISI increased direct contacts with the Taliban in 2011, encouraging violence and supplying explosives. A leaked NATO report in 2012 revealed ongoing support from the ISI to Afghan insurgents, with senior Taliban leaders meeting regularly with ISI personnel for strategic advice. The ISI is also linked to anti-India terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba. Pakistan's ISI is linked to anti-India terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and has been accused of having relationships with terrorist groups for many decades. Despite Pakistani officials denying cooperation with militants, independent observers believe the security services are increasingly infiltrated by Islamist extremists. Pakistan's security services are believed to be infiltrated by Islamist extremists, with claims of biased training against the United States for military officers. The security services can be seen as divided between a nationalist group led by Gen. Kayani and a leaderless group driven by a revisionist Islamist ideology. CIA-ISI relations were strained even before the Raymond Davis incident. The leaderless faction within Pakistan's security services is influenced by a revisionist Islamist ideology, leading to strained CIA-ISI relations. The Raymond Davis incident exacerbated tensions, with the ISI demanding accountability for all CIA operatives in Pakistan. Following Osama bin Laden's death, suspicions of ISI links to Islamist extremism increased, prompting Pakistan to crack down on its citizens working with the CIA. Following Osama bin Laden's death in May 2011, Pakistan cracked down on its citizens working with the CIA. Pressure was increased to allow American investigators access to bin Laden's widows in Pakistani custody. The CIA's Islamabad station chief was outed by a Pakistani newspaper, believed to be deliberate by U.S. officials as a means for the ISI to demonstrate its leverage and express anger at U.S. policies. ISI leadership was confronted more frequently with U.S. evidence of collusion after the raid. After Osama bin Laden's death, Pakistan cracked down on CIA operatives, leading to the outing of the CIA's Islamabad station chief. U.S. officials believed the disclosures were deliberate by the ISI to show its leverage and express anger at U.S. policies. Evidence of collusion between Pakistani officials and Afghan insurgents was presented, including instances where bomb-making facilities were found abandoned after CIA alerts, leading to accusations of tipping off targets. Pakistani military denied the charges, citing incorrect intelligence provided. U.S. officials repeated accusations after militants fled other bomb-making facilities. The Pakistani military denied accusations of collusion with militants, calling them \"totally false and malicious.\" Despite interagency discord, joint intelligence work continued, leading to the arrest of a senior Al Qaeda operative in Karachi. This capture was seen as a Pakistani effort to mend relations with the U.S. Pakistan also pledged to grant more than three dozen visas to the CIA in June. Ali Qasim Yaqub, a key courier for Al Qaeda, was captured in a Pakistani effort to mend relations with the U.S. Pakistan also granted visas to CIA officers. Ilyas Kashmiri and Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, top Al Qaeda leaders, were killed in drone strikes. Pakistan arrested three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta with CIA assistance. Bilateral intelligence cooperation targeting Al Qaeda and the \"Pakistani Taliban\" has continued. In September, Pakistan arrested three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta with CIA assistance. Bilateral intelligence cooperation targeting Al Qaeda and the \"Pakistani Taliban\" has quietly continued despite worsening government-to-government relations. The CIA has reportedly established a network of \"secret friends\" in Pakistan to counter less trustworthy army and ISI officials. Pakistani leaders have historically sought strategic depth with Central Asia and India through friendly relations with Afghanistan. Pakistan's historical policy aimed for access to Central Asia and strategic depth towards India through friendly relations with Afghanistan. This led to support for Afghan mujahideen in the 1980s and later for the Taliban regime. The Durand Line, dividing Pashtun tribes, remains a point of contention between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The ongoing acrimony between Islamabad and Kabul hinders U.S. interests in combating Islamic militancy. Pakistan and Afghanistan are key U.S. allies in combating Islamic militancy, but their ongoing acrimony hinders U.S. interests. American and Pakistani goals in Afghanistan differ, with Pakistan seeking a dependent Afghanistan while the U.S. aims for an independent one. This could lead to increased cooperation between Kabul and India, with Pakistan using proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network in its dealings with Kabul. The US aims for an independent Afghanistan, while Pakistan seeks a dependent one. Pakistan may use proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network in its dealings with Kabul, increasing its leverage. Washington seeks Islamabad's support for Afghan reconciliation talks, but tensions arise due to differing approaches. Pakistani officials are confused by perceived lack of clarity in US goals for Afghanistan. The differing approaches between Americans and Pakistanis towards Afghanistan are evident. Pakistani officials are confused by the lack of clarity in US goals for Afghanistan and pressure to employ force against militants in North Waziristan. Some believe that Pakistani intransigence may be rewarded by giving their security services a role in brokering peace with insurgent forces. Despite this, Pakistani cooperation is deemed necessary for reconciliation and stability in Afghanistan. The Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan is linked to Pakistani sanctuaries in Quetta and Karachi, hindering pacification efforts. Despite some improvement in Pakistan-Afghanistan relations, Afghan officials accuse Pakistan of supporting terrorism in Afghanistan. The Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan is attributed to Pakistani sanctuaries in Quetta and Karachi, hindering pacification efforts. Afghan officials openly accuse Pakistan of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan, showing continued wariness of Pakistani influence. Islamabad's use of \"Pashtun jihadi proxies\" and military dominance ambitions in Afghanistan raise concerns among analysts. The U.S. military drawdown announcement in 2011 signals potential shifts in the region that could impact Pakistani interests. The international community may abandon the region, damaging Pakistani interests. President Obama's 2011 announcement of a U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan signals a focus on an exit strategy. Pakistani leaders emphasize Afghan stability as vital. Prime Minister Gilani, Army Chief Kayani, and ISI Director Pasha visited Kabul to accelerate the peace process, causing concern among American observers. Prime Minister Gilani visited Kabul to accelerate the peace process and move closer to Islamabad, seeking support from China. He criticized America's \"imperial designs\" and emphasized Afghan and Pakistani ownership of the peace process. The new Joint Commission meeting in June 2011 resulted in an \"Islamabad Declaration\" for improved ties. Friction arose between Islamabad and Kabul due to increased \"reverse infiltration\" incidents, escalating after Pakistani soldiers were killed in a cross-border raid. In the summer of 2011, increased \"reverse infiltration\" caused friction between Islamabad and Kabul after Pakistani soldiers were killed in a cross-border raid by militants from Afghanistan's Kunar province. Afghan officials accused Pakistan of firing rockets into Afghan provinces, leading to strained relations. Pakistan denied involvement in cross-border attacks, but some in Afghanistan viewed the barrages as part of a Pakistani effort to control Afghanistan. In September 2011, Afghan-Pakistani relations deteriorated further after the assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani in Kabul. Afghan officials suspected ISI involvement in the murder, leading to accusations of Pakistan using terrorism as official policy. In October, Afghan intelligence claimed to have foiled a plot to assassinate President Karzai, with alleged culprits based in FATA. The Afghan president accuses Pakistan of supporting terrorism, with Afghan intelligence claiming to have stopped a plot to assassinate Karzai. Islamabad supports peace talks with the Afghan Taliban but wants Kabul to set the parameters. Pakistan aims to limit India's influence in post-conflict Afghanistan and controls which Taliban figures can negotiate. In 2010, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a key Taliban commander, was captured in a joint ISI-CIA operation in Karachi. In early 2010, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a top Afghan Taliban commander, was captured in a joint ISI-CIA operation in Karachi. Pakistan aimed to control which Taliban figures could negotiate, possibly to facilitate talks with select commanders for reconciliation. Pakistan also sought to broker a reconciliation between the Kabul government and the Haqqani Network, raising concerns about Islamabad's intentions to maximize influence in post-conflict Kabul. Later that year, NATO facilitated the secret travel of QST figures. Pakistan's initiative to control Taliban negotiations raised concerns about its influence in post-conflict Kabul. NATO facilitated secret travel of QST figures to Kabul for meetings with Afghan officials, indicating Islamabad's influence over top insurgents. The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan suggested Pakistan was hesitant to allow Taliban leaders to travel to Kabul for reconciliation talks, urging Pakistan to support the process. Afghan President Karzai echoed these sentiments. The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan and Afghan President Karzai expressed concerns about Pakistan's reluctance to allow Taliban leaders to participate in reconciliation talks in Kabul. Despite initial resistance, by early 2012, Islamabad seemed to be cooperating with U.S.-Taliban negotiations. However, Afghan President Karzai's request for Pakistani leaders to influence the Taliban into negotiations was met with skepticism by Foreign Minister Khar. Prime Minister Gilani later made a public appeal to the Afghan Taliban leadership and other militant commanders to engage in talks. Prime Minister Gilani issued an open appeal to Afghan Taliban leaders and militant commanders for national reconciliation and peace, despite initial skepticism from Foreign Minister Khar. Concerns persist about Pakistan's ties with Afghan insurgent groups, particularly the Haqqani network in the FATA region. The U.S. transition planning for Afghanistan is viewed with suspicion as a potential cover for a hasty exit strategy. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, is considered the most dangerous Afghan insurgent group. They pose a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests, maintaining ties with al-Qaeda. Military offensives are seen as necessary to deal with them beyond 2012. Pakistan has been reluctant to launch operations against the Haqqanis in North Waziristan. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, poses a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. Military offensives are necessary to deal with them beyond 2012. Pakistan has been reluctant to launch operations against the Haqqanis in North Waziristan, citing stretched forces and a long-standing relationship with the group. Islamabad officials have deferred U.S. requests for action, believing the Haqqanis could help exert Pashtun-based influence in post-ISAF Afghanistan. The Haqqanis have carried out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including the 2011 assault on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel and a truck bomb attack on a U.S. military base. In 2011, high-visibility attacks in Afghanistan by Haqqani gunmen and suicide bombers left many dead and injured, including assaults on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel, a U.S. military base, and the U.S. Embassy compound. These attacks strained U.S.-Pakistan relations and raised concerns about Afghanistan's security. The Haqqani militants' raid in Kabul's heavily guarded area was seen as a setback to Afghanistan's security. Admiral Mullen urged Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases, escalating tensions with accusations of ISI supporting a \"proxy war.\" Secretary Panetta warned of protecting US forces from future Haqqani attacks, leading to increased pressure on Pakistan. Mullen's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee was the strongest US government response. During testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Admiral Mullen accused the Haqqani network of being supported by Pakistan's ISI, linking them to recent attacks in Afghanistan. Secretary Panetta emphasized the need to pressure Pakistan to address the issue. During testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Admiral Mullen accused the Haqqani network of being supported by Pakistan's ISI, linking them to recent attacks in Afghanistan. Secretary Panetta emphasized the need to pressure Pakistan to address the issue, signaling a new level of U.S. intolerance for Pakistan's regional \"double-game.\" President Obama later stated that while the intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship was unclear, Pakistan needed to address the problem. The Wardak truck bombing was a turning point in hardening Secretary Clinton's attitude toward the Haqqanis. The Wardak truck bombing was a turning point in hardening Secretary Clinton's attitude toward the Haqqanis. Islamabad denies responsibility for attacks in Afghanistan and rejects claims of supporting the Haqqani network. The Pakistani military refuted accusations of conducting a proxy war or backing the Haqqanis, warning that such allegations could strain the US-Pakistan alliance. President Zardari criticized verbal assaults against Pakistan as damaging to bilateral relations. Pakistani officials deny supporting the Haqqani network and warn the US of damaging the alliance. President Zardari criticizes verbal assaults against Pakistan. Pakistan seeks to facilitate peace talks between the Haqqanis and Kabul, but their links with Al Qaeda pose a challenge. Military officials claim they can bring the Haqqanis to the negotiating table. Unnamed Pakistani military officials claim they can \"deliver\" the Haqqanis to negotiations, potentially giving Islamabad a central role in the process. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, with pressure from senior Senators. Seven Haqqani leaders have been under U.S. sanctions since 2008. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under U.S. law, with pressure from senior Senators. Seven Haqqani leaders have been under U.S. sanctions since 2008. The potential decision on an FTO designation is complicated by the Administration's willingness to negotiate with the Haqqani leadership for sustainable peace in Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate but has not emerged from the House committee. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 (S. 1959) passed the Senate but has not advanced in the House committee. Congressional frustration with the Administration's delay in the FTO designation review has grown in 2012. Ammonium nitrate is a key ingredient in IEDs used by insurgents in Afghanistan, with most illicit AN believed to come from Pakistan. Historic peaks in IED events were recorded in Afghanistan in the summer of 2011. The summer of 2011 saw historic peaks in total IED events in Afghanistan, with most illicit ammonium nitrate believed to come from Pakistan. The U.S. government is urging Islamabad to adjust Pakistani national laws to restrict access to ammonium nitrate or enhance border security. Congressional legislation required a report on countering IED-related networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The U.S. government is urging Pakistan to adjust national laws to restrict access to ammonium nitrate and enhance border security to prevent its movement into Afghanistan. Efforts include diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives involving various agencies. Operation Global Shield aims to combat illicit cross-border trafficking of chemical explosives precursors. Operation Global Shield is a multilateral law enforcement operation launched in 2010 to combat the trafficking of chemical explosives precursors. Recommendations include adding urea fertilizer to make processing for explosives more difficult and using colored dyes or RFID tags for tracking shipments. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan is the country's largest fertilizer complex. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the largest fertilizer complex in the country, producing over 300,000 metric tons of ammonium nitrate annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad aims to restrict AN and other precursors, but changes are unlikely in the near term. The US relies on Pakistani authorities to address the issue, as an outright ban is not in place. The Islamabad government has established a National Counter-IED Forum for Pakistani agencies to develop an action plan. The US relies on Pakistani police and border authorities for support. NATO's supply routes through Pakistan to Afghanistan have been closed for six months due to tensions. Insurgents have targeted these supply lines near the Khyber Pass. In 2008, militants targeted surface supply routes connecting Pakistan to Afghanistan, causing destruction of trucks and deaths of drivers. Truck drivers often pay bribes to officials and face attacks en route. In response, the U.S. military explored alternative routes from Central Asia to reduce reliance on Pakistan. The U.S. military began testing alternative routes from Central Asia and Russia to reduce reliance on Pakistan for supply routes. The \"Northern Distribution Network\" (NDN) was carrying over half of NATO's supplies by mid-2010, but only nonlethal cargo moved via this route. Despite the preference for Pakistan as a faster and cheaper logistics route, the U.S. continued to expand aerial and NDN routes, even though they are more costly and involve reliance on authoritarian regimes in Central Asia. Loss of Pakistani supply routes has been less damaging to Afghan operations than expected. The loss of Pakistani supply routes has been less damaging to Afghan operations than expected, with the closure of the GLOCs being a strategic concern that has hampered Afghan security forces by backlogging equipment. Gen. Allen mentioned that the closure has not negatively affected the campaign, but reopening the GLOCs would be extremely helpful and provide financial benefits to Pakistanis. The closure of Pakistani supply routes has caused a backlog of equipment for Afghan operations. NATO needs to remove thousands of shipping containers and vehicles worth billions of dollars. U.S. commanders pushed for the reopening of Pakistani GLOCs in early 2012. Pakistani officials indicated that reopening was imminent in mid-May. The Pakistani parliamentary review in mid-April called for reopening the supply routes. Senior officials indicated that a deal had been struck before the Chicago summit, with reports of a proposed fee increase to $5,000 per truck. This drastic hike was deemed unacceptable by the Pentagon, as Pakistani GLOCs were previously considered \"free\" in exchange for CSF reimbursements. Negotiations on the $5,000 fee for Pakistani GLOCs have not reached a resolution. Pakistan faces challenges from Islamist extremism, militancy, separatist insurgency in Baluchistan, and politically motivated violence in Karachi. The U.S. NCTC reports declines in terrorist incidents and related deaths. Pakistan continues to face challenges from Islamist extremism, militancy, and separatist insurgency in Baluchistan, along with politically motivated violence in Karachi. Despite a significant decline in terrorist incidents and related deaths since 2009, Pakistan still ranks third in the world for both measures. The country has seen a rise in suicide bombings, with nearly half of all worldwide deaths from such attacks occurring in Pakistan. Militants have targeted the country's military and intelligence institutions in recent years, leading to a drop in Islamist attacks in 2011. In recent years, militants have targeted Pakistan's military and intelligence institutions, leading to a drop in Islamist attacks in 2011. Despite some improvement in law enforcement, observers believe the Islamabad government is sometimes influenced by terrorists. Various Islamist militant groups in Pakistan have become more interconnected and supportive since 2009, with concerns remaining about Al Qaeda operating freely in the country. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged as a coherent grouping in late 2007, representing Pakistan's tribal agencies and settled districts. The Quetta Shura Taliban and Haqqani Network are based in different regions of the FATA. Punjab province houses various Islamist militant groups, including the U.S.-designated terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) with ties to the ISI. The Punjab province in Pakistan is home to several Islamist militant groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which has ties to the ISI and is considered a growing threat to U.S. national security. The LeT is identified as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia and could become a global threat if not addressed. The group's charity wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), has an expanding presence in Pakistan. Pakistan's former Ambassador to the U.S., Husain Haqqani, criticizes the country's focus on U.S. sovereignty violations while ignoring other issues. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to militancy in western Pakistan. Husain Haqqani criticizes Pakistan's focus on U.S. sovereignty violations instead of combating jihadist ideology that has cost many Pakistani lives. He believes the national mindset was influenced by military dictators to divert attention from social and economic issues. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to militancy in western Pakistan, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. U.S. government assessments paint a discouraging picture of recent efforts, with difficulties in the \"holding\" and \"building\" phases of military operations due to limited civilian administration capacity. Independent analyses reach similar conclusions. The Pakistani military's operations in Swat and FATA from 2009 to 2011 had mixed results, with temporary success in dislodging militants but no sustained progress in counterinsurgency. The air force conducted numerous combat sorties and bombings in FATA, but government forces continue sporadic offensives in Kurram and Khyber agencies. The Pakistani military conducted operations in FATA, dropping over 10,000 bombs and destroying 4,600 targets. Bloody fighting continues in Kurram and Khyber agencies. The army has had success in degrading LI's capabilities, but a simmering insurgency persists. TTP militants overran a fort in South Waziristan, killing 15 soldiers. Bajaur suffered a major militant attack, with a TTP suicide bomber killing dozens in retaliation. The TTP suicide bomber killed dozens in Bajaur in retaliation for the killing of an Al Qaeda operative by security forces in 2011. North Waziristan is a key haven for militants, but Pakistani officials have not moved their military there despite U.S. requests. Pakistan's military has limited capacity for nonconventional warfare. Pakistan's military forces in North Waziristan need to consolidate areas under their control. They have limited capacity for effective nonconventional warfare. US efforts to bolster Pakistan's COIN capabilities were hindered by Islamabad's ejection of US military trainers in July 2011. Pakistan's military operations and political approach have splintered the Pakistani Taliban, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks. The Pakistani Taliban splintered in 2011, resulting in smaller factions not following orders from TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud. Mehsud has feuds with other militant commanders and was reportedly ordered killed by his former deputy. Pakistani officials considered negotiations with TTP militants as the US favored talks with the Afghan Taliban. In late 2011, Pakistani civilian officials were open to new negotiations with TTP militants as the US leaned towards talks with the Afghan Taliban. Meetings with government representatives were claimed to have started in November, but domestic and international concerns arose. Despite denials, negotiations seem to have occurred, with reports of pressure from Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar for Pakistani militants to make peace. Negotiations between Pakistani militants and the government have led to a demotion that angered Bajaur agency lieutenants. Mullah Omar of the Afghan Taliban has urged Pakistani militants to make peace with the Pakistani army. Al Qaeda and Haqqani group mediators facilitated an agreement to unify four major militant factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan. This new alliance, Shura-i-Muraqba, will focus hostility solely on Afghanistan, unlike the TTP, which targets the Pakistani state. The Haqqanis aim to redirect FATA militants' focus towards Afghanistan to further their own agenda. The Haqqani group aims to shift FATA militants' focus from Pakistan to Afghanistan to advance their own agenda. The U.S. government offered a $10 million reward for information on Hafiz Saeed, causing tension in U.S.-Pakistan relations. In April, militants attacked a prison in Bannu, Pakistan, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a plot against President Musharraf. The government inquiry blamed various security forces for the lapse, fueling concerns about Pakistan's security apparatus. The raid on a prison in Bannu, Pakistan, freed nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death. The incident blamed security forces for the lapse, raising concerns about Pakistan's security apparatus. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries and extremist groups operating with impunity in the country. The Afghan Taliban leadership in Quetta and Karachi, the Haqqani Network in North Waziristan, and other militant groups in Pakistan remain significant threats to the United States. The Haqqani Network in North Waziristan, LeT, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and other terrorist organizations in Pakistan pose significant threats to the United States and its allies. Concerns about American citizens being recruited for terrorism by Pakistan-based groups heightened in 2010 after Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted a car bomb attack in Times Square. Shahzad received bomb-making training in western Pakistan and was sentenced to life in prison. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing, and the culprit confessed to receiving bomb-making training in western Pakistan. Shahzad was sentenced to life in prison. Other cases involving U.S. citizens and residents with links to Islamist extremism in Pakistan and terrorist plots against American targets are numerous. One Pakistani-born American was involved in the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai, India. David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, was charged in 2009 for scouting the attack for the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group. Headley's case was the first to directly link a former Pakistani military officer to terrorism suspects in the United States. Headley and another Pakistan-born Chicagoan, Tahawwur Rana, are believed to have reported to a terrorist group. In a significant case, David Coleman Headley pleaded guilty to charges linking him to terrorism suspects in the United States, including interactions with a retired Pakistani major and a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. Indian officials gained access to Headley for interrogation, revealing a Pakistani role in the Mumbai attack. Testimony in Tahawwur Rana's trial also implicated three senior LeT members. The information from the Chicago court trial established official Pakistani involvement in the Mumbai attack, with links between ISI, terrorism, and LeT. Rana was acquitted of Mumbai attack charges but found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish newspaper. This added to existing tensions in U.S.-Pakistan relations. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, marked by three full-scale wars and ongoing military preparedness, stems from the acrimonious partition of British India in 1947 and the unresolved Kashmiri sovereignty issue. Both countries have large defense establishments at the expense of economic and social development. The Composite Dialogue initiated in 2004 has seen modest successes like a formal cease-fire and increased trade and people-to-people contacts across the Kashmiri Line of Control. Its aim is to achieve a peaceful settlement of all bilateral issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. In 2008, Pakistan-India relations deteriorated after a terrorist attack in Mumbai, leading to a halt in the peace process. Territorial disputes over Kashmir, Siachen Glacier, and Sir Creek remain unresolved. Conflict over water resources also strained the relationship. Regional peace is believed to be tied to resolving the Kashmir dispute. The U.S. government under the Obama Administration has continued its efforts in the region. Water resources have become a significant issue in the Pakistan-India relationship. Pakistani leaders and independent observers believe that regional peace is closely connected to resolving the Kashmir dispute. The U.S. government, under the Obama Administration, has maintained a policy of staying out of the Kashmir conflict. There are allegations of a \"shadow war\" between Pakistan and India in Afghanistan, with accusations of interference and support for anti-India terrorist groups. The 2008 Mumbai attack heightened tensions, with New Delhi holding Islamabad responsible for harboring these groups. Following the 2008 Mumbai attack, India focused on holding Islamabad accountable for supporting anti-India terrorist groups in Pakistan. Despite initial reluctance, India agreed to resume peace talks with Pakistan in early 2011, leading to the establishment of a \"terror hotline\" between the two countries. Following the \"cricket diplomacy\" in March 2011, bilateral talks between India and Pakistan led to agreements on establishing a \"terror hotline\" and increasing economic cooperation. Meetings between commerce and foreign secretaries resulted in positive outcomes, including expanding confidence-building measures and enhancing trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC. The Joint Statement in July was seen as a successful representation of the peace process, with trade ministers also meeting in September to further cooperation. The July Joint Statement during Foreign Minister Khar's visit to New Delhi was seen as a positive step towards peace after a two-year hiatus. Trade ministers from India and Pakistan agreed to enhance bilateral trade by reducing transaction costs and prices. India also supported a proposed EU initiative to waive duties on Pakistani exports from flood-affected areas. The killing of OBL had implications on relations between the two countries, with Indian PM Singh calling it a significant step against terrorism. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh praised the killing of OBL as a significant step against terrorism, but also expressed concerns about a potential U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan affecting India's foreign policy interests. New Delhi saw the event as an opportunity to press Pakistan to extradite perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attack and other anti-India terrorists. Afghanistan's new strategic framework agreement with India heightened Pakistan's fears of strategic encirclement. Afghan President Karzai signed a new \"strategic framework\" agreement with India in 2011, causing Pakistan to feel more encircled. The pact aimed at closer ties with India, potentially complicating efforts to reduce Pakistan's reliance on militant proxies in Afghanistan. Pakistan's relations with India have improved, but tensions remain over the Kashmir conflict. Pakistan's relations with India have improved, with the Kashmir conflict at its lowest ebb since 1989. Pakistan's government plans to grant Most-Favored Nation trade status to India by the end of 2012, which could significantly boost bilateral trade and build peace constituencies in both countries. Islamabad's offer to move towards freer bilateral trade is seen as a positive step towards prosperity in the region. Pakistan's offer to increase bilateral trade with India and move towards freer trade policies, including a shift from a \"positive list\" to a \"negative list\" of prohibited items, indicates a shift in its stance on the Kashmir issue. Additionally, the absence of terrorist attacks traced to Pakistan in India for over three years and recent diplomatic engagements, such as President Zardari's visit to India in 2012, suggest improving relations between the two countries. In 2012, President Zardari of Pakistan visited India for a lunch meeting with Prime Minister Singh, marking the first such visit by a Pakistani head of state since 2005. Shortly after, an avalanche at Siachen Glacier killed 139 Pakistani soldiers, highlighting the ongoing conflict over the region. Despite the tragedy, both governments remain unwilling to redeploy their forces. In May 2012, Pakistan and India signed agreements with Turkmenistan to build a gas pipeline through Afghanistan, costing at least $7.6 billion. Pakistan and India signed pacts with Turkmenistan to build a $7.6 billion gas pipeline through Afghanistan, supported by the US for regional energy integration. Security concerns in Afghanistan raise doubts about investor confidence. India's concessions are limited due to ongoing Islamist militancy from Pakistan. Despite reasons for cautious optimism, India's willingness to make concessions is constrained by Islamist militancy from Pakistan. New Delhi is unsatisfied with Pakistan's failure to bring Mumbai terrorism masterminds to justice, especially LeT chief Hafiz Saeed. India also seeks extradition of Ibrahim and Indian Mujahedeen leaders in Pakistan. Economic cooperation could prevent open conflict, but Pakistan's generals play a crucial role in future relations. China's close relationship with Pakistan includes being a primary arms supplier and involvement in the Pakistani economy. Beijing plans to build new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating international guidelines. Chinese companies and workers are heavily involved in the Pakistani economy, with plans for Beijing to construct two new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating international guidelines. During Premier Wen Jiabao's 2010 visit to Islamabad, 12 Memoranda of Understanding were signed, designating 2011 as the \"Year of China-Pakistan Friendship.\" Contracts worth $15 billion were signed between Pakistani and Chinese businesses, covering various sectors. In August 2011, Pakistan swiftly responded to Beijing's accusation of Islamist militants trained in Pakistan being responsible for terrorist activities in China's Xinjiang province by dispatching ISI Director Pasha to Beijing. In August 2011, Pakistan quickly responded to Beijing's accusation of Islamist militants trained in Pakistan being responsible for terrorist activities in China's Xinjiang province by sending ISI Director Pasha to Beijing. China has expressed concerns about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. As US-Pakistan ties deteriorate, Islamabad is increasingly relying on its friendship with Beijing. Pakistani leaders have shown strong closeness with China, with Prime Minister Gilani's visit in May 2011 not resulting in any major new agreements. In 2011, Pakistani leaders showed increased closeness with China, with Prime Minister Gilani's visit resulting in no major new agreements. China agreed to expedite delivery of 50 JF-17 fighter jets to Pakistan and is in negotiations for the purchase of six submarines. China sees its relationship with Pakistan as a way to balance against India and strengthen Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. China sees its relationship with Pakistan as a means of balancing against India and strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. This dynamic could lead to greater U.S.-China coordination to improve Pakistan's military and intelligence services and potentially pressure Islamabad to dismantle global jihadist groups. Additionally, Chinese support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions, but there is potential for cooperation between the United States and China in areas such as nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan. China's support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions, but there is potential for cooperation between the United States and China in areas such as nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan. The Chinese government is unlikely to get involved in any U.S.-Pakistani rift and is not looking to replace Washington as Islamabad's primary foreign benefactor. Pakistan's relations with its Shia Muslim-majority are also a factor to consider. The Chinese government is unlikely to mediate in any U.S.-Pakistani rift or replace Washington as Islamabad's main foreign supporter. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been strained due to differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups. Despite this, both countries aim to complete a gas pipeline project, with Iran offering $500 million for construction after a Chinese consortium withdrew. Iran has completed construction on its side of the border to feed Pakistan's energy demands. Tehran offered $500 million to finance construction on the Pakistani side after a Chinese consortium withdrew. The U.S. opposes the pipeline project due to sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Despite U.S. opposition, Islamabad is determined to complete the project. Iran is also seeking barter deals with Pakistan for oil in exchange for wheat and rice. Tehran is determined to complete the energy project with Pakistan despite U.S. sanctions. Pakistan's nuclear security is a top concern for the U.S. due to past illicit proliferation activities. The network overseen by A.Q. Khan was disrupted in 2004, but concerns remain about its potential reactivation. Analysts warn that parts of the A.Q. Khan network may still be intact, with ongoing concerns about Pakistan's nuclear security and potential leakage of know-how. Recent reports suggest Pakistan is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, possibly in response to U.S. civil nuclear cooperation with India. This poses a dilemma for the Obama Administration, especially as China plans to build new nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines. Pakistan's rapidly growing nuclear arsenal raises concerns, especially with China planning to build new nuclear reactors in violation of guidelines. Economic challenges, including inflation, unemployment, food and energy shortages, worsened by devastating flooding in 2010 and 2011, along with corruption, hinder Pakistan's development and international aid efforts. Pakistan's economic development has been hindered by corruption, devastating flooding in 2010 and 2011, and increasing militancy. Foreign direct investment dropped significantly, and economic priorities include addressing inflation, budget deficit, and reviving growth. Global recession and political instability in Islamabad are also major factors affecting Pakistan's economy. Pakistan's economic development has been hindered by corruption, devastating flooding, and increasing militancy. Foreign direct investment dropped significantly, and economic priorities include addressing inflation, budget deficit, and reviving growth. In the early 2000s, India's growth surpassed Pakistan's, leading to higher national wealth figures. A 2008 balance-of-payments crisis prompted Islamabad to seek multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF, resulting in a $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement. The $11.3 billion IMF Stand-By Arrangement for Pakistan, approved in 2008, faced delays due to reforms non-implementation. Security concerns in 2011 further postponed disbursement. Pakistan sought U.S. help to influence IMF for relaxed conditions, but it is unlikely to happen. The Pakistani government sought U.S. help to influence the IMF to relax conditions for releasing outstanding tranches, as repayment of IMF loans will strain Islamabad's budget due to low revenue generation and high military spending. Secretary Clinton criticized Pakistan's low tax-to-GDP ratio and the government's unsuccessful attempts to implement tax reforms. Pakistan has a 9% tax-to-GDP ratio, one of the lowest globally. The government's efforts to implement tax reforms and lower fuel subsidies have faced challenges, leading to political turmoil. Electricity shortages have caused economic deterioration, forcing businesses to shut down, with up to 20-hour daily outages in some areas. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent at times. Public protests over gas shortages in Pakistan have led to unannounced outages of up to 20 hours per day in some areas, sparking violent demonstrations in cities like Lahore. Despite economic growth of 2.4% in FY2011, the country faces challenges such as high inflation and severe energy shortages, which are expected to continue hindering growth in the near term. The State Bank of Pakistan acknowledges structural deficiencies in the economy, including low tax revenue and persistent inflation. The State Bank of Pakistan recognizes that onerous public debt, persistent double-digit inflation, and severe energy shortages will continue to hinder growth in the near term. Plans to reform taxes and phase out subsidies are delayed, with power outages estimated to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. Poor governance is identified as the central cause of economic problems in Pakistan. International financial institutions regularly assess the Pakistani economy, with the World Bank acknowledging these challenges in a recent report. The World Bank and IMF reports highlight economic challenges in Pakistan due to poor governance. The World Bank recommends focusing on human development sectors to prevent poverty alleviation setbacks. The State Bank of Pakistan recognizes public debt, inflation, and energy shortages as hindrances to growth. Plans for tax reform and subsidy phase-outs are delayed, with power outages impacting GDP growth. The IMF warns of Pakistan's poor economic prospects, citing low growth, high inflation, and unsustainable fiscal deficits. Urgent policy action is recommended to strengthen public finances, reform the energy sector, and reduce inflation. Pakistani leaders aim to improve access to Western markets. Pakistani leaders aim to reform the energy sector, reduce inflation, and improve access to Western markets, particularly for textile exports. They seek reduced tariffs on textile exports to boost the economy. Pakistani officials and business leaders estimate that abolishing American tariffs on cotton apparel could increase exports by $5 billion annually. Pakistan's democracy has struggled with power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs, with direct military rule for over half of its existence.
