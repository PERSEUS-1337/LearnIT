    "content": "Children in foster care have higher rates of mental health care needs and are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications. These medications are used to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is closely monitoring how states regulate the use of psychotropic medications for foster children, as federal law requires states to have a plan for overseeing prescription drug use in this population. Federal child welfare law mandates states to oversee prescription drug use, including psychotropic medications, for children in foster care. The report discusses the mental health needs of these children, the prevalence of psychotropic medication use, congressional oversight, and efforts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to assist states in ensuring appropriate medication use. State monitoring of psychotropic medication use for foster children is also briefly addressed. Child welfare agencies intervene in cases of child abuse or neglect, sometimes leading to children being placed in foster care. Foster care involves round-the-clock care in a different setting, determined by a judge to be necessary for the child's welfare. Most children enter foster care due to neglect or abuse by their parents, with behavioral issues also playing a role. The judge has given responsibility for the child's care and placement to the state child welfare agency. Children enter foster care due to neglect, abuse, or behavioral problems. Foster care is temporary until reunification with parents or permanent placement with relatives, an adopted family, or legal guardian. States must ensure the safety and well-being of children in foster care. In FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 leaving the system, leaving 428,000 children in care by the end of the fiscal year. During FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 leaving the system, leaving 428,000 children in care by the end of the fiscal year. The national foster care caseload has generally been declining for over a decade, with about 77,000 fewer children in care compared to FY2006. Children in foster care have higher mental health service needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care, which can have serious mental health outcomes. Children in foster care may experience serious mental health outcomes due to maltreatment before entering care. This can lead to difficulties in regulating emotions, interpreting cues, and socializing, potentially resulting in violent or aggressive behaviors. A national survey found that a significant percentage of children placed in foster care homes or institutions were at risk of behavioral or emotional problems, indicating a need for mental health services. Children in foster care, especially those in group homes or institutions, have a high risk of behavioral or emotional problems and often require mental health services. Rates of these issues are much higher in foster care children compared to the general population. Recent trends show an increasing number of children in foster care, including those on Medicaid, receiving mental health diagnoses such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Children in foster care, especially those in group homes or institutions, have a high risk of behavioral or emotional problems. Rates of mental health diagnoses such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia have been increasing among children in foster care on Medicaid. Older children are more likely to be diagnosed with these conditions, with varying prevalence based on age groups. In 2007, children in foster care had high rates of mental health diagnoses, with varying prevalence based on age groups. Rates of major diagnoses such as conduct disorders and attention disorders increased across all age groups, except for depression among children ages 6 to 11 and schizophrenia. National standards recommend mental health screening for all children placed in foster care. National standards propose mental health screening for children in foster care, followed by comprehensive assessment and coordinated services. Medicaid provides diagnostic and treatment services for children in foster care, with each state designing its own plan for medical assistance. The Medicaid program provides diagnostic and treatment services for children in foster care, with each state designing its own plan for medical assistance, including primary and acute medical services, long-term care, and EPSDT program coverage for health screenings and services. The EPSDT program under Medicaid covers health screenings, assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services for children. States must provide treatment for children's identified health needs, including mental health services like case management, psychiatry, psychology, and prescription drugs. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from these services. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from health care services such as counseling, case management, and prescription drugs. Psychosocial treatment interventions like behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been found to be moderately effective for children with antisocial-related and disruptive behaviors. CBT interventions have been found effective for children with trauma. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. Psychotropics may be prescribed to children in care without psychosocial therapies due to lack of resources. Medicaid warns against over-reliance on medication, citing limited access to behavioral health care. SAMHSA rates treatments based on evidence of effectiveness. Children in foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to those who remain at home after investigations of abuse or neglect. Research on Medicaid claims shows an increase in psychosocial mental health interventions among foster children taking antipsychotic medication. Children in foster care eligible for Medicaid show increased use of psychosocial mental health interventions while taking antipsychotic medication, compared to non-foster children. Studies indicate that children in foster care needing mental health services may not always receive them, with a significant percentage not receiving specialty mental health services or psychotropics. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in out-of-home care vary between 16% and 33%. Between 16% and 33% of children in out-of-home care may be using psychotropic medication, with rates significantly higher than children generally. Children in foster care eligible for Medicaid receive psychotropic medication at a much higher rate compared to other children served by Medicaid. Children in foster care eligible for Medicaid receive psychotropic medication at a rate up to nine times higher than other children served by Medicaid, similar to older children with mental disorders. Research shows that children in non-relative foster homes are not more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medication compared to child-welfare involved children in their own homes. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in the child welfare system, including those in foster care, vary by state and over time. Research shows that rates of psychotropic medication use among children in the child welfare system, including those in foster care, vary by state and over time. Studies have found significant variation in prescription practices, with state practices playing a key role in determining medication use. Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007 revealed an initial increase in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, followed by a decline in most states. The study found an increase in the use of antipsychotic medications among children in foster care, with 45 states experiencing a relative increase from 2002 to 2007. In 2007, the annual rate of antipsychotic medication use ranged from 2.8% to 21.7% in each state. The annual rate of antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care ranged from 2.8% to 21.7% in 2007. A review of Medicaid claims data showed an increase in antipsychotic use from 2005 to 2008, followed by a slight decrease in 2010. Non-foster care children and privately insured children had lower levels of antipsychotic use, with a slight increase in usage among privately insured children from 2005 to 2009. Data from the NSCAW II provides a detailed discussion on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. The NSCAW II survey funded by HHS examined psychotropic medication use among children in foster care from 2005 to 2013. The survey included children who remained in their homes post-investigation and those placed in foster care. At the time of the NSCAW II Survey, children's ages ranged from 2 months to 17.5 years initially, 16 months to 19 years at the 18-month follow-up, and 34 months to 20 years at the 36-month follow-up. Children in the sample may have entered and re-entered foster care during this period. Children in the sample, ranging from 34 months to 20 years old, may have entered and re-entered foster care. NSCAW II data shows that children living with their own parents after an investigation were less likely to use psychotropic medication than those in foster care. Living in congregate care and being school age increased the likelihood of a child in foster care using psychotropic medications. There was no significant difference in medication use between children in foster care and those who remained at home after four to six months following the investigation. At 18 months following the investigation, children in foster care were significantly more likely to be taking psychotropic medications than those who remained in their homes. By the 36-month follow-up, about one out of three children in care was taking psychotropics, compared to 12.9% of children who remained in their homes. Among children placed in foster care, medication use was significantly greater for those in group foster homes or residential treatment programs. Children in foster care, especially those in group settings, had a significantly higher prevalence of psychotropic medication use compared to those in foster family homes or formal kin care. The rate of medication use was highest among children in group settings, with 67.4% prescribed psychotropics, compared to 15.9% to 23.8% in other foster care settings. Children in group settings were most likely to be prescribed psychotropics (67.4%), compared to other foster care settings (15.9% to 23.8%), children in their own homes (10.9%), and informal kin care (11.9%). 52% of children in group settings were taking psychotropics, with lower rates among children in other foster care settings (16.5% to 36.1%), those in their own homes (12.5%), and informal kin care (16.5%). At 18 months after the initial investigation, children in foster care group homes or residential settings were most likely to be taking more than one psychotropic medication, with about half of them prescribed two or more drugs. The rate of children in other child welfare settings taking two or more drugs was lower, ranging from 5.7% to 14.6%. At 36 months following the initial investigation, children in group settings still had the highest percentage of children taking two or more psychotropic medications, followed by children in foster care, formal kin care, informal kin care, and those who remained in their own homes. Children in group settings were significantly more likely to be using three or more psychotropic medications at 36 months following the investigation compared to children in other settings. Youth ages 11 to 17 were most likely to be using psychotropics at each wave, followed by youth ages 6 to 10, youth ages 18 and older, and youth ages 1.5 to 5 years. Older youth, ages 18 and older, were not as likely to be taking psychotropic medications. The research found that youth ages 11 to 17 were most likely to be using psychotropic medications, followed by youth ages 6 to 10, youth ages 18 and older, and youth ages 1.5 to 5 years. Older youth, ages 18 and older, were not as likely to be taking psychotropic medications. The prescribing patterns for foster children have been characterized as \"too many, too much, and too young,\" with polypharmacy rates remaining consistent at about 5.2% to 5.9% annually from 2002 through 2007. The polypharmacy rates for children in foster care remained consistent at about 5.2% to 5.9% annually from 2002 through 2007. In 2011, 2.8% of children with foster care status and 3.1% of those without were prescribed three or more antipsychotic drugs. On average, children in foster care prescribed psychotropics were taking 1.9 medications per day. The percentage of children prescribed one, two, or three or more psychotropic medications is shown in Figure 3. Children in group or residential settings prescribed three or more psychotropics have a statistically significant difference compared to other groups. Concerns have been raised about using certain classes of psychotropics, such as antipsychotics, concurrently, with antipsychotic polypharmacy showing greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. There are concerns about prescriptions for foster children exceeding recommended dosages and very young children being prescribed psychotropics, as limited studies exist on the safety and efficacy of these medications for children. The NSCAW II study found that a small percentage of children under the age of 6 in out-of-home care were prescribed psychotropic medications, with rates varying among different states. Research also showed an increase in prescribing rates for ADHD and antipsychotic medications with each year of age among children ages 3 to 6 in foster care. Health experts have raised concerns about the use of psychotropic drugs in infants and young children in foster care, as there are no established mental health indications for their use. Children in foster care may receive psychotropic medications more readily due to a lack of psychosocial services available. Children in foster care may receive psychotropic medications more readily due to a lack of psychosocial services available. The use of certain classes of these drugs, such as antipsychotics, has steadily grown despite a decrease in overall prescribing rates. The share of children in foster care prescribed antipsychotic medication increased from 2005 to 2008. The use of psychotropic medications, including antipsychotics, in children in foster care has increased over the years. This trend may be influenced by limited research on their effectiveness in children, pharmaceutical companies marketing these drugs, and a general rise in psychotropic medication prescriptions for children. Policymakers and stakeholders in child welfare are increasingly scrutinizing the use of psychotropics in children, despite a growing body of research on the topic. The use of psychotropic medications in children in foster care has raised concerns among policymakers and stakeholders in child welfare. Research on the safety and effectiveness of these medications, particularly antipsychotics, is limited. Studies have shown insufficient evidence to support their use for various mental health disorders in children, including disruptive behavior disorders and eating disorders. The duration of most studies is too short to evaluate long-term outcomes. The analysis highlighted concerns regarding the use of psychotropic medication in children in foster care, citing high risk of bias in studies due to mishandling of data and funding sources. Antipsychotics have been linked to adverse health effects in children, such as high cholesterol, weight gain, and type-2 diabetes. Despite these risks, some children may benefit from medication to manage mental health and behavior issues resulting from complex trauma. Some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing mental health and behavior concerns stemming from complex trauma. Stimulants, particularly for ADHD, have been well-researched and found to effectively reduce core symptoms. Children in foster care are more likely to have mental health diagnoses compared to low-income children. Children in foster care are more likely to have mental health diagnoses, including ADHD, leading to higher levels of psychotropic drug use. Multiple placements and inconsistent oversight may contribute to this. Congress has shown interest in oversight of prescription medications for these children. Congress has taken an interest in oversight of prescription medications used by children in foster care, including clinical drug trials and psychotropic medication use. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 required state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for appropriate medical treatment of children in foster care. The oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care was discussed in congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 expanded the requirement for states to consult with medical professionals in developing a coordinated strategy and oversight plan for the health and well-being of children in foster care. States must consult with medical professionals to develop a coordinated strategy for ensuring access to health care, including mental health services, for children in foster care. This strategy must also include protocols for the use of psychotropic medication. Congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008 addressed the oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care. The Senate oversight hearing in December 2011 focused on the Government Accountability Office's study of state policies for prescribing psychotropic medications to foster children. The study compared state policies against best practice guidelines developed by AACAP, revealing that all six state programs lacked comprehensive oversight. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) developed practice guidelines for prescribing psychotropic medications to foster children. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that six state programs lacked comprehensive oversight in implementing these guidelines. Only Texas fully implemented consent procedures, raising concerns about caregivers' awareness of risks and benefits. GAO recommended that HHS endorse guidance for monitoring psychotropic medications in foster care. HHS was recommended by GAO to endorse guidance for monitoring psychotropic medications in foster care. Witnesses discussed increasing cooperation between HHS and state Medicaid programs. A former foster youth shared his experience with multiple psychotropic medications and the importance of therapy. Senate Finance Committee held a roundtable discussion in April 2013. In April 2013, the Senate Finance Committee held a roundtable discussion with child welfare stakeholders to address issues related to psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Former foster youth shared their experiences, noting the importance of therapy in transitioning from medications. The stories emphasized the need for invested caregivers or professionals in ensuring appropriate mental health treatment. Therapy helped youths transition from psychotropic medications, emphasizing the importance of invested caregivers or professionals. Child welfare stakeholders discussed psychotropic medication use among youth, federal government's role in promoting alternatives, tools for prescribing medications, and engagement of schools, mental health system, and foster parents. House Ways and Means Subcommittee held a hearing in May 2014 on psychotropic medication use among foster care children. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses included officials from HHS, GAO, a researcher on medication use, and Dr. Phil McGraw. GAO focused on their work from 2011 to 2014 regarding psychotropic medication prescription among children in care. GAO examined prescribing rates of psychotropics among children in foster care in five states. Experts found varying quality in documentation supporting medication use. GAO recommended HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of medication by third-party managed care organizations. The GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of medication, including psychotropic use among foster children. State officials reported developing practices to support appropriate mental health care for children in care. State officials in seven states developed guidelines to support appropriate mental health care for children in foster care, including initial mental health screenings and monitoring after medication is prescribed. Factors such as collaboration among agencies and outreach to stakeholders were critical in implementing these practices. State officials in seven states reported that collaboration among agencies and outreach to stakeholders were critical in implementing oversight work for children in foster care. They use various measures to gauge results, including physician prescribing practices and monitoring child outcomes. GAO did not examine the effectiveness of state practices or compliance with policies. HHS has supported states in their oversight work since 2014. The GAO recommended that HHS convene state stakeholders to collaborate on psychotropic medication oversight for children in care. HHS has implemented federal requirements for monitoring psychotropic medication use and various agencies are working together to understand its impact on children, especially those in foster care. Several federal agencies have collaborated to understand psychotropic medication use among children, including those in foster care. The Obama Administration proposed increased funding for oversight of psychotropic medications. States must develop a coordinated strategy for ensuring access to healthcare for children. Under the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program, states must develop a coordinated strategy for ensuring access to health care, including mental health services and dental care, for children in foster care. This strategy must be developed collaboratively between the state child welfare agency and the state Medicaid agency, with input from health care experts and child welfare services experts. It should include a schedule for health screenings, monitoring and treatment of health needs, including emotional trauma. The strategy for children in foster care must include a schedule for health screenings, monitoring and treatment of health needs, updating and sharing medical information, ensuring continuity of health care services, oversight of prescription medicines, and consulting with medical professionals for appropriate treatment. The state must actively involve medical professionals in assessing and treating the health of children in foster care, ensure transition plans for aging out children meet health care needs, and maintain health records for each child in foster care. The state must maintain health records for children in foster care, including immunizations, medication information, and other relevant health details. These records must be provided to foster care parents or providers during placements and to youth upon leaving care. States report on their oversight of psychotropic medications through the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Reports for federal funding. Jurisdictions seeking federal funds for child welfare programs must address psychotropic oversight in their reports. The oversight protocols should cover screening, evaluation, consent for treatment, medication monitoring, mental health expertise availability, and information sharing. The instructions have become less detailed in subsequent program reports. The most recent five-year CFSP for FY2015-FY2019 requires jurisdictions to report on the oversight of prescription medicines, including protocols for the appropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications. In 2011, HHS convened an interagency working group to address research on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care and support state efforts in implementing requirements on psychotropics. The working group aims to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, interventions, oversight, monitoring of psychotropic medications, and research evidence on medications and psychosocial treatments for children in foster care, led by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The working group, led by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), aims to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, interventions, oversight, and monitoring of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. It includes representatives from HHS agencies such as CMS and SAMHSA, which administer Medicaid and block grant funding for non-Medicaid covered treatment services related to trauma. SAMHSA administers block grant funding to support non-Medicaid covered treatment services and projects related to understanding and treating trauma in children. A letter from ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS addressed actions to manage prescription medication use for children in foster care, emphasizing the role of state agencies in providing quality mental health services for children in out-of-home care. The letter from ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS emphasized the importance of collaboration between State child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities to improve mental health services for children in foster care. They also took steps to raise awareness about psychotropic medication use through webinars and information memoranda. In 2012, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS provided guidance to states and stakeholders on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care through webinars and information memoranda. They also organized question and answer sessions and a summit in August called \"Because Minds Matter\" to address the mental health needs of children in foster care. The \"Because Minds Matter\" summit aimed to improve collaboration among state welfare agencies regarding the appropriate use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. States were urged to identify areas for improvement in oversight and outline steps for implementation. Presentations from HHS staff and state teams covered various psychotropic oversight topics. Post-summit, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS have taken steps to enhance oversight of psychotropic medications. HHS has advanced its work on oversight of psychotropic medications following the \"Because Minds Matter\" summit. ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring psychotropic medication use, emphasizing coordinated planning, shared decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. States are required to report on the implementation of these elements in their monitoring of psychotropic drug use for children in foster care. ACF issued guidance to state child welfare agencies on improving outcomes for children who have experienced abuse or neglect, focusing on brain development, social-emotional impacts, and tools for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications. ACF also published guides for child welfare staff and foster parents on mental health, trauma, and psychotropic medications. ACF published guides for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications and for child welfare staff on mental health, trauma, and psychotropic medications. ACF awarded funds to support projects for youth with mental and behavioral health needs and to promote well-being after trauma. SAMHSA provided partial funding for developing guidelines on prescribing medications. SAMHSA provided partial funding to AACAP for developing guidelines on prescribing medications for children and youth. A medical director position funded by SAMHSA works with child and adolescent psychiatrists to address issues related to psychotropic medications. The network disseminates best practices through a community listerv and webinars, including for children on Medicaid. The CMS Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services issued an informational bulletin in August 2012 to make states aware of resources. The network disseminates best practices through a community listerv and webinars on medication oversight, including for children on Medicaid. The CMS Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services issued an informational bulletin in August 2012 to make states aware of resources and opportunities to address the use of psychotropic medication in vulnerable populations, such as children in foster care. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs in place to oversee drug prescribing for Medicaid beneficiaries, with examples provided on how some states use this review for oversight. Automated system \"edit checks\" may ensure prescriptions align with accepted medical practice. In 2015, CMS collaborated with state Medicaid agencies to improve appropriate use of antipsychotic medications for children on Medicaid. They also introduced a new measure to help states enhance healthcare delivery for children on Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA issued joint guidance in July 2013 to emphasize the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced \"complex trauma.\" The guidance highlighted the use of existing federal funding and authority by states to offer these interventions, especially for children in foster care who may be improperly prescribed psychotropic medication due to the complexity of their symptoms. The guidance emphasized the need for psychosocial interventions for children in foster care, promoting functional assessments, trauma screening, mental health assessment, and outcome measurement. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being through performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies. This initiative aims to enhance care coordination and deliver evidence-based psychosocial interventions to Medicaid-eligible children served by child welfare agencies. States can also apply for competitive grant funding under Title IV-E. The initiative proposed in President Obama's FY2017 budget aims to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Incentive payments would be made to state Medicaid agencies over five years to support evidence-based psychosocial interventions for children served by child welfare agencies. States can also apply for grant funding under Title IV-E to build capacity for implementing these interventions. The focus is on ensuring fidelity to these models and evaluating their effectiveness. The research literature has focused on states overseeing the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care, including obtaining consent and monitoring procedures. Surveys have been conducted to learn about state policies, but none address how states have responded to the federal provision on oversight of psychotropic medications. Researchers surveyed states in 2009 and 2010 to understand policies, challenges, and solutions related to overseeing psychotropic medication use in foster care children. In 2009 and 2010, researchers surveyed 48 states to assess policies and guidelines for overseeing psychotropic medication use in foster care children. Over half of the states rated this issue as a high concern. At the time of the survey, 26 states had a written policy in place, 13 were developing one, and 9 had no policy. States varied in their approaches to overseeing psychotropic medication use in foster care children, with 26 having a written policy, 13 in the process of developing one, and 9 having no policy. Red flags were used to identify issues such as medication use in young children, multiple medications before a single one, simultaneous use of multiple psychotropic medications, prolonged use of multiple medications within the same class, and exceeding recommended dosages. The effectiveness of these approaches in improving outcomes for children was not systematically studied. Researchers found that states had varying approaches to overseeing psychotropic medication use in foster care children, with limited evidence of systematic implementation or study to improve outcomes. A 2014 study highlighted concerns about the availability and effectiveness of policies, with many policies being underdeveloped and lacking essential criteria for protecting children. States have underdeveloped policies for overseeing psychotropic medication use in foster care children, lacking key criteria for protection. However, efforts are being made to improve oversight, with some states collaborating to address the issue. The Center for Health Care Strategies collaborated with six states from 2012 to 2015 to improve oversight of psychotropic medication use among foster youth. They developed common terms, measures, and best practices for monitoring medication utilization, with each state setting individual goals. States implemented protocols for gaining consent, real-time data collection, reviewing \"red flags,\" and tailored monitoring processes. The Center for Health Care Strategies collaborated with states to improve oversight of psychotropic medication use among foster youth. They developed protocols for gaining consent, obtaining real-time data on medication utilization, reviewing \"red flags,\" and tailored monitoring processes. SAMSHA provided technical assistance to states on oversight of psychotropic medications. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing looked at rates of psychotropic medication use among children investigated for abuse or neglect. The study investigated psychotropic medication use among children who were investigated for abuse or neglect. Data was collected at baseline in 2008-2009 and followed up at 18 and 36 months post-investigation. The study looked at children aged 18 months to 17 years old, some of whom were in foster care. The study analyzed psychotropic medication use among children investigated for abuse or neglect, comparing those in foster care to those not in foster care at 18 and 36 months post-investigation. Foster care settings included non-relative foster homes, kin placements, and group/residential settings, while \"in home\" included biological/adoptive parents or informal kinship care. Initial survey showed no statistically significant differences in medication use, but differences were significant at 18 and 36 months follow-up for children in foster care. At 18 and 36 months post-investigation, children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medications compared to those not in foster care. Statistical significance was found at these follow-up points, with differences varying across age groups. Children in foster care were more likely to use psychotropic medications at 18 and 36 months post-investigation compared to those not in foster care. Statistical significance was found at these follow-up points, with differences varying across age groups. For children ages 11 through 17 years, there was no statistical significance between the in-home and foster care groups initially, but significant differences were shown at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up."
