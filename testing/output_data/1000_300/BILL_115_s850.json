    "content": "The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for foreign medical schools to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. Congress finds that three for-profit schools in the Caribbean receive the majority of Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 for students at foreign graduate medical schools, despite being exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements. The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation recommends that all foreign medical schools should meet the same requirements for Federal funding. The attrition rate at US medical schools was 3.4% in 2014, while for-profit Caribbean medical schools can reach 30%. Residency match rates for foreign trained graduates were 54% in 2016, compared to 94% for US graduates. Students at for-profit medical schools outside the US and Canada accumulate more debt than those in the US. SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 60 percent of enrolled and graduated students in a graduate medical school outside the United States were not described in section 484(a)(5) in the previous year, and at least 75 percent of students seeking a loan under part D of title IV meet this criteria. At least 75% of students or graduates from a medical school outside the US or Canada passed exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in the year before applying for a loan under part D of title IV. The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates requires at least 75% of students or graduates from non-US or Canadian medical schools to pass exams before applying for a loan under part D of title IV. The authority of a medical school to qualify for loan programs expires on July 1 following the date of qualification. The authority for foreign medical schools to participate in loan programs under part D of title IV expires on July 1 after the enactment of the Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017. If a graduate medical school loses eligibility for loan programs under the Higher Education Act, enrolled students can still receive loans until they withdraw, complete their program, or the fourth June 30 after the loss of eligibility."
