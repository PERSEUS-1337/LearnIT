The Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Program aims to reduce fish mortality caused by water withdrawals for irrigation while allowing continued water use. It also aims to prevent fish from entering water supply systems. The Program involves developing projects to mitigate impacts on fisheries from water diversions in the Pacific Ocean drainage area. The Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Program focuses on reducing fish mortality from water diversions in the Pacific Ocean drainage area. Eligible projects include fish screens, passage devices, and related features. Priority is given to projects costing less than $5,000,000. Non-Federal participation in the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Program is voluntary. The Secretary will not hold non-Federal entities financially responsible unless they apply to participate. Projects on U.S. owned land will not require reimbursement. Evaluation and prioritization of projects are outlined in Section 5. Evaluation and prioritization of projects for development under the Program will be based on benefits to native fish species, size and type of water diversion, availability of funding sources, cost effectiveness, and additional opportunities for biological or water delivery system benefits. Eligibility requirements are outlined in Section 6. Eligibility requirements for projects under the Program include meeting Secretary and State requirements, approval from all relevant entities, and consultation with various agencies for project eligibility determination. Non-Federal participants in projects under the Program must provide 35 percent of the cost for projects on non-government-owned land or facilities.
