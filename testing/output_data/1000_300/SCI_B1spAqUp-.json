To address this, the PixelDCL is proposed to establish direct connections among adjacent pixels on the up-sampled feature map. This method can replace deconvolutional layers without compromising the original model's trainable capabilities, although it may slightly decrease efficiency.

It may slightly decrease efficiency, but this can be overcome with an implementation trick. Experimental results show that PixelDCL considers spatial features for more accurate segmentation and image generation tasks. Deep learning methods have shown promise in various AI tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and image generation. Deconvolutional layers, used for upsampling in deep models, suffer from checkerboard artifacts, limiting their capabilities. In this work, a new method called PixelDCL is proposed to address the checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution operations, which limit the capabilities of deep models in generating photo-realistic images and producing smooth outputs on semantic segmentation. The method aims to improve the deconvolution operation by providing a fresh interpretation that identifies the root cause of the checkerboard artifacts. The PixelDCL method addresses checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution operations by proposing a pixel deconvolutional operation. This new layer generates intermediate feature maps sequentially to establish direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the output feature map, overcoming the issue of checkerboard artifacts.

PixelDCL can replace deconvolutional layers in a plug-and-play manner, overcoming the checkerboard problem and improving efficiency with an implementation trick. Deconvolutional layers are commonly used in deep models for tasks like semantic segmentation and generative models. The up-sampled output feature map is obtained through shuffling intermediate feature maps in deconvolutional operations. Deconvolutional layers in encoder-decoder architectures use periodical shuffling of intermediate feature maps for up-sampling. This operation can be decomposed into multiple convolutional operations based on the up-sampling factor. The up-sampled output is generated by a deconvolutional layer, replacing the need for standard deconvolution operations. Deconvolutional layers in encoder-decoder architectures use periodical shuffling of intermediate feature maps for up-sampling. The intermediate feature maps are generated by independent convolutional kernels, with no direct relationship among them. Adjacent pixels on the output feature map come from different intermediate feature maps, leading to significant differences in pixel values. The pixel deconvolutional operation addresses checkerboard artifacts in semantic segmentation by creating direct dependencies among intermediate feature maps, ensuring that adjacent pixels have similar values. This eliminates the need for post-processing like smoothing, which can add complexity to the network and hinder full trainability. The pixel deconvolutional layers address the checkerboard artifact problem in semantic segmentation by creating direct dependencies among intermediate feature maps, ensuring adjacent pixels have similar values. This eliminates the need for post-processing and maintains full trainability. The iPixelDCL involves convolution with multiple feature maps, creating direct dependencies among intermediate feature maps to solve the checkerboard problem in semantic segmentation.Adjacent pixels are conditioned on input feature maps, and relationships among intermediate feature maps are flexible, relying on previously generated ones. In iPixelDCL, dependencies among intermediate feature maps are added to make adjacent pixels on final output feature maps directly related to each other. Information from input feature maps and previous intermediate feature maps is used when generating intermediate feature maps, allowing for improved computational efficiency and reduced trainable parameters. In iPixelDCL, dependencies among intermediate feature maps are added to make adjacent pixels on final output feature maps directly related to each other. The purple feature map is generated from the input feature map, while the orange feature map depends on both the input feature map and the purple feature map. The green feature map relies on the input feature map, purple, and orange intermediate feature maps, and the red feature map is generated based on all previous feature maps. PixelDCL proposes a modification where only the first intermediate feature map depends on the input feature map, leading to a more efficient generation process. In this setup, the orange feature map only relies on the purple feature map, while the green feature map depends on both purple and orange feature maps. The red feature map is conditioned on all previous feature maps. PixelDCL introduces a more efficient generation process by simplifying dependencies between feature maps. Experimental results show improved performance compared to models with complete connections, indicating that repeated dependencies on the input may not be necessary.

They are used for upsampling in various models and have shown superior performance in experiments. In experiments, pixel deconvolutional layers in U-Net and VAEs outperform traditional deconvolutional layers. These layers up-sample input feature maps by a factor of two, dividing output pixels into four groups. An efficient implementation involves up-sampling a 4x4 feature map to 8x8 using convolutional operations. The pixel deconvolutional layer involves up-sampling a 4x4 feature map to 8x8 through convolutional operations. Purple and orange feature maps are generated and combined to form a larger feature map. A masked 3x3 convolutional operation is applied to reduce sequential dependencies. The final output feature map is generated by combining the large feature maps. The proposed pixel deconvolutional methods improve performance in semantic segmentation and image generation tasks compared to regular deconvolution. Evaluation is done on PASCAL 2012 and MSCOCO 2015 datasets, with images resized to 256\u00d7256\u00d73 for training. Models predict labels for each pixel without post-processing, trained from scratch or fine-tuned from DeepLab-ResNet. The models are trained on images resized to 256\u00d7256\u00d73 for batch training. Two approaches are used: training from scratch with the U-Net architecture BID23, and fine-tuning from DeepLab-ResNet. The network consists of four encoder and decoder blocks, with deconvolutional and convolutional layers in each decoder block. The final output layer is adjusted based on the number of classes in the dataset, with PASCAL 2012 having 21 classes and MSCOCO 2015 having 81 classes. The number of feature maps in each layer is doubled for the MSCOCO 2015 dataset. The PASCAL 2012 segmentation dataset has 21 classes, while the MSCOCO 2015 detection dataset has 81 classes. To accommodate the higher number of classes in MSCOCO 2015, the number of feature maps in each layer is doubled. The baseline U-Net model uses deconvolutional layers, which are replaced with proposed pixel deconvolutional layers (iPixelDCL and PixelDCL) in the study. The study compares deconvolutional layers (iPixelDCL) with simplified versions (PixelDCL) in segmentation models. Fine-tuning is done based on DeepLabResNet BID0 architecture, boosting model performance with external data. The DeepLab-ResNet model is fine-tuned from ResNet101 BID5 and uses external data for training, significantly improving accuracy and mean IOU. The output is smaller than the input image, requiring up-sampling blocks with deconvolutional and convolutional layers. Results show segmentation using deconvolutional layers (DCL), iPixelDCL, and PixelDCL on different datasets. The U-Net models using iPixelDCL and PixelDCL outperform the base model with regular deconvolutional layers in capturing local image information. Pixel deconvolutional layers consider spatial features like edges and shapes for smoother semantic segmentation outputs. When trained for a small number of epochs, the model with PixelDCL performs better than iPixelDCL. The proposed models using PixelDCL produce smoother outputs than those using deconvolution. PixelDCL is more efficient with fewer parameters to learn, outperforming iPixelDCL in most cases. Evaluation results show that U-Net models with PixelDCL and iPixelDCL perform better than regular deconvolution. Fine-tuned models from Deeplab-ResNet also show better performance with iPixelDCL being the best. The models using PixelDCL and iPixelDCL outperform the model using regular deconvolution. In semantic segmentation, mean IOU is a more accurate evaluation measure than pixel accuracy. The dataset used for image generation is CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA), with images preprocessed to retain only facial information. The image generation task is to reconstruct faces excluding backgrounds, using a standard variational auto-encoder (VAE) as the base model. The image generation task involves reconstructing faces without backgrounds using a standard VAE model. PixelDCL is used to replace deconvolutional layers in the decoder, resulting in better quality images without checkerboard artifacts.

It enhances generative models by considering local spatial information, producing photo-realistic images. Comparison of VAE models using PixelDCL for up-sampling shows improved training and prediction times. The PixelDCL improves generative models by eliminating checkerboard artifacts and enhancing local spatial information for realistic image generation. Comparing VAE models using PixelDCL for up-sampling shows slightly increased training and prediction times, but the efficiency of PixelDCL implementation reduces dependencies. This increase in time is not expected to be a major bottleneck for the proposed methods.
