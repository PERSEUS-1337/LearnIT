    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\". The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\" includes definitions for key terms such as \"Administration\" and \"Administrator\" related to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also outlines coordination, assessment, acquisition, and reporting requirements for unmanned maritime systems to support NOAA missions. Funding and additional authorities are addressed as well. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" defines key terms like \"Administrator\" for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including cooperative activities and data specifications for programs. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" defines terms like \"data specifications,\" \"test or training range,\" and \"unmanned maritime systems\" for programs of the Administration. The test or training range is designated for evaluating system performance and training personnel on operating procedures. The term \"unmanned maritime systems\" refers to remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence, including undersea and surface vehicles. These systems may include control, communications, instrumentation, data transmission, and processing components. The term \"unmanned maritime systems\" encompasses unmanned undersea and surface vehicles, as well as autonomous underwater and surface vehicles. It also includes unmanned and autonomous aerial vehicles used for maritime purposes. The Administrator is tasked with coordinating the assessment and acquisition of these systems by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Administrator is responsible for coordinating the research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This includes utilizing the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board for coordination and ensuring that the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations address requirements. The Administrator will utilize the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB) for coordination and ensure representation from specific offices actively engaged with unmanned maritime systems. Additionally, efforts will be made to coordinate with the Secretary of the Navy. The Administrator will coordinate with the Secretary of the Navy to leverage expertise in unmanned maritime systems development and operations. This includes aligning with strategic priorities and utilizing Naval unmanned systems test ranges for interagency cooperation. The Administrator will coordinate with the Secretary of the Navy to formalize coordination and maximize interagency cooperation in unmanned maritime systems development and operations. This includes incorporating Administration priorities into Navy research activities and partnering to procure unmanned systems and establish test ranges. The Administrator will work with the Navy to coordinate and maximize cooperation in unmanned maritime systems development. This includes procuring systems, establishing test ranges, and accessing naval facilities for various purposes, such as mapping and ocean exploration. The activities will ideally be carried out at a co-located facility to enhance collaboration and advance unmanned systems development. The Navy and the Administration are co-located to collaborate on advancing unmanned maritime systems development, including research, testing, modifications, and integration. They aim to accelerate the transition from concept to manufacturing and acquisition. Additionally, they may utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for interagency coordination and work with the academic sector. The National Oceanographic Partnership Program, established for unmanned maritime systems coordination, may collaborate with academic institutions for research, training, and commercialization purposes. Facilitating commercialization of unmanned maritime systems through partnerships with academic research institutions, private industry, and public safety agencies. Providing access to facilities for testing, assessment, and training of unmanned maritime systems. Promoting engagement with other academic institutions with expertise in unmanned maritime systems and promoting information sharing. Engagement with the private sector is important for supporting the commercialization of unmanned maritime systems and assessing commercially available options to align with Navy and Administration goals. Coordination with academic institutions and information sharing are also key aspects of promoting robust unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator, with key personnel, will regularly assess available unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration missions. This includes science-based assessments of suitability, feasibility, and cost. The Administrator will assess unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting NOAA missions through science-based assessments of suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness. The Assistant Administrator and Director will jointly convene and consult the Unmanned Maritime Systems Ocean Technology Coordinating Committee. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. The Assistant Administrator and Director will consult with various stakeholders to conduct assessments. The Administrator may develop Memoranda of Understanding for greater efficiency in acquisition. The Administrator may develop Memoranda of Understanding with the Secretary of the Navy to enhance efficiency in procurement of unmanned maritime systems, including participating in Navy procurements, accepting decommissioned systems, sharing policies, and creating savings. This Act does not alter Federal procurement law. Additionally, reports on unmanned maritime systems and their use for NOAA missions are required. SEC. 6. REPORTS ON UNMANNED MARITIME SYSTEMS AND USAGE FOR MISSION OF THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION. The Administrator must submit reports on unmanned maritime systems used by NOAA programs every four years, detailing data inventory, benefits, and data requirements. The curr_chunk provides an inventory of unmanned maritime systems used by Administration programs, data they collect, benefits realized, prioritized data requirements, and commercially available systems. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" is defined as specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The Administrator may use existing funds for this Act and has additional authorities to enter contracts, accept donations, and utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The Administrator has the authority to accept donations, funds from other Federal departments, and utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. They can also transfer funds to organizations and use resources from various government entities, including international organizations. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
