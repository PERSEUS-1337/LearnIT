    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for electronic surveillance. Recent concerns have led to proposals to amend FISA and the practices of the FISC, focusing on altering the process for selecting judges for the FISA courts. The report focuses on proposals to change the selection process for judges on the FISA courts, which are Article III courts established by Congress to issue orders related to foreign intelligence investigations. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure to ensure impartial administration of the laws. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), an Article III court authorized to issue orders for foreign intelligence investigations. The FISC can approve electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen register/trap and trace device use, and access to business records. The FISA Court of Review can review FISC denials. Judges serve seven-year terms and are selected by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The FISC and FISA Court of Review judges are designated by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for seven-year terms. Criticisms of the selection process have led to proposed bills in Congress to change how FISA judges are chosen. Several bills have been introduced in the 113th Congress to alter the process for selecting FISA judges, with proposals including transferring selection authority to the chief judges of the circuit courts or authorizing the President or congressional leadership to choose FISA judges. The judicial branch has expressed concern with proposals to shift selection of FISA judges away from the Chief Justice. The report discusses the constitutionality of proposals to change the process for selecting FISA judges, including concerns about shifting selection authority away from the Chief Justice. It reviews the constitutional method for appointing judges and explores the designation process for temporary appointments. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates how government officials must be appointed. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates the appointment of government officials, including principal officers like judges. The Supreme Court has ruled that expanding the duties of an office may not require a second appointment if the incumbent already holds significant authority. The Supreme Court has ruled that expanding the duties of an office may not require a second appointment if the incumbent already holds significant authority under the laws of the United States. In Weiss v. United States, military officers could serve on a military court without a second appointment if the additional duties are germane to their original government post. This principle of \"germaneness\" allows Congress to increase the power and duties of an existing office without the need for reappointment. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress can increase the power and duties of an existing office without requiring reappointment. This includes allowing federal judges to serve in separate positions in a related Article III capacity. Congress has a history of using designations for Article III courts and giving the Chief Justice authority to assign federal judges to other federal courts. The Chief Justice was given authority to assign federal judges to specialized tribunals, like the now-defunct Commerce Court. This process became a model for future specialized courts, with lower federal court judges also receiving designation authority. The Supreme Court has upheld these designations within the judicial branch. The Supreme Court has upheld designations within the judicial branch, such as in McDowell v. United States where it affirmed the power of Congress to allow one District Judge to temporarily discharge duties in another district. The Court emphasized that the designation process does not infringe upon the executive power of appointment, as District Courts are created by statute and under the control of Congress. The Supreme Court has upheld designations within the judicial branch, such as in McDowell v. United States, emphasizing that the designation process does not infringe upon the executive power of appointment. Courts have dismissed constitutional challenges to the Chief Justice's authority in designating district court judges, including in Lamar v. United States. The constitutionality of the process for designating FISA judges has also been upheld in cases like United States v. Cavanagh. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected an argument that the FISC violates the Appointments Clause. They cited precedent that supports the temporary assignment of judges by the Chief Justice. District courts have also upheld the FISA designation process, noting that FISA judges are not distinguishable from other federal judges. The central issue raised by proposals to alter who selects FISA judges remains. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would select the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit with a vacancy. The central issue is whether the selection process by certain individuals within the branches of government is constitutionally permissible. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would select the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit with a vacancy. The Chief Justice would still have the final authority in designating a judge to the FISA courts under this proposal. The Chief Justice would have the final authority in designating a judge to the FISA courts under the proposed FISA Judge Selection Reform Act. The arrangement of authorizing others within the judicial branch to designate FISA judges could be constitutionally permissible based on limited judicial precedent. The McDowell Court emphasized Congress's control over how judges exercise jurisdiction and the power to temporarily assign duties to District Judges in different districts. The McDowell Court emphasized Congress's control over how judges exercise jurisdiction and the power to temporarily assign duties to District Judges in different districts. This principle suggests that Congress could authorize the Chief Justice to designate a judge to the FISA courts under the proposed FISA Judge Selection Reform Act. However, historical statutes limiting a chief judge's designation authority may lead a reviewing court to interpret McDowell narrowly, potentially restricting broader designation authority for chief judges. The McDowell Court highlighted Congress's control over judges' jurisdiction and the ability to assign duties to District Judges. This could allow the Chief Justice to designate judges to FISA courts under the FISA Judge Selection Reform Act. However, limitations on chief judges' authority may restrict broader designation authority. Other proposals suggest giving the President the power to designate FISA court judges, potentially raising concerns about the courts' status as Article III courts. A reviewing court could interpret that judges appointed to FISA courts for fixed terms do not lose their overall Article III status or protections, despite not having life tenure like judges on Article III courts. A federal judge appointed to FISA courts for a fixed term retains their Article III status and protections, despite not having life tenure like judges on Article III courts. The proposal to allow the President to select federal judges for FISA courts could raise separation-of-powers concerns. Mistretta v. United States established that the President can appoint judges to nonadjudicatory roles within the judicial branch. The President can appoint judges to the U.S. Sentencing Commission within the judicial branch, but cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges. FISA judges retain their Article III status and protections, raising separation-of-powers concerns if the President selects them. Mistretta v. United States established the President's ability to appoint judges to nonadjudicatory roles within the judicial branch. The selection of FISA judges by the President alone may raise separation-of-powers concerns, as it could potentially compromise their impartiality. Proposals like the FISA Court Accountability Act suggest allowing both the Chief Justice and congressional leadership to make designations to the FISC and FISA Court of Review, which could pose Appointments Clause issues. The FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586) proposes allowing the Chief Justice and congressional leadership to designate FISC and FISA Court of Review members. This raises concerns under the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles, as Congress lacks the authority to directly select appointees with significant authority. Additionally, these designations may conflict with the bicameralism and presentment requirements outlined in I.N.S. v. Chadha. The Court in Chadha ruled that legislative acts altering legal rights outside the Legislative Branch must meet constitutional requirements. Congressional designations to the judiciary without approval may violate these principles."
