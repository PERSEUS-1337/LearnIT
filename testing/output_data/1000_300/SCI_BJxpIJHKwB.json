Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM) addresses the challenge of generating diverse classification weights for query samples with very few training samples. AWGIM generates different weights for each query sample by allowing them to attend to the entire support set, maximizing mutual information between the generated weights and query/support data. This approach is a novel contribution in the field of few shot image classification. AWGIM aims to generate adaptive weights for query samples by maximizing mutual information with support data, a novel approach in few shot learning. This method has shown state-of-the-art performance in benchmark datasets, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in deep learning methods. Few shot learning is proposed to enable deep models to learn from very few samples, with meta learning being the most popular approach. Meta learning allows models to extract high-level knowledge across tasks for quick adaptation to new tasks. Different methods like gradient-based and metric-based approaches are used in meta learning for few shot learning. In this work, Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM) is introduced to address limitations in weights generation methods for few shot learning. AWGIM generates classification weights specifically for each query sample, improving performance in the few shot challenge. In this work, Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM) is introduced to address limitations in weights generation methods. AWGIM generates classification weights specifically for each query sample, improving performance in the few shot challenge by maximizing the lower bound of mutual information between generated weights and query, support data. AWGIM is the first work to introduce Variational Information Maximization in few shot learning, minimizing computational overhead. By maximizing mutual information's lower bound, AWGIM eliminates inner updates without performance compromise. It shows state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and includes detailed component analysis. Previous successful methods in few shot learning include meta learning approaches like optimal initialization and meta-learner LSTM. In gradient-based approaches, optimal initialization is learned for all tasks. Meta-learner LSTM is used to optimize few-shot classification tasks. Metric-based methods focus on learning a similarity metric between query and support samples. Some works also consider spatial information or local image descriptors for richer similarities. Generating classification weights directly has been explored as well. Some methods for few-shot classification include generating classification weights directly from activations of a trained feature extractor. Generative models are also used to generate more data for few-shot classification tasks. Bertinetto et al. (2019) utilized closed-form solutions for few-shot classification. In few-shot classification, generative models like Bertinetto et al. (2019) are used to generate additional data. Attention mechanisms, effective in computer vision and natural language processing, model interactions between queries and key-value pairs. Self and cross attention are employed to encode task and query-task information, similar to Attentive Neural Processes. In few-shot image classification, attention mechanisms like self and cross attention are used to encode task and query-task information. The approach focuses on maximizing mutual information for classification, contrasting with regression methods that optimize variational objectives. Mutual information measures the decrease in uncertainty of one random variable when another is known. The Kullback-Leibler divergence measures the difference between joint and marginal distributions. Mutual information is used in various applications like Generative Adversarial Networks and self-supervised learning. The attentive path equips query samples with task knowledge through an attention mechanism. Weight generator g generates classification weights specific for x. The weight generator g generates classification weights specific for x and X, maximizing mutual information. The proposed model is described in Sec. 3.3, with an objective function that maximizes mutual information between variables. The problem is formulated under episodic training paradigm for few-shot classification tasks. The problem is formulated under episodic training paradigm for few-shot classification tasks, where N-way K-shot tasks are sampled from an unknown task distribution. Support set S contains N K labeled samples, while query set Q includes x for which we need to predict label \u0177 based on S. Meta-training involves estimating meta-loss on Q to optimize the model, while meta-testing evaluates the performance of meta-learning method on Q with labeled S. The proposed approach aims to generate classification weights specific for x and X, maximizing mutual information. The proposed approach aims to generate classification weights for tasks in meta-training and meta-testing, following a general framework for weight generation. Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO) is a method related to this work, where classification weights are decoded from a latent code z generated by h conditioned on the support set S. LEO generates classification weights from a latent code z based on the support set S. It avoids updating high-dimensional weights in the inner loop by learning a lower-dimensional latent space. Unlike AWGIM, LEO does not require inner updates to adapt the model. The proposed method involves a feedforward network trained to maximize mutual information for different tasks. Unlike LEO, which generates fixed weights based on the support set, AWGIM learns optimal classification weights for each query sample. The framework includes a feature extractor processing images into d-dimensional vectors for task context encoding. The feature extractor processes images into d-dimensional vectors for task context encoding. Two paths, contextual and attentive, encode the task context and individual query sample. Classification weights are generated to predict labels and maximize mutual information. The encoding process involves two paths: contextual path for learning representations of the support set and attentive path for adapting to different query samples. Existing methods generate classification weights based on the support set only, leading to sub-optimal results. Introducing the attentive path allows individual query examples to attend to the task context for better weight generation. The attentive path introduces adaptive classification weights by allowing individual query examples to attend to the task context, improving weight generation compared to existing methods. A multi-head self-attention network is employed in the attentive path to encode global task information, different from the contextual path which focuses on generating classification weights. Sharing the same self-attention networks may limit expressiveness. The attentive path focuses on generating classification weights using self-attention, while the cross attention network is used to provide context for query samples. Multi-head attention is utilized to learn comprehensive representations from different subspaces. Replicating and reshaping the data allows for more expressive representations. The attentive path generates classification weights using self-attention, while the cross attention network provides context for query samples. Data is replicated and reshaped to create more expressive representations. The classification weights follow a Gaussian distribution with diagonal covariance, sampled from a learned distribution during meta-training. The weights are sampled from a learned distribution during meta-training and follow a Gaussian distribution with diagonal covariance. Classification weights are computed by taking the mean value on K classification weights for each class. The prediction for query data is computed using the final classification weight matrix. Additionally, there are two decoders that reconstruct X cp and X ap using the generated weights as inputs. The weights generator g produces weights W used by two decoders r1 and r2 to reconstruct Xcp and Xap. The reconstruction is used as an auxiliary task. The generated classification weights are not sensitive to different query samples. The weights generator produces weights used by two decoders to reconstruct data. However, the generated classification weights are not sensitive to different query samples. To address this limitation, the proposal is to maximize mutual information between generated weights and support/query data. This involves using Variational Information Maximization to compute a lower bound. The proposal aims to maximize mutual information between generated weights and support/query data using Variational Information Maximization to compute a lower bound. This involves approximating true posterior distributions and maximizing a new objective function. The proposal aims to maximize mutual information between generated weights and support/query data using Variational Information Maximization to compute a lower bound. The new objective function involves maximizing the log likelihood of label for both support and query data with respect to the network parameters, minimizing cross entropy between prediction and ground-truth, and reconstructing x cp and x ap with L2 loss. Hyper-parameters \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , \u03bb 3 trade-off different terms in the loss function for training the network. The loss function for training the network involves hyper-parameters \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , \u03bb 3 for trade-off of different terms. The generated classification weights are influenced by support data and query samples. LEO computes inner update loss as cross entropy on support data. LEO can be seen as a special case of the proposed method with certain conditions. The encoding process in contextual path results in computational complexity O((N K) 2) due to self-attention. The proposed method introduces a new approach with contextual and attentive paths, resulting in computational complexity O((N K) 2 + |Q|(N K)). The method, called AWGIM, reduces training and inference time significantly without compromising performance. Empirical evaluation is presented in A.3.4, with experiments conducted on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet. The empirical evaluation is conducted on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets, comparing with other methods. miniImageNet has 100 classes with 600 images each, while tieredImageNet has 608 classes and 779,165 images selected from 34 higher level nodes in ImageNet hierarchy. The dataset used for meta-training, meta-validation, and meta-testing contains 608 classes and 779,165 images selected from 34 higher level nodes in the ImageNet hierarchy. Image features from LEO are utilized, with a 28-layer Wide Residual Network trained on the meta-training set. Each image is represented by a 640-dimensional vector for input to the model. N-way K-shot experiments are conducted with randomly sampled classes and support/query sets. The average accuracy for query set is reported during meta-testing. During meta-testing, 600 N-way K-shot tasks are sampled from the meta-testing set. The average accuracy for the query set is reported with a 95% confidence interval. TensorFlow is used to implement the method with a feature embedding dimension of 640.

AWGIM outperforms other methods in generating classification weights, showing superior performance on tieredImageNet and miniImageNet. Comparison with LEO in Table 3 highlights AWGIM's effectiveness, especially when considering the impact of attentive paths and information maximization on generator performance. The generator in AWGIM achieves similar or slightly better results than \"Generator in LEO\", indicating that self-attention is comparable to relation networks in LEO for modeling task-context. By replacing attention modules with 2-layer MLPs in \"MLP encoding\", accuracy close to LEO can still be achieved, emphasizing the importance of information maximization. Ablation analysis on \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2, and \u03bb 3 further demonstrates the significance of maximizing information for performance. In the context of maximizing information for performance, ablation analysis was conducted on \u03bb 1, \u03bb 2, and \u03bb 3. Setting all values to 0 resulted in accuracy similar to \"generator conditioned on S only\", highlighting the importance of mutual information between weights and support. Notably, \u03bb 1 = 0 significantly affected performance, suggesting the critical role of support label prediction in information maximization. The study investigates the impact of different classification weights on support label prediction in AWGIM. By shuffling the weights between query samples within and between classes, it was found that the classification weights are adapted for different query samples. Random shuffling between classes degraded accuracy in 5-way 1-shot experiments. The study explores the effect of shuffling classification weights on support label prediction in AWGIM. Random shuffling between classes decreased accuracy in 5-way 1-shot experiments, indicating that weights for query samples within the same class are similar but distinct for different classes. In 5-way 5-shot experiments, larger support sets led to more diverse and specific classification weights for each query sample. In this work, Attentive Weights Generation via Information Maximization (AWGIM) is introduced for few-shot image classification. AWGIM learns to generate optimal classification weights for each query sample by maximizing the mutual information between generated weights and query, support data. This approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and utilizes mutual information techniques for few-shot learning. AWGIM is the first work to use mutual information techniques for few-shot learning, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The multi-head attention involves encoding global task information to support samples and computing cross attention between query and context-aware support samples. AWGIM utilizes mutual information techniques for few-shot learning, achieving top performance on benchmark datasets. The cross attention between query and context-aware support samples is computed, with classification weights following a Gaussian distribution. For few-shot regression tasks, the number of classes is set to 1 during meta-training, adapting the loss function to mean square error. Weight and bias parameters are generated for a three-layer MLP with a hidden dimension of 40. We use data points (x, y) as inputs to AWGIM to generate weight and bias parameters for a three-layer MLP with hidden dimension 40. Few shot regression tasks are constructed as sinusoidal or linear regression tasks. Multi-head attention is replaced with single-head attention for 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot experiments on miniImageNet dataset, showing improved performance. Single head attention struggles with extremely scarce data, as seen in the results. Comparing AWGIM with LEO in terms of convergence speed, batch size is set to 16. The performance of AWGIM is compared with LEO in terms of convergence speed using a batch size of 16. AWGIM converges faster than LEO and outperforms it, except for the initial iterations. Inference time of AWGIM shows minimal computational overhead compared to using \"MLP encoding\" with time complexity O(N K + |Q|). Experiments on miniImageNet with a batch size of 64 show AWGIM's efficiency. The usage of self-attention and cross attention in AWGIM incurs negligible overhead compared to MLP encoding due to small values of N, K, and |Q|. Visualization of classification weights using t-SNE shows efficient processing on GPU. In a meta-validation set experiment, 400 tasks with 5 query samples each were visualized using t-SNE. The generated classification weights showed closer clustering compared to the inputs. The generator could adapt weights for different query samples, as seen in the visualization results. The generator can adapt weights for different query samples, as shown in the t-SNE visualization. Blue and red dots represent classification weights for query samples in the same task."
