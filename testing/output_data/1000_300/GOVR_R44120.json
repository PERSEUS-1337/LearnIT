    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the two versions are resolved by a conference committee. This report highlights personnel-related issues of high interest to Congress and constituents, comparing House and Senate versions of the bills. The report summarizes key differences between the House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016 NDAA), highlighting personnel-related issues that may generate congressional and constituent interest. It compares S. 1356, passed by both chambers and signed into law, with an earlier vetoed version, H.R. 1735, which exceeded defense funding limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The President objected to a bill that would have exceeded defense spending limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. He later signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense. The revised NDAA complied with the new spending caps while retaining military personnel provisions. The initial bill (H.R. 1735) was modified to comply with revised spending caps while keeping military personnel provisions intact. The revised NDAA was substituted for an unrelated bill (S. 1356) and passed by the House and Senate. The Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for these bills on various dates in 2015. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for detailed background information and analysis. Some issues were previously addressed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The CRS report provides information on military personnel issues, including authorized end-strengths for FY2001 and increases in Army and Marine Corps personnel in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Contact information for CRS analysts is available for further details. The authorized end-strengths for military branches post-9/11 attacks saw increases due to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with subsequent reversals in anticipation of troop withdrawals and budget constraints. The Army plans to reduce active personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017. The Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have specific end-strength numbers. The Army plans to reduce active personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017. The Administration request proposed reductions in Army strength but increases or level strengths for the other services. The final bill's authorized end-strengths align with the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which is higher. The final bill's authorized end-strengths for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force align with the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which is 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill would have allowed the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel numbers in various components by certain percentages. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) allowed reductions in personnel numbers for National Guard, Reserve, and active duty components by certain percentages, adjusting minimum end-strengths downward and expanding the Secretary of Defense's authority to decrease these minimum strengths. The final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) authorized reductions in personnel numbers for National Guard, Reserve, and active duty components by certain percentages, allowing a decrease of up to 2% versus the current 0.5%. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. Over the past 14 years, there have been reductions in Navy Reserve strength, leading to a decline in the overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves. The largest shifts in authorized end strength occurred in the Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. Other components of the Selected Reserve also experienced modest shifts in strength during this period. For FY2016, the Administration proposed changes in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for various components. The Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve faced reductions, while the Navy Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve saw increases. The Coast Guard Reserve remained unchanged. The enacted bill matched the Administration's request. The Administration proposed changes in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for various components for FY2016. The Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve faced reductions, while the Navy Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve saw increases. The Coast Guard Reserve remained unchanged. The enacted bill matched the Administration's request. The military pay raise for 2016 is determined by a formula linked to the Employment Cost Index, with a proposed increase of 1.3% in the FY2016 President's Budget, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%. The Department of Defense plans to limit pay raises through FY2020, assuming a 2.3% increase in the ECI annually for the next four years. The Department of Defense plans to limit pay raises through FY2020, with increases of 1.3% in FY2017, 1.5% in FY2018 and FY2019, and 1.8% in FY2020. The initial House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay, but supported a 2.3% military pay raise for fiscal year 2016. The committee supports a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with private sector pay increases. President Obama set the pay raise at 1.3% for 2016, invoking 37 U.S.C. 1009(e). President Obama set the military pay raise for 2016 at 1.3%, freezing the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. The military retirement system is a defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity to servicemembers after 20 years of service. The NDAA for FY2013 established a commission to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services, with many proposed changes included in the enacted bill. The Commission's final report on military retirement system changes was delivered to Congress on January 29, 2015. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) will transition the existing system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. The new military retirement system will implement a reduced multiplier for defined benefits, grandfather existing servicemembers, and offer continuation pay at 12 years of service. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments are repealed by this Act. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military highlighted issues regarding legal procedures, policies, data collection, and reporting for military sexual assaults. The report indicated that 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military were estimated to have experienced sexual assault. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military revealed that 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014. Social retaliation was reported by 53% of victims, including adverse administrative action, professional retaliation, and punishment. The Government Accountability Office identified a need for the DOD to improve care for male sexual assault victims, which the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and care for male sexual assault victims in the military. It enhances the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifies requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. On January 24, 2013, the Department of Defense rescinded the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women in combat roles. By December 3, 2015, all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress established gender-neutral requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. On December 3, 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced that all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress established gender-neutral requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 and subsequent years directed DOD on developing and applying standards for measuring performance in specific military occupations. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for developing performance standards related to combat unit readiness. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for developing performance standards related to combat unit readiness. Changes made by the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) shorten the waiting period for Congress to review changes to assignment policies related to opening or closing military positions for females to 30 calendar days. This provides a more definitive timeline for implementation for DOD and reduces the amount of time Congress has for review. Changes made by the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) shorten the waiting period for Congress to review changes to assignment policies related to opening or closing military positions for females to 30 calendar days. This provides a more definitive timeline for implementation for DOD and reduces the amount of time Congress has for review. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, potentially impacting readiness. Improving financial literacy could save the DOD millions annually and reduce troops separated due to financial distress. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) mandates financial literacy training for servicemembers. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) mandates financial literacy training for servicemembers at various career points due to life changes or transitions. This includes requirements for enlistment in both active and reserve components. The MAVNI program allows exceptions for enlistment in the military if deemed vital to national interest under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7504. Enlistees must be U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have previously served in the armed forces as specified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a712102. The MAVNI program allows exceptions for enlistment in the military if deemed vital to national interest under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7504. Enlistees must be U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have previously served in the armed forces as specified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a712102. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include the provision linking eligibility requirements for enlistment in the reserve component with those for the active component. The Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) was recommended for termination by the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission due to the more generous benefits provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The initial Senate-passed bill proposed a sunset date for REAP four years after the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Only those using REAP in the enrollment period immediately prior to the date of enactment would be eligible during the interim period. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 established a sunset date for the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) four years after enactment. Only those enrolled in REAP prior to the enactment date could continue using the program during the interim period. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 established a sunset date for the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) four years after enactment. The current discussion involves requests for an official identification card for veterans to verify their military service, with a proposed bill entitling individuals undergoing discharge from the Armed Forces to a \"Recognition of Service ID Card.\" This card would identify the bearer as a veteran and include their name and photograph. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 established a sunset date for the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) four years after enactment. A proposed bill entitles individuals undergoing discharge from the Armed Forces to a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" to identify them as veterans. The card includes their name and photograph, and the Secretary of Defense may negotiate with national retail chains for acceptance. Honorably discharged veterans can also use state-issued ID cards to designate their veteran status. Veterans in 44 states and the District of Columbia can apply for a driver's license or ID card indicating veteran status. Since January 2014, honorably separated Uniformed Services members can obtain a military service ID card through the DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide identification cards to veterans with proof of military service. Congress aims to recruit and retain high-quality personnel in the armed forces through incentives like educational benefits and recruiting bonuses. Congress has an ongoing interest in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel in the armed forces through incentives like educational benefits and recruiting bonuses. Section 531 of the House-passed bill authorizes service secretaries to provide additional recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel. Section 522 of the enacted bill incorporated this provision. The proposed incentive for recruitment and retention in the armed forces would be subject to a 30-day congressional review and approval period. When reservists are called into active federal service, they become eligible for legal protections, including the right to reemployment under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 grants the right to reemployment for those leaving civilian jobs for military service, with a five-year limit. Certain types of duty are exempt from this limit, such as reservist activations under Full Mobilization, Partial Mobilization, and Presidential Reserve Call-Up. New mobilization authorities created in 2011 allow for 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions in support of combatant commands. The new activation authorities under P.L. 112-81 allow for 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions in support of combatant commands. Section 565 of H.R. 1735 exempts military duty under these authorities from counting towards the five-year limit on military service for reemployment protection under USERRA. By statute, a veteran is defined as a person who served in active military, naval, or air service under conditions other than dishonorable. Active service refers to full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or Public Health Service. Not all types of service qualify as active military service for VA benefits. Types of service considered active military service include full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or its predecessors. Active service also covers periods of active duty for training resulting in injury or death, as well as inactive duty for training under certain conditions. Additional circumstances of service are outlined in law (38 U.S.C. 101). National Guard and reserves members who are never activated for active duty are also included. Members of the National Guard and reserves must be activated for active duty military service to meet the statutory definition of a veteran, even if they qualify for reserve retirement after 20 years of service. The initial House-passed bill (H.R. 1735) proposed that reservists who qualify for reserve retirement should be \"honored as veterans.\" The enacted bill did not include the provision from the initial House-passed bill (H.R. 1735) that reservists who qualify for reserve retirement should be \"honored as veterans.\" This designation would not provide any additional benefits. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a pilot Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for work/life balance or broadening opportunities. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for work/life balance or broadening opportunities. The program aims to retain high-performing servicemembers by providing career flexibility and increasing retention rates. Participants accept an additional active duty service obligation for every month spent in CIP, with a maximum six-year follow-on obligation. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for work/life balance or broadening opportunities. Participants accept an additional active duty service obligation for every month in CIP, with a maximum six-year follow-on obligation. The enacted bill would remove prohibitions on program participation by certain members of the Armed Forces and remove restrictions on the number of annual participants. Congress has been focused on improving recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 created incentives for officers to be educated and experienced in joint matters for acquisition duty assignments. Congress has been concerned with improving recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce, including additional incentives for high-performing military personnel. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 incentivized officers to be educated in joint matters for acquisition duty assignments. The enacted bill extends joint duty credit to include service in acquisition-related assignments and allows officers to pursue a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition fields. NDAA conferees encouraged including acquisition matters in Phase II joint professional military education. The NDAA conferees urged the Secretary of Defense to incorporate acquisition matters into Phase II joint professional military education. Current DOD policies restrict the carrying of firearms on military bases to personnel on assigned duties. Military servicemembers are prohibited from carrying personal firearms on bases while on duty. Contact [author name scrubbed] for military personnel issues and [author name scrubbed] for defense acquisition matters. The NDAA restricts carrying firearms on military bases to personnel on assigned duties. Following recent active shooter incidents, there is debate on whether servicemembers should have broader authority to carry personal or government-issued firearms. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would compel DOD to review current policies. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would give more flexibility to commanders to establish protocols for servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection. The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the Armed Forces killed or wounded in action. Servicemembers injured in the Oklahoma City bombing are ineligible, but supporters argue they should be eligible. Supporters of Section 583 of H.R. 1735 argue that servicemembers killed in the Oklahoma City bombing should be eligible for the Purple Heart, but opponents disagree, stating they were victims of domestic terrorism. The FY2015 NDAA expanded eligibility to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX, initially considered criminal acts. Some believe these acts should be viewed as terrorism due to the Muslim perpetrators' motives. Section 571 of the NDAA for FY2015 expanded Purple Heart eligibility by redefining attacks by foreign terrorist organizations. The law specifies that an attack should be considered terrorism if the perpetrator was in communication with the organization before the attack and if the attack was inspired by the organization. The NDAA for FY2015 expanded Purple Heart eligibility by redefining attacks by foreign terrorist organizations. The provision in Section 583 of the initial House-passed bill was not adopted, so servicemembers affected by the Oklahoma City bombing are not eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill. Military working dogs (MWDs) have been a topic of congressional and media attention, with laws and provisions in the NDAA related to their transfer and adoption. The issue of military working dogs (MWDs) has received congressional and media attention over the years. Congress enacted laws related to the transfer and adoption of MWDs, including \"Robby's Law\" in November 2000 (P.L. 106-446) to prevent euthanizing MWDs and facilitate their adoption by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. The NDAA for FY2012 (Sec. 351, P.L. 112-81) expanded eligibility for adopting MWDs to include handlers, their family members, and others capable of caring for the dogs. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility for adopting military working dogs to include handlers, family members, and others capable of caring for the dogs. The NDAA for FY2013 allowed retiring MWDs to be transferred for adoption. The current law does not require DOD to transfer retired MWDs overseas back to the United States. The current law does not require DOD to transfer retired MWDs overseas back to the United States. The enacted bill requires DOD to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas to the United States and give adoption priority to former handlers. This change will facilitate the domestic transfer of these dogs to qualified adopters. The language change from \"may\" to \"shall\" requires all military working dogs to be retired only after they are returned to the United States, facilitating domestic transfer to qualified adopters. Opponents argue that the lack of appropriated funds for transferring retiring MWDs from abroad will be costly. The President's FY2015 and FY2016 budget proposals included cuts to the Defense Commissary System, but funding was fully restored in the FY2015 NDAA. The proposed cuts aimed to reduce subsidies for commissaries, potentially impacting operating hours and costs for goods. The commissary budget is being cut from $1.3 billion to $400 million in three years, affecting only stateside commissaries. This could lead to reduced operating days and hours, potentially increasing costs for goods and services. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retired personnel, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians stationed overseas. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report by March 1, 2016, with a plan to achieve budget-neutrality for the Defense Commissary Agency and military exchange system. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) mandates a report from the Secretary of Defense by March 1, 2016, outlining a plan to achieve budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system. The plan must meet set benchmarks like customer service satisfaction and sustain discount savings for eligible patrons by October 1, 2018. It should include potential modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, pricing constructs, and impact on MWR programs. The Defense Secretary is required to submit a report by March 1, 2016, detailing a plan to achieve budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system. The plan should address pricing constructs, potential modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, and the impact on MWR programs. This report will consider previous legislation and studies, including options like variable pricing, private label products, and converting the defense commissary system to a non-appropriated fund instrumentality. The Defense Secretary is required to submit a report detailing a plan to achieve budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system. This plan should address pricing constructs, potential modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, and the impact on MWR programs. The enacted bill requires a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days. The FY2016 budget request proposed changes to TRICARE health care options for uniformed servicemembers, retirees, and their dependents. This includes replacing current plans with a consolidated option, increasing pharmaceutical copays, and introducing a new enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. The Administration proposed changes to TRICARE health care options in the FY2016 budget request, including replacing current plans with a consolidated option, increasing pharmaceutical copays, and introducing a new enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. However, most of these proposals were not adopted, and recommendations for changes to TRICARE were not endorsed by the President or included in the House- or Senate-passed versions of H.R. 1735. Congress may still consider major changes to the TRICARE benefit in the future. The Senate report stated that while the committee believes the Commission's healthcare recommendations may address issues within the military health system, they are taking a cautious approach to enacting TRICARE reform legislation. The committee has recommended provisions in the Act to improve access to care, deliver better health outcomes, enhance the care experience for beneficiaries, and control healthcare costs, laying the foundation for comprehensive TRICARE modernization. The Act aims to improve access to care, deliver better health outcomes, enhance the care experience for beneficiaries, and control healthcare costs. It lays the foundation for comprehensive TRICARE modernization and reform legislation in the near future. The joint explanatory statement emphasizes the need for comprehensive reform of the military health care system to improve access, quality, and the experience of care for all beneficiaries, maintain medical readiness, and ensure long-term viability and cost-effectiveness. The current military healthcare system needs to be modernized and improved to meet future needs. Reevaluating all elements of the system and increasing fees and co-pays will be necessary for comprehensive reform. The Senate pharmacy provision is discussed separately. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act expanded TRICARE pharmacy benefits, including free 90-day supplies of formulary medications at military pharmacies for both civilian and military prescriptions. The Act also promoted the use of generic medications over brand-name drugs. The 2015 NDAA expanded TRICARE pharmacy benefits, allowing free 90-day supplies of formulary medications at military pharmacies for civilian and military prescriptions. It emphasized the use of generic medications over brand-name drugs and included a one-time $3 increase in pharmacy copays. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes a one-time increase in pharmacy copayments for prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies and by mail order. The copay for generic drugs at retail pharmacies increases from $8 to $10, and for formulary brand name drugs from $20 to $24. Mail order copays increase from $16 to $20 for formulary drugs and from $46 to $49 for non-formulary drugs, resulting in an estimated $1.5 billion reduction in direct spending over 10 years. The FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act addressed military health system quality issues, with a review resulting in an action plan. Some Members of Congress are interested in the plan's implementation. Sections of the initial Senate-passed bill aimed to increase visibility of health quality metrics, with an estimated cost of $95 million over 2016-2020. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires actions to increase visibility of health quality metrics by public access and reports to Congress, estimated to cost $95 million over 2016-2020. Access to contraception remains a concern for Service members according to the 2014 Defense Advisory Committee report. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by a TRICARE-authorized provider. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by a TRICARE-authorized provider, including contraceptive diaphragms, intrauterine devices, prescription contraceptives, and surgical sterilization. However, TRICARE does not cover condoms and nonprescription spermicidal products. Legislation (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires the Secretary of Defense to establish measures to increase access to contraception within one year. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for DOD health care providers regarding contraception methods and counseling for women in the Armed Forces. All female members must have access to comprehensive counseling on contraception methods."
