    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Military forces are crucial for initial security, but international civilian police (CivPol) are increasingly seen as more suitable for maintaining law and order in post-conflict environments. International civilian police (CivPol) have become more recognized for law and order tasks in post-conflict environments. Policymakers are addressing issues with their use and considering improvements to existing systems and building new capabilities. Policymakers are addressing issues with the use of international civilian police (CivPol) in post-conflict environments. Current issues for Congress include improving the existing system and building new U.S. and international CivPol capabilities. Advocates propose facilitating recruitment and deployment of qualified personnel for complex missions and ensuring proper training for handling law enforcement situations. Key reform efforts include recommendations to improve existing CivPol systems and approaches. Key reform efforts include the Clinton Administration's PDD-71 and the UN's Brahimi Panel report, which recommended mechanisms to improve existing CivPol systems and address issues with recruitment, training, and deployment of international civilian police. The Brahimi Panel report made recommendations to address problems with the U.N. civilian police system, including creating a reserve CivPol force, diversifying international police forces, and establishing more robust civilian response mechanisms. These proposals are being considered for implementation. The current focus is on improving police forces for peacekeeping operations, including the establishment of specialized units for crowd control and the creation of civilian response mechanisms. Policymakers are exploring ways to reduce reliance on U.S. military forces in post-conflict operations. The report provides a synopsis of the evolution of international police use in peacekeeping operations, highlighting problems encountered. It discusses current mechanisms for providing CivPols, recommendations for improvement, and options for resolving ongoing issues. The focus is on reducing reliance on U.S. military forces in post-conflict operations. The report discusses the increasing use of CivPols in international peace operations, with a significant rise in the number of international civilian police participating in U.N. operations. As of February 29, 2004, there were 4,655 international civilian police, including 476 Americans, assisting with law enforcement tasks in U.N. peacekeeping missions. Additionally, countries like the United States provide bilateral assistance, especially training, to indigenous police forces. As of February 29, 2004, 476 Americans were part of the 4,655 international civilian police assisting in U.N. peacekeeping missions. Countries like the United States offer bilateral assistance, including training, to indigenous police forces in post-conflict situations. Some analysts suggest deploying international civilian police to countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. U.S. assistance for foreign law enforcement is governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with exceptions for post-conflict situations. International civilian police forces have been utilized since the late 19th century. International civilian police forces have been used since the late 19th century for various purposes, including monitoring, advising, training, and supporting human rights. In some cases, these forces are armed and granted arrest powers. Policing in peacekeeping operations has evolved through five phases in the past decade. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations over the past decade has gone through five phases, involving the expansion of U.N. activities from monitoring mandates to the addition of training components. This evolution has aimed at establishing security and has not necessarily followed a strict sequential order. Operations do not need to be modeled after the latest ones. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, including the addition of training components, the development of mandates for police reform, the creation of specially constituted constabulary units, and the expansion of mandates to provide international police with executive authority. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has included the expansion of mandates to provide international police with \"executive authority\" to bear arms and make arrests. This evolution reflects the international community's growing awareness of security needs in peace operations. Policymakers and analysts increasingly view ensuring public security as the responsibility of countries and organizations involved in interventions. Policymakers and analysts emphasize the responsibility of countries and organizations involved in interventions to ensure public security. They recognize the need for clear mandates and effective implementation procedures. Two problem areas, or \"gaps,\" have been identified in peacekeeping mandates, including recruitment and training deficiencies. The United Nations faces recruitment and training gaps in its peacekeeping operations, leading to difficulties in assembling a well-trained and professional police force. Issues include diverse recruitment pools with varying standards, lack of basic skills among recruits, and instances of corruption. Efforts have been made to address these challenges over the past decade. The United Nations has adopted procedures to address recruitment and training gaps in peacekeeping operations. Challenges include diverse recruitment pools, lack of basic skills, and instances of corruption among early recruits. Additional training is needed to improve policing skills and professionalism, as well as enhance collaboration among personnel. Security gaps in establishing law and order in post-conflict situations persist due to deficiencies in recruitment and training systems. The presence of three security gaps hinders the international community's ability to establish law and order in post-conflict situations. The first gap is the deployment gap, where police forces are not deployed quickly or in sufficient numbers. This was evident in past international missions, such as in Cambodia. Deficiencies in recruitment and training systems contribute to these gaps, making it challenging to address conflicts where not all parties are committed to peace. The deployment gap in international missions has been a challenge, with delays in deploying police forces and recruiting personnel with specialized skills. The enforcement gap also hinders the ability to provide necessary security in post-conflict situations. The U.N. faces challenges in deploying personnel with specialized skills, leading to gaps in enforcement and institution capabilities in post-conflict situations. Military forces may lack the necessary skills for constabulary functions and handling organized crime, compromising peacekeeping operations. In post-conflict situations, peacekeeping operations can be compromised due to shortages of personnel or limitations in mandates. The institution gap arises when local law enforcement systems lack the necessary personnel and resources for effective prosecution and punishment. International police assistance has been provided by the United Nations and other organizations since the end of the Cold War. Since the end of the Cold War, international police assistance has been provided by the United Nations and other organizations to handle increased workload in post-conflict situations. The United Nations international civilian police system is the main mechanism for this assistance, with 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations serving in eight U.N. missions as of February 29, 2004. Jordan is the largest contributor with 553 officers, followed by the United States with 476 officers. Other countries like India also contribute significantly. As of February 29, 2004, 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations were serving in eight U.N. missions. Jordan is the largest contributor with 553 officers, followed by the United States with 476 officers. Other significant contributors include India, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, Nepal, Malaysia, Romania, Pakistan, Argentina, Poland, and the United Kingdom. The majority of UNCIVPOL officers were serving in Kosovo, with other missions in Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, and Afghanistan. Many nations also provided training and reform assistance individually. During the early to mid-1990s, the United States provided police assistance in peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Haiti under U.N. authority. The U.S. developed police training programs in Somalia through ICITAP. Many EU member states and organizations like OSCE have also contributed police assistance individually. The United States, EU member states, and organizations like OSCE have provided police assistance in various countries, with the OSCE and EU taking the lead in specific missions. For example, the OSCE has trained police in Kosovo and other countries, while the EU has taken over police missions in Bosnia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The EU took over police missions in Bosnia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from the United Nations. Member States contribute police personnel voluntarily for peacekeeping operations based on international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations oversees civilian police missions, focusing on policy, planning, recruitment, and training of international civilian police officers. The principles of peacekeeping include consent, impartiality, and minimal use of force in self-defense. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations oversees civilian police missions, focusing on policy, planning, recruitment, and training of international civilian police officers. UNCIVPOL personnel are under the command of the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner, who reports to the U.N. Secretary-General's Special Representative. The Brahimi Panel report identified difficulties with recruitment, training, and deployment of police personnel in U.N. peacekeeping missions. It recommended actions to strengthen the U.N.'s capacity for rapid deployment of UNCIVPOLs. The Brahimi Panel report recommended actions to strengthen the U.N.'s capacity for rapid deployment of UNCIVPOLs, including the establishment of a \"ready roster\" of qualified CivPols by each police-contributing Member State, the development of an on-call list of experts for advance mission planning by the United Nations, regional partnerships for joint police training, and the identification of a national point of contact on CivPol matters in each country. Additionally, the UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to review U.N. policing operations and identify problems. The UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to address problems with U.N. policing operations and propose solutions, including the incorporation of CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system and pre-positioning of equipment for rapid deployment. The UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to address problems with U.N. policing operations. Recommendations were made for a standby arrangement system for military personnel and measures to improve training. Specific proposals were also made for pre-positioning equipment for rapid deployment. Some Brahimi panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations have been implemented, but significant problems remain with the UNCIVPOL system. Constraints on UNCIVPOL reform in recruitment, training, and deployment areas are also discussed. The Brahimi Panel report recommended reforms to address recruitment, training, and deployment issues in UNCIVPOL operations. Progress has been made in reforming the operational and internal management of UNDPKO. The report emphasized the need for a new approach involving qualified law enforcement personnel for restructuring local police. The Brahimi Panel report recommended a new approach for UNCIVPOL operations, emphasizing the need for qualified law enforcement personnel to integrate with rule of law experts for reform and restructuring. This shift may strain U.N. Member States in providing specialized police experts. Some analysts see challenges in implementing this approach within the U.N. CivPol system. The United Nations is facing challenges in implementing a new approach for UNCIVPOL operations, which involves integrating qualified law enforcement personnel with rule of law experts. Some analysts believe that this approach is controversial within the U.N. CivPol system and may infringe on national sovereignty. Despite this, the U.N. has created a new rule of law unit to increase the use of a full range of experts in peacekeeping operations. The United Nations has faced challenges in implementing a new approach for UNCIVPOL operations due to limited resources. Despite creating a new rule of law unit, progress towards integrating rule of law-related components is viewed as \"lagging\" by some analysts. The current ad hoc system of recruiting civilian police from various nations poses three problems, with specific reforms proposed by the Brahimi Panel report. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting civilian police officers due to uneven results in meeting minimum standards and lack of experience in community policing and human rights. Additionally, difficulties arise in recruiting officers with specialized skills, and a lack of a comprehensive civilian police strategy hinders determining mission needs and appropriate authorized strength. The United Nations struggles to recruit civilian police officers with specialized skills due to a lack of a comprehensive strategy for determining mission needs and appropriate authorized strength. This hinders the recruitment of officers with skills suitable for mission requirements, as the current criteria only include basic qualifications such as age, years of service, and language proficiency. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting civilian police officers with specialized skills, as the current criteria focus on basic qualifications like age, years of service, and language proficiency. Despite U.N. efforts to improve recruit quality, some personnel still lack essential skills such as language, driving, and firearms proficiency. Selection Assistance Teams have been sent since 1996 to guide Member States in selecting police candidates. The United Nations has faced challenges in recruiting civilian police officers with specialized skills, despite efforts to improve recruit quality. Selection Assistance Teams have been sent since 1996 to guide Member States in selecting candidates, focusing on language, driving, and firearms requirements. Deficiencies in these areas have led to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. Recruitment for specialized skills remains difficult. The United Nations has struggled to recruit civilian police officers with specialized skills, leading to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. Recruitment for specialized skills, such as training, investigations, organized crime, forensics, drug trafficking, and police intelligence, has been particularly challenging. Efforts to improve the quality of recruits and speed up deployment have been mixed, with recommendations for advance recruitment before mission authorization. The Brahimi Panel Report and UNDPKO seminar recommended establishing national and international ready rosters of pre-selected CivPol personnel for quick deployment, aiming to improve recruitment quality and deployment efficiency. The UNDPKO seminar recommended enhancing UNSAS by creating an effective ready roster of international police personnel through increasing participating countries, creating job descriptions, and identifying personnel by specialization. The Stimson Center evaluation in December 2003 found that too few states have national pools of candidates for international operations, highlighting the need for real candidates with professional experience and familiarity with UN rules and procedures. The Stimson Center evaluation in December 2003 identified a lack of individual candidates for international operations as a major weakness. It recommended replacing 'bidding for slots' with real candidates who have professional experience and familiarity with UN rules and procedures. The Brahimi Panel Report also called for the UN to maintain an on-call list of 100 police officers and related experts for advance mission planning and early deployment. As of March 2004, 10 out of 89 police-contributing Member States have nominated individuals for the on-call lists. The United Nations has made efforts to recruit specialized expertise for new missions, including training exercises and including substantive skills in selection criteria. Analysts have identified shortcomings in U.N. procedures that hinder recruitment efforts. Analysts have criticized the United Nations for lacking standardized criteria in determining the number of civilian police for missions and not consistently matching skills to specific tasks. The audit faulted UNDPKO for not consistently matching skills to specific missions, with civilian police personnel often performing non-policing functions, reducing available police for policing tasks. Administrative functions accounted for a significant portion of police officers in missions, and training varied among police-contributing Member States, sometimes considered inadequate. The training for police-contributing Member States in UN missions varies and is sometimes inadequate. Lack of uniform experience and standardized training can undermine mission effectiveness. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training to civilian police personnel. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training to civilian police personnel in UN missions. Inadequate training is attributed to a lack of experienced trainers, resources, and varying national training programs. Recommendations include developing regional partnerships for joint police training. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO recommendations emphasize the need for joint police training exercises and using U.N. educational materials for pre-deployment training. However, there is limited progress in establishing regional training partnerships among member states. The UNDPKO Training Unit has developed training publications to assist with pre-deployment training programs. The UNDPKO Training Unit has developed training publications to assist Member States with pre-deployment training programs, including standardized training modules for peacekeepers. PDD-71 highlights training as an area where the United States can contribute to enhancing the capabilities of other nations in CivPol operations. PDD-71 emphasizes the importance of training in enhancing the capabilities of other nations in CivPol operations. It calls for the State Department to provide tailored training packages to U.S. and international CIVPOL when requested, with appropriate funding. Under a new State Department CivPol program, capabilities are sought to invite foreign police officers for training with the U.S. contingent. Deployment of UNCIVPOL is complex, involving mission definition, rapid recruitment, and procurement of resources from multiple nations, historically taking six to eighteen months due to resource limitations. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for deployment delays in UNCIVPOL missions, including the lack of a reserve corps of mission leadership, unreliable standby arrangements, and insufficient equipment. It recommended achieving effective and rapid deployment within four to 12 weeks of Security Council authorization. The Brahimi Panel recommended rapid deployment of peacekeeping missions within 30 days for \"traditional\" missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies after Security Council authorization. Constraints on rapid deployment include the U.N. system's limited capacity to handle concurrent missions and insufficient equipment. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations identified constraints on rapid deployment, including the U.N. system's limited capacity for concurrent missions and the need for contributing states to quickly deploy well-trained civilian police personnel. Reforms are underway to improve the United Nations System for Standby Arrangements and develop a 100-person roster for rapid deployment of civilian police personnel. Additionally, equipment is being pre-packaged and stored at the U.N. Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy for quick deployment. The United Nations is enhancing its ability to deploy rapidly in the future by developing a 100-person roster of civilian police personnel and improving procurement and management of strategic deployment stocks at the U.N. Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy. However, there is currently no program in place to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. Many U.N. Member States have generic rapid deployment programs, but few have the capability to deploy rapidly. The U.S. CivPol program, managed by the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, is responsible for policy development, training, oversight, and coordination with the United Nations and other contributing countries. The Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) manages the U.S. CivPol program, recruiting civilian police personnel from local law enforcement agencies through a commercial contractor. DynCorp International has been the sole supplier of civilian police personnel under a State Department contract until April 1, 2004, when a new arrangement was initiated. In 2004, DynCorp International, a CSC Company, was the sole supplier of civilian police personnel under a State Department contract. A new arrangement was initiated in April 2004, with multiple companies now maintaining rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for bidding on deployment contracts. Funding for the U.S. CivPol program comes from various State Department regional bureaus. The U.S. CivPol program is funded through various State Department bureaus and the Peacekeeping account. Officers receive salaries ranging from $50,000-100,000, with additional allowances for U.N. missions. The total cost per officer varies by mission, with recent costs ranging from $100,000 in Kosovo to $150,000-$175,000 in Iraq. DynCorp is the private contractor providing police services in these areas. The cost per U.S. CivPol officer in Kosovo is $100,000, while in Iraq it ranges from $150,000 to $175,000. The expenses in Kosovo cover salary, equipment, transportation, and MWR support, while in Iraq it also includes security, food, and housing costs. The United Nations covers these expenses in Kosovo. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the incremental cost per troop in Iraq ranged from $179,000 to $206,000 based on rotation schedules. As of September 2003, the cost of deploying soldiers to Iraq ranged from $179,000 to $206,000 based on rotation schedules. In March 2004, there were 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel participating in international missions, with deployments in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The United States has deployed 408 police officers and support personnel to Afghanistan and Iraq as unilateral contributions. Additionally, six police officers were provided for monitoring high-profile prisoners in Israel. U.S. policymakers have recognized recruitment and deployment issues for qualified CivPol personnel, with PDD-71 aiming to enhance response capacities and operational activities. PDD-71 aimed to enhance U.S. response capacities by providing guidance for the recruitment, training, management, and deployment of CivPol personnel. Analysts highlight the need for improvements in matching skills with mission requirements, training consistency, and deployment efficiency. Despite ongoing enhancements, there is a continued emphasis on the need to improve the current system. The Department of State has issued contracts for a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service. The intention is to facilitate rapid deployment of well-qualified CivPols, with the contractor responsible for recruitment, training, and procurement services. The new cadre aims to streamline the recruitment process and improve deployment efficiency. The State Department issued contracts for a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and procurement services to streamline the process and improve deployment efficiency. Multiple companies were awarded contracts, raising concerns about the expeditiousness of the process. The new CivPol cadre program, awarded to multiple companies, raises concerns about delays and costs. The original RFP provisions and recruitment methods are under scrutiny, with unclear details on the new contracts. Recruitment for CivPols in the United States draws from overextended state and local law enforcement agencies, with officers taking leave of absence or resigning to perform international police service. The repeated call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces have exacerbated problems with police staffing. The repeated call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces have worsened police staffing issues in municipal and state departments, as many officers are part of the reserve. Analysts suggest that providing compensation to state and municipal governments for detailing officers to international police missions could help recruit a more professional and qualified force. Some argue for compensation for detailing police officers to international missions to improve recruitment and cohesion within the U.S. police contingent. Concerns also exist about the selection criteria not accurately reflecting mission requirements. The requirements for U.S. law enforcement officers serving in international missions include U.S. citizenship, eight years of work experience with at least five years as an active sworn civilian officer, a clean record, a valid driver's license, physical and psychological fitness, a valid passport, and English proficiency. Some missions also require proficiency with a 9mm handgun and specialized experience. The Department of State is improving recruitment for specialized skills. The State Department is improving recruitment for specialized skills in international police missions, including Kosovo, East Timor, and Iraq. The new CivPol cadre program aims to address the problem by including specialists and providing training in essential policing skills. Selected individuals must have experience in a specialized area, interpersonal skills, leadership abilities, and knowledge of international police standards. The CivPol cadre program aims to provide training in essential policing skills to individuals selected for the program. The training is intended to incentivize high-quality officers to join by helping them achieve career goals. However, the specific program details and funding for training all members of the program are unclear. Training for U.S. CivPols is complicated by inconsistencies in skills and professionalism among recruited police officers. The training program for U.S. CivPols is viewed as insufficient due to inconsistencies in skills and professionalism among recruited police officers. The pre-deployment training includes various topics such as United Nations operations, ICITAP, mission overview, and team building. The specific number of individuals in the cadre program is unclear. The training program for U.S. CivPols covers topics such as United Nations operations, ICITAP, mission overview, U.S. military involvement, team building, lifestyle in the mission, human rights, contractor support, personal safety, defensive tactics, and use of police equipment. The curriculum aims to meet national police standards and international principles of democratic policing and human rights. The new training program being developed by INL aims to meet Police Officer Standards and Training (POST) certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing and human rights. It includes ongoing training courses in policing skills, specialized training, and in-service training. The program seeks recognition and certification from U.S. and select foreign law enforcement organizations. Deployment of U.S. CivPol contingent to a U.N. operation can occur within 30-45 days following a U.N. Security Council authorization. The U.S. CivPol contingent can deploy to a U.N. operation within 30-45 days following authorization. Legislation calls for deployment capability within 15 days. Analysts question if current deployment capability can be maintained under the new CivPol cadre system. The contractor would maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment. Some analysts question the current deployment capability under the new CivPol cadre system. The contractor would maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment and develop a logistics support team to provide advanced support. It is unclear if these provisions still apply under the new system's contracts and how deployments may be affected by new bidding processes. European countries deploy police from their national forces to international CivPol operations, with the exception of the United Kingdom and the United States. European governments have recognized the need to reform their deployment systems to enhance international CivPol capabilities. The EU has set goals to improve the quality and timeliness of European contributions to police missions since 1999. The EU has developed goals to improve the quality and timeliness of European contributions to international police missions since 1999. Member States agreed to develop a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for peace operations by 2003. This development is part of the European Security and Defense Policy adopted in 1999. The EU established the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) to fund civilian crisis management operations for a six-month period. EU Member States committed up to 5,000 police officers for crisis management operations, with 1,400 available for rapid deployment within 30 days. Member States also agreed to provide up to 13 rapidly deployable, integrated police units. The EU launched its first ESDP mission on January 1, 2003 in Bosnia and Herzegovina with almost 500 police personnel. Member States committed 5,000 police officers for crisis management, with 1,400 available for rapid deployment within 30 days. Up to 13 integrated police units were also pledged for rapid deployment. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with almost 500 police personnel. The mission aims to establish sustainable policing arrangements in accordance with best practices. The EU began its second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 200 police and civilian personnel. The annual budget for the missions is $47.2 million and $18.6 million respectively. EU Member States have met their commitment for police officers and exceeded the goal for rapid deployment. The EU Member States have met their goals for police officers and rapid deployment in ESDP missions. Analysts are skeptical about the effectiveness of EU crisis management capabilities due to concerns about surrendering national sovereignty. The OSCE is also enhancing its operational capabilities for rapid deployment of CivPols and civilian experts in various countries. The OSCE has 160 CivPols conducting policing activities in eight countries, with a focus on training, reform, and development of local police. The REACT program enables the rapid deployment of experts in conflict prevention and crisis management. Each participating State can establish its own database of qualified civilian experts. The REACT program allows participating States to establish a database of civilian experts for security promotion. OSCE and its 55 participating States have implemented steps to improve the program, including creating national websites for recruitment. The OSCE, along with its participating States, have implemented measures to enhance the REACT program. This includes creating national websites for recruitment and establishing standards for educational and experience requirements. The OSCE developed a staffing matrix to aid in recruiting qualified candidates based on past and current field activities. The OSCE developed a staffing matrix to assist participating States in recruiting qualified CivPols with specific skills and experience requirements. Minimum requirements for civilian police include graduation from a recognized police training school, active police experience, English communication skills, negotiation abilities, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement organizations and proficiency in operating police radio equipment. Mission-specific requirements focus on specific skills needed for the role. The OSCE recruits CivPols with specific skills and experience requirements, including graduation from a police training school, active police experience, English communication skills, negotiation abilities, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement organizations and proficiency in operating police radio equipment. The 108th Congress introduced bills to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions and rule of law missions. H.R. 2616 and S. 2127 aim to enhance U.S. and NATO capabilities for post-conflict stabilization. Analysts suggest options to improve training and constabulary functions. H.R. 1414 proposes reforms for UNCIVPOL effectiveness and recruitment. H.R. 1414, the International Rule of Law and Antiterrorism Act of 2003, proposes reforms to make UNCIVPOL more effective and address recruitment and training issues. It calls for negotiations within the United Nations to establish a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) that can be rapidly deployed to peace operations within 15 days of authorization. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps that can be deployed to peace operations within 15 days of authorization. It emphasizes the need for the corps to have appropriate resources, funding, equipment, training, and staffing. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps with appropriate resources, funding, equipment, training, and staffing. It aims to address deployment and enforcement gaps, and calls for standards and training programs for international civilian police. The bill proposes the creation of a professional U.N. police corps to address deployment and enforcement gaps, improve standards and accountability, and reduce the need for combat soldiers in peacekeeping missions. Opponents are concerned about the cost and feasibility of establishing a standing corps. The bill proposes the creation of a professional U.N. police corps to raise standards and skill levels of personnel, improve accountability, and reduce the need for combat soldiers in peacekeeping missions. Opponents fear the cost and feasibility of a standing corps, as well as concerns about national sovereignty and management capacity of the United Nations. The bill proposes the establishment of a U.N. police corps to enhance peacekeeping missions and reduce the need for combat soldiers. Some concerns include cost, feasibility, and potential infringement on national sovereignty by the United Nations. Another bill, H.R. 2616, aims to improve U.S. and NATO capabilities for reconstruction assistance in post-conflict situations. The bill proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations and train indigenous police forces. It also suggests creating a task force to develop this reserve. The bill proposes the establishment of a civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations and train indigenous police forces. It also suggests creating a NATO mechanism for military and policing services in reconstruction situations. The bill proposes the establishment of a civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations and train indigenous police forces. Proponents argue that this legislation would enhance international capabilities for post-conflict reconstruction by bridging deployment gaps. Proponents argue that the proposed legislation would establish a civilian police reserve to enhance international capabilities for post-conflict reconstruction by bridging deployment gaps. There is debate over whether this reserve should follow the State Department's private sector model or create a new government reserve force. Supporters of the private contractor model believe it is more efficient and avoids creating new government bureaucracies. Opponents may have concerns about limitations associated with this approach. Opponents of the private contractor model argue that limitations regarding commercial contractors in military operations may also apply to policing operations. They suggest that a government-sponsored reserve force could be as efficient as a private contractor, but at a potentially prohibitive cost. Proponents argue that a government reserve force for civilian law enforcement could be a more potent symbol of commitment, responsive to policy, cohesive, and accountable. They believe a government agency could ensure better quality recruits through stricter screening mechanisms and easier recruitment from local and state police departments with a compensation system in place. The desirability of pre-deployment training and coordination with military forces could make a government-sponsored reserve force more effective than a contractor model. This could be easier to establish under a federal reserve model. Questions remain about a NATO Constabulary Capability. The NATO constabulary capability could potentially be more effective and reliable than the current ad hoc model for post-conflict situations. However, there are concerns about whether NATO, as a military organization, is the appropriate venue for a force with policing functions. Critics argue that using military forces for policing may send inappropriate signals and duplicate existing structures within the European Union. Some critics argue that creating a police reserve within NATO could duplicate EU structures and strain US-European relations. Analysts suggest additional provisions for equipment, training, and coordination to avoid delays in deployment and ensure standardized training for effective operations. Critics argue that creating police reserves without standardized training could perpetuate policing style differences and lead to repeated problems in future operations. Some are skeptical of the need for such forces and the commitment of U.S. police officers. The bill S. 2127 aims to strengthen civilian rule of law and capabilities through joint training with U.S. and other military forces. S. 2127, the Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004, aims to reorganize government structures to enhance the capacity of civilian foreign affairs agencies in responding to overseas crises. It proposes $80 million to hire personnel for a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve roster, consisting of federal employees and non-government personnel trained for missions. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 proposes creating a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve roster with federal and non-government personnel trained for missions. The bill aims to address delays in deploying rule of law personnel, but lacks clarity on the types of personnel to be recruited. The need for improved training and professionalization of CivPol personnel is highlighted to bridge the deployment gap. Pre-deployment training has not kept pace with the increasing scope and mandate of police missions, leading to adjustments being made in the field on a case-by-case basis. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity to provide tailored training packages. In Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor, training adjustments were made on a case-by-case basis. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity to provide tailored training packages for CivPol personnel. Some analysts recommend increased funding for police training due to the prohibitive cost for many nations. The State Department's proposal includes provisions for U.S. training of foreign police personnel, but no decisions have been made yet. The State Department's proposal includes provisions for U.S. training of foreign police personnel, with the content and scope depending on available funding. Analysts suggest increasing international constabulary capabilities to address deployment and enforcement gaps. This includes creating new capabilities in nations without them and incorporating a unit within NATO for constabulary functions. Constabulary police perform tasks requiring less force than combat but more than routine law enforcement activities. The State Department's proposal suggests training foreign police personnel and increasing international constabulary capabilities. Constabulary police perform tasks requiring less force than combat but more than routine law enforcement activities, essential for hostile situations in post-conflict areas. Constabulary forces are trained in military and policing skills, essential for hostile situations in post-conflict areas. They deploy rapidly as formed units and are equipped with communication and logistical support. Analysts suggest specialized paramilitary units for constabulary tasks in peacekeeping operations. Several countries already have national police or paramilitary units trained as constabulary forces. Several countries have specialized paramilitary police units trained for constabulary tasks in peacekeeping operations, such as the Italian carabinieri, French gendarmerie, and Spanish Guardia Civil. These resources can be strained by high deployment rates in numerous U.N. peacekeeping operations. Some argue for the U.S. army to develop its own active duty constabulary force to augment military police in peacekeeping operations. Army analysts and policymakers have noted shortages in constabulary capabilities, especially when deployment rates are high. The U.S. Army is considering developing an active duty constabulary force to address shortages in peacekeeping operations. Army leaders have been hesitant to prioritize peacekeeping over warfighting missions, but analysts question the effectiveness of military forces that do not establish conditions for lasting peace. Army forces are seen as most valuable when adaptable and capable of handling security tasks in various conflict intensities. The U.S. Army is considering creating a constabulary force for peacekeeping operations to reduce reliance on combat soldiers. Analysts question the effectiveness of military forces that do not establish conditions for lasting peace. Army forces are valued for their adaptability in handling security tasks in different conflict intensities. Analysts are uncertain if other countries would be willing to enhance their constabulary capabilities for peacekeeping operations. Some suggest developing rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel for sustainable security. The development of rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel is essential to address the institution gap in peace operations for \"sustainable security.\" The current system lacks the full range of necessary personnel in a timely manner, despite efforts to deploy personnel with experience in justice and corrections systems. Robert S. Perito, a special advisor at USIP, advocates for integrating military and civilian personnel to form a \"U.S. force for stability\" in post-conflict interventions. This proposal aims to address security gaps and break the cycle of impunity caused by a lack of law enforcement authority. Perito's proposal introduces a new approach to post-conflict intervention by creating a U.S. stability force consisting of military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals. This force would deploy concurrently to provide immediate security and bridge deployment gaps. Civilian personnel would take over law enforcement functions once security conditions allow. Perito's proposal suggests a U.S. stability force with military, civilian constabulary units, police, and rule of law professionals. The military shifts to perimeter security after combat, while constabulary units handle internal security. Civilian police and justice experts then work to maintain public safety and restore the rule of law, with a transition from military to civilian personnel over time. Perito proposes a U.S. stability force with military, civilian constabulary units, police, and rule of law professionals. The military transitions to perimeter security post-combat, while constabulary units manage internal security. Civilian police and justice experts focus on restoring public safety and the rule of law, with a gradual shift from military to civilian personnel. Recommendations from recent reports include deploying civilian personnel alongside combat forces for nation-building tasks and creating a standing interagency team for stabilization and reconstruction efforts. The report suggests creating a standing interagency stabilization and reconstruction team within the government and an \"on-call\" civilian crisis management corps. Another recommendation is to establish an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State, responsible for preparing and managing a Civilian Stability Operations Corps and Reserve. The proposal suggests the creation of a Civilian Stability Operations Corps of 200-300 U.S. government civilians and a Reserve of non-government civilians for rapid deployment. This \"stability force\" model aims to enhance security and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries, allowing for earlier military withdrawal. However, implementing this force would require significant changes in current U.S. practices, including developing constabulary capabilities. Perito proposes the creation of a Civilian Stability Operations Corps with constabulary capabilities, including an increased number of military police. The force would consist of federal agency-recruited personnel, potentially controversial due to restructuring military forces and debates on government-employment versus contracting for CivPol deployments. Perito proposes a Civilian Stability Operations Corps with constabulary capabilities, potentially controversial due to debates on government-employment versus contracting for CivPol deployments. The model may offer advantages in establishing security rapidly in crisis countries, depending on recruitment and deployment methods. The availability of law enforcement and rule of law personnel for rapid deployment may depend on recruitment arrangements, similar to the U.S. military reserve component. Benefits such as pensions and salaries for training may be necessary for immediate deployment when called upon. Sources: U.N. Peacekeeping Fact Sheets and EU Police fact sheet.

The use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping operations dates back to 1960 with the U.N. Operation in the Congo. European nations sent police units to advise and train local police forces in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The first police monitors were deployed in 1882 to guard the Suez Canal and in 1935 to the Saarland under the League of Nations. The use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping operations began in 1960 with the U.N. Operation in the Congo. In subsequent years, U.N. civilian police were deployed to assist in maintaining order in various regions, such as West New Guinea and Cyprus. The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) was the first operation to use UNCIVPOL, a multilateral U.N. police force, to assist local police in maintaining order and security. Post-cold war operations focused on monitoring local police performance in areas with well-trained police forces, such as Namibia and Western Sahara. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia and the Western Sahara utilized UNCIVPOL to monitor electoral processes and assist local police. UNTAG set the model for future missions by accompanying local police, investigating complaints, and supervising police investigations. In the early 1990s, UNTAG set tasks for monitoring missions, including accompanying local police, investigating complaints, and supervising police investigations. MINURSO in Southwest Sahara aimed to hold a referendum on the territory's future status, but it has been delayed due to opposition from Morocco. Other monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia faced challenges with less established institutions and fragile peace agreements. Additional functions were occasionally deemed necessary in the field. In the 1990s, monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia faced challenges in difficult situations with fragile peace agreements. Additional functions were occasionally deemed necessary in the field, such as police monitors deployed in the U.N. Protection Force peacekeeping operation to new states created by the break-up of Yugoslavia. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) was one of the largest and most ambitious U.N. peacekeeping operations with a strictly monitoring mandate. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) was a large and ambitious peacekeeping operation with a monitoring mandate. The focus of the UNTAC police unit shifted to investigating complaints of political liberties and human rights violations. The U.N. Secretary-General's representative granted arrest powers to CivPols in January 1993, but these actions were considered too late to make the operation effective. The U.N. Secretary-General's representative granted arrest powers to CivPols in January 1993, but this came too late to make the U.N. operation in Cambodia effective. Deployment delays hindered the operation's performance, leading to adjustments in the UNTAC police mission to focus on monitoring elections. The UNTAC police mission initially adjusted its efforts from law enforcement to monitoring elections due to deployment delays. Limited training was provided for Cambodian police and judiciary, with some civil police conducting makeshift training. An \"institution gap\" was identified as UNTAC police lacked resources to promote justice effectively. Analysts identified an \"institution gap\" in the UNTAC operation due to the lack of an independent judicial system, hindering justice. To address this, integrated \"justice packages\" were proposed, including justice, penal officials, and police officers. Police reform became crucial, highlighted by the UN Observer Mission in El Salvador's efforts to place security forces under civilian control with extensive international support. The United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) played a significant role in placing internal security forces under civilian control with extensive international support. This was established through peace accords in January 1992, ending the country's civil war and leading to the creation of a new National Civilian Police force. ONUSAL began operations in July 1991 and provided UNCIVPOLs starting in March 1992. The ONUSAL mission in El Salvador oversaw the transition to a new National Civilian Police force, including the creation of a new police academy and training of recruits. The UNDP managed this process while ONUSAL focused on verification and field work. The ONUSAL mission in El Salvador oversaw the formation of a new police academy and police force, with international contributions from Spain, Norway, Sweden, the United States, and Chile. Despite encountering significant problems, the establishment of the new police force was considered a success in the country's reconciliation and democratization processes. The success of the ONUSAL mission in El Salvador convinced contributing governments of the importance of civilian police deployment in peacekeeping operations. Subsequent missions, like ONUMOZ in Mozambique, also included training and reform mandates for civilian police forces. ONUMOZ's civilian police mission in Mozambique included monitoring and a small training assistance component. The mission focused on providing technical support to the Mozambican police and was a precursor to later training and police reform missions. International support for police reform continued after the formal UN operations, primarily through bilateral training programs, notably by the Spanish Guardia Civil. Training was also a key part of the mandate of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda. In Somalia and Haiti, international forces made significant efforts in training and reforming the local police forces. In Somalia, the U.S.-led United Task Force (UNITAF) initiated training and reform efforts to restore order after the collapse of Siad Barre's dictatorship. Despite lacking a specific mandate, UNITAF established an interim Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) as part of its humanitarian assistance mission. The interim Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) in Somalia was established by UNITAF to enforce locally agreed upon laws and be controlled by the community. It aimed to eliminate the need for UNITAF troops to serve as police, reduce confusion about their role, minimize casualties, deal with ordinary criminal activity, create jobs, and provide income to Somalis. The ASF in Somalia, supported by UNITAF, the United Nations, and individual nations, aimed to establish a local police force to handle criminal activity, create jobs, and provide income to Somalis. The UNDP provided assistance with salaries, equipment, and experts from Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany. The UNDP, Italian, Dutch, and German experts, UNITAF, and other nations provided assistance to the ASF in Somalia, including salaries, equipment, training, and food rations. UNITAF military forces from Morocco, Botswana, and the UAE also contributed to the training and operations of the ASF. In May 1993, UNOSOM II replaced UNITAF in Somalia, with ASF members operating in Mogadishu and 17 other cities. Despite plans to rebuild the Somali police force, challenges arose from militant factions and lack of resources, delaying progress. After UNITAF departed, it took nearly a year for UNCIVPOL members to arrive and another two months to reach full strength. Training and cultural differences hindered program development. UNOSOM II military forces collaborated with ICITAP to train Somali police officers, but programs collapsed due to escalating violence and insecurity. ICITAP withdrew in June 1994, and UNCIVPOLs left in March 1995 with the forced U.N. withdrawal. UNITAF ASF achieved some success in providing police forces protection and legitimacy. The need for police institution development and reform was recognized by the end of the 1990s, with a recommendation for a doctrinal shift in the use of civilian personnel in peace operations in the August 2000 Brahimi Panel Report. The primary role of CivPol personnel should be to build local police services capacity. The primary role of CivPol personnel in peace operations is to build local police services capacity. In Somalia and Haiti, the lack of commitment to support CivPol led to the development of an \"enforcement gap,\" where military force was needed to maintain law and order in post-conflict situations. In post-conflict situations, military force may be necessary to maintain law and order when violence is high. International civilian police forces face challenges in areas without effective cease-fires and lack of political settlements. The lack of adequate courts and prison systems can undermine police reform efforts in the long run. Similar gaps were seen in Haiti despite intensive U.S. and U.N. police reform efforts. In Haiti, U.S. and U.N. police reform efforts faced challenges due to institutional gaps. The International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) was formed to train a new Haitian national police force, vet former members of the armed forces, and supervise public security. The lack of political settlement and inadequate courts and prison systems could undermine successful police reform efforts in the long term. The IPM supervised the selection and training of Haiti's interim public security force, with UNMIH taking over monitoring and training functions. Multiple UN follow-on missions continued to professionalize the Haitian police, coordinating with the military to establish public security. The US adjusted rules of engagement when IPMs were slow to deploy effectively. The US adjusted rules of engagement to allow military forces to detain and shoot criminals in Haiti. MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training to IPMs on basic policing tasks. Unlike Somalia, there was a smooth transition from the US-led MNF to the UN operation in Haiti. In Haiti, training was provided to IPMs at police stations on basic tasks like patrolling and using force. The transition from the U.S.-led MNF to the UN operation was smooth, with UNMIH military forces bridging the law enforcement gap. UNMIH supported UNCIVPOL with rapid backup, MPs for liaison, and military patrols to deter crime and violence. HNP deployment led to UNCIVPOLs shifting to a mentoring role, while UNMIH monitored HNP performance. Despite operational adjustments, institutional gaps like overcrowded prisons and a corrupt judicial system remained. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002, focusing on monitoring and training under the December 1995 Dayton Accords. The institutional gap in Haiti, including overcrowded prisons and a corrupt judicial system, hindered public security establishment despite operational adjustments. The United Nations was assigned the role of overseeing a joint government in Bosnia under the December 1995 Dayton Accords. This was carried out through the International Police Task Force (IPTF) to monitor, advise, train, and assess law enforcement activities in Bosnia. The International Police Task Force (IPTF) was established to train and advise law enforcement personnel in Bosnia. In 2003, the European Union took over this responsibility through the EU Police Mission. The IPTF, consisting of 1,721 unarmed CivPols, struggled to maintain public order among hostile groups in Bosnia. The 1,721 unarmed IPTF CivPols lacked enforcement powers and struggled to maintain public order among hostile groups in Bosnia. Concerns about their effectiveness were raised during the Dayton negotiations, with calls for a stronger mandate and a policing function for NATO's IFOR. IFOR provided assistance to IPTF during the early 1996 transfer of control in Sarajevo. The relocation of residents in early 1996 tested the IPTF and IFOR, with IFOR assisting in planning and organizing the operation. Despite only one death during the relocation, the destruction of many dwellings highlighted an enforcement gap as IPTF lacked authority and resources. This led to a flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs, seen as a failure of the UN in Bosnia. The IPTF and IFOR faced challenges in early 1996 during the relocation of residents, highlighting an enforcement gap due to the lack of authority and resources. This led to a flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs, seen as a failure of the UN in Bosnia. SFOR replaced IFOR in late 1996, providing backup support to the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF. Specialized units within the IPTF, referring to paramilitary forces, were developed to address the enforcement gap in Bosnia. The development of \"specialized units\" within the IPTF, which included paramilitary forces from foreign nations like France, Italy, and Spain, helped fill the enforcement gap in Bosnia in the late 1990s. These units were recognized for bridging the gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors. The late 1990s saw the recognition of the need for specialized police units like the Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) in Bosnia to bridge the gap between military and unarmed police capabilities. This successful model led to the formation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor. Additionally, in 1999, expanded mandates and powers were granted to international civilian police in peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and East Timor. In 1999, international civilian police in Kosovo and East Timor were given executive authority powers due to the absence of local authority. NATO and the UN took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo, with NATO providing military presence through KFOR and the UN overseeing civil administration functions through UNMIK. In Kosovo and East Timor, NATO and the UN provided military and civil administration support to stabilize the regions and fill the security vacuum left by local authorities. NATO deployed KFOR in Kosovo, while the UN oversaw civil administration through UNMIK. In East Timor, UNTAET managed civil administration during its transition to independence from Indonesia. In East Timor, a security vacuum existed after Indonesia's withdrawal, requiring U.N. and Australian-led forces to exercise executive authority. Despite challenges, the use of executive authority in such situations is seen as problematic and unlikely to be a wise choice in the future due to limited international civilian police personnel. The limited availability of international civilian police personnel makes it challenging to effectively exercise executive policing authority in areas where local police forces are inadequate. Sovereignty considerations also play a significant role in decision-making regarding the use of executive policing."
