The Government Code prohibits cities or counties from imposing new conditions for building permits after final map approval for a residential subdivision. However, they are not prohibited from taking certain actions. The Government Code prohibits cities or counties from imposing new conditions for building permits after final map approval for a residential subdivision. However, they are allowed to impose conditions for building permits if necessary for health and safety reasons, to comply with state or federal law, or to ensure compliance with zoning ordinances. The Government Code prohibits cities or counties from imposing new conditions for building permits after final map approval for a residential subdivision. However, they can impose conditions for building permits if necessary for health and safety reasons, to comply with state or federal law, or to ensure compliance with zoning ordinances. This also applies to cities or city and counties incorporating after January 1, 1985, within boundaries of a tentative or parcel map, where conditions could have been imposed by the county if there was no incorporation. The Government Code allows for a three-year extension of tentative subdivision maps or parcel maps under certain sections. Cities, counties, or city and counties can still impose fees or conditions related to building permits, including fees not included in zoning ordinances. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of tentative maps or parcel maps approved in certain counties between January 1, 2002, and July 11, 2013. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of approved tentative maps or parcel maps in specific counties if the map is consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. The legislative body or advisory agency may deny or conditionally approve an extension for a period of 24 months if the map is not consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. An approved tentative map can be automatically extended for 60 days or until the extension application is approved, conditionally approved, or denied. If an extension is denied by the advisory agency, the subdivider can appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, the conditions for this section to apply are: annual mean household income is less than 80% of the statewide income, and the annual nonseasonal unemployment rate is at least 2.75% higher than the statewide rate. The population for whom poverty status is determined must be at least 4 percent higher than the statewide median poverty rate, based on the American Community Survey. Any approval by a state agency related to a development project on an extended map shall be extended by 24 months. The provisions of Section 65961 regarding conditions for building permits for residential subdivisions are modified for extended tentative maps. No reimbursement is required for this act, as local agencies can cover costs. This act is urgent for public safety and will take immediate effect. This act is urgent for public safety and will take immediate effect to allow cities, counties, and cities and counties to preserve development applications set to expire due to adverse economic conditions in the construction industry."
