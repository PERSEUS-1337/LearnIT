    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. Other trade negotiations that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years. The President has been granted TPA/fast track authority by Congress for over 40 years. TPA allows Congress to consider trade agreement implementing legislation quickly and vote on it without amendment, as long as certain negotiating objectives and consultation requirements are met. This gives the President additional negotiating leverage and assures U.S. trade partners that the agreement will be given timely consideration. Trade negotiations have become more complex over time, leading to tighter oversight and consultation requirements from Congress. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has evolved over time with bipartisan support but has become more controversial and partisan. The expiration of TPA raises questions about its renewal and form. TPA is the result of decades of cooperation and compromise between Congress and the executive branch, based on constitutional powers and the need for flexibility in trade negotiations. The partnership between Congress and the President in trade policymaking can be strengthened. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has evolved with bipartisan support but has become more controversial and partisan. The partnership between Congress and the President in trade policymaking can be strengthened as they adjust to evolving political and economic conditions. Congress has authority over the regulation of foreign trade, while the President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements. The President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements, while Congress historically set tariff rates on imported products for the first 150 years of the United States. Trade policy was mainly determined by tariffs, with debates between protectionist tariffs for northern manufacturing regions and low tariffs for southern commodity exporting regions. The President's role in trade policy was primarily through foreign affairs negotiations. In the 1930s, U.S. trade policy underwent significant changes with the enactment of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which imposed high tariff rates in response to the Great Depression. This led to retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, severely restricting trade. The President's role in trade policy involved negotiating bilateral treaties that included most-favored-nation treatment, ensuring nondiscrimination in tariff application for all treaty partners. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 imposed high tariff rates during the Great Depression, leading to retaliatory tariffs and trade restrictions. In response, the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal trade agreements, allowing for tariff adjustments without additional legislation. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 allowed the President to implement tariff reductions through reciprocal trade agreements, delegating trade authority to reduce tariffs within predefined ranges. This aimed to lessen political pressure from special interests faced by Congress. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, the last general tariff legislation, is now only applied to imports from countries without MFN status. Congress retained broader trade authority while delegating tariff-cutting power to the President. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 allowed the President to implement tariff reductions through reciprocal trade agreements, delegating trade authority to reduce tariffs within predefined ranges. Tariffs are now only applied to imports from Cuba and North Korea, not receiving MFN status, referred to as normal trade relations status (NTR) in U.S. trade laws. Congress insured against executive branch overreach by subjecting trade agreements authority to periodic review and renewal. General tariff levels declined with the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, shifting trade negotiations from bilateral to multilateral negotiations. Trade negotiations were eventually expanded beyond tariffs. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and enter into agreements, shifting trade negotiations to a multilateral approach. Congress played a role in the process by requiring the President to submit agreements for review. This act allowed the conclusion of the GATT Kennedy Round, focusing on tariff reduction. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and enter into agreements, shifting trade negotiations to a multilateral approach. The GATT Kennedy Round focused on tariff reduction and also addressed nontariff barriers. Congress raised concerns about the President exceeding his authority due to required changes in U.S. laws beyond tariff modifications. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and enter into agreements, shifting trade negotiations to a multilateral approach. Concerns arose in Congress over changes in U.S. laws beyond tariff modifications due to nontariff barrier rules, leading to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and enter into agreements. Concerns over changes in U.S. laws beyond tariff modifications led to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 established fast track authority for trade agreements, requiring Congress to pass implementing legislation for nontariff barrier agreements. Some argued that subjecting implementing legislation to ordinary congressional debate would defeat the purpose of delegating trade agreements authority to the President. The Trade Act of 1974 established fast track authority for trade agreements, requiring Congress to pass implementing legislation for nontariff barrier agreements. U.S. trading partners wanted assurances that negotiated agreements would be subject to an up-or-down vote by Congress within a definite time-frame to ensure successful negotiations. Congress agreed to expedited treatment for trade agreements, suspending ordinary legislative procedures for implementing bills. The Trade Act of 1974 established fast track authority for trade agreements, requiring Congress to pass implementing legislation within a specific time-frame. Congress agreed to expedited treatment for trade agreements, suspending ordinary legislative procedures for implementing bills. This included limited time for relevant committees to consider bills, time-limited debate on the floor with no amendments allowed, and the requirement for the executive branch to consult with Congress and notify them 90 days before signing an agreement. Additionally, the act allowed for the accreditation of 10 Members of Congress as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators, expanding on the provisions of the Trade Act of 1962. This fast track trade negotiating authority was utilized during the Tokyo Round of the GATT (1973-1979). The Trade Act of 1974 established fast track authority for trade agreements, leading to the conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT. The resulting Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first implementing bill passed under this authority, with expedited legislative procedures that have remained unchanged since 1974. These provisions, found in Sections 151-154 of the Trade Act of 1974, are not subject to sunset provisions but are subject to time limits. The expedited legislative procedures established in the Trade Act of 1974 have remained unchanged since 1974 and are found in Sections 151-154. These provisions are not subject to sunset provisions but are subject to time limits. The initial grant of \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" and the authority to enact tariff modifications by proclamation were in effect until January 2, 1980, with a residual presidential authority extended to January 2, 1982. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988, without extending tariff modification authority. It added trade agreements authority for negotiating bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The legislation waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress for negotiations with other countries. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988, without extending tariff modification authority. It added trade agreements authority for negotiating bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The legislation waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress for negotiations with other countries. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, and expedited procedures for agreements entered into before June 1, 1991. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, and expedited procedures for agreements entered into before June 1, 1991. Congress could withhold a trade agreement from fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval if the USTR had failed to consult adequately. The OTCA provisions expanded trade negotiation objectives and implemented NAFTA in 1993. Congress extended authority for Uruguay Round negotiations with H.R. 1876 in 1993. The law was passed with strong congressional support and did not change fast track authority. After the Trade Act of 1994 expired, Congress did not approve new fast track authority until 2002. In 1997 and 1998, attempts to renew fast track authority failed due to lack of support. Congress's decision not to enact new trade agreements authority for the Clinton Administration may have been influenced by various reasons. In September 1998, the House failed to pass fast track authority legislation (180-243), as Congress could not agree on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. The lack of a new round of negotiations at the 1999 WTO Ministerial meeting also contributed to the decision not to renew trade agreements authority for the Clinton Administration. In 2001, President George W. Bush requested renewal of fast track authority, renamed as \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. TPA included new language for labor and environmental provisions as \"principal negotiating objectives,\" but did not mandate enforceable labor standards in trade agreements. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 included new language for labor and environmental provisions as \"principal negotiating objectives.\" It did not mandate enforceable labor standards in trade agreements, leading to opposition from labor groups and some Members of Congress. The act also established the Congressional Oversight Group for congressional consultation. The House version of the bill passed by a narrow margin, mostly along party lines. The Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002, passed by a narrow margin, combined legislation in the Senate with Trade Adjustment Assistance, Andean Trade Preference Act, and Generalized System of Preferences. The final bill, H.R. 3009, was adopted by both the House and Senate. The 2002 version of TPA approved implementing legislation for Free Trade Agreement countries. The proposed BCTPA was introduced in 2015 by Senators Hatch and Wyden and Representative Ryan. The BCTPA legislation, introduced in 2015 by Senators Hatch and Wyden and Representative Ryan, was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. It passed on May 22 by a vote of 62-37, containing updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, and agriculture. TPA-2015, an amendment to H.R. 1314, passed on May 22 by a vote of 62-37. It includes updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. The legislation also addresses currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. If enacted, TPA-2015 will expire on July 1, 2021. TPA-2015 allows for consideration of agreements from various trade negotiations, including TPP, T-TIP, TISA, EGA, and Doha Round. Congress has used TPA/fast track to pursue major trade objectives. Through TPA/fast track, Congress aims to define trade policy priorities, ensure adherence to objectives, establish terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm its constitutional authority over trade. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to define trade policy priorities, establish terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's constitutional authority over trade. This authority allows for fast track negotiation and implementation of trade agreements, especially when dealing with nontariff barriers. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows for fast track negotiation and implementation of trade agreements, including nontariff barriers (NTBs). Congress tightened control over trade agreements negotiation by establishing \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" through the Trade Act of 1974. This authority includes expedited procedures for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress, which are available for qualifying trade implementing bills under the Trade Act of 2002. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows for fast track negotiation and implementation of trade agreements. Congress provides expedited procedures for qualifying trade implementing bills, which must meet specific conditions. The implementing bill must approve the agreement, contain necessary law changes, and allow Congress to modify the rules at any time. Congress has granted the President authority to implement trade agreements through the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), with expedited procedures for approval. The President can proclaim an agreement into force after ensuring the partner country has complied with its provisions. This authority is outlined in Section 2105 of the Trade Act of 2002, requiring notification to Congress 90 days before signing the agreement. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President the power to implement trade agreements with expedited approval procedures. The President must notify Congress 90 days before signing the agreement, provide a list of required changes to U.S. law within 60 days of signing, and transmit the final legal text of the agreement after it is signed. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President the power to implement trade agreements with expedited approval procedures. On a day when both houses of Congress are in session, the President transmits the final legal text of the trade agreement, a draft implementing bill, a statement of administrative action, and supporting statements on how the agreement meets congressional priorities. If Congress is satisfied, expedited legislative procedures are followed, requiring prompt action on the implementing bill. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants the President the power to implement trade agreements with expedited approval procedures. These rules require prompt action on the bill by Congress, including mandatory introduction in both houses, limited debate, and a simple majority vote. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation to emphasize the importance of trade in U.S. foreign policy. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation to emphasize the importance of trade in U.S. foreign policy. These objectives are definitive statements of U.S. trade policy that the Administration is expected to honor for expedited consideration of trade agreement implementing legislation. Trade negotiating objectives are crucial in U.S. trade policy and must be honored for expedited consideration of trade agreement implementing legislation. Congress establishes objectives in three categories: overall, principal, and other priorities, focusing on goals like enhancing economies, reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and promoting fair regulatory practices. Trade negotiating objectives are essential in U.S. trade policy, focusing on reducing barriers to trade, protecting intellectual property rights, promoting fair regulatory practices, combating corruption, and enforcing environmental and labor laws. The language defining these objectives can be contentious, as seen in past controversies over Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal. These objectives serve as a template for future trade agreements negotiated under these guidelines. The controversy over Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) negotiating objectives reflects the importance of these objectives as a template for future trade agreements. The labor provisions, a key focus in negotiating objectives, have led to contentious debates in Congress, particularly seen in the 2005 debate on the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). The structure of trade agreements mirrors TPA objectives, leading to disputes over language and standards. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) negotiating objectives are crucial for future trade agreements, as seen in the 2005 debate on the CAFTA-DR. The TPA authority is extended to the President with consultation requirements, including with Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG) in both chambers. Notification and consultation processes have been revised with each renewal of authority. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) includes consultation requirements with Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG) in both chambers. The President must conduct specific notifications and consultations before and after trade agreements are entered into. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) requires the President to conduct consultations with Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG) and notify Congress before entering into trade agreements. This includes notifying Congress 90 days prior to the agreement, consulting with relevant committees, and submitting reports to Congress, the President, and the USTR within 30 days. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) mandates consultations with Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG) and notifying Congress before entering trade agreements. This involves notifying Congress 90 days before the agreement, consulting with relevant committees, submitting reports within 30 days, and following specific timelines for releasing agreement details and impact reports. The congressional consultation process is crucial for ensuring legislative oversight of trade policy. The congressional consultation process under TPA is a long-standing precedent ensuring legislative oversight of trade policy. The effectiveness of this process has been questioned, with the GAO finding that despite extensive consultations by USTR, congressional staff often felt they did not have sufficient time for input. Many congressional staff felt that the consultation process for trade agreements did not allow for sufficient input or time for feedback, leading to concerns about the need for greater congressional involvement in drafting FTAs. This issue has also been raised in relation to TPP and other trade negotiations. Congress implemented TPA procedures to prevent delays in trade bills due to lack of input from Congress. Congress adopted Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures to prevent delays in trade bills and protect fragile consensus between trade partners. TPA limits congressional amendments to trade agreements while preserving Congress's constitutional authority over trade matters. Each renewal of TPA provides expedited procedures for trade agreement implementing bills. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) limits congressional amendments to trade agreements while preserving Congress's constitutional authority over trade matters. Each renewal of TPA provides expedited procedures for trade agreement implementing bills, with deadlines for agreements entered into before specific dates. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) sets deadlines for submitting implementing legislation for FTAs entered into before specific dates. The President must request an extension of TPA authority, which is granted unless a disapproval resolution is adopted by either House of Congress. This process reminds the executive branch of the availability of expedited procedures for trade agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) sets deadlines for submitting implementing legislation for FTAs entered into before specific dates. Resolutions have been reported out of committee but not passed in Congress, serving as a reminder to the executive branch about expedited legislative procedures. Congress can deny these procedures if dissatisfied with the President's trade agreement negotiations. Fulfilling consultation and reporting obligations helps preserve Congress's role in trade agreements. If the President fails to meet these requirements, Congress may deem the implementing bill ineligible under TPA rules and adopt a joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution. Should Congress determine that the President has failed to meet requirements, it may decide that the implementing bill is not eligible under TPA rules. A joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution would be adopted in both houses of Congress. The CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for an implementing bill for failure to notify or consult with Congress on a trade agreement. Trade Act of 1974 provides expedited procedures for trade bills as rules of procedures for each house, with recognition of the constitutional right to change the rules at any time. The Trade Act of 1974 provides expedited procedures for trade bills as rules of procedures for each house, with the recognition of the constitutional right to change the rules at any time. The success of TPA relies on cooperation between the legislative and executive branches, as well as between political parties. Bipartisan agreement on TPA has been lacking since 1993. Since 1993, bipartisan agreement on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has been absent, leading to a strain on the trade legislative process. Congress has integrated certain procedures, such as reviewing trade agreements before introducing implementing bills, into the process of approving trade agreements. Congress has integrated procedures for reviewing trade agreements before introducing implementing bills into the process of approving trade agreements. This includes hearings before the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees, informal markup sessions, and mock conferences to test congressional response. The congressional response to the trade agreement implementing bill involves informal draft discussions, committee members raising concerns, offering amendments, and reconciling differences in markups. Changes may be made in the final bill, but the Administration has discretion in accepting suggestions from Congress. The Administration has discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress in trade agreement implementing bills. Despite attempts to accommodate changes, the Bush Administration declined to include certain language in the U.S.-Oman FTA implementing legislation. This led to a bipartisan call for better consultation prior to the President entering into a trade agreement. Congress has at times encouraged or insisted on additions outside of formal statutory requirements. A bipartisan call for better consultation prior to the President entering into a trade agreement arose due to dissatisfaction with the Oman FTA and the TPA process. Congress has encouraged or insisted on additions to trade agreements, resulting in side agreements or side letters. Side agreements involve additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement is signed, while side letters act as clarifying devices for specific issues in bilateral FTAs. Side letters are used as clarifying devices in bilateral FTAs to address specific issues and alleviate congressional concerns. They are typically exchanged between top trade negotiating representatives and do not alter the agreement's text. While side agreements and letters require official signatures from all parties to be considered in force, their enforceability remains untested. Informal commitments from the executive branch have been relied upon by some Members of Congress to address special interests and concerns raised during mock markups. For example, accommodations were made by the Bush Administration in the CAFTA-DR implementing bill regarding sugar. The Bush Administration made accommodations to sugar, textile, and labor interests in the CAFTA-DR implementing bill to secure congressional support. TPA expired on July 1, 2007, and there have been criticisms of President Obama for delaying a request for its renewal. President Obama requested TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. Congressional desire to update the 2002 law may also influence legislative action on TPA. President Obama requested TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. The decision to initiate legislative action on TPA may be influenced by Congress's desire to revamp parts of the 2002 law. Some broader policy issues and technical changes may be contemplated. While TPA can help build consensus on trade policy, it involves more than just expedited legislative procedures. TPA, or Trade Promotion Authority, goes beyond expedited legislative procedures. It helps build consensus on trade policy, signals congressional support for FTAs, and ensures Congress's role in trade policy by defining negotiating objectives and requiring consultation. The timing of TPA renewal is debated, with some suggesting waiting until negotiations are near completion and others advocating for early action to allow Congress input before negotiations end. The scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives has expanded with the changing structure of trade, leading to the inclusion of new topics in TPA-2015. Current TPP negotiations focus on issues not previously addressed, reflecting the complexity of modern trade agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has evolved to address new topics in trade agreements, such as state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, and the impact on small businesses. These issues were not previously considered in TPA renewals, leading to controversy and partisan debates in Congress. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has been a controversial topic for renewal, with Democrats dissatisfied with the outcome in 2002. The \"May 10th Agreement\" in 2007 incorporated changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. These changes have been accepted as a baseline for future trade agreements by many Republicans and Democrats. Congress may consider including these commitments in future agreements. Some House Democrats proposed key elements during the 2002 renewal debate, which have been accepted as a baseline for future trade agreements by many Republicans and Democrats. There are differing opinions on whether the May 10th Understanding commitments should be included in formal trade negotiating objectives in TPA. TPA-2015 includes provisions on labor and environmental issues from the May 10th Understanding, but it is unclear how it addresses intellectual property rights. Some Members of Congress are dissatisfied with the executive branch's execution of trade negotiation consultation. Some Members of Congress are dissatisfied with the executive branch's execution of trade negotiation consultation, particularly regarding access to draft texts of agreements. There are ongoing concerns about ensuring Congress can influence FTAs early in the negotiation process. Congress may seek to clarify negotiation and consultation procedures in the future. Some Members of Congress are concerned about access to draft texts of trade agreements and want to influence the negotiation process. There is bipartisan interest in enforcing trade commitments, with separate legislative efforts and the creation of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center by President Obama. Congress may consider language on trade agreement enforcement. President Obama has created the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center to address trade enforcement issues. Congress may also need to consider language on trade agreement enforcement in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress raised technical issues that Congress may need to reevaluate, including the importance of strict interpretation of using TPA only for necessary or appropriate provisions in implementing bills. TPA-2015 requires provisions in implementing legislation to be \"strictly necessary or appropriate.\" Some Members want to define this language more precisely, while others argue for flexibility. Delays in introducing FTA implementing bills have been due to leveraging FTAs for policy changes outside their scope. This raises the question of whether Congress should consider a time limit for bill introduction. The delay in introducing FTAs was partly due to congressional leveraging for policy changes beyond the FTA scope. There are concerns about text changes in the U.S.-South Korea FTA after negotiations, which may have violated TPA. The power of TPA lies in the political agreement between Congress and the President, rather than its statutory guarantees. Congress may need to address these issues in TPA renewal. The real power of fast track (TPA) lies in the political agreement between Congress and the President, rather than its statutory guarantees. Congress seeks bipartisan consensus on trade policy, with TPA being a key element. Congress has options for renewing TPA, including renewing and revising TPA authority. Congress has options for renewing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), including renewing and revising TPA authority, extending a targeted TPA for specific agreements like the TPP, and granting permanent TPA authority with a two-tier procedure. One expert suggested Congress could enact permanent fast track procedures and require approval from both houses before negotiations. The lack of TPA could delay trade agreements, but policy can still progress with TIFAs, AGOA, and trade enforcement measures. Some Members oppose TPA due to expedited procedures relinquishing congressional authority. Legislation to renew TPA was introduced in the 114th Congress. In the 114th Congress, legislation was signed to renew TPA, reauthorizing it for four years with a possible three-year extension. The legislation includes changes like increased consultation requirements with Congress and private sector advisers. It also outlines trade negotiating objectives and topics, building on previous TPA statutes. The two bills renewed TPA with new trade negotiating objectives, including digital trade, state-owned enterprises, localization barriers, currency, and human rights. These objectives build on previous TPA statutes and cover a wide range of trade policy issues. The bills renewed TPA with new trade negotiating objectives, including digital trade, state-owned enterprises, localization barriers, currency, and human rights. Congressional committees hold \"mock markups\" on informal drafts of implementing legislation before formal TPA expedited procedures. The House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees hold \"mock markups\" on informal drafts of implementing legislation before sending final legislation to Congress. The vote and any amendments made during these meetings are not binding on the Administration. The President then sends a final legal draft of the trade agreement and a draft implementing bill to Congress, which initiates expedited procedures. Identical bills are introduced in each house of Congress and referred to the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees jointly. The draft bill may reflect some amendments from mock markups. Identical bills are introduced in both houses of Congress and referred to relevant committees. Committees have 45 days to report the bill or it is automatically discharged. The Senate Finance Committee has a deadline to act on the House bill. After the bill is reported or discharged, any Member can motion to consider it. After being introduced in both houses of Congress, committees have 45 days to report the bill or it is automatically discharged. Any Member can motion to consider the bill after it is reported or discharged. Debate is limited to 20 hours, and the bill passes by a simple majority. The second house typically debates its own bill but takes a final vote on the bill received from the other house to ensure both houses act on the same measure. After being introduced in both houses of Congress, committees have 45 days to report the bill or it is automatically discharged. Any Member can motion to consider the bill after it is reported or discharged. Debate is limited to 20 hours, and the bill passes by a simple majority. The second house typically debates its own bill but takes a final vote on the bill received from the other house to ensure both houses act on the same measure. The implementing bill is signed by the President, and after the USTR confirms partner countries' compliance, the agreement enters into force upon proclamation."
