    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Financial Literacy for Homeowners Act\". The Congress acknowledges the impact of expanded access to credit on homeownership rates, but expresses concern about predatory lending practices that make homeownership more costly for vulnerable families. Borrowers with fair credit can access loans in the prime market, while those with poor credit turn to the subprime market with higher rates and fees. Predatory lending in the subprime mortgage market involves high interest rates, excessive fees, and unfair terms, particularly affecting minority neighborhoods and communities with limited access to traditional lenders. Predatory lending in minority neighborhoods strips away wealth accumulated over decades, victimizing communities with limited access to traditional lenders. High interest rate home equity loans with hidden fees lead to foreclosure for cash-poor homeowners. A joint report by HUD and Treasury aims to curb predatory home mortgage lending. The joint report by HUD and Treasury in 2000 urged Congress to adopt legislation to restrict abusive terms on high-cost loans, improve consumer literacy, and prohibit predatory lending practices. The joint report in 2000 proposed a four-point plan to address predatory lending practices, including improving consumer literacy, requiring lenders to recommend home mortgage counseling, disclosing credit scores to borrowers, and providing timely and accurate loan information. Government agencies are involved in reducing high-pressure telemarketing sales tactics and misleading borrowers about loan terms.
