The Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat to national security, especially in unstable regions. The United Nations has recognized the threat of weapons of mass destruction and has taken steps to prevent proliferation. The United Nations Special Commission on Iraq was established to prevent nuclear proliferation. Aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, other nations are pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Regional nuclear arms races increase the risk of nuclear weapons use. Concerns about Russia's ability to secure its nuclear materials raise the threat of proliferation. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program aided by dual-use exports. North Korea and the United States exchanged nuclear reactors and reprocessing equipment. In October 1994, North Korea and the United States signed an agreement to exchange nuclear reactors and reprocessing equipment for modern light water reactor technology. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa renounced nuclear weapons and accepted IAEA safeguards for their nuclear facilities. In response to reduced regional tensions, three countries renounced nuclear weapons, accepted IAEA safeguards for their facilities, and joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones to prevent conflicts and arms races. The United States signed nuclear free zone treaties in 1996 to prevent regional conflicts and arms races. The IAEA's safeguard system may be affected by constraints, but the US supports immobilizing plutonium for energy and disposal challenges from dismantled warheads. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty aims to prevent further nuclear proliferation by using enriched uranium as fuel in commercial reactors and addressing challenges of storing and disposing of plutonium from dismantled warheads. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 reinforces the US commitment to the treaty and strengthening international controls over nuclear transfers. The United States is committed to strong support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a more effective IAEA. The goal is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, roll back proliferation, and prevent their use worldwide through comprehensive nonproliferation policies. SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION POLICY. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by placing fissile materials under international controls, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, ending production of new nuclear warheads with Russia, and negotiating to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals. The Federation plans to end the production of new nuclear warheads and negotiate multilateral agreements to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals globally. Nonproliferation Treaty member states aim to halt production of weapons-usable fissile materials, end production by January 1, 2008, place existing stockpiles under controls, and require nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes to be under IAEA safeguards. Strengthening IAEA safeguards and nuclear export controls is also emphasized. To ensure nonproliferation, countries must comply with commitments, support IAEA, strengthen nuclear export controls, impose sanctions on proliferators, reduce regional tensions, and enhance regional security agreements. To reduce incentives for countries to acquire nuclear weapons, efforts should focus on reducing regional tensions, strengthening security agreements, and increasing the role of the UN Security Council in enforcing nonproliferation agreements. Additionally, agreements should be made with nuclear weapon states to adopt a \"no first use\" policy, assist countries under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in case of nuclear weapon use, and establish verifiable bilateral agreements with Russia to dismantle tactical nuclear weapons. The Russian Federation and the United States should ratify nuclear-free zone treaties, monitor North Korea's nuclear activities, and begin negotiations on START III before START II enters into force. The President must report to Congress every year on the actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those of the Russian Federation and other countries. Reports must be unclassified, with a classified appendix if needed. The Act defines key terms such as \"fissile materials,\" \"highly enriched uranium,\" \"IAEA,\" \"IAEA safeguards,\" \"no first use,\" \"non-nuclear weapon state,\" and \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\" The Act defines key terms related to nuclear weapons, including \"non-nuclear weapon state\" and \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\" It also defines terms like \"START I treaty\" and \"START II treaty.\" The START I treaty was signed in 1991 between the US and USSR. The START II treaty was signed in 1993 between the US and Russia. The START III treaty was discussed between President Clinton and President Yeltsin in 1997."
