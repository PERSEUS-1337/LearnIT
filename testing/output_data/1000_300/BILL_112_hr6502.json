    "content": "The Act titled \"Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012\" promotes the development of combinations of investigational new drugs for serious diseases by providing marketing exclusivity and priority review for significant drug combinations. The Act promotes the designation of significant drug combinations that advance treatment for serious diseases by combining 2 or more drugs, including biologics, meeting specific criteria for codevelopment. The Act encourages the designation of drug combinations for codevelopment, involving at least 2 unapproved drugs to advance treatment for serious diseases. The Act encourages the codevelopment of drug combinations, with the Secretary considering task force recommendations and responding to requests from manufacturers or sponsors regarding significant drug combinations. The Secretary will review requests for drug combination designation within 30 days, providing notice if the combination meets requirements. The Secretary will designate a drug combination as significant if it meets requirements, providing notice to the requester. The Secretary will provide notice if a drug combination does not meet significant designation requirements. Requests for designation must be made alongside or after drug application submission, but before completion of phase I trials. The Secretary will develop and publish a list of significant drug combinations under the Life-Threatening Diseases Compassion through Combination Therapy Act of 2012, updating it annually with additional combinations. The Secretary will update the list of significant drug combinations annually, adding new combinations and removing those that no longer meet the criteria. This process extends market exclusivity for drugs awaiting approval. The Secretary updates the list of significant drug combinations annually, extending market exclusivity for drugs awaiting approval. If a drug is designated in a significant combination, the approval period under section 505 is extended by 6 months.

The Secretary shall prioritize the review of applications for drugs in significant drug combinations designated under subsection (a). The Secretary prioritizes the review of drug applications in significant combinations, ensuring timely action within 6 months. The definition of significantly advancing treatment includes addressing life-threatening diseases without existing therapies or improving upon current treatments through clinical investigations. The FDA prioritizes the review of drug combinations for serious conditions without existing therapies or showing improved effects compared to current treatments. This includes demonstrating superiority or minimizing drug resistance in clinical trials assessing serious morbidity endpoints. The FDA prioritizes reviewing drug combinations for serious conditions without existing therapies or showing improved effects compared to current treatments, including demonstrating superiority or minimizing drug resistance in clinical trials.

CODEVELOPMENT TASK FORCE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish an interagency task force to promote the codevelopment of drugs in significant combinations. The task force will include experts in research and drug development for serious diseases like cancer, and will develop a list of recommended drug combinations for designation by the Secretary. The interagency task force will recommend significant drug combinations for designation by the Secretary, with opportunities for public comment and revisions based on feedback. The interagency task force will revise and update the list of recommended drug combinations in response to public comments, submitting the revised list annually to the Secretary and Congress. The interagency task force will submit a policy report to the Secretary and Congress annually, identifying challenges and opportunities for codevelopment of drugs in significant combinations, along with recommendations for policy changes to provide additional support. The interagency task force will submit an annual policy report to the Secretary and Congress on significant drug combinations, with recommendations for policy changes to support codevelopment. Public comments will be invited before the report is finalized, and the task force is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
