    "title": "SB 1325",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 25247 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require the department to review and approve plans submitted under Section 25246 if they comply with regulations and state/federal laws. Approval may be delayed until certain conditions are met, including approval under the Water Code or if immediate approval is necessary for public health or safety. The director may approve a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan if it is necessary for public health, safety, or the environment. Any department action is subject to Section 25204.5 and must comply with the California Environmental Quality Act. The hazardous waste facility postclosure plan must be approved in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. The department must allow public involvement before approving or modifying the plan. A \"significant modification\" for a hazardous waste facility permit is determined based on similarity to class 3 modifications in regulations. Public concern and complexity of the proposed change are also considered in determining if a modification requires more extensive procedures. The department has the authority to order necessary actions at a facility to protect public health and safety, regardless of any limitations or delays imposed by this subdivision. If the department requires a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan through an enforcement order or agreement instead of a permit, the owner must pay a specified fee or enter a cost reimbursement agreement. The fee must be paid at the start of the postclosure period. The department may enforce a postclosure plan through various actions, including filing an injunction, requiring corrective action, and assessing civil penalties for violations. This does not apply to plans with permits issued before December 31, 2003, unless mutually replaced with an enforcement order or agreement. The department must adopt regulations by January 1, 2018, to impose postclosure plan requirements. If deemed necessary, a postclosure permit can replace an enforcement order or agreement. The department retains authority to order actions for public health or safety. Section 25247 of the Health and Safety Code is amended.
