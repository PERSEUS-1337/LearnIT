Congress finds that in 2008, there were millions of users of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin in the United States. The majority of cocaine and heroin in the US originates from Andean countries and Colombia and Mexico, respectively, leading to violence and corruption in those regions. Additionally, drug trafficking in Central America, Mexico, and other countries contributes to instability. Drug trafficking of cocaine and heroin in Central America, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Haiti, and other Caribbean countries fuels organized crime, threatening law enforcement, political institutions, and citizen security. Drug-related violence is increasing in Mexico and along the US-Mexico border, with 5,661 deaths in 2008 alone. Organized criminal networks in Mexico also traffic women and girls into the United States. According to the Department of State's June 2009 Trafficking in Persons report, organized criminal networks in Mexico traffic women and girls into the United States for commercial sexual exploitation. Extremist groups in the Western Hemisphere, such as FARC and Hezbollah, use drug trafficking to finance terrorist activities. US counternarcotics assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean from 1980-2008 totaled about $11.3 billion.
