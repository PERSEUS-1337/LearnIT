    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws require equal coverage terms for annual and lifetime limits, treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits. The health reform law did not alter these requirements. The federal parity law ensures that mental health and substance use disorder services have coverage terms equal to medical and surgical services. The ACA did not change these requirements, which include annual and lifetime limits, treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits. The federal parity law applies to insurers covering these services and certain plan types, including large fully insured and self-insured plans, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP plans. The ACA expands the law's applicability. The ACA expands federal parity law to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. QHPs offered in the Exchanges must comply with federal parity law. The ACA expands federal parity law to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. QHPs offered in the Exchanges must comply with federal parity law, which also applies to plans offered through the individual market and Medicaid benchmark plans. Medicaid may be provided through traditional state plan benefits or Medicaid managed care plans. The ACA expands federal parity law to include Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, which must partially comply with federal parity law for mental health and substance use disorder services. Fully insured and self-insured small plans are exempt from federal parity law, and it does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. Federal parity law exempts fully insured and self-insured small plans in non-managed care settings. It also does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. The ACA expanded federal parity law to include Medicaid benchmark plans, but the small employer exemption remains in effect. The ACA did not change the small employer exemption, which remains in effect. Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. There have historically been disparities in coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, but federal parity law aims to address these discrepancies. Federal parity law aims to address disparities in coverage terms between mental health and substance use disorder services and medical and surgical services. The ACA did not change the fundamental approach of mandated offering parity, but included broader changes for the coverage of mental health services. The ACA did not change the fundamental approach of mandated offering parity for mental health and substance use disorder services. However, it included broader changes for coverage, such as the establishment of Exchanges where QHPs must offer a minimum set of benefits known as the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP). The ACA requires the offering of a minimum set of benefits called the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP), which includes Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and specified tiers of coverage. The Secretary of HHS defines the items and services in the EHB, including 10 categories like mental health and substance use disorder services. Benefits in the EHB must be comparable to those in a typical employer plan, determined through a survey by the DOL. The ACA requires the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) to be comparable to a typical employer plan, determined through a DOL survey. The specific mental health and substance use disorder services included in the EHBP will be determined through the rulemaking process. The EHBP will include mental health and substance use disorder services determined through the rulemaking process. HHS has discretion to add benefits beyond the 10 required categories. States can define EHB using benchmark health insurance plans. The HHS proposes allowing states to define Essential Health Benefits (EHB) using benchmark health insurance plans, including options like the largest HMO in the state or one of the three largest federal employee health plan options. The designated benchmark plan would determine the scope of services comparable to a typical employer plan, with benefits covered by the plan becoming the EHB for the state. Additionally, the HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to conduct a consensus study on EHB determination. The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to study the determination of Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The IOM released a report on the criteria for determining the EHB, which does not recommend specific services. The ACA mandates plans to offer either the EHBP or EHB, including coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA mandates plans to offer either the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) or Essential Health Benefits (EHB), including coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. This requirement applies to new plans in the individual and small group markets, Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), and Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA mandates coverage of the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) including mental health and substance use disorder services. Plans must comply by January 1, 2014, with exemptions for grandfathered and large group plans. The health reform law will increase access to these services and require coverage on par with medical and surgical services. Some plans may voluntarily offer coverage beyond federal parity law requirements. The broader requirements of the ACA mandate coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services to be on par with medical and surgical services. Plans may voluntarily offer these services or comply with federal parity law to stay competitive in the private market."
