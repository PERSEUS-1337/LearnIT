    "content": "The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The purpose and findings of the Act are outlined in section 2. The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" aims to provide financially competitive options for maintaining prime, unique, and strategic farmland in agricultural production, as agricultural producers lack incentives to retain such lands. States and local governments have also struggled to provide sufficient incentives for landowners to keep farmland in agricultural production. Federal assistance is necessary to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands, as states and local governments have been unable to provide sufficient incentives for landowners to maintain agricultural production. Federal assistance is needed to protect prime, unique, and strategic farmlands, as states and local governments lack incentives for landowners to maintain agricultural production. The Farms for the Future Act of 1990 is amended to include federal cost sharing for the acquisition of farmland protection easements. The term 'qualifying farmland' refers to land crucial for agricultural production and at risk of being converted to incompatible uses. A 'farmland protection easement' restricts land use to support continued agricultural production. Farmland protection easements restrict land use to support agricultural production and bind all future landowners. Eligible States with approved programs can acquire these easements. The Secretary may provide matching grants to assist in retaining qualifying farmland for agricultural use. The Secretary may provide matching grants to eligible States for acquiring farmland protection easements to preserve qualifying farmland for agricultural use. Grants are made on a 50-50 matching basis, with exceptions for States actively protecting farmland. The Secretary provides matching grants to eligible States for acquiring farmland protection easements to preserve qualifying farmland for agricultural use. An eligible State may not receive more than 10 percent of the total amount available for grants in a fiscal year. Funds must be used to protect farmland, with priority given to lands of greatest importance to the State's agriculture industry. The Secretary ensures that funds are used by eligible States to protect farmland, prioritizing lands important to the State's agriculture industry. The purchase price of farmland protection easements should not exceed fair market value on average. Authorization of appropriations is provided for each fiscal year."
