    "content": "In the 109th Congress, legislation has been approved to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. S. 667 and H.R. 240 were the bills involved, with S. 667 reported by the Senate Finance Committee on March 17, 2005, and H.R. 240 approved by the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources on March 15, 2005. The CSE program, enacted in 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the Department of Health and Human Services. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is funded by general revenues and operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services. Other families must apply and may be charged an application fee not exceeding $25. Child support collected for nonwelfare families is disbursed to the family. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1975, is funded by general revenues and operates in all 50 states. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services. Child support collected on behalf of nonwelfare families goes to the family. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly. However, the program still only collects 18% of child support obligations for which it is responsible. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1975 and funded by general revenues, handles about 50% of all child support cases. In FY2003, paternity was established for 77% of children without legally identified fathers. The program provides services such as parent location, paternity establishment, child support order establishment, support order review and modification, support payment collection and distribution, and medical support enforcement. Collection methods include income withholding, intercept of tax refunds, unemployment compensation, liens, security bonds, and credit bureau reporting. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program utilizes various methods for collecting child support payments, including income withholding, intercepting tax refunds and unemployment compensation, liens, security bonds, and credit bureau reporting. Legislation such as P.L. 105-187 and P.L. 104-193 have established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. P.L. 104-193 mandated states to implement expedited procedures to collect child support arrearages by intercepting various payments and seizing assets of debtor parents, including those held in retirement funds and financial institutions. States were also required to withhold licenses of individuals with past-due support or who failed to comply with legal obligations related to child support. Additionally, states had to conduct quarterly data matches with financial institutions to identify and seize debtor's financial resources. P.L. 104-193 required states to implement procedures to collect child support arrearages, including intercepting payments and seizing assets of debtor parents. It also authorized the denial, revocation, or restriction of passports for debtor parents and mandated the enactment of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. Additionally, the federal government provides financial incentives to states for operating effective child support enforcement programs. The government reimburses states for administering their CSE programs and refunds laboratory costs for establishing paternity. Incentive payments are given to states to operate effective programs. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 established a new incentive payment system. The CSE program has evolved into a multifaceted program focusing on service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and parental responsibility. The program helps secure financial support for children. The CSE program focuses on service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and parental responsibility. It helps secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents, contributing significantly to single-parent family income. Proposed bills aim to enhance the program, increase collections, and improve economic independence for former welfare families. Child support makes up 30% of family income for poor families. Bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to improve the CSE program, increase collections, and provide stable income for single-parent families. The bills focus on simplifying CSE rules, strengthening family-first policies, and enhancing enforcement tools. The Senate bill includes more CSE provisions than the House bill. The report discusses the assignment of child support rights to the state as a condition for receiving TANF benefits. Assigned child support collections are retained by states and the federal government. Child support accrued while receiving TANF benefits and before, is kept by states and the federal government. Nonwelfare families keep all child support collected on their behalf. Assignments entered before September 30, 1997, permanently assign arrearages to the state, while those after October 1, 1997, only assign arrearages accumulated during assistance. The child support assignment rules differ based on the date it was entered. Arrearages accrued before TANF benefits are \"temporarily assigned\" and revert to the family when they leave TANF. S. 667 proposes that only child support during TANF benefits be assigned to the state, while H.R. 240 suggests a different approach. H.R. 240 does not change child support assignment rules, which determine the order of payment for collections. TANF families can retain current support and assigned arrearages up to the amount of benefits received. The 1996 welfare law (P.L. 104-193) repealed the $50 required pass through and allowed states to decide how much of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send to the family. States also determine whether to treat child support payments as income to the family. States must pay the federal government its share of child support collections, placing the entire cost on the state. The 1996 welfare law (P.L. 104-193) required states to pay the federal government the federal government's share of child support collections collected on behalf of TANF families. As of August 2004, 18 states were continuing the $50 pass-through and disregard policy. Both bills aim to incentivize states to direct more child support to families rather than reimbursing state and federal coffers for welfare benefits. The bills differ in the amount of federal cost-sharing provided and helping states pay for current expenses. The bills aim to incentivize states to prioritize directing child support to families rather than reimbursing state and federal coffers for welfare benefits. They differ in federal cost-sharing and supporting states with current expenses. S. 667 allows states to pay up to $400 per month in child support to TANF families without reimbursing the federal government. The House bill, H.R. 240, incentivizes states to increase child support pass-through to TANF families without reimbursing the federal government. It allows states to pay more child support to families without paying the federal share of those payments. The House bill incentivizes states to increase child support pass-through to TANF families without reimbursing the federal government. The subsidized child support pass-through payments would be the amount above any payments the state was making on December 31, 2001. The federal government's cost-sharing of the new pass-through payments would be limited to the greater of $100 per month or $50 per month more than the state previously shared with the family. Child support collections paid to TANF families are prioritized under the 1996 welfare reform law. States must distribute child support collections to former TANF families before reimbursing the state and federal government. This \"family-first\" policy includes current child support, never-assigned arrearages, and pre-TANF arrearages. The goal is to prioritize families once they leave the TANF program. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritizes child support collections for former TANF families, aiming to provide additional income to reduce dependence on public assistance. Child support accrued before and after TANF goes to the family, while support during TANF goes to the state. S. 667 proposes giving states the option to distribute the full amount of child support collected to former TANF families, including arrearages. S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose giving states the option to distribute the full amount of child support collected to former TANF families, including arrearages. The federal government would share the costs of paying child support arrearages to the family first. The House bill proposes sharing costs with states for paying child support arrearages accrued during TANF receipt and passing through child support collected via federal income tax refund offset program. Both bills include provisions on passport denial, collecting child support from Social Security and veterans' benefits, using tax refund offset program for past-due child support, and HHS Secretary's authority to compare information of noncustodial parents owing child support. The Senate Finance Committee's bill includes provisions to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments, such as allowing the HHS Secretary to compare information of noncustodial parents who owe past-due child support with insurer data and enabling states to establish interstate child support cases. The Senate Finance Committee's bill includes provisions to expand states' ability to collect child support payments, such as authorizing the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents, requiring medical support from parents, and notifying health care plan administrators. Additionally, the bill mandates states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years, requires a report on locating custodial parents, and establishes a minimum funding level. The proposed bills aim to improve child support collection by requiring regular review of support orders for TANF families, establishing minimum funding levels for assistance programs, and designating Indian tribes as authorized entities for accessing support information. Additionally, there are provisions for a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services but not on TANF, and increased funding for access and visitation programs in S. 667. S. 667 aims to increase funding for the CSE access and visitation program, require states to adopt a later version of UIFSA for interstate child support payments, and allow Texas to continue its CSE program without a federal waiver. Table 1 compares the CSE provisions of S. 667 with current law. Table 1 compares the child support provisions of S. 667, the \"Personal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone Act (PRIDE)\" and H.R. 240, the \"Personal Responsibility, Work and Family Promotion Act of 2005\", with current law."
