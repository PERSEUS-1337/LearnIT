    "content": "This report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. The report discusses the background of animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and highlights unresolved issues. Appendices provide a timeline of the U.S. National Animal Identification System and its successor program. On February 5, 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced the USDA's new approach to animal disease traceability, replacing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). This new approach, called Animal Disease Traceability, allows states and tribal nations to choose their own system. The USDA's new approach to animal disease traceability, known as Animal Disease Traceability, allows states and tribal nations to choose their own system for within-state animal identification and traceability. All animals moving in interstate commerce must have a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. This framework is based on the authority derived from the Animal Health Protection Act. The USDA, under the Animal Health Protection Act, has the authority to regulate interstate movement of farm-raised livestock. A Traceability Regulation Working Group was established to gather feedback and make recommendations for a proposed rule. APHIS conducted forums and public meetings to discuss the new framework for animal disease traceability. USDA released publications outlining recommendations for animal disease traceability framework. APHIS conducted public meetings to gather feedback from officials and producers. The framework emphasizes state and tribal responsibility in managing traceability programs. The USDA's traceability framework emphasizes state and tribal responsibility in managing traceability programs for animal diseases. States may choose to have no mandatory animal ID or traceability capability, rely on existing systems, or develop their own detailed ID system. Data collection and storage will be done by states, not the federal government, with federal rules applying only to livestock in interstate commerce. The federal government emphasizes state and tribal responsibility in managing traceability programs for animal diseases. Federal rules will apply only to livestock in interstate commerce, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. Exemptions will be defined, and acceptable identification types will be outlined in federal regulations. Performance standards for animal disease traceability will be evaluated through rulemaking by the Traceability Regulation Working Group. The Traceability Regulation Working Group, along with state and tribal animal health officials, will define performance standards for animal disease traceability. Each state and tribal nation will have detailed traceability cooperative agreements with APHIS, with federal funding provided through annual agreements. No funding is designated for animal traceability in the FY2011 agriculture appropriations bill, but funding could be considered after needs are identified under USDA's new initiative. The Senate Committee on Appropriations report indicates that funding for animal traceability could be considered after needs are identified under USDA's new initiative. The program governing animal disease traceability of interstate animal movements will be implemented through federal regulations. USDA will define animal disease traceability with a new section in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and a proposed rule could be published in April 2011 with a 60- to 90-day comment period. The USDA is working on a proposed rule for animal disease traceability, with potential economic consequences if major outbreaks occur. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic outbreaks like foot and mouth disease in other countries. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic animal disease outbreaks like foot and mouth disease. However, if a similar outbreak were to occur, it could cost the U.S. cattle industry $30 billion to $100 billion. This has led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries. The 1990s and early 2000s saw the development of animal identification and traceability systems in various countries, with programs ranging from voluntary to mandatory. Japan and South Korea are considering requiring traceability on imported meat products, which could impact market access. Any changes in animal health, food safety, and import standards could have significant economic implications for U.S. livestock industries. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production. It ranks third in pork production behind China and the EU. The US is the top exporter of pork, second in poultry (after Brazil), and third in beef. US exports account for a significant portion of domestic production, with 17% for pork and poultry, and 6% for beef in 2007 and 2008.

Animal identification (ID) involves keeping records on individual farm animals or groups for tracking purposes, including information on origins and traceability. Animal ID systems with traceability are crucial for tracking animal products back to their source and identifying potential contamination. A national database accessible through a high-speed network is seen as the ideal system to respond quickly to disease outbreaks or food safety issues. Different countries have varying versions of animal ID systems, collecting information on birthplace, owner details, movements, and slaughter locations. Animal ID systems with traceability are essential for tracking animal products back to their source and identifying contamination. Information collected includes birthplace, owner details, movements, and slaughter locations. More elaborate systems include data on sex, breed, parentage, feeds, pharmaceuticals, and product movement. Reasons for tracking animals and products include rapid response to health and safety concerns, verification of premium production processes, and animal health focus in the United States. In the United States, animal ID focuses on health, while other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea prioritize both health and food safety. These countries have more comprehensive traceability systems that track products from birth to retail. International buyers are increasingly demanding information on product history, including how animals were raised and the marketing chain they followed. The national animal ID and traceability system in the United States responds to international buyers' demands for better information on product history, including how animals were raised and the marketing chain they followed. Proponents argue that the system enhances animal health surveillance and disease eradication, while critics raise concerns about its implementation. The national animal ID and traceability system in the United States aims to enhance animal health surveillance and disease eradication. It would facilitate early detection of dangerous animal diseases and minimize the economic impact of outbreaks by controlling and eradicating diseases at regional and national levels. Regionalization or compartmentalization helps contain outbreaks to specific zones, reducing the risk of international trade restrictions. Regionalization or compartmentalization is a disease management tool that contains a disease outbreak to a specific zone, limiting the spread of harmful diseases and economic damage. It also helps in re-establishing international market access and increasing domestic marketing opportunities for farmers and ranchers. Increasing domestic marketing opportunities for farmers and ranchers involve tracking individual animals for desirable production characteristics like \"organic\" or \"grass-fed\" to command higher prices in retail markets. Universal bar codes on processed food help manage inventories and monitor consumer buying, while ID and traceability assist in verifying production methods for consumers seeking specific standards. Government-coordinated programs, like USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service process verification program, support these efforts. Government-coordinated programs, such as USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service process verification program, provide livestock and meat producers with the opportunity to assure customers of consistent quality products through independent audits. These programs also include domestic origin requirements, national organic certification, and country-of-origin labeling. A traceability program for animal products provides valuable management tools for producers by tracking post-mortem information on cattle, performance history of racing or show animals, and increasing transparency in the supply chain. It helps reduce the risk of liability claims against livestock producers and allows for maintaining records on animal movements, health, and breed registries. A traceability program for animal products enhances transparency in the supply chain, reduces liability claims against livestock producers, and helps maintain records on animal movements, health, and breed registries. It also addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state agencies to protect the food supply from threats like tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses. A more rigorous traceback and animal ID system is believed to facilitate food recalls and contain the spread of foodborne illnesses. However, some in the food industry argue that such a system would be costly and technically unworkable. Traceability systems also enhance foreign marketing opportunities for animal products by reassuring buyers about the health of U.S. animals and meeting foreign veterinary and food safety requirements. Animal disease programs, aided by traceability systems, reassure buyers about the health of U.S. animals and meet foreign veterinary and food safety requirements. They also certify production processes for value-added niche markets and export programs. USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. AMS sets standards for U.S. suppliers shipping beef and certifies proper procedures are in place, becoming a prerequisite for access. USDA's AMS establishes standards for U.S. suppliers to ship beef to countries like Japan, making traceability systems a prerequisite for access to foreign markets. Lack of a national animal identification system hindered the U.S. from receiving \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the OIE, which could enhance international competitiveness and domestic price structures. The USDA's AMS sets standards for U.S. beef suppliers to access foreign markets like Japan, requiring traceability systems. Lack of a national animal ID system prevented the U.S. from obtaining \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the OIE, impacting international competitiveness and domestic prices. Additionally, an animal ID system could aid in rescuing at-risk animals during natural disasters, although opponents raise concerns about privacy invasion. Critics of a national animal ID program argue that it invades privacy by collecting personal information and could lead to disclosure of proprietary data. They also point out increased costs for producers with no guaranteed market benefits. The USDA-funded benefit-cost analysis of animal ID implementation in the United States found that over 90% of the annual cost would fall on the cattle sector. The technology requirements could complicate operations and exceed operators' capabilities, disadvantaging cattle producers compared to vertically integrated pork and poultry industries. Critics argue that individual animal tagging in the cattle industry would unfairly disadvantage small operators, eroding profit margins and hindering market power. Some religious groups object to the government program on apocalyptic grounds. Some producers resist individual animal tagging in the cattle industry due to concerns about increased transparency leading to higher tax liabilities. Religious groups also object to the program on apocalyptic grounds. The national animal ID and traceability program has evolved from state and national disease eradication programs. The national animal ID and traceability program, overseen by USDA's APHIS, emerged from state and national disease eradication programs. Unique brucellosis ID tags were used successfully in eradicating the disease from U.S. commercial herds, leading to a decrease in animal ID usage. The national animal ID program, overseen by USDA's APHIS, successfully eradicated brucellosis from U.S. commercial herds, leading to a decrease in animal ID usage. Certain livestock classes have official identification requirements for interstate commerce, such as swine for pseudorabies and sheep for scrapie. Various programs exist for animal identification, but they are not national in scope and vary in their approach. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program was proposed in 2002 to address limitations in U.S. animal ID systems after the discovery of BSE in the United States. The program aimed to improve animal identification, record keeping, and data management through a state-federal-industry partnership. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program, proposed in 2002 after the discovery of BSE in the U.S., aimed to improve animal ID systems. However, due to criticism from the cattle sector, USDA replaced NAIS with a state-based program in 2010, mandating traceability only for livestock moving in interstate commerce. The NAIS system, intended for all major commercial livestock and poultry species in the U.S., faced criticism from the cattle sector due to cost and implementation burdens. It excluded household pets and aimed to provide nationwide animal ID, focusing on animals in commerce or those that commingle with others. The NAIS system in the United States focused on identifying animals in commerce or those that commingle with others, excluding household pets. The program was voluntary, with USDA's role being to popularize it, provide information, and address implementation issues. The NAIS system in the United States focused on identifying animals in commerce or those that commingle with others, excluding household pets. The program was voluntary, with USDA's role being to popularize it, provide information, and address implementation issues. Information was available to all participants, addressing issues such as prioritizing implementation by species/sectors, harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating technology, partnering with states/industry, and advancing ID technologies. USDA published reports for participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies. Three reports provided detailed information about the status of NAIS, how to participate in the program, and the future direction of program implementation. A Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability recommended strategies to enhance animal disease traceability. The NAIS User Guide offered guidance to producers and owners on participation benefits. Program Standards and Technical details were also provided. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document, published in November 2006, established data standards for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). It included formats for premises, animal, and group/lot identification numbers, as well as standards for official identification devices. Compliance with these standards by various entities involved in NAIS would ensure system effectiveness. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) established data standards by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to ensure system effectiveness. The primary goal of NAIS was to protect U.S. agriculture from the harm of animal disease outbreaks. USDA identified specific goals for NAIS, including increasing disease response capabilities, limiting disease spread, minimizing economic impact, and maintaining market access. The long-term goal was to identify and trace animals of interest within 48 hours. The USDA's long-term goal for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease outbreak. NAIS was designed to provide rapid access to data on animal ID and movement history to contain outbreaks and limit economic damage by quickly identifying infected animals and potential exposure. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was created to facilitate quick traceback of animal diseases in the commercial marketing chain. It consisted of three components: premises registration, animal identification, and animal tracking. The first phase involved registering the geographic location where livestock or poultry were raised. States and tribes had to collect specific information for premises registration, such as premises identification number, entity name, contact person, and address. The premises registration for the National Animal Identification System required states and tribes to collect specific information including a premises identification number (PIN), entity name, contact person, address, phone numbers, operation type, activation and retirement dates, and alternative phone numbers. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number, remains the same even with a change of ownership. Registration was free and done through state or tribal animal health authorities. Premises registration for the National Animal Identification System was required by states and tribes, with information stored in a National Premises Information Repository by the USDA to protect privacy. This information would help notify producers quickly in case of disease outbreaks and allow officials to locate at-risk animals for prompt action. The goal was to have all premises registered by 2009, but as of September 6, 2009, this had not been achieved. Health officials aimed to quickly locate at-risk animals and take precise actions to address the situation, minimize hardships, and speed disease eradication efforts. By September 6, 2009, only 37% of premises were registered under the NAIS out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. USDA emphasized the need for higher participation levels to successfully implement NAIS, which involved assigning unique numbers to individual animals or specific groups. Animal identification under the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) involved obtaining unique 15-digit Animal Identification Numbers (AIN) for animals like swine and poultry. The first three digits of the AIN are the country code, with the United States designated as 840. Various ID devices, including RFID tags and injectable transponders, were used to comply with the AIN numbering system. The goal was to quickly locate at-risk animals for disease control and eradication efforts. The USDA did not specify any particular identification technologies beyond the minimum requirements for official identification under the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The use of RFID devices and injectable transponders has increased in recent years, allowing for faster access to ID information without the need to physically approach or restrain animals. This technology helps reduce stress and improve data quality. Some animals were exempt from identification under NAIS. RFID and electronic transponder devices provide easier access to ID information, eliminating the need to approach or restrain animals, reducing stress, and improving data quality. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS, such as those that never leave their birth premises or are moved directly to custom slaughter for personal consumption. USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises due to the risk of disease spread. The person responsible for the animal can choose when to place the ID on it. Diseases like avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, and vesicular stomatitis can spread even if an animal stays on its home premises. The USDA recommends attaching an ID to animals before they are moved to another location. Producers can choose when to attach the ID, with some opting to do so shortly after birth. If animals cannot be tagged on their current premises, tagging services are available at auction markets. Tagging services are available for producers to market their animals. Animals should be tagged before being commingled with others. Producers bringing animals into their operation should maintain the official identification already on the animal. Group/lot identification numbers can be used for animals moving through the production chain as a group. This practice is common in the poultry and pork industries. Group/lot identification numbers (GIN) are a 15-character code used in the poultry and pork industries to track animals assembled in groups. The GIN includes a seven-character PIN, a six-digit date of assembly, and a two-digit count of groups at the same premises. Producers generate the GIN, which remains with the animals for life, linking them to their birthplace. The system is tailored to different species and their unique characteristics in raising, moving, and commingling. The NAIS involves a uniform numbering system to link livestock or poultry to their birthplace. Producers report animal movements to NAIS-compliant databases for disease outbreak tracking. Minimum tracing information is required for participation. The NAIS requires producers to report animal movements to non-federal databases using standardized tracing information. This includes national premises ID, animal ID, date of event, and event type. Additional animal-specific data is standardized but not required for participation. Movement within a production unit for management purposes is not necessary to report for NAIS. The NAIS requires producers to report animal movements to non-federal databases using standardized tracing information. Movements within a production unit for management purposes are not necessary to report for NAIS. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS is a public/private partnership where industry and states operate and maintain Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) containing animal location and movement records. States and private entities maintain the ATDs to assure confidentiality for participants, while the federal government operates a portal system for animal health officials to request information from the ATD administrators during disease investigations. The USDA's Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) was part of a plan to ensure confidentiality for participants in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The system allowed animal health officials to request information from the ATDs during disease investigations. The ATDs were designed to provide timely and accurate reports during disease outbreaks, with optimal retrieval of traceback data within a 48-hour window for efficient disease containment. State and federal officials would use the system in situations such as a confirmed positive test for a foreign animal disease or an animal disease emergency declared by the Secretary of Agriculture or state. State and federal animal health officials would use the system in situations like a confirmed positive test for a foreign animal disease, an animal disease emergency, or the need for traceback/traceforward for program diseases. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the US had been registered, with varying participation rates across species and states. Poultry and sheep had a 95% registration rate, swine 80%, goat 60%, horse 50%, and cattle 18%. By September 6, 2009, 531,284 animal premises (excluding horses) had been registered, representing 36.9% of the total. According to USDA, animal registration rates varied across species, with poultry and sheep at 95%, swine at 80%, goat at 60%, horse at 50%, and cattle at 18%. As of September 6, 2009, 531,284 animal premises (excluding horses) had been registered, representing 36.9% of the estimated 1.4 million livestock and poultry farms in the United States. To achieve a 48-hour traceback goal, USDA estimated that 70% of animals in a specific species would need to be identified and traceable to their premises of origin. USDA estimated that 70% of animals in a specific species need to be identified and traceable to achieve critical mass for effective traceability. Dr. John Clifford suggested a participation rate of 70% for effective traceability, but a higher rate of 90% may be needed for full benefits. Some supporters criticized USDA for slow progress in implementing animal ID, as highlighted in a 2007 GAO report. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified problems hindering effective implementation of animal ID, such as lack of prioritization among species, integration plan with existing requirements, and data requirements. USDA's NAIS Business Plan (2008) aimed to address GAO criticisms, but slow progress was attributed to unresolved issues and low participation rates. USDA officials called for Congress to address the issue of low participation rates for NAIS to achieve its 48-hour traceback window. The USDA officials expressed concern over low participation rates in the NAIS program, calling for Congress to either increase incentives or make participation mandatory. Various groups, including state animal health officials and the AVMA, supported mandatory participation. In October 2006, the National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials and the U.S. Animal Health Association approved a recommendation for USDA to make animal ID mandatory for all U.S. breeding cattle. Various industry groups and lawmakers supported this move to prevent losses from virulent diseases. Rosa DeLauro of the Appropriations' Subcommittee on Agriculture supports making NAIS mandatory to prevent losses from virulent diseases. Opponents, mainly from the cattle industry, including R-CALF, NCBA, and Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, fear high costs and confidentiality issues. Some members of Congress from cattle-heavy districts share these concerns. The USDA faces concerns from small producers and Congress members about the confidentiality of the NAIS program. In response to industry worries, Secretary Johanns announced NAIS would remain voluntary. Proponents argue for a mandatory program under Secretary Vilsack. Secretary Vilsack may reverse the decision for NAIS to remain voluntary and make it mandatory for the U.S. livestock industry. The costs of an animal ID system, including tags and data tracking, vary widely. The question of who should bear these costs\u2014industry, government, or both\u2014remains a policy issue. USDA suggests sharing expenses, with government funding database costs and producers covering identifying devices. The USDA suggests sharing expenses for an animal ID system, with government funding database costs and producers covering identifying devices. Larger retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to farms, making it difficult for smaller operations to survive. Some argue that smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may find niche market opportunities with traceability to the retail level. On April 29, 2009, APHIS released the KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) on the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS. The study assumed individual ID tagging for cattle, group ID tagging for swine (except cull breeding animals), and unique group ID tagging for poultry. Results for a 100%-participation scenario are summarized in Table 5. The KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) estimated that implementing NAIS for livestock industries would cost approximately $228 million annually for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation. Costs increase to $304.2 million when including horses. The majority of costs, $5.97 per animal marketed, are associated with the cattle sector due to individual ID tagging requirements. Swine, sheep, goats, and poultry can often be traced using premises and group ID tagging. The cost of implementing NAIS for livestock industries is estimated at $228 million annually for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation, increasing to $304.2 million with horses included. The cattle sector incurs the highest costs at $5.97 per animal marketed due to individual ID tagging requirements. Other livestock sectors have lower costs for traceability. The economic benefits of NAIS with full participation outweigh the costs. The economic benefits of implementing NAIS with 100% participation include substantial government savings, re-establishing markets quickly after disease outbreaks, expanded market access, avoidance of significant losses, and increased consumer demand. The cost-effectiveness of NAIS improves with higher participation levels. The study found that implementation of NAIS would be more cost-effective with higher participation levels, but may not be economically viable at lower levels. Producers are concerned about liability for contamination and public scrutiny of their records under the federal Freedom of Information Act. Producers are concerned about public scrutiny of their records under the federal Freedom of Information Act, which exempts access to certain business information to protect trade secrets and proprietary data. In the 110th Congress, a provision addressing the protection of trade secrets was deleted from the omnibus 2008 farm bill. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2419, the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246), required USDA regulations to protect trade secrets and confidential business information in an animal ID system. South Korea plans to implement traceability requirements for imported beef by December 2010. The EU mandates individual identification and traceability for all suppliers, while Japan currently does not require traceability for imported beef but has other specifications in place. The Democratic Party of Japan aims to pass laws for BSE measures and beef traceability for imported beef. The Democratic Party of Japan aims to pass laws for BSE measures and beef traceability for imported beef, but it is unlikely to be addressed as an early priority due to the party's focus on setting up its new administration and prioritizing its agenda. India is the only top-tier beef exporter without a traceability system besides the United States. India, a top-tier beef exporter besides the United States, lacks a traceability system for its low-valued canned/cooked beef exports. The implementation of traceability measures for imported meat is becoming crucial, with the WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures applying rules to non-tariff trade barriers like traceability requirements. These measures must be scientifically justified and not more rigorous than necessary. The USDA invested $142 million in the development of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) since 2004, but participation remained low at 40% by 2009. Criticism from the U.S. cattle sector led to a public listening initiative by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to address concerns and slow growth in participation rates. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April 15 to June 30, 2009, to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The information obtained from these sessions and written comments led to the decision to abandon NAIS in favor of a state-based system on February 5, 2010. Secretary Vilsack announced the abandonment of NAIS in favor of a state-based system on February 5, 2010, following public listening sessions and written feedback. Congress expressed frustration with the slow pace of NAIS implementation despite significant funding allocated from FY2004 to FY2009. In FY2009, USDA was directed to show progress in implementing the program, leading to a proposed increase in funding to $14.6 million for FY2010. In 2009, the Administration proposed increasing funding for the NAIS to $14.6 million in FY2010, but the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill. Subcommittee members expressed frustration with the slow pace of national sign-up for NAIS despite receiving $142 million in funding since FY2004. The report (H.Rept. 111-181) noted that despite receiving $142 million in funding since FY2004, APHIS has not implemented an effective system for animal health and livestock market benefits. Continued investments in the current NAIS are deemed unwarranted until USDA provides details on how it will implement an effective ID system. An amendment reduced FY2010 funding for NAIS to $7.3 million, with funds restricted to ongoing NAIS activities and rulemaking purposes. The FY2010 funding for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was reduced to $5.3 million, with restrictions on the use of funds for ongoing activities and rulemaking. The final funding level was set at $5.3 million in the Agriculture appropriations bill signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed at clarifying USDA's authority for an animal ID program were proposed but not adopted. In the 110th Congress, bills were proposed to clarify USDA's authority for an animal ID program, including H.R. 1018, H.R. 2301, and S. 1292. H.R. 3485 aimed to establish new traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat and poultry. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 814 and S. 425 included provisions for FSIS to establish a traceability system. In the 111th Congress, bills H.R. 814 and S. 425 included provisions for FSIS to establish a traceability system for meat and poultry products regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The system would trace each animal to any premises prior to slaughter and track carcasses and meat/poultry products from slaughter through distribution to consumers. The Secretary of Agriculture would be authorized to require record maintenance for traceability purposes. The 111th Congress considered food safety legislation for FDA-regulated foods, not for FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products. Two hearings were held on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in the House, focusing on animal identification systems and bio-security measures. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was reviewed by Congress, with a history dating back to the 1800s when hot iron brands were used for animal identification. In the 1940s, a successful cattle ID program was initiated for brucellosis vaccination, but has since been phased out due to near eradication of the disease in the US. In the 1950s-1980s, the USDA developed a successful animal ID program for cattle to detect disease outbreaks early. The system was phased out as brucellosis neared eradication in the US. In 1986-1988, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or \"mad cow disease\" was first identified in the UK, leading to the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. In the 1990s and early 2000s, outbreaks of foot and mouth disease and Classical Swine Fever in various countries led to the slaughter of millions of animals and significant economic losses. In the UK, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in cattle resulted in the forced slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle, costing an estimated $7.9 billion in losses and eradication costs. In 2002, APHIS officials collaborated with various organizations to draft an early version of an animal ID plan. By December 2003, a draft of the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP) was published, calling for recording animal movements in a central database. APHIS was responsible for designing an ID numbering system, allocating numbers to premises and animals, and coordinating data collection. APHIS was tasked with designing an ID numbering system and coordinating data collection for the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP). The plan aimed to have all states implement an animal premises ID system by July 2004 and identify farm animals by July 2006. Following the detection of mad cow disease in December 2003, USDA accelerated the implementation of a national animal ID system, with Secretary Ann Veneman transferring funds for this purpose in April 2004. The implementation of a national animal ID system was accelerated by Secretary Ann Veneman in April 2004, with $18.8 million transferred for this purpose. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) framework was announced in April 2004, with periodic revisions made in response to industry feedback. USDA issued a Draft Strategic Plan in May 2005 with timelines for a mandatory program by January 2009, and a new set of guiding principles was announced in August 2005. By April 2006, a new plan called \"Implementation Strategies\" set a timeline for full implementation by 2009, with the program initially being voluntary. In April 2006, USDA unveiled a new plan called \"Implementation Strategies\" with a timeline for full implementation by 2009. The program was initially voluntary, but there was a contingency for mandatory participation if voluntary levels were not sufficient. In August 2006, the NAIS program was designed to transition from voluntary to mandatory, but it was announced in November 2006 that it would remain entirely voluntary at the federal level. In November 2006, USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" outlining the three-step approach to implementing the voluntary National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The guide assured livestock producers of the program's voluntary nature and commitment to protecting private information. In December 2007, USDA's APHIS released the NAIS User Guide, followed by a draft Business Plan in April 2008. In April 2008, USDA's APHIS released a Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability, aiming for 48-hour traceback of affected animals in case of an outbreak. The plan prioritized species into Tier 1 (commercial food animals and horses) and Tier 2 (other livestock and poultry). The goal was to bring 70% of the cattle breeding herd into NAIS by the end of 2009. On January 13, 2009, APHIS published a proposed rule for \"Official Animal Identification Numbering.\" The USDA's APHIS released a Business Plan in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability, prioritizing species into Tier 1 and Tier 2. The goal was to bring 70% of the cattle breeding herd into NAIS by the end of 2009. In January 2009, a proposed rule for \"Official Animal Identification Numbering\" was published. Subsequently, in April 2009, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions to gather feedback on the future direction of animal identification and traceability in the United States. In April 2009, Secretary Vilsack gathered feedback on animal identification and traceability in the US. In February 2010, USDA announced a new approach to animal disease traceability, allowing states to choose their own ID systems. By March 2010, USDA required traceability for animals moving interstate. The USDA proposed a revision requiring all animals in interstate commerce to have traceable ID back to their originating state. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 to discuss the Animal Disease Traceability framework. APHIS released documents in August 2010 outlining the proposed rule on traceability. The US participates in international organizations related to animal health, food safety, and trade in livestock. The United States participates in international organizations such as the CODEX alimentarius, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) for animal health, food safety, and trade in livestock. U.S. livestock and animal products are subject to export certification standards imposed by importing countries. The WTO sets international trade rules for harmonizing participation in commerce and resolving disputes, while the CODEX alimentarius and OIE recommend standards for food safety and animal health. The World Trade Organization (WTO) aims to harmonize international commerce and resolve disputes, while the CODEX alimentarius and OIE provide guidelines for food safety and animal health standards. WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures restricts traceability measures on imports to scientifically justified requirements equivalent to domestic standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) develop food and animal health standards respectively. These organizations ensure fair trade practices, protect consumer health, and coordinate international food standards work. Traceability requirements for imports must be scientifically justified and equivalent to domestic industry standards. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is an intergovernmental organization responsible for improving animal health worldwide. It sets international standards for animal identification and traceability to enhance disease prevention, control, food safety, and export certification. The OIE established guidelines on animal identification and traceability in 2006, which were adopted as official standards in 2007. The Director General called for global implementation of these systems from farm to fork under OIE standards. The OIE (Bernard Vallet) urged for global implementation of animal identification and traceability systems from farm to fork. These systems, based on OIE standards, would enable compartmentalization during disease outbreaks, allowing trade to continue. Export certification, managed by USDA's FSIS in the US, is often required by importing countries. Certification for export verification is handled by USDA's FSIS in the US, ensuring compliance with importing countries' standards. The OIE promotes international certification standards and transparency through its programs. Chapter 5 of the OIE's Terrestrial Code outlines certification obligations and procedures. Foreign Animal ID and Traceability Programs are essential for global trade. Chapter 5 of the OIE's Terrestrial Code outlines certification obligations and procedures for global trade. Many countries, including Canada, have national animal identification systems with traceability capabilities managed by industry-led organizations like the Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA). The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) is responsible for an individual identification system for the Canadian cattle and bison industry. It became mandatory in 2002, transitioning to RFID tags in 2003. The CCIA works closely with the Canadian government to meet funding requirements for development initiatives. The Canadian cattle industry transitioned to RFID tags in 2003, with all cattle leaving their farm of origin required to have a CCIA-approved RFID tag since September 1, 2006. Benefits of RFID tags include exceptional tag retention, increased data integrity, and the ability to read at a distance without line of sight. CCIA's executive director estimated a nationwide compliance rate of 99-100% for Canadian cattle ID by March 2009. Personal information associated with the ear tag number is securely maintained in a national database for authorized personnel access in case of an animal health issue. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) securely maintains personal information associated with ear tag numbers in a national database for authorized personnel access in case of animal health issues. The system covers various industry and species groups, including dairy, beef, bison, sheep, pork, and poultry. Mandatory sheep and hog identification programs were established in 2004 and 2008, respectively. In Australia, the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) allows for electronic identification and traceability of livestock from birth to slaughter, with a mandatory system for cattle since 2005 and a tracing system for sheep and goats. The NLIS is a permanent system for electronic identification and tracking of animals from birth to slaughter. It was established in Australia in the early 1960s to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. A mandatory system for cattle has been in place since 2005, with tracing systems for sheep and goats. In the mid-1990s, the visual-read-only PIC system was converted to an electronic whole-of-life individual cattle identification system using RFIDs. Individual identification became compulsory for producers supplying the EU market in 1998. The NLIS was introduced in 1999, ensuring biosecurity, food safety, and market access. In a 2004 audit, all animals identified using NLIS were traced to their origin within 24 hours. In 2005, NLIS expanded to mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth, with unique ID numbers assigned to each animal at slaughter. Individual animal ID information is linked to live animals, carcasses, hides, and byproducts. The NLIS in Australia involves mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth, with unique ID numbers assigned to each animal at slaughter. The system is a joint commitment between the Australian Government and industry, with the Federal government providing funding and policy coordination, while state governments have legal jurisdiction over livestock movement and health. State governments work with industry to develop and implement legislation for the animal identification program. The government collaborates with industry to manage the animal identification program through joint committees. State governments oversee extension programs and producer education, maintain a registry of PICs, and ensure compliance with legislation. The database for NLIS is administered by Meat and Livestock Australia, protecting data from FOI requests. The database for NLIS, administered by Meat and Livestock Australia, is protected from Australian FOI requests. The European Union has mandatory animal identification programs for food safety, focusing on localization and tracing for veterinary purposes. EU species-specific ID systems have evolved in response to disease outbreaks. The EU has implemented mandatory animal identification systems in response to disease outbreaks, such as classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and the BSE crisis. These systems include traceability from birth to death, double ear tags for individual identification, cattle passports for movement recording, and a national database for tracking information. The EU has implemented mandatory animal identification systems, including cattle passports and a national database for tracking information. Regulations require animals to be tracked from birth to harvest, with meat products labeled to show origin and processing details. Equidae in the EU must have passports for movement since July 1, 2000. Since January 1, 2005, mandatory food traceability has been a part of the EU's general food law. Equidae in the EU must have passports for movement since July 1, 2000, while a mandatory identification system for porcine animals started on August 28, 2008. The EU's ID system for ovine and caprine animals was fully implemented in July 2005. Japan has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system since December 1, 2004, tracking animals from birth to consumer purchase. Imported beef currently does not have the same traceability requirements as domestically produced beef, but there is growing political pressure for this to change. Japan implemented animal traceability regulations and food safety oversight in response to food safety crises in the early 2000s. The first phase began in July 2002 with the Law Relating to Special BSE Countermeasures, requiring traceability of domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by December 2003. The second phase established the Food Safety Commission in May 2003. Political pressure is growing for imported beef to be subject to the same traceability requirements as domestically produced beef. Japan implemented animal traceability regulations in response to food safety crises. The Beef Traceability Law required traceability from farms to slaughterhouses by December 2003, and extended it to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 2004. Retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumers. Additionally, a Japan Agricultural Standard program certifies the traceability of imported beef. Japan implemented animal traceability regulations in response to food safety crises, including the Beef Traceability Law. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) introduced the Japan Agricultural Standard (JAS) program to certify the traceability of imported beef. Exporters must provide detailed information such as date of birth, breed, and slaughter date, along with feed and pharmaceutical details. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) for domestically produced beef, tracking each animal from birth to consumer. In South Korea, the Beef Traceability System (BTS) tracks individual animals from birth to consumer, providing detailed information such as sex, breed, quality grade, location of birth, owner's information, feed, medications, slaughter date, inspection date, and processing location. The government plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand lacks a national animal ID system but established the Animal Identification and Traceability Working Group in 2004 to address this issue. New Zealand established the Animal Identification and Traceability Working Group in 2004 to improve animal traceability. The National Animal Identification and Tracing (NAIT) system is still under development as of early 2009, focusing on traceability for cattle and deer populations. The current systems in place only provide traceability at herd levels, leaving gaps at the national level. The current animal ID systems in New Zealand focus on traceability for cattle and deer populations, with gaps at the national level. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to consider adding other species to the NAIT system once it is established for cattle and deer. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is considering expanding the National Animal Identification and Tracing (NAIT) system to include other species once it is established for cattle and deer. The country currently has the Livestock Improvement Corporation's MINDA system for herd management and the National Bovine Tuberculosis Identification Program (NBTIP) for animal traceability. Additionally, there are other voluntary traceability databases available for producers. Brazil implemented the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV, now ERAS) in 2001 for farm-level identification. Brazil implemented the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV, now ERAS) in 2001 as a farm-level identification system for cattle. Initially intended as mandatory, SISBOV remains voluntary, focusing on premises supplying slaughterhouses for foreign markets like the EU. SISBOV is a voluntary program for premises supplying slaughterhouses for foreign markets like the EU, which requires strict identification and traceability criteria. The EU has found severe shortcomings in Brazil's system, leading to a near-total ban on beef imports in 2008. The EU imposed a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil in 2008 due to severe shortcomings in Brazil's animal identification and traceability system. A report released in 2009 suggested that the situation in Brazil was deteriorating, raising concerns about the lack of robust information and the potential risk of foot-and-mouth disease entering the EU from Brazil. Argentina established a limited mandatory system of animal identification and traceability in 2003, directed at animal products destined for the EU, but operates primarily for identifying cattle. Argentina implemented a mandatory cattle identification program in 2003, focusing on exports to the EU. The system tracks cattle movements and exposure to diseases like foot-and-mouth disease. However, the entire beef herd is not expected to be tagged until 2017. Argentina's beef exports to the US are limited to thermo-processed beef due to disease control issues. Argentina implemented a mandatory cattle identification program in 2003 for EU exports, focusing on tracking cattle movements and disease exposure. Beef exports to the US are limited to thermo-processed beef due to disease control issues. Uruguay heavily relies on foreign markets for beef sales, with 68% of production sold abroad from 2004-2008. Uruguay implemented a national animal identification system in late 2006 to meet foreign buyer demands. Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in late 2006. All individual animals must be tagged before six months of age or before being transported. The government aims to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010, with traceability extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. Uruguay's National Livestock Information System (SNIG) aims to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010. Traceability will be extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. SNIG includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. The government currently covers the cost of ID tags but plans to shift this expense to producers in the future. The Uruguayan government plans to mandate further traceability for consumers by shifting the cost of ID tags to producers. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have animal ID programs due to large agrarian populations, lack of technology, and limited distribution chains for animal products. Lower-income consumers in poorer countries may not be financially able to be selective in their choice of animal products. In poorer countries, consumers may not afford to be selective in choosing animal products, leading to a lack of willingness to pay extra for traceable food."
