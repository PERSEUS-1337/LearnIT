The Senate applies regulations based on various parliamentary authorities and principles, including deriving procedures from multiple sources, having the power to make its own rules, initiating enforcement of rules, conducting business by unanimous consent, following precedents, and adhering to informal practices. The Senate follows various sources for its parliamentary procedures, including rules, standing orders, precedents, statutory provisions, committee rules, party conference rules, procedural agreements, and informal practices. These sources are essential for understanding Senate procedure, such as the recognition process outlined in Rule XIX. The Senate's standing rules dictate that the presiding officer must recognize the Senator who first addresses him. However, precedence is given to the majority and minority leaders, as well as the majority and minority managers, in that order when multiple Senators seek recognition simultaneously. This practice allows the majority leader to propose debate-ending motions or amendments. Understanding this Senate practice is crucial for comprehending how the Senate conducts its business, as outlined in Article I of the Constitution. The Senate has the authority to determine its rules of procedure, which includes creating new rules or amending existing ones. This rulemaking power extends to standing orders and rulemaking provisions in statutes. Additionally, the Senate can decide when its rules should not apply. The Senate can waive its rules by unanimous consent or suspend them by a two-thirds vote. Unlike the House, the Senate cannot supersede its rules by majority vote but can set them aside by overruling the presiding officer or not sustaining a point of order. The Senate can set aside its rules by overruling the presiding officer or not sustaining a point of order, establishing a precedent for future rulings.

Any Senator can appeal the ruling, and the Senate can decide by majority vote to uphold or overturn it, setting a precedent for future rulings. Some rulemaking statutes may require a supermajority vote. When a point of order is raised in the Senate, the presiding officer makes a ruling without debate.

These agreements have the same authority as the Senate's standing rules and can change rules and precedents. Senator objects to UC agreements having the same authority as Senate rules, which can only be altered by unanimous consent. Senate precedents are crucial for interpreting rules and guiding proceedings, similar to case law in court. The Senate's standing rules are brief, so precedents play a crucial role in determining proceedings. Precedents, similar to case law, are cited by Senators and the presiding officer to support arguments, defend against points of order, or appeal rulings. These precedents influence how current Senate rules are applied by connecting past decisions to the specific case at hand. Most precedents are established when the Senate votes on questions of order or when the presiding officer submits a point of order to the body. Precedents in the Senate are crucial for determining proceedings, similar to case law. They are established through Senate votes on questions of order or rulings by the presiding officer.
