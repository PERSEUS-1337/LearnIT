    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS employees hired before 1984 do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS employees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but only FERS employees receive employer matching contributions. CSRS and FERS are not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which governs private sector retirement plans. ERISA does not apply to CSRS and FERS plans for federal employees, which means that certain rights and protections for spouses and former spouses in private-sector plans, such as joint and survivor annuities and qualified domestic relations orders, do not automatically apply. In defined contribution plans, written consent from both spouses is required to name a beneficiary other than the spouse in case of the participant's death. Federal employees' retirement benefits are governed by Title 5 of the United States Code, which establishes rights for spouses similar to those under ERISA. Both ERISA and Title 5 require a joint and survivor annuity as the default form of benefit, with written consent needed to waive the survivor annuity. Title 5, like ERISA, mandates a joint and survivor annuity as the default benefit under CSRS and FERS, requiring written consent to waive it. While both laws allow pension division in divorce, ERISA permits payments to the former spouse upon the plan participant's earliest retirement age, whereas Title 5 prohibits any payments until the federal employee separates from service. Title 5 prohibits payment of any part of a CSRS or FERS annuity to a former spouse until the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible to receive an annuity, and has applied for it. ERISA requires spousal consent for naming beneficiaries in defined contribution plans, while federal regulations allow Thrift Savings Plan participants to name anyone as beneficiary without spousal consent. Federal regulations for the Thrift Savings Plan allow participants to name any beneficiary without spousal consent in case of death. A state court decree can award a former spouse of a federal employee a share of retirement annuity or survivor annuity. The court order must specify both benefits for the former spouse to receive them. CSRS retirement annuity is generally exempt from state court proceedings, but a former spouse can be awarded a share according to Title 5. OPM will divide the retired employee's monthly annuity as directed by a court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. Payments will only be divided after OPM receives the court order. The right of a former spouse to receive a share of a retired federal employee's retirement annuity ends when the retired employee separates from federal service, is eligible for an annuity, and applies for it. A former spouse's right to receive a share of a retired federal employee's annuity ends when the employee separates from service, is eligible for an annuity, and applies for it. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must elect it or a court order must specify it. A CSRS survivor annuity is 55% of the single-life annuity, funded by reducing the retiree's pension. A survivor annuity under CSRS is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity. The annuity is funded by reducing the retiree's pension by 2.5% of the first $3,600 plus 10% of the annuity above that amount. The total amount of survivor annuities paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 55% of the retiree's single-life annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded a survivor annuity, the current spouse is not entitled to receive one unless the former spouse dies or remarries before the age of 55. If a survivor annuity has been awarded to a former spouse through a court order, the employee's current spouse is not entitled to receive a survivor annuity unless the former spouse has died or remarried before the age of 55. An exception exists for remarriages lasting at least 30 years after January 1, 1995. The annuity restarts in the same amount if the remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment. Any modifications to the survivor annuity must be made before the employee retires or dies. If a survivor annuity is awarded to a former spouse through a court order, the employee's current spouse is not entitled to receive it unless the former spouse dies or remarries before the age of 55. The annuity restarts in the same amount if the remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment. An employee's election or court order for a survivor annuity can only be modified before retirement or death. OPM will not honor a court order for a survivor annuity if the former spouse waived their right to it. Refunding contributions forfeits the right to a CSRS annuity, and state courts can block refunds if a former spouse is entitled to a share of the annuity. FERS is generally exempt from state court proceedings, but a FERS annuity can be divided between a federal annuitant and a former spouse under certain circumstances. OPM will divide a retired federal employee's monthly annuity as directed by a state court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, paying the specified share to the former spouse. This division only occurs after the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible for an annuity, and has applied for it. The former spouse's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retiree's death. The former spouse's right to receive a share of a retired federal employee's annuity ends upon the retiree's death. A survivor annuity for a former spouse can be elected by the retiree or specified in a court order. Section 8445 of Title 5 allows a federal employee to elect a FERS survivor annuity for a former spouse. This annuity is equal to 50% of the single-life annuity the retired worker would have received, funded by a 10% reduction in the retiree's annuity amount. A survivor annuity under FERS is equal to 50% of the single-life annuity to which the retired worker would have been entitled, funded by a 10% reduction in the retiree's annuity amount. An employee may provide for no more than one FERS spouse survivor annuity, and the total amount paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 50% of the single-life annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded a survivor annuity, the current spouse is not entitled to receive one unless the former spouse has died or remarried before the age of 55. If a former spouse has been awarded a survivor annuity, the current spouse is not entitled to receive one unless the former spouse has died or remarried before the age of 55. A survivor annuity terminates when the spouse or former spouse dies or remarries before the age of 55, with exceptions for remarriages lasting at least 30 years. An election or court order for a FERS survivor annuity can only be modified before the employee retires or dies. If a former spouse has been awarded a survivor annuity, the current spouse is not entitled to receive one unless the former spouse has died or remarried before the age of 55. An annuity restarts in the same amount after divorce or annulment. A court order awarding a survivor annuity to a former spouse can be modified before the employee retires or dies. If an employee dies after completing at least 18 months but fewer than 10 years of service, the spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit. This benefit may be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse as per a state court order. If an employee dies after completing at least 10 years of service, the surviving spouse (or former spouse, pursuant to a court order) receives a lump sum and an annuity equal to 50% of the annuity that the employee had earned at the time of his or her death. A separating employee who elects to receive a refund of contributions to the retirement system forfeits the right to receive a FERS annuity. A state court can block this refund if a former spouse has been awarded a share of the employee's FERS retirement annuity or a FERS survivor annuity. An employee or former employee can designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries who will receive his or her TSP account balance in the event of the participant's death. A participant can designate beneficiaries for their TSP account balance by filing Form TSP-3 with the Thrift Board. Spouse consent is not required for beneficiary designation or receiving a loan from the TSP account for married FERS participants. CSRS participants do not need spousal consent for TSP transactions, but the spouse will be notified. For married FERS participants, spouse consent is not required for beneficiary designation or receiving a loan from the TSP account. However, the spouse will be notified before a loan is approved or in the event of a withdrawal. The spouse of a married FERS participant is entitled to a joint and survivor annuity with a 50% survivor benefit from the TSP, but must waive this right in writing before the participant can withdraw money. The TSP can recognize state court orders related to divorce, annulment, legal separation, property settlements, alimony, and child support. The TSP can recognize state court orders related to divorce, legal separation, alimony, and child support. Former spouses of FERS participants may be eligible for Social Security benefits if married for at least 10 years. Remarriage can affect the eligibility for survivor benefits. Survivor benefits for divorced spouses can be received if the marriage lasted at least 10 years. Remarriage before age 60 can terminate these benefits unless the subsequent marriage ends. Children of a deceased worker can still receive Social Security survivor benefits regardless of the remarriage status of the surviving spouse."
