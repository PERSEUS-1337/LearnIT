    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia Recognition Act\". The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia, recognized by Congress, are descendants of the original Creek Indian Nation and signatories of the 1832 Treaty of Washington. The tribe consists of over 2,500 members residing close to their ancestral homeland in Georgia. The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia, with over 2,500 eligible members, chose not to be removed under the 1832 Treaty of Washington. They continue to operate as a sovereign tribe with a tribal government and traditional decision-making processes. In 1972, the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia petitioned for Federal recognition but lacked necessary historical information. The petition was denied in 1981 despite recognition from the Federal Government, the State of Georgia, and local governments. Despite the denial of the petition in 1981, the political leaders of the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia have been recognized by the Federal Government, the government of the State of Georgia, and local governments as leaders of a distinct political entity. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"member\" refers to an enrolled member of the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia or an individual placed on the membership rolls. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"Tribe\" refers to the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia. SEC. 4. FEDERAL RECOGNITION. Federal recognition is extended to the Tribe, making them eligible for all Federal benefits and services available to federally recognized Indian tribes. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 is applicable to the Tribe and its members. The Tribe can transfer land to the Secretary within 2 years for trust, establishing it as the initial reservation land. Gaming is prohibited on the trust land. Additionally, a base membership roll is established for the Tribe. The Tribe must submit a membership roll to the Secretary within 120 days of the Act's enactment, based on the Tribe's Constitution. Future membership is limited to lineal descendants of those on the base roll who maintain political relations with the Tribe.
