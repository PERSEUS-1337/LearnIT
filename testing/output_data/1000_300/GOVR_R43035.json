General Khin Kyunt announced a roadmap to a \"disciplined democracy\" in Burma, with the transfer of power to the Union Government completing steps towards a modern, developed, and democratic nation. The SPDC in Burma completed the transfer of power to the Union Government on March 30, 2011, moving towards a \"disciplined democracy.\" President Thein Sein acknowledges the ongoing democratization process but lacks clarity on what a disciplined democracy entails. Key debates include civilian control over the military and the Tatmadaw's special powers. Key elements of a future democratic Burma are under debate, including civilian control over the military, the balance of power between branches of government, and citizenship conditions. The power balance between appointed Ministers and the Union Parliament, selection of President and Vice Presidents, citizenship conditions, rights of Rohingyas, civil liberties restrictions, and the opaque nature of the military's role in Burma are key concerns in the debate on democratic reforms. The relationship between the military and Union Government in Burma is opaque, with many cabinet ministers being current or past military officers. Their support for political reform may be limited, as indicated by their actions or inactions. As of March 2013, 18 out of 30 cabinet ministers in Burma were current or past military officers. Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hliang has not publicly confirmed ordering his troops to cease military operations against the KIO/KIA despite President Thein Sein's instructions. The reassignment of top military personnel and replacement of military-appointed members of the Union Parliament suggest political intentions and efforts to tighten discipline within the military's selected representatives. Relations between the military and the Union Parliament remain a critical issue. The Union Parliament, after the NLD's success in by-elections, aimed to enforce discipline among military representatives. Tensions between the military and Parliament arose over the military budget size and land seizures. The military's confiscation of 247,000 acres of land led to recommendations for return by a parliamentary commission. The military in Burma confiscated over 247,000 acres of land between July 2012 and January 2013, leading to recommendations for return by a parliamentary commission. The military's pervasive presence in the country's economy, with regional commanders benefiting economically from their political power, remains an unresolved issue. Various major corporations in lucrative sectors are allegedly owned by the military or senior officers. The military in Burma controls major corporations in lucrative sectors like mining, oil, and gas, through entities like UMEHL and MEC. These companies provide the military with independent revenue and economic control. The Tatmadaw controls major banks in Burma, providing independent revenue and economic control. The military has been involved in a civil war since 1948, citing the failure of the government to protect national integrity as a reason for the 1962 coup. Senior military officers believe the Tatmadaw is responsible for preserving Burma's current form. The Burmese military, known as the Tatmadaw, has been crucial in maintaining Burma's current form for the past 60 years. The 2008 Constitution designates the military as the main entity responsible for safeguarding the country's unity and sovereignty. The government has proposed a three-step peace process to end the civil war and reconcile with ethnic organizations opposing the current government structure. This includes negotiating ceasefire agreements and broader agreements on political and economic development with these groups. The Union Government's proposed three-step peace process aims to negotiate ceasefire agreements with ethnic organizations, followed by broader agreements on political and economic development. The final step involves negotiating a national agreement to amend the 2008 Constitution. Former Railway Minister Aung Min is a key negotiator in these talks. The Union Government has established a \"peace committee\" with a central committee headed by President Thein Sein and a working committee led by Vice-President Sai Mauk Kham. Former Railway Minister Aung Min is the lead negotiator in talks with ethnic organizations. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) has proposed an alternative path to national reconciliation involving direct negotiations with the Union Government, followed by a national conference and a national convention to negotiate a \"national accord\" for a federal union of Burma. The UNFC proposal does not assume the preservation of the 2008 Constitution or the disbanding of militias. The UNFC has appointed a negotiating team and held talks with the Union Government and various ethnic organizations. Ceasefire agreements have been reached with 13 out of 21 groups, excluding the KIO/KIA. Informal talks in China resulted in an agreement for future discussions, but none have completed the Union Government's peace process. The Union Government held talks in Ruili, China in February 2013, agreeing to future discussions. However, no negotiations have completed the peace process's second step. Key issues include power distribution between the central government and ethnic States, and the need for Tatmadaw approval for national reconciliation. The Burmese military's absence in negotiations and reports of attacks on ethnic militias pose challenges. The peace process in Myanmar faces challenges as the central government seeks national reconciliation with ethnic groups. The Burmese military's absence in negotiations and attacks on ethnic militias raise doubts about their support. The Union Government aims to incorporate ethnic organizations into the current governance system, while major ethnic groups prefer equal talks without assumptions. The future of the 2008 Constitution is crucial for national reconciliation in Myanmar. Many opposition parties and ethnic organizations did not participate in its drafting, viewing it as a tool to maintain military power. Public access to the Constitution was limited, raising concerns about its legitimacy. The 2008 Constitution in Myanmar was drafted by the SPDC to protect the military's power. Public access to the Constitution was limited, and the 2008 referendum results are seen as fraudulent. The parliamentary elections in 2010 were not considered free or fair, questioning the legitimacy of the Union Government and Parliament. President Thein Sein is open to limited amendments to the Constitution, including changes to the privileged status of the Tatmadaw. President Thein Sein and opposition parties, including Aung San Suu Kyi's NLD, are open to limited amendments to the 2008 Constitution in Myanmar. The Tatmadaw is also willing to consider changes that do not fundamentally alter their special status. The NLD seeks to modify provisions that prevent Aung San Suu Kyi from becoming President after the 2015 elections. The NLD and other opposition parties in Myanmar are willing to amend the 2008 Constitution to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to become President after the 2015 elections. However, ethnic organizations are reluctant to accept the current constitution and prefer direct negotiations with the government and military for a new constitution. The process to amend the constitution may be too difficult to implement a negotiated agreement. The 2008 Constitution outlines the process for amending it, requiring support from at least 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption. Certain sections also need approval from over 50% of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum. This could pose challenges for negotiating agreements due to the arduous requirements. The 2008 Constitution requires support from at least 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% for adoption. Certain sections also need approval from over 50% of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum, including provisions related to the structure of the government, military's role, state of emergency, eligibility for President, and amending the Constitution. Amendments must also obtain support from military appointees in the Union Parliament, indirectly requiring the support of the Tatmadaw. The 2008 Constitution requires support from a portion of military appointees in the Union Parliament for any amendment, indirectly needing the Tatmadaw's support. It is uncertain if an amendment acceptable to the military will satisfy ethnic organizations. Approval by over 50% of eligible voters could be a challenge, as voter turnout has been low in the past. The 113th Congress may play a more active role in U.S. policy towards Burma during this potential political transition. Critics argue that the Obama Administration has moved too quickly in relaxing sanctions and forming close ties with Burma. The 112th Congress passed laws and bills related to Burma, with critics divided on the Obama Administration's approach towards the country. Congress may assess U.S. policy towards Burma and take appropriate action based on their evaluation. The 112th Congress passed laws and bills related to Burma, with critics divided on the Obama Administration's approach towards the country. Five laws were passed, mostly extending or reiterating sanctions on Burma. 28 bills were introduced but saw little further action. Six hearings were held, including ambassadorial nomination hearings and discussions on U.S. policy in Burma. Three of the new laws extended the general import ban from the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Three new laws were passed by the 112th Congress related to Burma, extending sanctions and prohibiting the use of funds for military training involving child soldiers. The 112th Congress passed three new laws related to Burma, extending sanctions and prohibiting the use of funds for military training involving child soldiers. P.L. 109-163, P.L. 112-74, and P.L. 112-192 imposed restrictions on direct commercial sales of military equipment, peacekeeping operations, and international assistance to Burma. The 112th Congress passed laws related to Burma, extending sanctions and prohibiting funds for military training involving child soldiers. The U.S. Executive Director can vote for assistance for Burma at international financial institutions if deemed in the national interest. Consultation with congressional committees is required before such a determination. Over 20 bills related to Burma were introduced in the 112th Congress. During the 112th Congress, over 20 bills related to Burma were introduced, with only five becoming law. Congressional committees were consulted on assistance to Burma by international financial institutions, with a focus on national interests. Additionally, a Congressional Gold Medal was presented to Aung San Suu Kyi, and six hearings on Burma were held by the House and Senate Committees on Foreign Affairs. During the 112th Congress, several hearings were held by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations regarding Burma. These hearings included discussions on the implementation of various acts related to religious freedom, democracy, and human rights in Asia, as well as nomination hearings for Derek J. Mitchell for positions in Burma. During the 113th Congress, hearings were held to consider U.S. policy towards Burma, including Derek J. Mitchell's nominations for Special Representative and Ambassador. Congress may investigate the Obama Administration's approach and consider adjusting policy in response to changing circumstances. The 113th Congress held hearings to review U.S. policy towards Burma, including nominations for Special Representative and Ambassador. Congress may adjust policy based on changing circumstances and oversee funding for assistance programs in Burma. Congressional oversight is a long-standing authority to ensure the Administration implements federal laws faithfully. The 113th Congress conducted hearings on U.S. policy towards Burma and may continue oversight activities to examine the Obama Administration's approach. Key aspects for consideration include changes in the political situation in Burma and the implementation of existing laws. The 113th Congress is reviewing U.S. policy towards Burma, focusing on changes in the political situation and the implementation of existing laws. Key questions include the pace of sanctions easing, the Obama Administration's relationship with Burmese officials, and acceptance of the Union Government and Parliament as legitimate. The U.S. government may need to decide between a reactive or proactive approach towards Burma. The 113th Congress is reviewing U.S. policy towards Burma, focusing on changes in the political situation and the implementation of existing laws. Key questions include the legitimacy of the Union Government and Parliament, the 2008 Constitution, the Obama Administration's approach towards fostering reforms, the Burmese military's stance on political reform, reestablishing military-to-military relations, relations with ethnic groups and militias, and the general framework of U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration's view on ethnic groups and militias in Burma is being questioned by Congress. Specific issues include the Administration's intentions regarding the Special Representative for Burma, the maintenance of lists of Burmese nationals subject to sanctions, and the submission of required reports to Congress. The 113th Congress is reviewing U.S. policy towards Burma, focusing on political changes and the implementation of existing laws. Key questions include the legitimacy of the Union Government, the 2008 Constitution, fostering reforms, and military relations. The Obama Administration's stance on ethnic groups and militias in Burma is under scrutiny by Congress. Key issues include the appointment of a Special Representative for Burma, maintaining lists of sanctioned Burmese nationals, and submitting required reports to Congress. The 2008 JADE Act mandates the appointment of a Special Representative with ambassador rank, who cannot hold another executive branch position concurrently. The Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 allows for temporary appointments for positions requiring Senate confirmation, with a time limit of 210 days in most cases. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell served as Special Representative for Burma before becoming U.S. Ambassador to Burma. Deputy Special Representative W. Patrick Murphy took over as acting Special Representative. The Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 allows temporary appointments for Senate-confirmed positions for up to 210 days, with exceptions for pending nominations. Murphy's temporary appointment as Special Representative for Burma has exceeded the time limit. Congress may inquire about the Obama Administration's nomination plans. Implementation issues include compiling lists of Burmese individuals and entities subject to sanctions under existing laws. The Department of State is responsible for maintaining lists of Burmese individuals and entities subject to sanctions under various laws and executive orders, which prohibit the issuance of entry visas to certain Burmese nationals unless deemed in the national interest of the United States. The Department of State maintains lists of Burmese nationals prohibited from receiving entry visas under various laws and executive orders, including financial sanctions freezing assets and banning financial services for certain individuals. The Treasury Secretary administers these sanctions in accordance with relevant laws and presidential EOs. The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act requires the Secretaries of State and the Treasury to enforce sanctions on potential individuals. Human rights organizations criticize the lack of enforcement of visa bans and financial sanctions. The State Department has not publicly disclosed the names on its visa ban list, raising compliance concerns. Burmese government officials have visited the US without clarity on sanctions enforcement. Several Burmese government officials have visited the United States in the past two years, potentially violating sanctions under the 2003 BFDA and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act. It is unclear if the required presidential determination to Congress was provided. The Treasury Department delegates the responsibility of maintaining the list of sanctioned Burmese individuals to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). However, human rights organizations note that the current SDN list does not include many Burmese individuals subject to sanctions. The SDN list, a compilation of individuals, groups, companies subject to Treasury sanctions, lacks many Burmese nationals and companies. Criticism also surrounds the delivery of mandated reports to Congress, with some reports not meeting deadlines. The delivery of mandated reports to Congress regarding Burmese sanction laws has been criticized for not meeting deadlines and lacking detail. Existing sanctions on Burma remain in effect until certain conditions are met or Congress acts to terminate them. President Obama has waived some sanctions on Burma, but the authority to impose them remains, allowing for sanctions to be resumed at any time. The current extension of the general import ban in Section 3(a) of the 2003 BFDA ends on July 25, 2013. President Obama has used existing authority to waive some sanctions on Burma, but the authority to impose sanctions remains. The 113th Congress may consider extending the import ban or altering U.S. policy towards Burma. The 113th Congress may consider legislation to alter U.S. policy towards Burma, including imposing or re-imposing sanctions, clarifying conditions for sanction termination, and providing guidance on policy conduct. Funding levels for assistance programs in Burma proposed by the Obama Administration will also be reviewed. The 113th Congress will review funding levels for assistance programs in Burma proposed by the Obama Administration, including aid for landmine victims, English language training, academic exchange programs, and democracy initiatives. The reopening of the USAID mission in Rangoon and plans for expansion will require additional federal funding, which may be affected by budget constraints like sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent amendments require across-the-board cuts in funding for programs in Burma, including those for landmine victims, English language training, academic exchange programs, and democracy initiatives. Sequestration allows for reprogramming of funds by the Department of State and USAID, but uncertainty over country allocations makes it difficult to calculate post-sequestration funding levels for Burma. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates cuts in funding for programs in Burma, including landmine victims, English training, and democracy initiatives. Uncertainty over country allocations hinders calculating post-sequestration funding levels. Reprogramming funds is allowed, with a possible 5% reduction from FY2012 estimates. The Department of State will determine allocations after Congress passes FY2013 funding legislation. U.S. policy may influence Burma's future amid significant political and economic changes leading up to the 2015 elections. The 113th Congress may play a role in influencing Burma's future as it transitions to a civilian democratic government. U.S. policy towards Burma during this critical period could impact the nation's path towards democracy and human rights protection. Appendices provide maps, chronology of events, and required reports to Congress on Burma. The table below summarizes major events in Burma and U.S. policy developments since the Obama Administration's new approach. Various laws require reports to Congress on Burma, detailing topics, responsible agencies, frequency, deadline, and mode of delivery."
