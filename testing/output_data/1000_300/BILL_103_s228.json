    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that 90 million Americans ride bicycles, with 20 million riding more than once a week. Between 1984 and 1988, 2,985 bicyclists in the United States died from head injuries, and 905,752 suffered head injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms. 41 percent of bicycle-related head injury deaths and 76 percent of injuries occurred among American children under age 15. Deaths and injuries from bicycle accidents cost society $7.6 billion annually, with a child's head injury costing $4.5 million over their lifetime. Universal use of bicycle helmets in the US would have prevented 2,600 deaths and 757,000 injuries. Only 5 percent of children in the nation who ride bicycles. Between 1984 and 1988, 2,985 bicyclists in the United States died from head injuries, with 41 percent of deaths and 76 percent of injuries occurring among children under age 15. The cost of deaths and injuries from bicycle accidents is $7.6 billion annually, with a child's head injury costing $4.5 million over their lifetime. Universal use of bicycle helmets in the US would have prevented 2,600 deaths and 757,000 injuries, yet only 5 percent of children in the nation who ride bicycles wear helmets. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can provide grants to states, political subdivisions, and nonprofit organizations to promote bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16. Grantees have flexibility in designing effective programs. Grants can be used to enforce laws on bicycle helmet use, assist in acquiring helmets, educate on helmet importance for safety, or a combination of these activities. Bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after enactment must conform to interim standards like ANSI Z90.4-1984 and Snell B-90, until a final standard is established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 60 days. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must establish a final standard for bicycle helmet safety within 60 days of the Act's enactment. This standard should include provisions to prevent helmets from coming off, address injury risks to children, and incorporate additional necessary provisions. The final standard for bicycle helmet safety must be established within 60 days of the Act's enactment, including provisions to prevent helmets from coming off and address injury risks to children. Sections 7, 9, and 11 of the Consumer Product Safety Act do not apply to the proceeding, and any helmet not conforming to the interim standard will be considered in violation of a safety standard. The final standard will take effect one year from issuance. Authorization of appropriations for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration grant program: $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996. Definition of \"approved bicycle helmet\" includes meeting interim and final safety standards."
