    "content": "Federal inspectors general (IGs) have substantial independence and powers to combat waste, fraud, and abuse within federal departments and agencies. Offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct audits, investigations, and in some cases, employees have law enforcement authority. This includes carrying a firearm, making arrests without a warrant, and executing warrants for arrest, search, or seizure of evidence. Law enforcement authority is deemed essential for certain OIG missions, especially when investigations pose safety risks. Some OIGs have law enforcement authority for missions that pose safety risks. The report lists statutes and regulations granting this authority and resources supporting its necessity. Agencies may publicly detail their need for law enforcement authority, such as the SSA's OIG in 2012. The SSA's OIG and USDA's OIG have addressed concerns about their weapons procurement by explaining the necessity of acquiring standard issue ammunition for law enforcement purposes. This includes using the ammunition for mandatory firearms qualifications and training sessions to ensure agent and public safety. The USDA's OIG addressed inquiries about weapons procurement, stating the need for standard issue ammunition for law enforcement purposes. This included replacing automatic firearms with semi-automatic ones to ensure agent and public safety. The OIG's criminal investigation responsibilities have led to numerous indictments, convictions, and monetary results. The USDA's OIG conducts extensive investigations, resulting in over 2,000 indictments, 1,350 convictions, and $460 million in monetary results from 2012 to 2014. OIG Special Agents are authorized to make arrests, carry firearms, and conduct undercover operations for criminal activities such as fraud, theft, bribery, smuggling, and assaults against USDA employees. The USDA's OIG conducts investigations on criminal activities such as fraud, theft, bribery, smuggling, and assaults against USDA employees. OIG special agents can be vested with law enforcement authority through various means outlined in the IG Act of 1978. The OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority pursuant to the IG Act of 1978 or other statutes, with the Attorney General authorized to delegate such powers under certain conditions. The Attorney General has vested law enforcement authority in OIGs within 10 agencies listed below, with guidelines governing the use of these powers. The Attorney General authorized guidelines for OIGs' law enforcement powers, including training requirements and adherence to DOJ's deadly force policy. The Department of Justice's guidelines require OIGs with law enforcement authority to undergo periodic training in various legal and investigative procedures. They must also follow DOJ policies, consult before using electronic surveillance, and obtain approval for undercover investigations. Additionally, some OIGs have law enforcement authority through laws outside the IG Act. The Bureau of Justice Statistics maintains data on federal employees authorized to carry firearms. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics maintains a Census on Federal Law Enforcement Officers, including data on the number of federal employees authorized to carry firearms. A report from September 2008 shows that 33 OIGs had a total of 3,501 agents authorized to carry firearms, with no reported assaults or injuries to law enforcement officers within an OIG in 2008."
