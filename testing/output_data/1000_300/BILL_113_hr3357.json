    "content": "The \"Early Childhood Education Professional Improvement Act of 2013\" aims to enhance the qualifications and professional development of early childhood educators in various programs. This includes Head Start Programs, state-funded prekindergarten programs, licensed child care for prekindergarten children, and special education preschools. The Act also authorizes a program to provide assistance to states for improving early childhood education. The Secretary of Education, with input from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, can grant funds to States for implementing activities outlined in section 6. Each State must submit an application to the Secretary of Education for a grant under this Act, including details of their early childhood professional development system developed in collaboration with various stakeholders. The State must designate an agency to administer the grant program and describe how their system provides oversight, professional standards, career advancement opportunities, coordination with higher education institutions, and encouragement of articulation agreements. The State agency administering the grant program must coordinate with higher education institutions, accrediting bodies, and two- and four-year colleges. They should encourage articulation agreements, offer accessible college courses for working learners, and support adult learners from diverse backgrounds. The State agency administering the grant program must coordinate with higher education institutions, accrediting bodies, and colleges to provide accessible college courses for working learners and support adult learners from diverse backgrounds, including dual language learners, low-income, and minority communities. Additionally, workforce data should be used to assess the State's workforce needs, and financing should be considered over time. The State must use funds in accordance with Section 6. A State receiving a grant under this Act must use the funds for scholarships covering tuition, fees, materials, and support for preschool teachers pursuing a bachelor's degree in early childhood education. Additionally, funds can be used to help teachers with a degree in another field obtain credentials in early childhood education and increase compensation for teachers working towards a degree in early childhood education. To support early childhood education, funds from the grant can be used for scholarships for preschool teachers pursuing a degree in the field, increasing compensation for teachers working towards a degree, and providing professional development opportunities addressing child development, teacher-child interaction, family engagement, and cultural competence. The grant funds can be used for scholarships, increasing teacher compensation, and professional development in areas such as child development, teacher-child interaction, family engagement, and cultural competence for working with diverse children and families. Grant funds provided under this Act must supplement, not replace, other available Federal, State, and local funds for early childhood educator preparation and professional development. States receiving funds must maintain or increase their fiscal effort for supported activities each year. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2019 to carry out this Act."
