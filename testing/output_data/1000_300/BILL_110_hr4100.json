    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Instructional Level Assessment Pilot Program. This program aims to assess students' instructional levels. The Secretary will award grants to up to ten State educational agencies for pilot programs to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency and provide quality instruction. Grants will be for a 3-year period. States must apply for the grant and meet eligibility criteria set by the Secretary. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application as prescribed by the Secretary. The State should not need intervention in implementing requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, have implemented alternate assessments, and identify at least 5 local education agencies for participation in the pilot program. The agency has identified 5 local education agencies for a pilot program, providing guidance on student selection, assessment tools, and data collection. Participating agencies must have implemented a response to intervention approach to ensure quality instruction for all students. The pilot program requires participating local education agencies to implement a response to intervention approach to ensure quality instruction for all students and establish monitoring and oversight processes for student identification. The pilot program requires participating local education agencies to limit student participation to 0.5% of the total population, ensure the student's IEP Team determines the appropriate assessment, and provide data-driven instruction for all participating students. The pilot program mandates that students receive quality instruction in the subject areas to be assessed, with the IEP Team examining various data sources to determine if a student is significantly below grade level in reading or math. The pilot program requires quality instruction in assessed subjects, with the IEP Team assessing if a student is significantly below grade level in reading or math. Assessments must be scientifically valid and reliable, leading to targeted interventions to address identified gaps in instructional and grade-level knowledge. The pilot program focuses on interventions to remediate gaps in student's instructional knowledge. Data from instructional assessments cannot determine proficiency levels or school progress. Local education agencies will compile reports on student progress. The pilot program requires local education agencies to compile reports on student progress, including instructional level proficiency and progress towards grade level proficiency. State education agencies must submit annual reports to the Secretary detailing the number of students in the pilot and progress towards closing proficiency gaps. Data collected will be used by the Secretary for evaluation purposes. The pilot program requires local education agencies to compile reports on student progress, including instructional level proficiency and progress towards grade level proficiency. Data collected will be used by the Secretary to inform a report to Congress on the number of students in the pilot and changes in proficiency levels before and after participation. $5,000,000 is authorized for grants under this program for fiscal year 2008."
