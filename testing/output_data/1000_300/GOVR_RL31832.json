    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. Several pieces of legislation in the 110th Congress addressed penalties, enforcement, diversion of goods, and integration of export control data. The EAA controls sensitive dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications, including those that can contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. The EAA has been periodically reauthorized since its original expiration in 1989, with the last extension expiring in August 2001. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), originally expired in 1989, has been periodically reauthorized, with the last extension expiring in August 2001. The export licensing system under the EAA is continued through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The EAA regulates exports of dual-use items with military applications, administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce. The Export Administration Act (EAA) regulates exports of dual-use items with military applications. There are differing views on the need to liberalize U.S. export regulations to allow American companies to compete internationally for high-technology goods. Some argue for tighter controls due to foreign threats to U.S. national security. The Export Administration Act regulates exports of dual-use items with military applications. Some argue for tighter controls due to foreign threats to U.S. national security, while others advocate for liberalization of export controls. The report discusses the evolution of the act, types of controls authorized, export licensing procedures, and issues concerning the maintenance of export controls. It also highlights controlled commodities and debates on technology control, multilateral regimes, and the organization of the export control system. Export controls have been a part of U.S. policy for almost a century, with a shift towards peacetime regulations after WWII. The Export Control Act of 1949 was enacted in response to the new security threats, focusing on the Soviet-Bloc countries. The Act outlined reasons for imposing export controls, including preventing short-supply situations. The Export Control Act of 1949 (P.L. 81-11) established a peacetime export control system to address security threats. It identified three reasons for imposing export controls: short-supply, foreign policy, and national security controls. These controls encompass issues such as regional stability, human rights, anti-terrorism, missile technology, and chemical and biological warfare. National security controls aim to restrict exports that could enhance the military capability of countries threatening U.S. national security. The Export Control Act of 1949 established security controls to restrict the export of goods and technology that could enhance the military capability of countries posing a threat to US national security. CoCom was established in 1949 to coordinate multilateral export controls with NATO allies, reflecting a high level of restrictions. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 to coordinate export controls with NATO allies. The Export Control Act of 1949 was renewed multiple times with little change until the 1960s when a reexamination and revision occurred due to the U.S.-Soviet era of \"detente.\" The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act, leading to a shift towards less restrictive export controls. This trend continued with the renewal of the act in 1974 and 1977. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to less restrictive export controls. The act was rewritten in 1979 and amended in 1985, with some further liberalization. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 marked a shift in U.S. external threats. The export control system has been streamlined since the George H.W. Bush Administration, with calls for revamping to enhance exports or focus on current national security threats. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to less restrictive export controls. The system has been streamlined since the George H.W. Bush Administration, with calls for revamping to enhance exports or focus on current national security threats. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 significantly changed the export control environment, raising questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives. Congress has not been able to agree on measures to reform the Export Administration. Questions remain about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives and the fairness of unilateral controls to American industry. Congress has struggled to reform the Export Administration Act since the 101st Congress. Export controls were extended through temporary measures and Executive Order No. 12924 in 1994. Many argue that operating under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) hinders the administration of export controls and makes it vulnerable to legal challenges, impacting its effectiveness. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act until 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate under IEEPA powers. Export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been introduced in recent Congresses. In recent Congresses, the Export Administration Act has been introduced but faced challenges in passing. In the 104th Congress, the House passed the Omnibus Export Administration Act of 1996, while in the 106th Congress, the Export Administration Act of 1999 was introduced but not acted upon by the Senate. Senator Michael P. Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149) in the 107th Congress. The Senate Banking Committee reported the legislation favorably, and it passed with amendments by a vote of 85-14. This bill was similar to S. 1712 from the previous Congress. The Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149) was introduced by Senator Enzi in the 107th Congress. The Senate debated and passed the legislation with amendments by a vote of 85-14. The House version, H.R. 2581, was introduced by Representative Gilman and passed with 35 amendments. The House International Relations Committee passed H.R. 2581 with 35 amendments. The House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence received the legislation through sequential referral. HASC further amended and reported out the legislation by a vote of 44-6. HPSCI held hearings but did not alter the legislation. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55) identical to S. 149, but no action was taken on it. The National Defense Authorization Act has been used to attempt to amend the export control regime. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been used to attempt to amend the export control regime. In 2004, the House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) contained provisions related to dual-use export controls, requiring licenses for certain technologies and items. The House version of NDAA 2005 included provisions for export controls on items under EAR or ITAR to prevent transfer to China, but these provisions were not included in the final conference report signed by the President. In the 109th Congress, a bill to revise the Export Administration Act was introduced by Representative Henry Hyde, focusing on penalties, enforcement, and US relations with multilateral control regimes. The bill aimed to extend the expired EAA for two years and provide authorization of appropriations for export control activities, but it did not receive consideration. No comprehensive legislation to rewrite or reauthorize the EAA was introduced in the 110th Congress. The EAA was extended for two years in the 109th Congress but did not receive consideration in the 110th Congress. Legislation was introduced to amend enforcement and penalty structures, integrate export control information into electronic filing, and target countries of diversion concern. Only S. 3445 / H.R. 7112 was acted upon in the 110th Congress. The GAO investigated BIS' validated end-user program. Legislation like S. 3445 / H.R. 7112 was considered in the 110th Congress. H.R. 3515 introduced provisions on export controls enforcement and diversion control. The draft legislation introduced by A. Smith focuses on export controls enforcement, integration of export control data in the AES, and diversion control. It grants additional enforcement authority for the Export Administration Regulations, allowing for investigative authority and search, detention, and seizure of goods by the Department of Commerce. The draft legislation introduced by A. Smith focuses on export controls enforcement, integration of export control data in the AES, and diversion control. It grants additional enforcement authority for the Export Administration Regulations, allowing for investigative authority and search, detention, and seizure of goods by the Department of Commerce. The bill also authorizes search, detention, and seizures at U.S. ports of entry or exit and overseas with the concurrence of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Additionally, it includes provisions for publishing best practices guidelines for export control compliance programs and establishes audit and reporting requirements for undercover investigations. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 focuses on integrating licensing requirements and export control data into the Automated Export System to prevent improper shipments and address evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs. The bill also includes provisions for audit and reporting requirements for undercover investigations. The issue of evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs, particularly in the United Arab Emirates, first surfaced in 2006. The focus shifted to the UAE's export control regime, leading to a proposal for a 'Country Category C' with stricter licensing requirements for countries of diversion concern. No country was designated as Category C. H.R. 3515 proposes the creation of a 'Category C' for countries of diversion concern, specifically targeting Iran. The bill requires the President to identify countries at risk of diverting items subject to export controls to Iran. Countries designated as such must improve their export control systems within a year, or face consequences. The bill proposes the creation of a 'Category C' for countries of diversion concern, targeting Iran. Countries failing to improve export control systems within a year would face consequences, including additional licensing requirements and increased end-user checks. Additionally, an annual report on transfers of significant dual-use U.S. technology to concerning countries would be mandated. The legislation includes provisions for creating a 'Category C' for countries of diversion concern, focusing on Iran. It also mandates an annual report on transfers of significant dual-use U.S. technology to concerning countries. President Obama initiated a review of the export control system, with Defense Secretary Gates proposing a 4-pronged approach for reform. Secretary Gates proposed a 4-pronged approach to reform the export control system, including creating a single licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, establishing an integrated IT system, and setting up a single enforcement coordination agency. The changes would be implemented in three phases, with the final phase requiring legislative action. The first phase involves harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List and developing standardized licensing processes. The proposed reform of the export control system includes harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List and establishing a tiered control structure. This would lead to a significant reduction in license requirements and the movement of certain items from the munitions list to the dual-use list. Additionally, a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured tiered control lists would be implemented in Phase II. The proposed reform of the export control system includes moving items from the munitions list to the dual-use list, establishing a single licensing agency, merging control lists, consolidating enforcement activities, and implementing a new IT system. Secretary Gates predicts a 3-phase plan unfolding over the next year, but many questions remain unanswered. The 3-phase plan for reforming the export control system leaves many questions unanswered, including the need for legislative action and multilateral consultations for changes to the control lists and agency structure. The proposed changes to the export control system include potential restructuring of agencies and the placement of a new licensing agency within existing departments. Common principles in the Export Administration Act (EAA) focus on types of export controls, licensing procedures, review processes, and enforcement measures. Dual-use export controls in the US have historically been based on national security, foreign policy, and economic considerations since the 1949 Act. The 1949 Act established U.S. dual-use export controls based on national security, foreign policy, and economic considerations. The 1979 Act further restricted exports that could enhance military capabilities of other countries. Items on the Commerce Control List are controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons, with different standards for licensing to specific countries. The 1979 Act restricted the export of goods or technology that could enhance military capabilities of other countries. National security control items fall under the National Security licensing requirement of the EAR. Licenses for items controlled for national security purposes are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Goods and technology to be controlled for national security purposes are identified by the Secretary of Defense and other agencies. The Secretary of Defense and other agencies identify goods and technology for national security control. The Military Critical Technology List is maintained for this purpose. The national security control list aligns with the Wassenaar Arrangement. Items not covered by U.S. national security controls are controlled for foreign policy reasons. Foreign availability determinations are required for items controlled for national security purposes. The 1979 Act charges the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense and other appropriate agencies, with determining on a continuing basis whether any item currently subject to export control for reasons of national security meets foreign availability status. Requests for foreign availability determinations can be made by a license applicant or through the initiative of the Secretary. If a foreign availability determination is made, the item must be decontrolled, unless the President overturns the decision. The 1979 Act allows for foreign availability determinations to be requested by a license applicant or initiated by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines foreign availability, the item is decontrolled unless the President deems it detrimental to national security. The Office of Foreign Availability, now replaced by the Office of Technology Evaluation, gathers data for these determinations. The President may enter negotiations with control partners to eliminate the availability if needed. The Office of Foreign Availability, now replaced by the Office of Technology Evaluation, conducts foreign availability determinations. The Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) was created to involve university experts in determining technologies for the control list. BIS plans to review 1/3 of the CCL each year. Certain licensing requirements on uncooled thermal imaging cameras were lifted for 36 U.S. allied countries in 2009. BIS conducted a systemic review of the CCL in 2007-8 and plans to review 1/3 of it each year. In 2009, certain licensing requirements on thermal imaging cameras were lifted for 36 U.S. allied countries. The rule decontrolled low to mid-market night vision cameras for civilian use but tightened controls on higher-end thermal imaging cameras. Exporters must report transactions to BIS semi-annually. Some concerns remain about the time taken to resolve issues. The BIS requires exporters to report transactions semi-annually. Concerns persist about the time taken to resolve issues, with some stating it took years for BIS to engage and reach agreements. Mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation but is not currently included in regulations. The EAA legislation introduced criteria for mass market status, including distribution manner, shipping conduciveness, and usefulness without modification. This feature was controversial in the 107th Congress, with concerns about wholesale decontrol of sensitive items. The EAA authorizes export control for foreign policy objectives, international obligations, and counterterrorism efforts. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for promoting foreign policy objectives, complying with international obligations, or deterring terrorism. Foreign policy controls are in place for anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, embargoes, and non-proliferation. The EAA attaches limitations on foreign policy controls, requiring yearly renewal, clear objectives reported to Congress, negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items, and imposition of controls. The President is required to state objectives and criteria for controls to be reported to Congress, engage in negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items, and impose controls to comply with international obligations or treaties. A license is needed for exporting certain items to countries supporting terrorism. Foreign policy controls do not apply to sales of medicine, medical supplies, food donations, seeds, and water equipment for basic human needs. Controls on agricultural products and medicines were further amended by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Controls on sales of agricultural products and medicines have been amended by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Catch-all controls require a license for export of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security maintains an end-user list of entities requiring licenses subject to these controls. Presumption of denial for licenses applies to certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Israel. The Bureau of Industry and Security maintains an end-user list of entities requiring licenses subject to Export Control and Prevention of Proliferation Activities. Regulations prescribe a presumption of denial for licenses to certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and Israel, as well as foreign terrorist organizations. The Export Administration Act of 1979 authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages and inflationary impacts. Short-supply controls include restrictions on exports of crude oil, petroleum derivatives, unprocessed western red cedar, and the export of horses by sea. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process within the Department of Commerce. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process for exports. In FY2008, BIS reviewed 21,213 applications totaling $72.1 billion, including $50.2 billion in crude oil exports for refined petroleum. Dual-use technology licenses were valued at $21.9 billion, representing 1.7% of total U.S. exports. BIS approved 84% of applications, denied 1.0%, and returned 15%. China received the most controlled goods in FY2008 with 1,990 licenses. In FY2008, the Bureau of Industry and Security reviewed 21,213 license applications totaling $72.1 billion. China was the largest destination for controlled goods with 1,990 licenses approved worth $2.7 billion. Chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment had the most approved license applications with 2,212 valued at $294 million. The Commerce Control List includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. The Commerce Control List (CCL) includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. It consists of specific goods, technology, and software divided into ten categories, each further divided into functional groups. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes items like avionics, marine, and propulsion systems, space vehicles, and related equipment into functional groups with export control classification numbers (ECCN). Each ECCN has a description and reason for control, totaling around 500 listings. U.S.-origin commodities are generally \"subject to the EAR,\" allowing restrictions based on end-use or end-user, with items on the CCL potentially eligible for license exceptions. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes items into functional groups with export control classification numbers (ECCN), allowing restrictions based on end-use or end-user. Items on the CCL may be eligible for license exceptions, but some products may still require a license due to high diversion risk or controversial nature. Commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or a munition, with CJs determined by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls determines Commodity Jurisdictions (CJs) to classify products as dual-use or munitions. Exporters may request a classification from BIS for items not listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL). However, the General Accounting Office criticized Commerce for low referral rates to State and Defense for classification. The General Accounting Office criticized Commerce for low referral rates to State and Defense for classification, highlighting jurisdictional disagreements and lack of coordination between the two departments. The General Accounting Office criticized Commerce for low referral rates to State and Defense for classification due to jurisdictional disagreements and lack of coordination between the two departments. The EAA and EAR establish policies for license application review and interagency dispute resolution, but current procedures need improvement. The Secretary of Commerce has the power to review and determine export license disposition. Procedures for resolving interagency disputes regarding export licenses were established by Executive Order 12981. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to review and determine the disposition of export licenses, with other agencies having the ability to review licenses as well. Within nine days of a license application, the Secretary must take various actions, including seeking additional information, referring the application to other agencies, and granting or denying the application. The Executive Order 12981 established procedures for resolving interagency disputes regarding export licenses. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to review and determine the disposition of export licenses, with other agencies also having the ability to review licenses. Within 30 days of receipt of the application, agencies must recommend approval or denial of the application, providing regulatory or statutory justification for a denial. If an agency fails to provide a recommendation within 30 days, the agency is deemed to have no objection to the decision of the Secretary. The 1995 Order established a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism for export licenses. The top tier is the Export Administration Review Board (EARB) chaired by the Secretary, with the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy as members. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is under the EARB, chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. Other agency heads may participate as needed. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration and consists of relevant assistant Secretaries and officials from agencies represented in the Export Administration Review Board (EARB). The Operating Committee (OC) of ACEP, made up of representatives from listed departments, handles the dispute resolution process. The Chair reviews recommendations within 14 days and any reviewing department can appeal to the ACEP within five days. The ACEP handles appeals from reviewing departments within 5 days. The EARB decides on the application within 11 days of an appeal. The interagency appeal process must be completed within 90 days. Presidential consideration of a license decision has no set time frame. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by statutory and regulatory requirements. The interagency appeal process for export licenses must be completed within 90 days of registration. BIS's denial of a license must be supported by specific reasons, with a possible basis for appeal being foreign availability. In FY2008, 422 cases were escalated to the OC for review. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations by executive order when the EAA expired in 1990. In FY2008, BIS reported 422 cases escalated to the OC and 20 examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations by executive order when the EAA expired in 1990, invoking emergency authority under IEEPA. Controls were later terminated during temporary EAA extensions in 1993 and 1994, with President Clinton reimposing controls under IEEPA after the second extension expired in 1994. President Clinton reimposed export controls under IEEPA after the EAA extensions expired in 1994. A major restructuring of export control regulations was published in 1996. President Clinton signed legislation in 2000 to extend the authority of the 1979 Act. President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls in 2001. Deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority have been noted, including lapses in enforcement power and complications for enforcement agents. The power of enforcement agents lapsed with the EAA, and under IEEPA, they must obtain Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status to function as law enforcement officers. IEEPA does not authorize the President to limit federal court jurisdiction or extend the EAA's denial of judicial review. Additionally, IEEPA lacks explicit provisions for confidentiality, discouraging compliance with foreign boycotts, and sending the wrong message to other countries by not enacting appropriate legislation. The United States has been criticized for not enacting appropriate legislation to strengthen export control laws, diminishing its credibility. However, the International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties to $1 million and civil penalties to $250,000, aiming to deter violations. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act, signed by President Bush on October 16, 2007, increased criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for individuals, and civil penalties to $250,000. The act also imposed equivalent penalties under the EAA for violations involving national security controls, including penalties of $250,000 and 10 years' imprisonment for individuals and $1 million for firms. Controversial exports have included telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, guidance technology, aerospace technology, synthetic materials, and specialized manufacturing equipment. Technologically advanced goods and technologies include Global Positioning System technology, aerospace and jet engine technology, synthetic materials, specialized manufacturing and testing equipment, and high-performance computers (HPCs). HPCs can perform complex digital operations quickly and efficiently, with performance measured in millions of theoretical operations per second (MTOPS). The benchmark for HPC computing performance was previously measured in MTOPS, but a new standard called adjusted peak performance (APP) was approved in 2005. APP is measured in weighted teraflops (WT) and controls high-end proprietary HPCs at a level of 0.75 WT. The adjusted peak rate for high-performance computing is measured in weighted teraflops (WT), with a control level set at 0.75 WT for advanced research and development. Export restrictions on HPCs have been debated due to rapid advancements in computing capabilities and foreign availability of comparable models. During the Clinton and Bush Administrations, export thresholds for High-Performance Computers (HPCs) were raised, with the last change in January 2002 setting the threshold for exports to Tier 3 countries at 190,000 MTOPS. This decontrol process significantly impacted the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), reducing the number of license applications for computer assemblies and hardware. Despite the shift to weighted teraflops (WT) metric, changes in export restrictions on HPCs have been debated. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. Exports of these computers are subject to approval from multiple government departments. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. Exports of these computers are subject to approval from multiple government departments. Encryption is crucial for e-commerce security but also impacts military code-breaking capabilities. The importance of encryption technology in e-commerce security led to its transfer from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996. Retail encryption products can now be exported to western countries and non-governmental end-users with a license exemption, while licenses are still required for countries under anti-terrorism controls. Stealth design incorporates various elements for enhanced security. Stealth technology involves materials and structures to protect against electronic detection. It can deflect or absorb radar signals to prevent detection. Export control is crucial due to civil applications and the need to maintain U.S. leadership in this technology. Commodities are sensitive from an export control perspective due to civil applications that make it difficult to control dissemination and retain U.S. leadership in technology. Concerns over potential exports led to reclassification of stealth-related technology as munitions in the 1990s. Congress debated controlling exports of commercial communications satellites and effectiveness of monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent disclosures of missile secrets. In 1998, the Cox Committee found U.S. satellite manufacturers provided missile design information to China through improper transfer of launch failure analysis. Satellite exports were licensed by the Department of Commerce from late 1996 until March 1999. Congress returned authority to license exports of commercial satellites in October 1998, effective March 15, 1999. The transfer of launch failure analysis led to concerns over potential exports of sensitive satellite technology to China. Satellite exports were licensed by the Department of Commerce until March 1999, when Congress returned authority to the Department of State. The satellite industry has lobbied to reverse export controls to Commerce due to licensing delays and lost sales. Commercial communication satellites may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 (H.R. 2410) allows the transfer of commercial satellite technology from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List with congressional approval. This includes manufacturing technology for missiles, aircraft engines, and arms, which is becoming more advanced with sophisticated computer software and circuitry. The industry has expressed concerns about the lack of multilateral controls over sales of this equipment. The capital equipment in the industry is becoming more advanced with sophisticated computer software and circuitry. The lack of multilateral controls over sales of this equipment, especially regarding China, has been a concern. The BIS Office of Technology Evaluation recommended decontrol of certain products to China and Taiwan. \"Hot section\" technology is crucial for jet aircraft development and production, controlled by different departments based on military or commercial use. The U.S. Munitions List controls technology developed by the Department of Defense for aircraft, while technology in commercial aircraft is regulated by the Department of Commerce. Concerns were raised in Congress about decontrolling sensitive technologies in civilian aviation. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls has been expanding its jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts. Section 17(c) of the EAA addresses standard equipment certified by the FAA. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, a agency within the Department of State, has been asserting jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts and components. Section 17(c) of the EAA states that standard equipment certified by the FAA in civil aircraft, to be exported to a non-controlled country, shall be subject to export controls exclusively under this act. Commercial suppliers have complained about having to submit commodity jurisdiction for items covered by 17(c) to avoid ITAR issues. The DDTC released a new rule clarifying that Commerce will have jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment, covered by a civil aircraft type certificate, and integral to the aircraft. This came after complaints from commercial suppliers about having to submit commodity jurisdiction for items covered by Section 17(c) of the EAA to avoid ITAR issues. Under the new rule, Commerce will have jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment, covered by a civil aircraft type certificate, and integral to the aircraft. This eliminates the need for suppliers to submit the part for a commodity jurisdiction determination. Deemed exports of technology, know-how, and non-encryption source code are regulated by the Export Administration Regulations, requiring a license for transfer to a foreign national in the United States. The Export Administration Regulations require a license for technology transfer to a foreign national in the US. Deemed exports were not mentioned in the 1979 EAA but have become a significant part of BIS activity. In FY2007, BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses, with 57% for Chinese nationals. BIS established new rules in response to an IG report recommending changes to foreign national export controls. In response to an Inspector General's report, BIS considered changing the standard for foreign nationals subject to export controls from country of citizenship to country of birth. However, in December 2005, Under Secretary of Commerce David McCormick announced that deemed export controls would still be based on country of citizenship or permanent residency. In December 2007, BIS released the report of the Deemed Export Advisory Commission (DEAC), recommending a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to streamline deemed export applications. The Commission proposed evaluating an applicant's probable loyalties based on various factors, including country of birth and current citizenship. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission (DEAC) recommended evaluating an applicant's country of birth, prior residence, citizenship, and activities for a deemed export license. They also suggested streamlining regulations and establishing an expert panel for annual technology reviews. Industry and research groups criticized the proposals as unmanageable. BIS sought feedback on technology scope and criteria for assessing country affiliation for foreign nationals in a notice of inquiry in May 2008. The DEAC recommended evaluating an applicant's background for a deemed export license, including country of birth and activities. BIS sought feedback on technology scope and criteria for assessing country affiliation for foreign nationals in a notice of inquiry in May 2008. The tension between commercial and national security concerns is a key theme in debates on export administration legislation. Many support reform of the current export control system to help U.S. businesses compete globally. Many support reform of the current export control system to assist U.S. businesses in global competition while considering national security concerns. Controversies arise regarding technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing processes, and the impact on the U.S. economy. Discussions also focus on effective controls for potential exports to countries threatening U.S. security, terrorists, human rights violators, and weapons proliferators. The EAA debate involves controversies over technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing processes, and the impact on the U.S. economy. Industry groups support foreign availability and mass market provisions in potential EAA legislation, arguing that U.S. dominance of cutting-edge technology is no longer guaranteed and that unilateral controls will not prevent other countries from obtaining advanced technology. According to advocates, unilateral controls on cutting-edge technology are ineffective as other countries can still obtain it from different sources. They argue that current multilateral controls are not working and only harm American businesses, while foreign businesses benefit from new markets. With the globalization of the economy, unilateral export controls are seen as increasingly unworkable as component parts are manufactured globally. The current export control system is facing challenges due to globalization, with component parts being manufactured globally. Purchasing managers are reducing dependence on American components due to delays in licensing procedures. Critics argue that the mass market standard could nullify the U.S. control regime. Industry proponents argue for mass market and foreign availability standards, claiming they enhance national security by supporting robust export industries. Critics fear the mass market standard could undermine U.S. control regime by decontrolling items meeting criteria, potentially allowing proliferation items to qualify. The foreign availability criterion could enable the sale of controlled items to rogue buyers from controlled countries. Industry argues that selling current technology is crucial for national security, as it generates funds for future technology development. They believe that export controls hinder American firms competitively, allowing foreign firms to gain market share and potentially surpass the US in technological advancements. This could impact the quality of technology available for national security purposes, so industry advocates for a streamlined approach to export controls. Foreign firms gaining market share, increasing profits, and investing more in R&D could potentially surpass the US technological lead, impacting the quality of technology available for national security. Industry advocates for a streamlined export process to avoid hindering exports, while critics argue that selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states does not promote national security. They point to past instances like Iraq using US weaponry against Kuwait in the Persian Gulf War. The argument highlights the case of Iraq using U.S. weaponry in the 1980s against Kuwait in the Persian Gulf War. It discusses the reliance on the civilian sector for R&D due to declining defense budgets in the 1990s and the need to fund defense capabilities within the Defense Department. Some argue that controlling computing power is not feasible or effective, as technology advances rapidly and export control systems struggle to keep up. The export control system struggles to keep up with the rapid advancement of technology, particularly in computing power. Attempts to control computing power are deemed ineffective as microprocessors can be linked together to create high-performance systems that breach export thresholds. This ability to cluster commodity computers erodes restrictions on access to supercomputing capabilities. The Defense Science Board noted that clustering commodity computers can create a parallel processing system approaching super-computer capabilities, eroding restrictions on high-performance computing access. Some believe the US can limit access to advanced computer technology by controlling exports, as American-made products are seen as superior with better networking and service. Control advocates argue that qualitative differences are significant in networking parallel processing systems. One policy attempted to monitor and verify the end-use of controlled goods is the post-shipment verification requirement on the export of high-performance computers to tier III destinations, including China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and other nations in areas of regional instability. Lawmakers are particularly concerned with exports of high-performance computers to China. The GAO has reported that China has restricted access to facilities containing advanced computing technology. The export of high-performance computers to tier III destinations, including China, has raised concerns among lawmakers. China has restricted access to facilities containing U.S. high-performance computer exports, making it difficult to monitor end-use compliance. The United States participates in multilateral export control regimes, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions. The Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions, established in 1996, is the key multilateral regime for controlling dual-use goods and technology. It succeeded the Coordinated Committee (CoCom) from the Cold War era. The WA control list aligns with U.S. CCL items for national security controls. The U.S. also participates in other proliferation-related control regimes like the Australia Group, Missile Technology Control Regime, and Nuclear Suppliers Group, each with a common control list and national discretion for export controls. The Wassenaar Arrangement and other proliferation-related control regimes have common control lists and national discretion for export controls. These organizations operate by consensus but are criticized for being ineffective due to the necessity for unanimous agreement among member states. The Wassenaar Arrangement and other control regimes operate by consensus but are criticized for limited institutional structures. Critics argue that consensus hampers effectiveness, especially in pre-export consultation. Industry representatives emphasize the need for multilateral controls and criticize unilateral export policies, particularly regarding exports to China. The machine tool industry criticizes unilateral export policies towards China, citing lack of consensus among Wassenaar Arrangement countries. They argue that stringent domestic controls and minimal multilateral constraints harm American companies. Proponents of tighter export restrictions highlight America's historical leadership in export controls and non-proliferation efforts. They call for a strategy to convince allies to follow suit in strengthening export control regimes like the Wassenaar Arrangement. The United States historically leads in export controls and non-proliferation efforts, advocating for stronger multilateral controls like the Wassenaar Arrangement. Adherents argue that Washington must set the example to persuade other nations to follow suit, rather than relying solely on consensus-based policies. Both industry representatives and proponents of heightened export controls agree on the need to strengthen multilateral controls. The debate over strengthening multilateral export controls revolves around the lack of consensus on which countries pose a threat, particularly China. This dilemma raises the question of whether the United States should impose unilateral controls, weighing the importance of non-proliferation goals against potential economic costs and national security risks. The dilemma in U.S. export control policy towards China involves balancing economic benefits with national security risks. Some argue that current controls are too stringent and have hindered technology transfers to China, leading to Chinese companies avoiding U.S. bids due to delays. The U.S. export control policy towards China is criticized for being too stringent, hindering technology transfers. Chinese companies avoid U.S. bids due to licensing delays, impacting U.S. firms in the market. Concerns about China's dual-use technology acquisitions are raised, citing instances of evading export controls and obtaining technology illegally. The need for tightened controls is emphasized. The Cox Commission found that China evaded export controls to obtain missile and satellite technology illegally. China has also been involved in nuclear, missile, and chemical proliferation activities. The final rule by BIS includes new licensing requirements for military end-use products in China and a validated end-user program. This rule is driven by concerns about exporting commercial technology to certain end-users. The proposed rule by BIS includes new controls for military end-use products in China, a validated end-user program, and a requirement for obtaining an end-user statement for certain licensed products. This rule aims to address concerns about exporting commercial technology to specific end-users in China, potentially undermining arms embargoes. The new licensing policy consists of establishing military end-use controls and revising the License Review Policy for national security controlled items destined for China. The focus is on implementing new controls on 20 product categories with 31 export control classification numbers. The new rule by BIS establishes military end-use controls on 20 product categories with 31 export control classification numbers, requiring a license for exports to China if the items are intended for military end-uses. It also revises the licensing policy for National Security controlled items destined for China, with a presumption of denial for items contributing to China's military capabilities. The Final Rule by BIS establishes military end-use controls on certain items for exports to China, with a presumption of denial for items contributing to China's military capabilities. It also increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce of the PRC, raising the value exempted from $5,000 to $50,000 for most goods. The Final Rule by BIS establishes military end-use controls on certain items for exports to China, with a presumption of denial for items contributing to China's military capabilities. It increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from $5,000 to $50,000 for most goods. The rule expands the End-User Statement requirement to cover all license applications to China reaching this threshold, previously required only for items under national security controls. The VEU component allows trusted PRC civilian end-users to receive items without a license if approved by BIS, with an application process for nomination. The VEU program sets up an applications process for nominating end-users for the program. Approval criteria include exclusive engagement in civilian end-use activities, compliance with U.S. export controls, recordkeeping capability, on-site reviews, and relationships with U.S. and foreign companies. China's MoFCom requires authorization for companies seeking VEU status. Not all items on the CCL are eligible for export under this program, such as those controlled for crime control or missile technology. The VEU program allows for streamlined licensing for certain companies, diverting resources from routine applications to more problematic ones. Approved VEU applications can import items from any exporter, not just the nominee. The program does not allow export of items controlled for crime control or missile technology. The list of items that can be exported to the end-user can be expanded or contracted by the ERC. The VEU program streamlines licensing for certain companies, allowing resources to be redirected to more complex applications. General Electric India was the first eligible company in India, while the first five VEU companies included Applied Materials China and Boeing Hexcel AVIC I Joint Venture. These companies imported goods worth $54.3 million in 2006. AVIC I and HHNEC were flagged for diversion risks due to their government affiliations. In 2006, companies imported goods worth $54.3 million. AVIC I and HHNEC were flagged for diversion risks due to their government affiliations. The Wisconsin Project raised concerns about their ties to Chinese military-owned companies and violations of U.S. sanctions and export laws. BIS Undersecretary defended the companies' use of U.S. technology and VEU authorization. Controversy surrounding the VEU program persisted, with a GAO study in September 2008. The controversy surrounding the VEU program continues, with a GAO study in September 2008 recommending its suspension with China due to the lack of a specific inspection agreement. Commerce has conducted checks under the 2004 EUVU system, but it requires an end-use statement from MoFCom, contradicting the program's trade facilitation purpose. On January 13, 2009, BIS announced full implementation of the VEU program to China, with procedures in place for secure and efficient operation. Representative Markey raised concerns about Aviza Technology China sharing an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. BIS, under the Department of Commerce, regulates dual-use exports. China, shared an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce regulates dual-use exports, consulting with other agencies for input on licensing. The Defense Technology Security Agency in the Department of Defense conducts national security reviews for license applications, while the Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls at the State Department administers the International Traffic in Arms. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversee license applications for nuclear uses. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) at the State Department manages the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for weapons and military technology exports. Industry leaders highlight issues with the licensing system, including overlapping jurisdiction, lengthy approval times, and outdated technology considerations. The licensing system for export controls in the U.S. is criticized for compromising supplier reliability, hindering planning, and lacking updates in technology considerations. There is no opportunity for judicial review of licensing decisions, and officials claim thorough and fair reviews are conducted, requiring time for checks and coordination with government agencies. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) coordinates with government agencies to prevent sensitive technologies from reaching wrong hands. Some question if BIS, under the Department of Commerce, prioritizes national security over promoting exports. However, others argue that other agencies like the Department of Defense ensure a balanced approach."
