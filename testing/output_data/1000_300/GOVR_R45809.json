    "content": "Critical infrastructure (CI) encompasses machinery, facilities, and information crucial for governance, public health, and the economy. Adverse events can result from disruptions to CI systems, whether due to natural disasters or deliberate attacks. This report outlines key policy concerns for Congress, including defining and identifying CI, assessing CI risk, federal organization for CI, and the role of the private sector. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance on critical infrastructure protection, focusing on national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63), released in 1998, was the first high-level policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection. It defined critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government, setting ambitious goals to eliminate national vulnerability to asymmetric cyber or physical attacks. However, establishing consistent criteria for assessing criticality has proven challenging. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 established a statutory definition of critical infrastructure, focusing on the difficulty of assessing the criticality of specific assets and systems due to the scale, complexity, and interconnectedness of the U.S. and global economies. Critical infrastructure, as defined by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, includes systems and assets vital to national security, economic security, public health, and safety. This definition has evolved to encompass essential services and conveniences for the public, reflecting a broader concern beyond physical foundations of national power. The universe of threats to critical infrastructure has expanded to include asymmetric attacks by state and non-state adversaries using physical or cyber means to disrupt essential services and assets. The intelligence community focuses on these threats to CI, which have evolved beyond the post-9/11 period. Asymmetric attacks using physical or cyber means can damage domestic critical infrastructure systems and assets, causing mass civilian casualties. The definition of critical infrastructure has broadened to include events with disruptive effects at all levels of society and government, reflecting a focus on infrastructure as a key enabler of prosperity, public safety, and civic life. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) defines critical infrastructure as assets, systems, and networks that support American society, considering impacts of natural and manmade hazards at various levels. CI policy has evolved to prioritize society-centric resilience over security-oriented protection of specific assets, reflecting a global trend among developed countries. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure in January 2017, including physical locations and technology infrastructure essential for managing elections. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure in January 2017, including voter registration databases, voting systems, and other technology used to manage elections. Currently, there are 16 critical infrastructure sectors outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21), with DHS responsible for coordinating public-private partnerships to protect these essential assets. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has overall responsibility for coordinating partnership programs and activities related to critical infrastructure sectors. Other federal agencies may also have leading roles as Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs). These sectors encompass a wide range of national economic and social activities, each with unique characteristics. The designation of critical infrastructure has policy implications for Congress, with each sector having formal coordination bodies involving private sector stakeholders and representatives of state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. Industry and non-profit groups may also participate in sector-wide activities. The critical infrastructure sector is represented by formal coordination bodies involving private sector stakeholders, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. New public and private sector communities of interest emerge within the broader critical infrastructure enterprise, each with its unique perspective on criticality. There is no single, consistently applied definition of critical infrastructure, reflecting diverse interests and evolving perspectives. Definitions of critical infrastructure are not merely a matter of semantics. The identification and prioritization of critical systems and assets in the critical infrastructure sector reflect diverse interests and perspectives. Definitions of critical infrastructure are not just about semantics but reflect negotiations on congressional responsibility, government programs, and public-private sector relationships. Critical infrastructure policy has two orientations focusing on the protection and prioritization of infrastructure assets. Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) have different organizational perspectives and requirements. CIP focuses on identifying and protecting infrastructure assets based on consequences of loss or disruption, while CIR emphasizes investments in hazard mitigation and preparedness for availability of essential services. Legislation for CI policy was passed after 9/11 attacks. The foundation for critical infrastructure (CI) policy was established post-9/11 attacks, with a shift towards system resilience over asset protection in developed countries. The national CI policy now combines elements of both CI protection (CIP) and CI resilience (CIR), leading to complexities in defining criticality. This report uses the term \"critical infrastructure security\" to discuss CI policy without bias towards CIP or CIR. Legislation and government directives post-2001 have predominantly focused on CIP. The report discusses critical infrastructure security, emphasizing the importance of asset identification and prioritization for higher levels of protection against threats. Despite the logic behind it, complexities arise in practice, leading to ongoing national-level challenges in all CI sectors. Inventory requirements serve as the initial step in broader risk management strategies for critical infrastructure. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in February 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for asset identification and prioritization. This strategy highlights the ongoing debate within the critical infrastructure policy community regarding definitional criteria of criticality. The list/no-list decisions help define specific critical assets in practice. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in February 2003, directed DHS to develop a uniform methodology for identifying and cataloging critical facilities, systems, and functions. This strategy was followed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) in December 2003, which laid the foundation for critical infrastructure policy development until it was replaced by PPD-21 in 2013. HSPD-7 directed federal departments and agencies to prioritize and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure and key assets. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) directed federal departments and agencies to identify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources. Despite claims of a comprehensive database in the 2006 NIPP, a DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in the national database of critical infrastructure assets. The database grew rapidly from 160 key assets in 2003 to 77,069 assets in 2006, including nuclear power plants and dams. The DHS Inspector General report identified shortcomings in the National Asset Database, which had grown rapidly from 160 key assets in 2003 to 77,069 assets in 2006. The database included a wide range of assets, from nuclear power plants to petting zoos and water parks, with many entries lacking clear criticality. Data collection procedures were not standardized, leading to inconsistencies in asset listings. Congress later included provisions for the National Asset Database in the 9-11 Commission Act of 2007. The National Asset Database was listed in the 9-11 Commission Act of 2007, requiring a compilation of vital systems or assets and a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure. The Secretary determines assets that could cause catastrophic effects if disrupted or destroyed, with quality control procedures in place for asset nominations. The 2013 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlighted improvements in DHS processes for critical asset identification, but raised concerns about reporting criteria and methodology. The National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) underwent changes in nomination and adjudication criteria post-2009, assessing criticality based on potential adverse consequences like fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. After 2009, NCIPP assessed criticality of nominations based on potential adverse consequences like fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. Methodological adjustments were made to account for unique CI characteristics. Recommendations were made for an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods to ensure the identification of the nation's highest priority infrastructure. The report recommended an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods for the NCIPP list to identify the nation's highest priority infrastructure. Being listed in the NCIPP elevates an asset's national significance, impacting government prioritization, risk assessments, regulatory regimes, grant programs, criminal prosecutions, and emergency preparedness. The exact number of nominated assets is classified but numbers in the thousands. Some state governments are opting out of participating in DHS data calls due to compliance burdens. The 2013 GAO report found that some state governments were opting out of participating in DHS data calls for the NCIPP list due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. States lacked expertise in developing scenarios to assess consequences of failure or disruption, leading to an incomplete national inventory of critical systems and assets. DHS failed to provide documentation for statutory reporting requirements, indicating persistent difficulties in CI inventory and categorization. The GAO found that DHS struggled to comply with annual reporting requirements for critical infrastructure (CI) assets. The complexities of CI inventory and categorization indicate ongoing challenges in ensuring the completeness and quality of centralized inventories. The Critical Infrastructure Resilience (CIR) approach prioritizes using critical capabilities for service continuity during stress on infrastructure systems. This method expands data collection to include all assets in a CI sector for emergency planning, regardless of their listing. This data can be used to identify alternative ways to maintain critical functions and essential services during disruptions. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, managed by four lead agencies, compiles data from public and private sector partners to support emergency planning and response. It includes hundreds of data layers covering various asset categories relevant to homeland security functions. HIFLD is a database with data layers curated by partner agencies, including critical assets for homeland security functions. It also includes non-critical asset categories that may become critical in emergencies. HHS used HIFLD during the 2017 hurricane season to locate day care centers in impacted areas. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) utilized the HIFLD database during the 2017 hurricane season to find day care centers in affected areas. These centers, while not classified as critical infrastructure, were crucial for providing essential public health services and ensuring the safety of children in disaster zones. The HIFLD partnership model aims to allow government agencies and private sector entities to access infrastructure data for real-world applications. The HIFLD partnership model enables government agencies and private sector entities to access infrastructure data for real-world use cases. It is widely used for preparedness and incident management activities by federal and SLTT agencies. The development of HIFLD partnerships contrasts with declining state participation in NCIPP, but CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant. The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires DHS to identify critical utilities and national security assets at risk. Chemical manufacturing facilities are subject to DHS inspection under CFATS regulations to protect against cyber and physical threats. Congress may need to consider the shift towards system-level resilience for legacy programs like NCIPP. The 2007 regulations require owner-operators to protect facilities against cyber and physical threats. Congress may need to consider the implications of the policy shift towards system-level resilience for legacy programs like NCIPP. Stakeholder participation in NCIPP may require additional appropriations for data gathering and analysis. Updates to National Asset Database requirements may be necessary to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities. Updates to National Asset Database requirements in the 9/11 Commission Act may be needed to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities, ensuring relevance and applicability. Efforts to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems and assets are crucial for understanding homeland security risks and informing resource allocation decisions. Congress frequently seeks authoritative risk assessments for critical infrastructure, which are used for emergency preparedness, regulatory oversight, grant funding, and security measures. DHS defines risk as part of its coordination and oversight of national infrastructure security efforts. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents, events, or occurrences, determined by likelihood and consequences. Risk components include threat, vulnerability, and consequence, with threat defined as potential harm to life, information, operations, environment, or property. Threat assessments consider human adversaries or natural hazards, with estimates based on available information about threat actors or groups and their motivations. Threat assessments include data on human adversaries or natural hazards, estimating timing, methods, and frequency of attacks. Vulnerability assessments identify characteristics that make assets or systems susceptible to exploitation or damage. Vulnerability assessments provide information about characteristics of assets or systems that may leave them open to exploitation or damage from a threat or hazard. Assessments may contain recommendations for adoption of resilience measures to mitigate identified vulnerabilities. DHS defines consequence as the \"effect of an event, incident, or occurrence.\" Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events that disrupt or destroy infrastructure systems and assets, using various assessment methods. Consequence-based criticality assessments inform risk assessments by evaluating potential outcomes of events that disrupt infrastructure systems and assets. Various methodologies are used by research centers, universities, and industry groups to assess infrastructure security. DHS has integrated threat, vulnerability, and consequence elements into its planning and budget activities since 2007, although critics question the effectiveness of this approach. DHS has integrated threat, vulnerability, and consequence elements into its planning and budget activities since 2007. Critics challenge the effectiveness of this approach, citing difficulties in assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks and the interdependence of the equation's terms. DHS recognized the need for a more comprehensive risk assessment approach in 2018. In 2018, DHS acknowledged the need for a comprehensive risk assessment approach for critical infrastructure (CI). Legislative and executive initiatives were implemented in 2018-2019 to establish the basis for significant changes, including the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to manage national CI risk. The creation of CISA and NRMC in 2018-2019 elevated CI risk management as a policy focus. NRMC adopts an evolved approach emphasizing cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented CI risk management. Congress may request information on new risk management methods validated by external reviewers. Expertise from National Laboratories, university-based DHS Centers of Excellence, industry research groups, and the Homeland Security Advisory Council can contribute to infrastructure risk assessment methodology. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to utilize expertise from various organizations for infrastructure risk assessment. Congress can set funding priorities and program guidance to support national critical infrastructure security goals. Federal organization for critical infrastructure issues has evolved in response to threats, with three distinct development periods outlined. The development of federal attention to critical infrastructure (CI) policy began in the late 1990s due to concerns about cyber threats. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996, leading to the issuance of PDD-63 in 1998 to address emerging cyber threats. The Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection was established in 1996 to address emerging cyber threats. In 1998, the Administration issued PDD-63, requiring the government to eliminate vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures to non-traditional cyber or physical attacks within five years. The directive focused on increasing interagency coordination through existing federal entities. A blue ribbon commission was chartered in 1999 to assess terrorist threats. The Gilmore Commission, chartered in 1999, found that implementation of PDD-63 was incomplete, with ISACs still in early stages of development. The Gilmore Commission found that ISACs were still in early stages of development, lacking a national CIP strategy and concrete actions by the NIPC under FBI auspices. The 9/11 attacks spurred urgent policy initiatives for critical infrastructure protection. The 9/11 attacks prompted urgent policy initiatives for critical infrastructure protection, leading to two legislative tracks: reestablishing the Office of Homeland Security under FBI auspices or comprehensive government consolidation. The 9/11 attacks led to two legislative tracks for critical infrastructure protection: one favored improved interagency coordination, while the other proposed consolidating government counterterrorism functions under a single agency, the National Homeland Security Agency. This consolidation aimed to address vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks by centralizing relevant functions and enhancing interagency coordination. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, influenced by the Hart-Rudman Commission, aimed to consolidate counterterrorism functions for clearer executive authority and better interagency coordination. It transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS, previously scattered across various sectors. The creation of DHS was deemed high risk due to the challenges of incorporating numerous agencies into the new department. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 aimed to consolidate counterterrorism functions and transfer infrastructure security functions to DHS. GAO designated the creation of DHS as high risk in 2003 due to the challenges of incorporating numerous agencies into the new department. DHS ultimately incorporated nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates, prioritizing homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism. This represented a change in infrastructure policy, as CIP was previously only tangentially related to counterterrorism functions before 9/11. The White House previously viewed CIP as separate from counterterrorism functions before 9/11. OMB highlighted the diverse risks of infrastructure, including terrorism, in a 2001 report to Congress. CIP funding for counterterrorism was minimal, less than half a percent of the total $2.6 billion. After 9/11, the White House increased funding for infrastructure programs related to counterterrorism efforts. The budget request for FY2004 was $12.1 billion, a 450% increase from pre-9/11 levels, involving 28 federal entities. The White House requested $12.1 billion for infrastructure programs related to counterterrorism in FY2004, a 450% increase from pre-9/11 levels. This funding involved 28 federal entities outside the newly-created DHS, which aimed to institutionalize homeland security missions under unified leadership. Under unified leadership, core homeland security missions were prioritized with more funding transferred to a single agency post-9/11. Despite the consolidation, independent agencies within DHS maintained significant autonomy. Infrastructure security functions were also retained by departments outside DHS. Critical infrastructure security policy focused on counterterrorism as a top priority, but Hurricane Katrina in 2005 highlighted the ongoing challenges in resource allocation and coordination across the federal government. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, public concern about terrorism decreased significantly, with only occasional spikes due to high-profile incidents. In early 2019, terrorism was not even listed as a category of public concern in Gallup surveys. The failure of the levy system during Katrina further emphasized the challenges in coordinating infrastructure security policy across the federal government. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, public concern about terrorism decreased significantly. In early 2019, terrorism was not listed as a category of public concern in Gallup surveys. The failure of the levy system during Katrina highlighted the vulnerability of critical systems to diverse hazards beyond terrorism. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force argued for a shift towards improving asset resilience against various threats, not just terrorist attacks. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force argued for a shift towards improving asset resilience against various threats, not just terrorist attacks, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive approach to protecting critical assets. The House Committee on Homeland Security also emphasized the importance of resilience in government policies and actions, leading to greater emphasis on resilience in subsequent policy documents such as the 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) emphasized the importance of resilience in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other homeland security missions, including immigration, border security, cybersecurity, and disaster response. Threats and hazards mentioned in the review included natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational criminal activities, and contagious diseases. The QHSR highlighted DHS's leadership in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other homeland security missions. It emphasized a decentralized approach involving diverse stakeholders in the public and private sector. PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7 in 2013, focusing more on all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience rather than just physical asset protection against terrorist threats. The 2013 NIPP and 2014 QHSR shifted focus from physical infrastructure protection against terrorist threats to all-hazards resilience. It emphasized the need for critical infrastructure to withstand and recover from various hazards, requiring integration with the national preparedness system. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include issues like aging and neglect of systems, turning ordinary concerns into homeland security issues. DHS failed to submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017 as mandated by the Homeland Security Act. The 2013 NIPP and 2014 QHSR shifted focus to all-hazards resilience for critical infrastructure. DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017, leaving a lack of strategic direction for infrastructure security. Negotiations continue on critical infrastructure responsibilities and definitions among various stakeholders. Congress directed the transfer of Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS in 2002 due to concerns of terrorist threats to the food and agriculture sector. In 2002, Congress directed the transfer of Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS under the Homeland Security Act due to concerns of terrorist threats. However, in 2018, Congress authorized the transfer of a replacement facility back to USDA from DHS. Critical infrastructure security has evolved into a distributed enterprise with an all-hazards approach emphasized. Congress may consider various aspects of critical infrastructure security. The federal government's critical infrastructure security has evolved into a distributed enterprise with an all-hazards approach. Congress may need to determine the division of responsibilities between homeland security and other areas like commerce and public utilities regulation. The definition of homeland security is expanding beyond counterterrorism. DHS has not provided a top-level strategy to Congress since 2014. The evolving definition of homeland security extends beyond counterterrorism roots. DHS has not submitted a top-level strategy to Congress since 2014. Congressional interest in homeland security strategy is evident in the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019. The Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) passed the House of Representatives and is now with the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. It requires DHS to consult advisory committees for its strategy, linking it with budgeting and program management. Congress has redefined organizational relationships within DHS, moving from a centralized to a federated structure emphasizing operational components. The centralized directorate structure under headquarters management in DHS has shifted to a more federated structure, emphasizing the operational role of its components. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS through the 2018 CISA Act. Congress may need to consider the organization and relationships within DHS to support critical infrastructure security. The management of privately owned critical infrastructure presents policy challenges for legislators and policymakers. The nation's privately owned critical infrastructure poses risks to the public if they fail. Policy challenges persist in managing infrastructure risk within a complex ownership and regulatory environment. Legislators and policymakers generally support a federated partnership model for critical infrastructure security, emphasizing voluntary collaboration between the public and private sectors. This model places responsibility on CI owner-operators to assess and mitigate risks at the enterprise level, while executive branch agencies are tasked with managing risk at the national level through incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments. The government has directed agencies to assess and manage national infrastructure risk through a collaborative effort between public and private sectors. Private individuals and entities largely invest in critical infrastructure security, but serious risks are shared collectively. Government and private-sector representatives work together to determine necessary security investments to manage societal-level risks. Businesses, government, and society share a common interest in infrastructure resilience, but determining responsibility at the policy level can be challenging. At the societal level, managing critical infrastructure risk requires collaboration and resilience. The federal government relies on the private sector to invest in infrastructure resilience voluntarily. Determining responsibility for upfront costs and regulatory measures can be challenging at the policy level. Government encourages industry to invest in national interests through public-private partnerships. The federal government relies on the private sector to invest in infrastructure resilience voluntarily through public-private partnerships. Incentives for industry participation include improved access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence critical infrastructure policy. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 was enacted to reduce barriers to information sharing between the public and private sectors. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 aims to facilitate information sharing between public and private sectors to enhance infrastructure resilience. Public-private coordination councils provide a platform for policy discussions and collaboration. However, voluntary partnerships may not always ensure sufficient investments for resilience targets. The OECD found that voluntary information sharing and collaboration partnerships in advanced economies may not provide enough incentive for investments in resilience. Regulatory mandates are favored for critical infrastructure sectors with potentially catastrophic impacts. Collaborative approaches are more common as risks become privatized and harms are isolated. Policymakers aim to balance voluntary and regulatory measures for infrastructure security. According to an academic survey, collaborative approaches in public-private partnerships for critical infrastructure security are more common as risks become privatized. Policymakers aim to limit government regulation in CI security, with organizations like DHS and TSA having regulatory oversight but narrow mandates. CISA directly regulates certain aspects of infrastructure security. The administration has regulatory oversight over oil and gas pipeline security, while the Coast Guard regulates port security. CISA directly regulates certain chemical facilities to prevent terrorist exploitation. Other agencies like the NRC regulate nuclear facilities for safety and reporting requirements. The NRC oversees safety and reporting requirements for nuclear facilities, stemming from the Three Mile Island incident. DHS focuses on voluntary collaboration with infrastructure security partners. The DHS infrastructure security programs emphasize voluntary collaboration with partners through information sharing, training, and assessments. Current CI partnership structures operate under PPD-21 and the 2013 NIPP, promoting distributed responsibility among stakeholders for national resilience goals. CISA administers NIPP partnerships at the federal level in coordination with other DHS entities. The NIPP emphasizes distributed responsibility among stakeholders for critical asset protection, with partnerships at the federal level administered by CISA in collaboration with other DHS components and federal agencies. Each of the 16 CI sectors has its own Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) for interagency coordination on infrastructure issues. DHS leads or co-leads 10 of the 16 GCCs as the Sector-Specific Agency (SSA). The Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) lead or co-lead 10 of the 16 Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) in the Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors. Other SSAs include the Environmental Protection Agency, Government Services Agency, and various departments like Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Transportation, and Treasury. SSAs utilize NIPP partnership structures to develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans tailored to unique sector characteristics and requirements. These plans analyze sector risks, interdependencies, stakeholders, and partners to establish resilience goals and effectiveness measures. The Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) lead or co-lead Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) in Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors. SSAs develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans analyzing risks, interdependencies, stakeholders, and partners to establish resilience goals and effectiveness measures. Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are composed of private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators, recognized by GCCs as representative of the sector. SCCs have advisory, coordination, and information-sharing functions with the federal government and support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) specific to their sector. The National Council of ISACs lists 24 member organizations. The National Council of ISACs lists 24 member organizations, which maintain operations centers and facilitate information sharing among stakeholders. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies widely across CI sectors. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups, including the State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal Government Coordinating Council (SLTTGCC) aimed at enhancing infrastructure resilience partnerships. The cross-sector councils, such as the SLTTGCC, Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council, Regional Consortium Coordinating Council, and Federal Senior Leadership Council, represent various stakeholder groups and coordinate infrastructure resilience efforts. The FSLC, chaired by the CISA Director, provides leadership over the other councils according to its charter. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) is chaired by the CISA Director and leads other cross-sector councils. It forges policy consensus on CI risk management strategies, coordinates issue resolution, develops resource requests, and collaborates with international partners. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) organizes deliberations for NIPP partnership councils and provides legal exemptions under certain circumstances. The Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) was established in 2006 and its Charter has been renewed multiple times, most recently in 2018. CIPAC provides legal exemptions to NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations from certain FACA provisions to facilitate discussions on sensitive infrastructure security topics. It engages government and private-sector stakeholders to develop policy advice and recommendations for DHS. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) advises the Secretary of Homeland Security on homeland security matters, with members appointed by the Secretary. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) provides advice and recommendations to the Secretary of Homeland Security on homeland security matters. Members are appointed by the Secretary and include leaders from various sectors. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy, serving as an intermediary between coordination councils and government officials. The NIPP partnership structure serves as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President, facilitating consultation between public and private sector representatives. Established in 2001, it monitors critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils and encourages risk management practices through various activities. Participation in these activities involves governmental and non-governmental stakeholders across organizational lines. The NIPP partnership structure facilitates collaboration through various formats such as symposia, research collaborations, and policy deliberations involving governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. Partnership activities now include representatives from multiple critical infrastructure sectors to promote system resilience. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) serves as a centralized hub for information sharing and threat analysis within the partnership network. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) collects, analyzes, and shares threat information in real-time within the critical infrastructure partnership network. It is part of the DHS National Operations Center and is administered by CISA. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) monitors cybersecurity incidents and performs related analytic functions. The partnership system aims to increase trust and information sharing between the public and private sectors. The partnership system administered by CISA aims to increase trust and information sharing between the public and private sectors. It raises questions about private sector collaboration, incentivizing investments in risk reduction, and the need for legislative remedies in cases where broader investments are necessary. The diversity and breadth of critical infrastructure enterprise lead to varying answers on the effectiveness of collaboration within the voluntary framework. Studies show that strong communities of interest in CI sectors are essential for effective risk mitigation investments. The 2011 study highlighted that private-sector risk mitigation investment is influenced by a company's cost-benefit analysis. Many CI owner-operators expect government support for social costs incurred from terrorist attacks. GAO testimony in 2014 noted challenges in DHS partnership efforts, including barriers to information sharing and evaluating performance. DHS lacks systematic data on industry participation in security surveys. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lacks systematic data on reasons for industry participation in security surveys and whether security improvements were made as a result. GAO emphasized the importance of evaluating program effectiveness and recommended data gathering and analysis initiatives for DHS to implement. Congress may explore the progress of these initiatives. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that DHS lacks systematic data on industry participation in security surveys and the effectiveness of security improvements. Congress may explore DHS progress in implementing GAO recommended data gathering initiatives to assess partnership effectiveness in incentivizing information sharing and risk reduction. CISA has not provided reliable data on public-partnership program effectiveness in promoting bidirectional information sharing and private investments in national resilience. Congress may address this data gap. Congress may address the lack of systematic data on industry participation in security surveys and the effectiveness of security improvements by exploring DHS progress in implementing data gathering initiatives. Enhancing regulatory authorities of federal departments and agencies may be necessary to meet national critical infrastructure resilience goals in cases where voluntary measures are ineffective or emergent threats require immediate action, as seen in the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018. The Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from gaining control of critical infrastructure assets. Congress may need to adjust partnership structures for better alignment with federal risk management approach. The partnership structures may need adjustment to align with the federal risk management approach, focusing on inter-sectoral analysis and resilience over sector-specific asset protection."
