    "content": "This report, General Management Laws: Major Themes and Management Policy Options, is a companion to CRS Report RL30795, General Management Laws: A Compendium. The reports aim to identify and describe major general management laws governing the executive branch, assist Congress in overseeing executive branch management, and help in considering changes to management laws and other legislation. The compendium profiles selected general management laws regulating executive branch activities and administration. The quality and implementation of these laws are crucial for maintaining accountability. The report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to general management laws, which are crucial for maintaining accountability in the executive branch. It complements a compendium that profiles selected general management laws regulating executive branch activities. The companion report provides an update on general management laws at the end of the 108th Congress. It includes over 90 entries organized into seven functional categories for the executive branch. Functions in management refer to specific business areas requiring related skills. The report provides an overview of general management laws, focusing on functions within the management field such as marketing, finance, production, and human resources. Entries in the compendium detail specific laws, with a section dedicated to civil service laws codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. Each entry includes a brief history, major provisions, key developments, and issues discussed by CRS analysts. The report provides an overview of general management laws, detailing specific laws with historical background, major provisions, key developments, and issues. It also discusses the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, compares management in public and private sectors, and analyzes major themes in general management laws. Scholars debate the constitutional roles of the President and Congress in managing the executive branch. The debate over the constitutional roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch has been ongoing for centuries. Both branches share the responsibility of managing federal agencies, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution's system of separated powers and checks and balances. Justice Robert Jackson emphasized the importance of interdependence and reciprocity between the branches in order to maintain a workable government. The Constitution outlines the shared responsibility of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. Congress has the power to establish administrative agencies and determine their operations. This report and compendium examine the ongoing conversation about how power is shared between Congress and the President in this regard. Section 8 of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to make laws necessary for executing government powers. The President has authority to manage the executive branch, ensuring laws are faithfully executed, but this power is limited to not frustrate congressional intentions. Article II explicitly references executive departments. Article II's 'take Care' clause does not grant the President power to frustrate congressional intention. It mentions the President's ability to require written opinions from department heads and outlines appointment powers. In 1789, Congress enacted laws establishing the Treasury Department and setting salaries for department secretaries. The federal government's financial management system was established by Congress, along with setting annual salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of the Treasury, State, and War. By the end of the 18th century, only a few departments had been created, leading to challenges in administering a growing nation. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, developed an administrative system with an independent chief executive and effective delegation of authority. After 1801, the Democratic-Republicans, under Thomas Jefferson, continued the Federalist framework for government administration. Congress became more involved in the administrative system, which struggled to keep up with the growing country in size and population. Both Presidents and department heads were overwhelmed with work, lacking delegation or administrative assistants to help. By the end of the 1820s, federal employment increased from 4,837 employees in 1816 to 36,672 in 1861. The structure of executive departments became more complex, with departments in 1860 consisting of the Secretary, bureaus handling routine business, and a field service. The growth of the administrative state after the Civil War led to challenges in managing the executive branch. By 1946, Congress delegated much legislative authority to administrative agencies, shifting policy-making and budgeting to the executive branch. Congress delegated legislative authority to administrative agencies, leading to a shift in policy-making and budgeting to the executive branch. Observers noted that Congress relied on agencies' discretion and technical expertise, sometimes allowing agencies to exercise legislative powers. In response, Congress expanded general management laws to improve executive branch management practices and increase transparency in oversight. Congress passed legislation to increase transparency in oversight of the executive branch, including the Administrative Procedure Act (1946), Freedom of Information Act (1966), Federal Advisory Committee Act (1972), and other laws. To enhance oversight and accountability, inspectors general were established in 1978, the Congressional Review of Regulations Act was enacted, and agency strategic planning was required with the Government Performance and Results Act (1993). Additionally, Congress aimed to reassert influence over the budget process with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act (1974) and improve financial accountability with the Chief Financial Officers Act (1990) and other laws. In summary, general management laws passed by Congress aim to bring disciplined management to executive branch agencies. The laws may be seen as necessary oversight to improve financial accountability and agency management, but they also raise questions about stifling flexibility and initiative. The perspective on these laws likely depends on the viewpoint of the questioner and the specific situation. The laws passed by Congress aim to bring disciplined management to executive branch agencies, raising questions about stifling flexibility and initiative. Scholars and practitioners debate the extent to which management practices in the public and private sectors can be compared, seeking to learn from each other. Management practices in the public and private sectors are often compared, with scholars cautioning against applying private-sector principles to government agencies. Public and private management are seen as fundamentally alike in unimportant respects, but operate under different laws regulating their behaviors. One significant difference between public-sector agencies and private-sector companies is the laws they operate under. Public-sector agencies are regulated by laws like the Constitution and public law, which give the government coercive power to regulate private activity and collect taxes. In contrast, private companies operate under laws that create and regulate a functioning market economy. Government agencies are regulated by laws like the Constitution and public law, giving them coercive power. In contrast, private companies operate under laws that create and regulate a functioning market economy. Private companies are primarily accountable to their owners or shareholders, while government agencies cannot retain earnings for private benefit. Government agencies, unlike private bureaucracies, are restricted in retaining earnings for private use, allocating resources based on administrator preferences, and setting their own goals. Control over revenues, resources, and agency objectives lies largely with external entities such as legislatures and interest groups. This leads to challenges in measuring agency performance and managing the differences between public and private sector practices. Government agencies face challenges in measuring and managing their performance due to differences between public and private sector practices. The compendium of general management laws raises public policy issues regarding agency management. Congress must consider how much discretion to give the executive branch in determining agency actions. The debate over how much discretion to give the executive branch in determining agency actions has been ongoing. Providing flexibility can allow agencies to tailor implementation of laws to specific circumstances and be more responsive to changing situations. This discretion is particularly important in scientific standard-setting or technical judgments. Granting discretion to the executive branch can expedite regulatory processes and allow for swift decision-making, especially in scientific or technical matters. However, this discretion can also lead to actions that may not align with Congress or key stakeholders, potentially bypassing oversight mechanisms. Granting discretion to the executive branch can lead to swift decision-making but may bypass oversight mechanisms, raising concerns about transparency and accountability. Congress has faced this tension between flexibility and accountability in granting agencies like DHS and DOD the authority to determine aspects of their management systems. Similar situations arose in the past, such as in 1993 with the NPR's recommendations on procurement policy leading to the passage of FASA in 1994. In 1993, the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review recommended ways to streamline procurement policy, leading to the passage of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. Congress can address delegation situations by setting conditions for authority delegation to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch. Congress can address delegation situations by setting conditions for authority delegation to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch, such as establishing goals, sanctions, probation periods, or sunsets, requiring the use of pilot projects, or creating \"profit-sharing relationships\" to incentivize agencies to act in ways beneficial to both the agency and the government. Screening and selection mechanisms can also be implemented to prevent poor performance by executive branch agencies. Congress can ensure effective performance by executive branch agencies through screening mechanisms and monitoring requirements. This includes setting conditions for authority delegation, requiring agencies to report actions taken and milestones reached, and convening hearings to assess organizational capacity and management skills. The agencies report their actions, milestones, and obtained information to Congress to monitor and provide access to difficult-to-oversee activities. Information technology allows for real-time reporting, but some argue that excessive reporting requirements can be burdensome. Congress can use institutional checks to delegate authority to multiple agencies to veto or block actions. Agencies or entities can veto or block delegate agency actions, involving other agencies in regulations, requiring notice and comment, providing sequential funding, conducting independent studies, or using committee vetoes. Should agency management laws be standardized or agency-specific, or a mix of both? The tension between standardization and customization in agency management laws is a frequent issue for Congress. Standardization can improve transparency and accountability in the executive branch, as seen in the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. Congress has introduced standardization in areas like financial management through stages. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 established basic requirements for agency rulemaking. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 and subsequent amendments required audited financial statements from executive departments and agencies, leading to improved accountability. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act extended similar requirements to other executive agencies, promoting transparency and accountability. Customization and standardization in agency management can promote accountability and effectiveness. Congress uses various tools to direct agency actions, including authorizing statutes and appropriations. Customization aligns management with internal and external environments, while standardization puts the burden of proof on agencies to justify exceptions. For example, small agencies were not initially required to prepare audited financial statements, showing how customization is built into general management laws. Congress allows for customization in agency management through authorizing statutes and appropriations, such as exempting small agencies from preparing audited financial statements. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense have been granted authority to customize aspects of their HRM systems. This mixed approach balances standardization with customization in applying general management laws to agencies. The mixed approach in agency management involves balancing standardization with customization. For example, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 required agencies to develop strategic plans but allowed flexibility in compliance. Standardization, customization, and mixed approaches each have advantages and disadvantages. In agency management, standardization, customization, and mixed approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Standardization can stifle creativity, while customization may reduce transparency. Mixed approaches can suffer from these problems as well. Congress considers these approaches for agency compliance. In addition to the three general approaches of standardization, customization, and mixed approaches in agency management, Congress also has policy options to avoid potential problems such as budget pressures and bidding wars for employees. The decision to use these approaches depends on various factors, and one option is to regularly assess the need for increased customization or standardization in general management laws for improved transparency, accountability, efficiency, or effectiveness. Analytical support can be obtained from various sources including agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, and the General. Standardization in general management laws is necessary for transparency, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. Analytical support can come from various sources such as agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and outside scholars. One option is to reduce the analytical burden for Congress by requiring the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions and updated comparisons across agencies. Increasing fragmentation of civil service laws may complicate the monitoring process. The compendium suggests that the increasing fragmentation of civil service laws may hinder monitoring and analysis of government-wide developments. Reporting requirements in areas of customization could help reduce the burden for Congress and the public. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, and GSA could play a role in this process. Possible changes if customization does not achieve desired outcomes could be reported in real-time on the Web by central management agencies like OMB, OPM, and GSA. This would facilitate government-wide analysis and comparisons, but may come with costs for reporting agencies. General management laws are categorized into functions like financial management, human resources, and procurement, reflecting how organizations manage themselves with a functional orientation. Functional orientation in organizations, whether in the private or public sector, is managed through functional structures. While structures may be based on \"customers\" or \"taxpayer groups,\" functional perspectives are still present in business units, shared services, and headquarters. This perspective is valued for its efficiency and centralized control benefits. However, an overly inward focus on functions can lead to coordination issues and hinder the development of general managers. This can result in functional silos operating in isolation from each other. Coordination and decision-making can be problematic in organizations when functional silos operate in isolation, hindering the development of general managers. Management literature emphasizes the importance of integrating functional perspectives within a broader general management context. Developing a general management perspective is crucial to integrating various functional viewpoints for a comprehensive understanding of problems or opportunities. This approach helps individuals move beyond their limited perspectives based on their specific backgrounds and experiences, allowing for a more holistic analysis. The general management perspective integrates multiple functional viewpoints to understand problems or opportunities. It can be applied to improve human resources and financial management using information technology. This approach offers a toolbox of options to address executive branch management issues, focusing on individual functions while also considering the interconnected nature of general management laws. The general management laws can be integrated to provide mutual support in various functional areas such as agency finances, technology procurement, and human capital issues. Integration can be achieved through changes in laws, agency statutes, appropriations, and other legislative tools. For example, leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for information technology can improve financial and performance reporting by utilizing the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The E-Government Act of 2002 aims to improve financial and performance reporting by utilizing the Federal Enterprise Architecture, directing appropriations for hiring contract oversight specialists, restructuring budget accounts, and aligning resources with individual programs and evaluations. The E-Government Act of 2002 aims to improve financial and performance reporting by restructuring budget accounts of agencies to align resources with programs and evaluations, leveraging the Chief Human Capital Officers Act for assessing staff resources for contract management and oversight. Other options include integrating various functional perspectives into general management laws. The history of federal government management reform includes various efforts to improve agencies' performance and management practices through general management laws. Despite these efforts, progress has been challenging to achieve, with Congress facing significant oversight challenges. Many efforts have been made to improve agency management practices through general management laws, but progress has been difficult to achieve. Congress faces challenges in overseeing executive branch management, particularly in ensuring compliance with laws and measuring progress. Measurement systems can motivate action but may also create perverse incentives. Mason Haire emphasizes the importance of measurement systems in driving organizational behavior. While they can motivate action, they can also lead to perverse incentives. For example, focusing solely on short-term profits in a company may neglect long-term sustainability. In the federal government, achieving clean financial audits may not indicate good fiscal management if achieved through workaround methods. Agency inspectors general have played a role in this context over the past 25 years. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported persistent management problems in executive branch agencies. GAO released reports detailing \"high risk\" areas and major challenges, noting progress but also ongoing issues. The GAO released reports on \"high risk\" areas and management challenges in government agencies, highlighting progress made but also the need for further work. Presidential administrations pursued management reform initiatives, and Congress expressed concerns about government management during this period. During the 1990s and early 2000s, government committees and their staff were concerned about the state of government management. Recommendations were made to improve central management, procurement, information resources management, financial management, and human resources management. Senator Fred Thompson highlighted urgent federal government management problems under President George W. Bush, including workforce issues, financial management, information technology, and duplication. President Bush's Office of Management and Budget introduced the President's Management Agenda with five government-wide initiatives. President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget introduced the President's Management Agenda in August 2001, which includes five government-wide initiatives to address management issues. The agenda involves quarterly evaluations of agencies based on \"stoplight scores\" to measure progress in areas such as human capital, competitive sourcing, financial performance, electronic government, and budget integration. The evaluations use red, yellow, or green ratings to indicate the status of each initiative. The President's Management Agenda introduced in 2001 includes five government-wide initiatives to address management issues. Agencies are evaluated quarterly based on \"stoplight scores\" using red, yellow, or green ratings to indicate the status of each initiative. The evaluations assess progress against deliverables and timelines, with green indicating implementation according to plans, yellow showing slippage or issues requiring adjustment, and red signaling serious jeopardy and the need for significant management intervention. The five government-wide PMA initiatives are categorized into functional categories and are meant to be mutually reinforcing. They leverage various general management laws to achieve their goals, such as the FAIR Act of 1998 and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The initiatives are currently facing challenges and are unlikely to achieve their objectives without significant management intervention. The PMA initiatives leverage various general management laws to achieve their goals, such as the FAIR Act of 1998 and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. Some agencies have reported significant progress, but there are concerns about PMA evaluation practices and congressional oversight. The PMA is being taken seriously with significant progress, but there are concerns about transparency in evaluation practices outside the executive branch.OMB assessments using the PART tool were more transparent, with detailed evidence released to increase transparency. The President's FY2004 budget proposal included detailed worksheets for transparency in OMB assessments of agency programs. The stoplight scoring criteria may introduce subjectivity, with examples including the need for acceptable IT business cases and leadership talent pools. Independent evaluation organizations have not verified agency stoplight scores, and the PMA may not cover all aspects of general management laws. The PMA's stoplight scoring criteria may introduce subjectivity, as independent evaluation organizations have not verified the scores. The scope of the PMA does not cover all aspects of general management laws, such as contract oversight and small business concerns. Real property management issues are also not explicitly addressed by the PMA. The executive branch, nongovernmental organizations, and Congress have all tried to influence agencies to improve management practices over the years. The executive branch, nongovernmental organizations, and Congress have tried to influence agencies to improve management practices. Agency IGs, GAO, OMB, and Congress have focused on specific problems and created \"high risk\" programs. Some, like Representative Stephen Horn and Senator Fred Thompson, have issued grades to evaluate agency performance on general management laws. Representative Adam Putnam and Senator Fred Thompson have evaluated agency performance on information security and general management laws. Congress is considering options to ensure agencies comply with management laws and improve practices. This includes maintaining current oversight tools and finding ways to measure agency progress effectively. Congress is exploring ways to measure agency progress in improving management practices, including maintaining current oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs or implementing independent verification and validation of PMA stoplight scores. Congress could improve its oversight by utilizing independent verification and validation from GAO and agency IGs to verify PMA stoplight scores. Another option is to increase transparency by accessing final PMA stoplight worksheets from OMB or agencies. Additionally, Congress could implement independent measurement by directing GAO or IGs to develop measures. Congress could improve oversight by implementing independent measurement through GAO or IGs to develop measures for agency progress in improving management practices. This option could make management improvement measurement more systematic and easily comparable across agencies, but may increase workload and costs. Congress could amend GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports. This could include establishing milestones and timelines for improvement and requiring the President to address these issues in the government-wide performance plan. This option may increase workload for agency and OMB personnel. The expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions and interagency councils is a major theme in general management laws. These chief officers, also known as \"CXOs,\" head various functions within agencies and include inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. This option could make management improvement measurement statutory or more systematic, but may increase workload for agency and OMB personnel. The expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions includes inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. These officers were established by statute in chronological order and have specific functions and appointment rules. Some are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by agency heads. The expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions includes inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. These officers have specific functions and appointment rules, with some being presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation. Reporting relationships vary among the officers, with some required to report directly to the agency head. The creation of these positions aimed to address the lack of attention to functional perspectives in managing executive branch agencies. The creation of agency \"chief officer\" positions aimed to address the lack of attention to functional perspectives in managing executive branch agencies. Observers believed that senior managers paid insufficient attention to functional perspectives, leading to the need to elevate each perspective within agencies' management ranks. Chief officers were placed into interagency councils by statute or executive order. Key information about each council is summarized in Table 2. Four councils were established by law, while two exist through executive order. The Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management chairs or vice-chairs each council, allowing the Executive Office of the President to influence their activities. The first council, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE), was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 through executive order. President Ronald Reagan established the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) in 1981 through executive order to coordinate government-wide efforts against fraud and waste. The PCIE became a valuable tool for agency Inspectors General to enhance their lobbying power and build informal networks for organizational learning. Standing committees were established to facilitate idea-sharing and collaboration among IGs. The PCIE was established in 1981 to coordinate government-wide efforts against fraud and waste. It allowed agency Inspectors General to build informal networks for organizational learning through standing committees. Despite positive feedback from IGs, the PCIE was also criticized as a \"trade union\" in the late 1980s. The PCIE was established in 1981 to address fraud, waste, and abuse issues. President George H. W. Bush later created the ECIE for IGs appointed by agency heads. The CFO Council was established by the CFO Act of 1990, giving the DDM chairperson status over the council. The CFO Act established the DDM position in the President's Office of Management and Budget, giving them responsibility for general management policies in various areas. In 1994, the CFO Council took steps to become more active by broadening membership, electing officers, and setting their own agenda. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act, elects council officers, sets its own agenda, and has the support of OMB. It serves as a model for other interagency efforts and led to the creation of additional chief officer councils. The establishment of IGs, CFOs, and CIOs has been generally well-received. The establishment of three additional chief officer councils - the CIO Council in 2002, the CHCO Council in 2002, and the CAO Council in 2003 - has been generally well-received. These chief officer positions have been successful in bringing focus to their functional perspectives, but face challenges such as high turnover among CIOs and difficulties with change management. Agencies continue to struggle with management difficulties despite the creation of these positions. The establishment of additional chief officer councils in 2002 and 2003 has been well-received, but agencies still face management difficulties despite these positions. Scholars are concerned about functional silos and the lack of integrated general management perspective. Interagency collaboration is seen as beneficial, with increasing attention from public management scholars. Observers generally agree that interagency councils have been beneficial, with increasing attention from public management scholars on the potential benefits of interagency collaboration. Testimony from a former OMB official highlighted the importance of setting up networks of people to share knowledge and best practices for improving federal management. Interagency collaboration and knowledge sharing among human capital officers in the Federal Government are crucial for organizational performance. Attention to knowledge management is important, but a narrow functional perspective should be avoided to prevent neglecting other functions. Re-thinking the structure is necessary for improving federal executive branch management. The need to avoid a narrow functional perspective in improving federal executive branch management is emphasized. Questions regarding the structure and role of OMB, chief officers, and interagency councils are raised, with options outlined for consideration. The need to improve federal executive branch management raises questions about the structure and funding of interagency councils. One option is to establish agency \"chief security officers\" to ensure government services are available in emergencies. These officers may focus on information technology and report to the company CIO. Many corporate chief executive officers have designated Chief Security Officers (CSOs) who handle information technology and security responsibilities. While creating statutory CSO positions could lead to turf battles with CIOs, it may bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management at federal agencies. Some argue that adding more chief officers would be excessive, as many agencies already have systems in place. Many observers believe agencies lack proper program evaluation, possibly due to capacity, management attention, or resources. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" positions in major agencies could address this issue by bringing more attention to program evaluation. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" positions in major agencies could create a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams. Chief officer appointments can vary in terms of political or career requirements, with some left to agency head discretion. Table 1 outlines the appointment positions for chief officers under current law, with some required to be political, others career, and some at the agency head's discretion. Recent discussions have debated the benefits of political appointees having a \"seat at the table\" for functional perspectives, while career officials offer continuity across administrations. Similar arguments apply to CAOs, with Congress reflecting these perspectives in the CFO Act by appointing CFOs as political and deputies as career. In enacting the CFO Act, Congress established political CFOs and career deputies. Chief officers like CFOs and CIOs must report to the agency head, while reporting relationships for CHCOs and CAOs vary by agency. Direct reporting to the agency head ensures chief officers have personal access to senior leadership, but agency heads may have many direct reports. The argument for a direct reporting relationship to the agency head is to provide chief officers with personal access to senior leadership. However, adding another direct report could overwhelm agency heads with too many subordinates. Congress may consider making IG councils statutory to formalize their mandates, as suggested by the vice chair of the PCIE. The vice chair of the PCIE believes codification of the two councils would require modest appropriations but improve training, strengthen IG-Congress relationship, and enhance coordination. Funding for IG councils is self-financed through MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. The IG councils self-finance their activities through MOUs, while the CHCO Council is funded by the Office of Personnel Management. The CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Council are funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements. The CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Councils have been funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements in recent years. Congress could maintain the current funding method or consider making a separate appropriation for each council individually or combined. This could potentially give Congress more control over the councils' activities and improve institutional memory and continuity across presidential administrations. Congress could consider altering the reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils to improve institutional memory and continuity. Some councils currently have no reporting or planning requirements, and Congress could require them to submit plans or reports to the President or Congress. The CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils do not have statutory requirements to report to Congress or prepare strategic plans. Congress could require them to submit plans or reports to the President or Congress. OMB could be required to submit an overall plan for leading the councils as part of the government-wide performance plan. Planning and reporting requirements may increase transparency and accountability but could limit the President's discretion and increase costs."
