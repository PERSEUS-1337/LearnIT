The Act defines \"catastrophic event\" as any natural disaster or fire, flood, or explosion, and \"conclusion\" as including containment of the event. It also defines \"National Scenic Area\" as an area with outstanding natural, scenic, and recreational values. Within 30 days after a catastrophic event in a National Scenic Area, the Secretary must propose response activities for the affected lands.

Public input and a response process are required, including a 30-day public scoping and comment period, a 15-day objection filing period, and a 15-day agency response period. After completion of the process, the Secretary will implement the response activity. An expedited environmental assessment is also required. The Secretary must propose response activities within 30 days of a catastrophic event in a National Scenic Area.
