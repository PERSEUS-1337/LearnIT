    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Crop Insurance Fairness Act\" allows for coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of recorded or appraised average yield. Subsection (a) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(a)) is amended to allow the Corporation to insure agricultural producers in the United States against various unavoidable causes of loss, including drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, and more, as determined by the Board. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows insurance coverage for agricultural producers against various causes of loss such as flood, hail, wind, frost, winterkill, lightning, fire, excessive rain, snow, wildlife, hurricane, tornado, insect infestation, and plant disease. Insurance coverage does not extend beyond the period the insured commodity is in the field, with aquacultural species defined as the environment in which the commodity is produced. Standard yield coverage is available to protect producers against loss in yield. The Federal Crop Insurance Act provides coverage for agricultural producers against various causes of loss. Standard yield coverage offers protection against yield loss up to 75% of the average yield of the commodity on the insured farm. Adjustments may be made to ensure fairness. Additionally, lesser levels of yield coverage are available to producers. The Federal Crop Insurance Act offers coverage for agricultural producers against yield loss, with standard coverage up to 75% of the average yield. Producers can also access lesser levels of coverage, including 50% coverage. Adjustments may be made based on established yields for fairness. The Federal Crop Insurance Act provides coverage for agricultural producers against yield loss. If the yield is higher than the recorded or appraised yield, insurance can cover the loss based on the adjusted yield established by the Service. Additional premiums are set by the Board to accurately reflect the increased risk and cover claims for losses. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows for coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield if normal yield variations have not led to loss claims. The insurance premiums must accurately reflect the increased risk and cover potential losses. The Federal Crop Insurance Act limits coverage to 75 percent of the average yield, with exceptions for normal yield variations not resulting in loss claims. The projected market price option must be at least 90 percent of the market price, and uninsured losses are not covered for neglect or malfeasance by the producer. Insurance provided under this subsection does not cover losses due to neglect or malfeasance of the producer, failure to reseed in customary circumstances, or failure to follow good farming practices. The Board has the authority to limit or refuse insurance based on the insurance risk involved. Insurance will not be provided on agricultural commodities in counties where the income from the commodity is deemed unimportant. The Corporation will not provide insurance on agricultural commodities in counties where the income from the commodity is considered unimportant. Additionally, the Corporation is required to report annually to Congress on the results of its operations for each insured commodity. Starting in 1992, a minimum price level for each insured commodity will be established by the Corporation, based on projected market prices determined by the Board. The Corporation will establish a price level for each commodity for insurance coverage, not less than the projected market price determined by the Board. Insurance coverage will be available based on the price election set by the Board, quoted in dollars per acre. SEC. 3. LATE PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include late planting coverage, allowing producers to plant after the final planting date for up to 25 days with reduced yield guarantee. Late planting coverage is provided under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, allowing producers to plant after the final planting date for up to 25 days with reduced yield guarantee. Producers have the option to waive this coverage, and if it significantly increases premiums, the Corporation must offer alternatives to encourage program participation. If late planting coverage would raise premiums significantly, the Corporation must offer it as a separate endorsement to encourage program participation. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers. This coverage allows for 50% of the guaranteed level of coverage if planting is prevented due to excess moisture, drought, or natural disasters. Producers also have the option to plant a substitute crop under this policy. The producers on a farm have the option to plant a substitute crop instead of an insured crop, which will offset the guaranteed coverage. They are presumed to have prevented planting coverage unless they waive it, and if offering this coverage would increase premiums significantly, the Corporation will make adjustments to encourage participation in the program. If prevented planting coverage would raise premiums significantly, the Corporation will offer it as a separate endorsement to encourage participation in the program. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF PENALTY FOR DE MINIMIS YIELDS. The Corporation will establish a procedure where producers with disaster losses won't have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of production is lower than harvesting costs. SEC. 6. YIELD AVERAGES. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include provisions for yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 years. The Corporation will establish a minimum insurance protection level for producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters. Transitional yield data can only be used for establishing yields. Producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters can use transitional or actual yields to establish yield coverage. Transitional yield data is only allowed if actual production history is not established for the first 4 crop years. After that, coverage is based on actual production history. For new parcels of land, yields from previous crop years can be used for crop insurance purposes. For new parcels of land, producers can use previous yield history or transitional yield data for crop insurance purposes. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to account for producers. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to consider producer yield declines from natural disasters, defining transitional yield as the countywide average used when no actual production records are available."
