    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their overall health, self-esteem, and behavior. Participation in high-quality daily physical education programs leads to better health and fitness, especially important as the rate of overweight young people has more than doubled in the 30 years preceding 1999. Children who participate in high quality daily physical education programs tend to be more healthy and physically fit. The percentage of young people who are overweight has more than doubled in the 30 years preceding 1999. Low levels of activity contribute to the high prevalence of obesity among children in the United States. Obesity related diseases cost the United States economy more than $100,000,000,000 every year. Inactivity and poor diet cause at least 300,000 deaths a year in the United States. Physically fit adults have significantly reduced risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. Children are not as active as they should be and fewer than 1 in 4 children get 20 minutes of vigorous activity every day of the week. \"Physically fit adults have reduced risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. Children are not as active as they should be, with less than 1 in 4 getting 20 minutes of vigorous activity daily. Recommendations for daily physical education for all students in kindergarten through grade 12 have not seen much progress since 1987.\" Despite recommendations for daily physical education programs for all students in kindergarten through grade 12 to promote health and fitness, little progress has been made in providing high-quality programs. It is essential for every student to have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education to develop physical competence and cognitive understanding about physical activity, leading to healthy and active lifestyles. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Applications and program requirements are outlined. The local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals and state standards. The goals include fitness education, motor skills instruction, and overall physical well-being. Physical education programs may provide fitness education, motor skills instruction, cognitive concepts about physical fitness, social skills development, and instruction in healthy eating habits. Teachers of physical education must be qualified for these programs. Physical education programs focus on developing cooperative skills through physical activity and teaching healthy eating habits. Teachers of physical education are required to undergo professional development to stay updated on the latest research and trends in the field. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC programs are not considered part of the curriculum for physical education programs assisted under this part. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies, as well as between agencies serving large and small student populations. Funds may include participation of private school and home-schooled students. Continued funding requires a report. \"Continued funding for grants or contracts under this part requires an annual report on activities and progress towards goals. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on program success and recommendations for improvement. Administrative costs are also addressed.\" \"Administrative costs for local educational agencies receiving grant funds are limited to 5 percent. The Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 90 percent in the first year and 75 percent in subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other available Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also specified.\" Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 is set at $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 for each year from 2002 to 2004. The allocated funds will remain available until expended."
