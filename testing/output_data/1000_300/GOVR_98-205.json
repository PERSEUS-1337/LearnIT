    "content": "The House and Senate approved conference agreements on defense bills for FY1999, with additional funding of $8.3 billion for various defense-related purposes. The President signed both bills into law on October 17, and an omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 was approved on October 20 and 21. The FY1999 defense bills were approved with additional funding of $8.3 billion for various defense-related purposes, including Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense and other purposes, signed into law on October 21 as P.L. 105-277. The FY1999 defense bills included funding for various defense-related purposes such as Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, and antiterrorism activities. The bill primarily allocated funds for programs under the Department of Defense, with additional amounts for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community management. The total national defense budget function was $270.6 billion, with $250.8 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. The FY1999 defense budget included $270.6 billion for national defense, with $250.8 billion in the defense appropriations bill. Congress acts on both defense authorization and appropriations bills annually, with major policy and funding debates usually focused on the authorization bill. Congressional action on the defense bills was completed on October 1. The defense authorization and appropriations bills were completed by Congress on October 1. The House and Senate allocated funds for defense programs, with the final Senate allocations totaling $250.290 billion in budget authority and $244.942 billion. The final Senate allocations for defense programs are $250.290 billion in budget authority and $244.942 billion in outlays, slightly below the Administration's request. The House allocations provide $250.499 billion in budget authority and $244.965 billion in outlays for national security programs. See Table B-1 in Appendix B for details on defense discretionary funds. The House and Senate approved the FY1999 defense authorization bill with amendments in May and June. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization bill in September, and it was signed into law in October as P.L. 105-261. The authorization conference agreement was reached in September and signed into law in October as P.L. 105-261. The House and Senate passed their respective FY1999 defense appropriations bills in June, with the Senate ultimately passing H.R. 4103 in July. The Senate passed its version of the FY1999 defense appropriations bill, S. 2132, in July. The conference report was approved by the House and Senate in September, with the President signing the bill into law as P.L. 105-262 in October. Additionally, the Senate approved S.Con.Res. 86 for the congressional budget resolution in April, while the House approved H.Con.Res. 284 in June, but a conference agreement was never completed. The House approved H.Con.Res. 284 for the congressional budget resolution in June. A conference agreement was never completed. Supplemental defense appropriations for FY1998 were approved for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, domestic and defense disaster relief, totaling $2.7 billion for the Defense Department. The bill provides $2.7 billion for the Defense Department, including funding for Bosnia, Southwest Asia, disaster relief, and other defense programs. Additionally, an omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 approved $8.3 billion in defense-related funding for various purposes such as Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, and defense health program. The omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 approved $8.3 billion in defense-related funding for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, defense health program, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, defense antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill resolved major issues including relations with China, with the conference agreement dropping language banning satellite exports. China was a contentious issue in the Senate debate on the authorization bill. The conference agreement on the FY1999 defense appropriations bill dropped contentious China-related amendments, including a ban on satellite exports to China. Instead, provisions were included to transfer technology export review to the State Department, require congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibit missile equipment exports unless certain conditions are met. Additionally, the agreement includes a measure to prohibit the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to COSCO. The conference agreement on the FY1999 defense appropriations bill includes measures to regulate satellite exports to China, prohibit port facility transfers to COSCO, and restrict missile equipment exports. It also prohibits DOD from doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies and requires a report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. No new military base closures were approved in the House or Senate authorization bills. The House and Senate authorization bills did not approve new rounds of military base closures. The Senate dropped a provision that would make it difficult for the Defense Department to realign military bases without a congressionally established base closure process. The House-passed bill required separation of men and women in basic training, while the Senate bill did not. The Senate rejected a proposal to separate men and women in basic training, opting to continue current integrated training practices with additional steps to separate sleeping quarters. The House-Senate conference ultimately adopted the Senate's language but included a statement urging separate training units. The House-Senate conference adopted the Senate's language on separating male and female sleeping quarters in basic training. The House authorization included a requirement for commanders to display exemplary behavior, while both chambers rejected amendments to lift the ban on abortions in military medical facilities. The House-passed bill also included a measure to prohibit the DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors. Tritium production: The House-passed bill prohibits DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors, requiring new facilities in South Carolina at a cost of $3 billion over 40 years. The Senate bill allows DOE to choose the long-term option, with a one-year review period by Congress. Active duty end-strength levels: The House rejects eliminating floors, while the Senate and both chambers maintain them. The House-passed authorization bill rejected an Administration request to eliminate floors on active duty end-strength levels. The Senate and both House and Senate versions of the appropriations bill agreed to the Administration's proposed reductions in end-strength. The authorization conference report also agrees to the Administration request. The House initially provided a pay raise of 3.6% for military personnel, while the Senate and both House and Senate versions of the appropriations bill initially provided only the requested raise of 3.1%. The Senate later approved an amendment to increase the pay raise to 3.6%. The Senate approved an amendment to increase the pay raise for military personnel to 3.6%, offset by a reduction in R&D funds. Senators Stevens and Inouye cosponsored the amendment. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide for the 3.6% raise. The Senate-passed defense appropriations bill included $1.9 billion for Bosnia as emergency funding. The House bill did not include this funding. The Senate and House bills differed on funding for Bosnia, with the Senate approving $1.9 billion as emergency appropriations while the House did not. The Senate also included a provision for a pay raise for military personnel, which was offset by a reduction in R&D funds. The House-passed bill included a provision to cap Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion, with the option for additional funds to protect U.S. troops, which the Administration objected to. Both houses rejected measures to withdraw troops by a specific date, but the Senate bill encouraged conditions for a drawdown of forces in Bosnia. The authorization bill includes $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, with the option for larger expenditures if certified by the President. Contentious weapons issues were minimal, with the Administration objecting to additional C-130J aircraft funding in the House bills. The Administration objected to additional funding for C-130J aircraft in the House bills, but the authorization and appropriations conference agreements provided funds for 7 aircraft, more than requested. Funding for the THAAD system was reduced after a test failure in May, with the authorization conference agreement cutting $294 million and the appropriations conference agreement cutting $376 million. Funding for the MEADS system was also reduced or eliminated in the Senate bills. The conference agreement cuts funding for the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, including the Medium Extended-Range Air Defense System (MEADS). The authorization conference agreement reduces funding to $24 million and prohibits expenditure unless MEADS is included in future budget plans. The appropriations conference agreement provides only $10 million. Funding for the Airborne Laser (ABL) program was also reduced, while funding for Space-Based Laser (SBL) R&D was increased. The Administration objected to these changes, but the authorization conference agreement follows the Senate's decisions. The authorization conference agreement provides funding for the Airborne Laser (ABL) program and increased funding for Space-Based Laser (SBL) R&D. Both House and Senate appropriations bills reduced funding for new aircraft carrier development. The Navy wanted to use some of the money for progressive changes in the current design. The authorization conference agreement provides $110 million and the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million of the $190 million requested. The Senate authorization and appropriations bills included advance procurement funds for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship. The Senate authorization and appropriations bills included funds for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship, despite objections from some lawmakers. The authorization conference agreement allocated $50 million and the appropriations agreement $45 million. There were disagreements between the House and Senate on the procurement of new F/A-18E/F aircraft, with the House adding funds for two unrequested F-16 aircraft. Ultimately, 30 F-18s and one F-16 were funded. The Administration objected to certain testing requirements for the F-22 aircraft in the Senate authorization bill, but the authorization conference included the restrictions with the ability to waive them. Additionally, there were cuts in other areas to finance increases in certain programs. The authorization conference included restrictions on aircraft testing before procurement contracts are signed, with the ability to waive them. The Administration objected to cuts in other areas to fund increases in certain programs. Long-term weapons issues were resolved, including the B-2 bomber procurement battle. Both House and Senate bills ensured military retirees' access to the defense health care system. The House and Senate authorization bills addressed military health care for retirees, including pilot projects to test alternative approaches and access to the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. Budget constraints, results of the Quadrennial Defense Review, and ongoing battles over social issues were key factors in this year's defense agenda. The defense debate this year covered various key topics such as military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology exports controls, military readiness, defense modernization funding, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues, and military health care policy. The defense debate in FY1999 included discussions on various key topics such as ballistic missile defense, the B-2 bomber, fighter aircraft, shipbuilding, sexual harassment, gender-integrated training, military health care policy, and budget constraints. Congress faced a \"zero-sum game\" due to budget constraints, where any additions to favored programs or rejected reductions had to be offset by cuts in other defense programs. In FY1999, the defense debate involved key topics like ballistic missile defense, the B-2 bomber, and budget constraints. Congress faced a \"zero-sum game\" where any additions to favored programs had to be offset by cuts in other defense programs. Congress provided an additional $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill, leading to potential conflicts with the Administration over defense priorities. Senior Administration officials tried to avoid confrontations by meeting to discuss the budget constraints. In FY1999, Congress added money for programs it felt the Administration had neglected and cut high priority programs to pay for it. Senior Administration officials tried to avoid conflicts by meeting Congress halfway on ongoing programs. The defense budget debate did not lead to contentious House and Senate actions on defense authorization and appropriations bills. Some money was provided for unrequested weapons. In FY1999, Congress added funds for programs it deemed neglected by the Administration and cut high priority programs to compensate. The defense budget debate did not result in contentious House and Senate actions on defense bills. Some money was allocated for unrequested weapons, with additional funds later added for defense, mainly for ballistic missile defense. The congressional defense debate was influenced by the Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent reports. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and two subsequent reports - the Defense Reform Initiative report and the National Defense Panel report - were released in 1997. The QDR proposed a revised U.S. defense strategy, reaffirmed the need to prevail in two major theater wars, and suggested measures to reduce pressures from smaller-scale contingency operations. These reports will continue to be important topics of discussion in Congress. The QDR, Defense Reform Initiative, and National Defense Panel reports in 1997 emphasized the need for U.S. forces to prevail in two major theater wars, reduce pressures from smaller-scale operations, and focus on efficiency and modernization. The National Defense Panel report also called for a greater emphasis on homeland defense and preparing for future threats. The National Defense Panel recommended a shift in focus towards homeland defense and preparing for future threats, calling for increased spending on experimental force exercises and new technology. Additionally, the Panel suggested two more rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs, a proposal that was not well-received by Congress. Secretary Cohen pushed for congressional approval of two new base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005, emphasizing the need for savings to fund upcoming weapons programs. The Defense Department's report projected annual savings of $2.8 billion from future base closure rounds, building on previous rounds' estimated savings of $5.6 billion per year. The Defense Department projects annual savings of $2.8 billion from future base closure rounds to fund upcoming weapons programs. Resistance in Congress stems from objections to the Administration's actions following the 1995 base closure round. The White House's plan to \"privatize in place\" at two Air Force aircraft depot maintenance facilities is now being implemented. The Administration's plan to \"privatize in place\" at two Air Force facilities is being implemented, leading to competition for contracts and better prices. However, many Members of Congress believe this plan politicized the base closure process and eroded support for further closures. The Defense Department is considering privatization at the Sacramento facility, despite concerns that it could hinder future base closures. Secretary Cohen suggests Congress could prohibit privatization and approve more base closures to prepare for the long-term defense plan. Congressional action on additional base closures for FY1999 defense authorization was unsuccessful. Congressional action on additional base closures for FY1999 defense authorization was unsuccessful, with the Senate voting down a proposal for one more base closure round in 2001. An amendment by Senator Inhofe to make it harder for DOD to realign facilities without a base closure process was approved but later dropped. Senator Inhofe predicted that Congress would approve another base closure round for 2001. The Administration requested supplemental appropriations for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. Congress approved funding for FY1998 in H.R. 3579 and for FY1999 in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328). The Administration requested additional funding for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. Congress approved funding for FY1999 in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328), with a proposal to designate the funding as \"emergency\" appropriations to avoid cuts in other defense programs. This proposal was contentious as it broke the previous practice of including anticipated costs in regular defense appropriations within established spending caps. The Administration requested additional funding for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. Congress approved funding for FY1999 in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328), with a proposal to designate the funding as \"emergency\" appropriations to avoid cuts in other defense programs. The FY1998 and FY1999 supplemental funding for ongoing military operations in Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, and elsewhere broke the precedent of including anticipated costs in regular defense appropriations within established spending caps. Congressional action included approving $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations. The SASC approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations, with an additional $100 million available for emergencies to protect U.S. troops. The HNSC set a cap of $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia operations without prior congressional approval. The Senate approved an amendment urging funding for Bosnia. The Senate rejected an amendment to cut off funds for Bosnia operations without prior congressional approval. Senator Thurmond urged a reduction in U.S. troop levels in Bosnia, while Senator Stevens proposed $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations for defense. Representative Skaggs proposed a provision to prohibit offensive military expenditures in the House-passed appropriations bill. Stevens proposed $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations for defense in the defense appropriations bill. The House included a provision by Representative Skaggs to restrict expenditures on offensive military action without prior congressional approval. The Senate voted to table a similar amendment by Senator Durbin. The White House threatened a veto if the Skaggs provision was included. The authorization conference agreement approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia, contingent on presidential certification for national security needs without reducing readiness. Emergency funding for Bosnia was not included in the appropriations conference agreement. The appropriations conference agreement allows expenditure exceeding the provided amount if certified necessary for national security without reducing readiness. Emergency funding for Bosnia was not included, leaving it for future consideration. The Skaggs amendment was dropped. $1.9 billion emergency funding for Bosnia was provided in the FY1999 Omnibus appropriations bill. Congressional focus on relations with China, technology exports controls, and nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. The House approved amendments to restrict technology exports to China and other countries, including limiting missile and satellite technology exports, transferring export review responsibility to the State Department, and allowing Congress to review nuclear technology exports. The White House objected to these measures. The bill also included a provision to prohibit the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard. The House approved amendments to restrict technology exports to China and other countries, including limiting missile and satellite technology exports. The White House objected to these measures. The House-passed bill also included a provision to prohibit the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. In the Senate, a number of amendments concerning technology exports to China and trade sanctions were proposed. Senator Hutchinson's China-related amendments were rejected, and debate on China policy was postponed. Senator Stevens delayed floor action on the bill due to concerns about contentious amendments. Ultimately, the Senate considered various issues related to China. Senator Stevens delayed floor action on the defense appropriations bill due to concerns about contentious amendments, including those related to China. Senator Hutchinson eventually offered a revised amendment requiring the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions, sterilization, or genital mutilation, which passed unanimously. The authorization conference agreement removed House language banning satellite exports to China but included provisions transferring technology export review from the Commerce Department to the State Department and requiring advanced congressional notification for satellite sales to China. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill includes provisions transferring technology export review to the State Department, requiring advanced congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibiting the export of missile equipment or technology to China without certification from the President. It also includes efficiency measures recommended by the QDR and Defense Reform Initiative. The Defense Reform Initiative report and the QDR recommended efficiency measures, including a one-third reduction in OSD staff, cuts in support personnel, and public-private competitions for activities currently done by civilian DOD employees. Congress has pressured the Defense Department to reduce overhead activities, but also imposed barriers to reducing civilian personnel levels. Issues this year include whether cuts in OSD and headquarters personnel are substantial or just on paper. The Defense Department is facing challenges in reducing overhead activities and civilian personnel levels. Congress is debating whether cuts in personnel are substantial or just on paper, and how to react to privatization measures. The House has pushed for deep cuts in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration have sought to soften these measures. Congressional action includes urging the Defense Department not to waive cuts. The House has resisted proposals to open weapons maintenance and other activities to private competition. HNSC urged the Defense Department not to waive cuts in acquisition personnel mandated in last year's defense authorization act. HNSC imposed a $500 million across-the-board cut in funding for consultants. The White House objected to the cut in consulting funds and several measures in the House-passed authorization bill. The authorization conference agreement includes a measure to withhold 10% of funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense unless DOD meets all statutory requirements to cut headquarters. The House-passed authorization bill includes measures to cut acquisition personnel, consultants, and Assistant Secretary of Defense positions. Congressional focus on military readiness highlights issues such as shortages in spare engines, Army personnel, and pilot retention rates in the Air Force and Navy. The House-passed authorization bill addresses military readiness concerns, including shortages in spare engines, Army personnel, and pilot retention rates in the Air Force and Navy. Some believe these issues indicate an imminent readiness crisis due to inadequate funding and excessive overseas missions. Administration officials acknowledge some problems but deny an overall readiness crisis, stating that early deploying units remain fully ready. Officials insist that despite anecdotal evidence of problems, overall readiness reports show a highly qualified and capable force. Issues like Air Force engine spares shortages and pilot retention are being addressed with changes in planning models and increased reenlistment bonuses. Army recruiting continues to meet quality goals, but concerns about readiness persist. Congress approved higher pilot reenlistment bonuses and steps are being taken to limit deployments. Concerns about personnel recruitment and retention have been expressed by officials. The President met with senior military officers to address readiness problems and urged higher defense spending. The Joint Chiefs testified about the need for over $17 billion per year in additional defense spending. Congressional action included restructuring funding for depot maintenance and real property. In response to concerns raised by officials, Congress took action by restructuring funding for depot maintenance and real property. The Senate approved amendments requiring reports on food stamp use by military families and acknowledging that readiness has been impacted by declining budgets and expanded missions. The Joint Chiefs identified shortfalls of up to $135 billion over five years, leading to calls for increased defense spending. The Senate adopted measures to address declining budgets and expanded missions impacting military readiness, including increased funding for recruiting, troop benefits, and quality of life measures. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill allocated $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness but did not make changes to military retirement benefits. Concerns also exist regarding long-term funding for defense modernization programs. The Administration has prioritized readiness-related funding over weapons procurement, leading to reallocation of funds. The FY1999 budget shows a slight decline in procurement funding, mainly due to adjustments following the Quadrennial Defense Review. Additionally, concerns persist about long-term funding for defense modernization programs. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001, relying on efficiency savings and base closures. However, achieving this goal without raising overall defense spending is challenging, as historical trends and rising maintenance costs pose obstacles. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001 through base closures and efficiency savings. However, reaching this target is challenging due to rising maintenance costs and other potential expenses. Under Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler noted the difficulty in meeting the procurement target. Congressional bills do not include substantial increases in modernization funding, except for $1 billion for BMD programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. Military personnel end-strength levels are also being reduced as mandated by the QDR. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $1 billion for BMD programs, but no other funds for weapons modernization. The QDR mandated a cut of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions through about the year 2003. There has been resistance in Congress to proposed personnel cuts, with concerns about active duty forces being strained by contingency operations and forward presence abroad. The Army has shortages in certain skills, relying on individual reservists to fill out units in the event of a major conflict. The Army has long had shortages in certain skills, relying on reservists to fill out units in major conflicts. Congress must agree to reduce active duty personnel levels to carry out QDR reductions. The Administration requested a reduction of over 35,000 personnel from the authorized FY1998 level. Congressional action: The Administration requested a reduction of over 35,000 active duty personnel from the authorized FY1998 level. HNSC rejected the request to repeal statutory floors on end-strength and agreed to reduce authorized end-strength by 11,000 fewer positions than the Administration wanted. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. The House and Senate versions of the defense appropriations bill assumed the cuts in end-strength in FY1999. The authorization conference report agreed to the Administration's request. A dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of ARNG combat units escalated after the QDR. The authorization conference report agrees to the Administration request for National Guard and reserve issues. A dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of ARNG combat units escalated after the QDR. Congress approved a measure requiring the appointment of Guard and Reserve officers as special advisors to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The Defense Department has requested more money for Guard and reserve weapons procurement. The Army Chief of Staff is working to ease the ongoing dispute with ARNG leaders. Congress has consistently added funds for Guard and reserve weapons programs. The Department has requested more money for Guard and reserve weapons procurement, while the Army Chief of Staff is working to ease disputes with ARNG leaders. Congress has consistently added funds for Guard and reserve weapons programs, including for major weapons programs like Missile defense. This year, Congress is focusing on missile defense programs, including National Missile Defense (NMD) and Theater Missile Defense (TMD). The Administration has increased funding for NMD programs, but major policy disputes remain unresolved. There is a plan to develop NMD technology without deploying a system yet, with hopes of preserving the 1972 ABM Treaty. Missile defense advocates in Congress argue for early deployment due to threats to the United States. The Administration is deferring a decision on deploying a missile defense system to preserve the 1972 ABM Treaty, while Congress advocates for early deployment due to threats to the United States. Disputes over TMD systems, including THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS, continue. The Administration has delayed THAAD development due to test failures and wants to delay Navy system procurement until after THAAD procurement is underway. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies to improve air/missile defense for forward deployed troops. The Administration has deferred a decision on deploying a missile defense system to preserve the ABM Treaty, while Congress advocates for early deployment due to threats to the United States. Disputes over TMD systems, including THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS, continue. Congress has considered separate legislation for missile defense policy, with the Senate failing to invoke cloture on the bill. Congressional action on TMD programs has also taken place earlier in the year. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on the bill for \"The American Missile Protection Act of 1998,\" which called for nationwide defense deployment. Congress approved additional funding for TMD programs in FY1998, including $147 million in H.R. 2786 and $179 million in H.R. 3579. The House-passed FY1999 authorization included more funding for Navy Area Defense and other TMD systems, while the SASC version added funding for Navy Theater Wide but reduced THAAD. However, the THAAD program faced its fifth test failure on May 12. The Senate approved an amendment to reduce funding for the THAAD program due to test failures. The House also restructured the THAAD program by requiring a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting funds from engineering to technology development. MEADS funding was cut and DOD was required to study alternatives. No additional funding was added for NMD. The Senate appropriations bill cut funding for the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program by $97 million and increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D by $94 million. Additionally, $57 million was cut from the ABL program. The Navy Theater Wide TMD system development was endorsed as an alternative to THAAD, with budget additions ranging from $70 million to $150 million. The congressional defense committees have endorsed accelerated development of the Navy Theater Wide TMD system with budget additions ranging from $70 million to $150 million. The authorization conference cut THAAD by $294 million and reduced MEADS by $19 million to $24 million. The appropriations conference agreement further cut THAAD by $376 million, reduced MEADS to $10 million, and cut the Airborne Laser by $25 million. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes an additional $1 billion for missile defense. Members of Congress have proposed procurement of 9 more B-2 bombers. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes an additional $1 billion for missile defense. Some Members of Congress have proposed procurement of 9 more B-2 bombers, but a recent study recommended against it due to cost. Congressional action this year does not add money for more B-2 bombers, potentially marking the end of the B-2 battle. The FY1999 defense bills do not allocate funds for more B-2 bombers, potentially ending the B-2 battle. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development: Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter. Congress is debating the affordability of all three programs, with concerns about the cost of the F-22 in the Senate. Some Members of Congress believe DOD cannot afford all three new fighter aircraft programs. The cost of the F-22 is a major concern in the Senate. Congressional actions include reducing F/A-18E/F procurement and setting requirements for F-22 flight tests before further funding is released. The authorization bill rejected a Bumpers amendment for 601 hours of flight testing before the next procurement round. The Administration objected to this Senate requirement. The authorization and appropriations conferences approved funds for 30 F-18s and waived the flight test requirement for the F-22. Congress has increased shipbuilding programs to avoid production gaps and ensure shipyards have enough work. A major issue is the procurement of the CVN-77, the last planned Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. DOD moved up the procurement to FY2001 from FY2002. The procurement issue with the CVN-77, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, has been moved up to FY2001 from FY2002. Newport News Shipbuilding's \"Smart Buy\" proposal aimed to save the Navy $600 million, but the new DOD plan avoids a big bill in FY1999 and FY2000. Another issue involves the development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer by Ingalls Shipbuilding Company and Bath Iron Works. The Navy has reached agreements with shipbuilders and combat system integrators to form teams for the development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer. Plans for a new-design aircraft carrier, known as the \"CVX,\" have been abandoned in favor of incremental improvements to the next three Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval has been given for the Administration's actions. The Navy has decided to pursue incremental improvements to the next three Nimitz-class carriers instead of developing a new-design aircraft carrier known as the \"CVX.\" Congressional approval has been given for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a new Attack Submarine (NSSN). Additionally, $50 million has been added for advance procurement of a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship. The Navy added $50 million for advance procurement of a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship instead of overhauling older ships. There are concerns about the allocation of funds for carrier R&D, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending a reduction in funding for CVX R&D and an increase for CVN-77 upgrades. The Appropriations Committee recommended a $130 million reduction in funding for CVX R&D and a $50 million increase for CVN-77 under program element (PE) 0603512N. They also cut $35.7 million for CVX feasibility studies and recommended a $5 million increase for a red team study. The House Appropriations bill reduced funding for CVX by $100 million, while the authorization conference agreement provides $110 million for CVX R&D and appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million. Additionally, the Administration did not request funding for additional F-16 aircraft in the FY1999 budget. Congress supported low level procurement of F-16 aircraft to maintain production lines, boost foreign sales, and meet Air Force needs. Funding for JSTARS aircraft was a concern, with plans to reduce procurement from 19 to 13. The House authorization added $66 million for 2 F-16s and advance procurement funds for 2 JSTARS aircraft. Additional funds were allocated for National Guard, Reserve equipment, and specific weapons programs. The House appropriations bill provided funding for F-16s, JSTARS aircraft, National Guard, Reserve equipment, and C-130 cargo aircraft. SASC and SAC also allocated funds for JSTARS, C-130s, and Guard/Reserve procurement. C-130J funding was a contentious issue. SASC and SAC funded additional C-130s and allocated funds for Guard/Reserve procurement. C-130J funding was contentious, with Rep. Obey proposing to reallocate funds to F/A-18E/F procurement. Authorization conference agreement includes funds for C-130s, F-16, JSTARS, and Guard/Reserve equipment. The authorization conference agreement provides funds for C-130s, F-16, JSTARS, and Guard/Reserve equipment. The appropriations conference agreement allocates funds for C-130s, JSTARS, and Guard/Reserve procurement. The National Defense Panel recommends pursuing leap-ahead technologies for future threats. The Defense Department is advised to reduce or terminate legacy programs and focus on leap-ahead technologies for land forces, fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility. The Panel criticized various programs, and Congress approved measures for a Quadrennial Defense Review and a review of the Army's Crusader artillery program. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) criticized the Army's Crusader artillery program and ordered a review in light of the National Defense Panel's argument. Social issues like sexual harassment and gender-integrated training are debated in annual defense funding bills, with a focus this year on outcomes of harassment cases and gender-integrated training in the Army. Former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker led a commission that made recommendations to improve recruitment and training. The Administration-appointed commission, led by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, made recommendations to improve recruitment and training in the military.
