    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Engineering Biology Research and Development Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that cellular and molecular processes can be utilized to develop new products, processes, and systems that benefit society, enhance national security, and boost the economy. Engineering biology requires a diverse set of skills and long-term research for breakthroughs, necessitating government investment. The Federal Government can support the development of tools and technologies to advance engineering biology. The Federal Government can play a crucial role in advancing engineering biology by facilitating the development of tools and technologies. Without necessary investment and a national strategy, the United States risks falling behind other countries in this emerging field. A National Engineering Biology Initiative can drive research, technology goals, interagency coordination, and technology transfer to maximize returns on federal investment. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Advisory Committee,\" \"biomanufacturing,\" \"engineering biology,\" \"Interagency Committee,\" and \"Program.\" These definitions are crucial for the implementation of the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program is established. The President will implement a National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity through research, supporting social science research, expanding training, accelerating commercialization, and improving interagency coordination. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity through research, supporting social science research, expanding training, accelerating commercialization, and improving interagency coordination. Program activities include sustained support for engineering biology research and development through grants, interdisciplinary projects, and research centers. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program supports interdisciplinary research centers, education of students in biological, physical, and information sciences, tracking economic benefits, and accelerating commercialization through research opportunities and public-private partnerships. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to commercialize new products, processes, and technologies by identifying research opportunities, fostering public-private partnerships, providing entrepreneurship education, supporting proof of concept activities, and forming startup companies. The program also focuses on expanding participation, including outreach to primarily undergraduate students. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to commercialize new products, processes, and technologies by identifying research opportunities, fostering public-private partnerships, providing entrepreneurship education, supporting proof of concept activities, and forming startup companies. The Program includes outreach to primarily undergraduate and minority-serving institutions, encourages research collaborations, and addresses ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program focuses on commercializing new products and technologies through research, partnerships, entrepreneurship education, and startup formation. It also addresses ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology by supporting research and ensuring public input through discussions and outreach activities. The President will designate an interagency committee on engineering biology, including representatives from various agencies to oversee planning, management, and coordination of the Program. The Interagency Committee, chaired by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, will oversee Federal engineering biology research and development activities. It will coordinate interagency efforts, set goals and priorities, and develop a strategic plan every 5 years to guide the Program. The Interagency Committee, chaired by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, will oversee Federal engineering biology research and development activities. It will coordinate interagency efforts, set goals and priorities, and develop a strategic plan every 5 years to guide the Program, including support for interdisciplinary research, education, ethical considerations, and moving results into practical applications for societal benefit and competitiveness. An annually coordinated interagency budget will be proposed. The Program will propose an annually coordinated interagency budget to maintain a robust engineering biology research portfolio. It will also develop a plan to utilize Federal programs in support of its goals and consider recommendations in carrying out its responsibilities. The Interagency Committee, in support of its goals, will consider recommendations from the Advisory Committee, workshop results, existing reports, and views of various groups. An annual report will be prepared and submitted to relevant committees, including the Program budget for the fiscal year. The Senate Committee will receive an annual report within 90 days of the President's budget request, detailing the Program budget for the fiscal year, agency spending, research facilities, and Small Business Innovation Research awards. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The President shall designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development with at least 12 members from various sectors to assess the progress, balance of activities and funding, Program priorities, and ethical issues. The Advisory Committee on engineering biology research and development will assess leadership, management, coordination, implementation, and societal issues of the Program. Reports will be submitted every 3 years to the President and relevant committees with recommendations for Program improvement. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to this Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee will review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research and development. The Director of the National Science Foundation will convene a workshop with the National Academies to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues in engineering biology research. The workshop aims to assess current research, identify gaps, and provide recommendations. A summary report will be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Director of the National Science Foundation will transmit a summary report to Congress containing the findings of a workshop convened to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues in engineering biology research. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITIES. The National Science Foundation supports basic research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences, research on environmental and social effects of engineering biology, provides instrumentation support, and awards grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The Department of Commerce establishes a bioscience research program as part of the Program. The Department of Commerce, under the Program, establishes a bioscience research program to advance standard reference materials, provide access to user facilities, and offer technical expertise for engineering biology. The Department of Energy, as part of the Program, conducts research and development in engineering biology disciplines like synthetic biology and biofuel development. They also provide access to advanced facilities for research and testing. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration conducts basic and applied research in engineering biology fields, including synthetic biology, Earth and space sciences, aeronautics, space technology, and space exploration. They also award grants to institutions to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows conducting engineering biology research in an industry setting. The Environmental Protection Agency will support research on how engineering biology products will impact the environment as part of the Program. Grants will be awarded to institutions to fund graduate students and postdoctoral fellows conducting research in an industry setting."
