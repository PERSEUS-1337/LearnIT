    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to boost enrollment and graduation rates for AB 540 students by mandating Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high schools each year, but only 20 percent attend college. Many are unaware of laws like Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA that make college more accessible. Most college campuses lack centralized support services for students eligible under AB 540. The creation of Dream Resource Centers would streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540, aiming to empower and support this population to increase enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates. Several college campuses have established Dream Resource Centers to support undocumented students, offering workshops, legal clinics, and peer mentoring to enhance awareness of available resources and increase employment opportunities. This initiative aims to streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540, with the goal of boosting enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates. Chapter 3.67 is added to the Education Code, encouraging California Community Colleges to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus to assist students meeting specific requirements by providing access to financial aid and academic opportunities. Each campus is encouraged to have a staff person knowledgeable in available resources for all students, including undocumented students, placed in the extended opportunity programs and services office or financial aid office. The California State University campuses are encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements, including undocumented students. The University of California is also encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus. Dream Resource Centers may offer various support services such as financial aid assistance, academic counseling, peer support, psychological counseling, referral services, and legal services. Dream Resource Centers may provide support services like financial aid assistance, academic counseling, peer support, psychological counseling, referral services, and legal services. The centers do not require new construction and can be housed within existing student service or academic centers. The space where the Dream Resource Liaison is located can be considered a Dream Resource Center. The Dream Resource Centers can be housed within existing student service or academic centers. The Dream Resource Liaison's space can be designated as a Dream Resource Center. The California State University, California Community Colleges, and University of California can accept gifts to support the creation and operation of Dream Resource Centers. The act mandates reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
