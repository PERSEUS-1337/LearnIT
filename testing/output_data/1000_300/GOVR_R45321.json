The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT, an increase over the Administration's request. The Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion for DOT in FY2019. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT, a 1.8% increase over FY2018 and 15% above the Administration request. The Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion for DOT in FY2019, slightly above FY2018 levels. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives most of its funding from trust funds, with around two-thirds to three-fourths being mandatory budget authority. This is different from most federal agencies that rely on discretionary funding. The Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund contribute around 90% of DOT's annual funding. The Department of Transportation (DOT) relies heavily on trust funds for funding, with the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund typically providing around 90% of its annual funding. In FY2018, there was a significant increase in discretionary funding, changing the funding proportion. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed as grants to states, local authorities, and Amtrak. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, employs the majority of DOT's employees. The Department of Transportation (DOT) relies heavily on trust funds for funding, with grants distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, employs the majority of DOT's employees. Reauthorizations of taxes supporting trust funds and budget apportionment are significant aspects of DOT funding. Highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020, while federal aviation programs face reauthorization in 2018, potentially impacting structure and funding levels. The authorization for federal aviation programs is set to expire on September 30, 2018, which may impact its structure and funding. The Department of Transportation's funding has fluctuated over the years, with inflation-adjusted funding peaking in FY2010 and declining until FY2015 before rising again in FY2016. In FY2019, appropriations for DOT were compared to FY2018, showing changes in funding levels for federal highway and transit programs. In FY2019, DOT's funding was compared to FY2018, showing changes in federal highway and transit funding. The Highway Trust Fund, mainly funded by the gas tax, has faced a shortfall for years due to expenditures exceeding revenues. Congress transferred $143 billion to the fund from FY2008-FY2016 to maintain solvency, as the gas tax has not been raised since 1993. The Highway Trust Fund faced a shortfall due to expenditures exceeding revenues, leading Congress to transfer $143 billion from FY2008-FY2016 to maintain solvency. The federal gas tax, unchanged since 1993, contributes to the fund with a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold, resulting in reduced purchasing power due to inflation and increased fuel efficiency. The Congressional Budget Office predicts flat gasoline consumption through 2024. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts flat gasoline consumption through 2024, with fuel efficiency offsetting increased miles driven. Highway Trust Fund revenues are projected at $39-41 billion annually from FY2018 to FY2027, falling short of projected expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for national infrastructure grants in FY2018, with the Senate proposing $1 billion and the House recommending $750 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1 billion for transportation grants in FY2018, formerly known as the TIGER grant program. The committee report prohibits the Department of Transportation from using an applicant's willingness to create new nonfederal revenue sources as a selection criterion, directing it to use the criteria from the FY2016 grant process. The TIGER grant program, originally called \"national infrastructure investment,\" aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding. It is a discretionary grant program that aims to fund projects with national or regional impacts. The program was created to overcome challenges such as funding distribution to state and local governments based on individual priorities and the division of federal transportation funding by mode, hindering projects in different modes from competing for funds based on comparative benefit. The federal transportation funding is divided by mode, making it difficult for projects in different modes to compete for funds based on comparative benefit. The Amtrak's Gateway Program, focused on the Northeast Corridor rail line, includes replacing a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River. The $13 billion-plus project burden falls on New York and New Jersey. The $13 billion-plus burden of the Gateway Program, focused on the Northeast Corridor rail line, falls on New York and New Jersey. The BUILD program provides grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan significance, with funding mainly going towards regional and metropolitan projects. Congress aims for equitable distribution across geographic areas and transportation modes. Congress has directed equitable distribution of funds across geographic areas, between rural and urban areas, and among transportation modes through the BUILD/TIGER program. The program is oversubscribed, with critics arguing grants disproportionately favor urban areas. To address this, Congress mandated that a percentage of funding should go to rural projects, increasing to 30% in FY2018 and 33% in FY2019. In FY2018 and FY2019, Congress increased the portion of funding for rural projects to 30% and 33% respectively. The House Appropriations Committee report specified that 33% of funding should go to rural areas, while the Senate bill maintained the 30% allocation. Additionally, 33% of funding is directed towards projects near major seaports, with the remaining 33% for urban areas over 200,000 in population. The BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process has shown a pattern of the Obama Administration requesting more funding than Congress provided, leading to proposed cuts by the House and similar amounts proposed by the Senate. Table 5 shows the recent patterns in the BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process. The Obama Administration typically requested more funding than Congress provided, leading to proposed cuts by the House and similar amounts proposed by the Senate. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested no funding, but Congress funded the program. The Essential Air Service program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a mandatory annual authorization estimated at $140 million for FY2019. The Essential Air Service program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority. The mandatory annual authorization is estimated at $140 million for FY2019, financed by overflight fees collected from commercial airlines by FAA. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for the EAS program in FY2019, $62 million less than the program received in FY2018. The House committee bill recommended a $175 million discretionary appropriation, $20 million more than the FY2018 level, and the Senate-passed bill also recommends a $175 million discretionary appropriation. The Essential Air Service program funding for FY2019 includes a $175 million discretionary appropriation, $29.5 million more than the FY2018 total funding level of $285.8 million. The program aims to maintain commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The program's costs have doubled since FY2008 due to airline route reductions and the addition of new communities. Congress made changes in 2012 to limit subsidies and new entrants to the program. Congress made changes to the Essential Air Service program in 2012, including capping subsidies per passenger, limiting subsidies for communities close to hub airports, and allowing smaller planes for communities with few passengers. Supporters argue that the program preserves airline service to small communities as promised during airline deregulation in 1978, promoting economic development in rural areas. Critics point out the high subsidy cost per passenger and the low passenger numbers at many EAS airports. Air service to smaller communities promotes economic development in rural areas. Critics note high subsidy costs per passenger, low passenger numbers at many airports, and proximity to major airports. Congress mandated positive train control (PTC) on railroads by 2015 to prevent incidents caused by errors. Railroads have spent billions on PTC, but most tracks were not compliant by 2015. Deadline extended to 2018, with option for extension to 2020 with approval. Congress mandated positive train control (PTC) on railroads by 2015 to prevent incidents caused by errors. However, most tracks were not compliant by the end of 2015. The deadline was extended to 2018, with an option for individual railroads to extend to 2020 with Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approval. Funding has been provided by Congress to help railroads with PTC expenses, including $50 million in FY2016, $199 million in FY2017, and at least $250 million in FY2018. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request did not include any funding for PTC implementation. The Senate-passed bill does not allocate specific funding for Positive Train Control (PTC) projects, but directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to prioritize PTC projects when making grants from the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements grant program. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 restructured Amtrak's federal grants, authorizing separate grants for the Northeast Corridor and the national network. Additionally, three new grant programs were established for intercity passenger rail development. The Administration's FY2019 budget requested a total of $738 million. The Administration's FY2019 budget requested $738 million for intercity passenger rail funding, with no funding requested for three grant programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak, $800 million for two new grant programs, and $150 million for the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. The Senate bill proposed $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for the three new grant programs. The Senate bill proposed $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for three new grant programs, with a focus on prioritizing PTC projects. Congress historically provided little funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for PTC implementation. In FY2017, Congress allocated $98 million for this purpose. In FY2011, Congress rescinded $400 million appropriated in FY2010 for intercity passenger rail development. In FY2017, $98 million was allocated for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration distributes roughly $13 billion in funding to state and local transit agencies through various programs, with the Capital Investment Grants program being the largest discretionary grant program. The Capital Investment Grants program (CIG) is the largest discretionary grant program by the Federal Transit Administration, funding new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. It has three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, and Core Capacity grants for projects increasing existing system capacity by at least 10%. Additionally, there is an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot for projects eligible for any of the three programs seeking no more than a 25% federal share. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, $1.6 billion less than the previous year. Funding is prioritized for projects with existing full funding grant agreements. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.614 billion for the program. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019, prioritizing projects with existing full funding grant agreements. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.614 billion, slightly less than the previous year. Congress has expressed concern over the Administration's stance on funding transit projects. The Trump Administration has taken the position that state and local governments should fund transit projects without federal assistance. However, Congress has not supported this proposal and has provided more funding than requested for the Capital Investment Grants program in both FY2018 and FY2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee report emphasizes the importance of advancing eligible projects through the program. The Senate-passed bill for FY2019 provides more than double the amount requested by FTA for the CIG program. The Senate Appropriations Committee report criticizes FTA for not complying with congressional directives and causing unnecessary delays in project development. Transportation for America accuses FTA of intentionally delaying project development despite the Administration's goal of reducing delays. Transportation for America accuses FTA of deliberately delaying transit projects despite Congress providing $2.3 billion for new projects. FTA has only issued $533 million in grants, leading to increased costs and expired construction bids. FTA denies delaying project reviews. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has faced criticism for delays in reviewing transit projects, leading to expired construction bids. Despite receiving $2.3 billion from Congress, FTA has only issued $533 million in grants. Legislation has imposed limits on the federal share for New Starts projects, with the House proposing a limit of 50% in FY2019. Critics argue that this is lower than the federal share for highway projects, which is typically 80%. Critics argue that the Senate-passed bill does not include a provision to limit the federal share for New Starts projects, unlike highway projects which typically receive 80% federal funding. Advocates believe that requiring a higher local match for New Starts projects would allow the Federal Transit Administration to support more projects with limited funding and encourage communities to carefully assess proposed transit projects to avoid cost overruns and low ridership. The challenges of funding transportation infrastructure include the difficulty of accumulating significant federal funding for projects involving multiple modes. This situation is exemplified by Amtrak's Gateway Program. The Gateway Program, including the Hudson Tunnel replacement project, aims to enhance rail service between northern New Jersey and Manhattan. It involves replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost is $24 billion. The Gateway Program aims to enhance rail service between New Jersey and New York by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. Funding for the project is limited, with the largest rail grant program in FY2018 being $593 million, but $285 million was reserved for other projects. In recent years, funding for intercity rail projects has increased significantly. The largest rail grant program in FY2017 was $68 million, which grew to $593 million in FY2018. The Capital Investment Grants program had $2.6 billion in FY2018, with intense competition for funding. An agreement was previously reached between DOT, Amtrak, and the States of New Jersey and New York to share costs for the new Hudson Tunnel, but the Trump Administration does not feel bound by it. Congress would need to provide the necessary funding. The Trump Administration does not feel bound by the previous agreement to share costs for the new Hudson Tunnel. Congress would need to provide the necessary funding, as neither the House nor Senate Appropriations Committees mentioned the Gateway Program or Hudson Tunnel project in their FY2019 THUD committee reports. However, both committees recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could be eligible for. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion over 10 years in grants to WMATA for maintenance and capital projects, with additional funding from DC, Maryland, and Virginia. The FY2018 grant was the final installment of this commitment, but WMATA's budget assumed continued annual funding. The Administration requested $120 million for FY2019, while the House and Senate recommended $150 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee's FY2019 report directed WMATA, local jurisdictions, and FTA to. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $150 million for the grant to WMATA for FY2019. Both committees directed WMATA to work on extending the authorization for the grant and implementing wireless service throughout the rail system. WMATA is facing maintenance backlog and safety concerns, with incidents leading to questions about the agency's safety culture. FTA restricted WMATA's use of federal funds due to mismanagement. Several fatal incidents, including one in January 2015, have raised questions about WMATA's safety culture. An investigation revealed mismanagement of federal funding, leading FTA to restrict WMATA's use of funds. FTA assumed oversight of WMATA's safety compliance practices in October 2015, conducting inspections and directing federal funds towards safety improvements. In February 2017, FTA notified leaders of the three jurisdictions that it would withhold 5% of their FY2017 transit funds until safety requirements are met. In February 2017, FTA notified leaders of the three jurisdictions that it would withhold 5% of their FY2017 transit funds until safety requirements are met. The jurisdictions established a new safety oversight agency (the Metrorail Safety Commission) to replace the Tri-State Oversight Committee. FTA outlined steps for the Commission to take over oversight responsibilities from FTA. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended that FRA, with a history of safety enforcement, oversee WMATA's rail operations instead of FTA. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended that oversight of WMATA's rail operations be transferred from FTA to FRA, which has a stronger safety enforcement history. Congress would need to grant FRA authority for this transition to occur."
