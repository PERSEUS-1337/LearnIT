The new budget caps in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) allowed for a higher appropriation totaling $23.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1625) included the Agriculture appropriations bill with a total of $23.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from FY2017. The enacted Agriculture appropriation also includes mandatory spending totaling nearly $123 billion, bringing the overall total to $146 billion. The Trump Administration's budget request proposed a lower discretionary total of $15.8 billion, while the House-passed bill was $20 billion and the Senate-reported bill was $20.53 billion. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriation bill, totaling $146 billion, includes funding for USDA and FDA. The bill also covers mandatory and discretionary spending, with nearly $123 billion in mandatory funds. The Trump Administration's budget request proposed a lower discretionary total of $15.8 billion. The FY2008 Agriculture appropriation bill focuses on discretionary spending controlled by annual appropriations acts. Mandatory spending is also included but receives less attention during the bill's development. Discretionary appropriations set spending limits, while mandatory spending is controlled by budget rules like PAYGO. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% ($23.3 billion) of the total, while mandatory spending comprised $123 billion, about 84% of the total. The largest discretionary spending items are for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The 2014 farm bill programs account for a significant portion of discretionary spending, including funding for WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance, food safety, conservation, and animal/plant health programs. Mandatory spending includes SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity/conservation programs funded through USDA's CCC. SNAP is an \"appropriated entitlement\" requiring annual appropriations based on projected spending needs. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds various programs including SNAP, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. SNAP requires annual appropriations based on projected spending needs, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. Funding for agriculture appropriations has fluctuated over time, peaking in FY2010, declining through FY2013, and increasing since then. Comparisons to historical benchmarks may require adjustments for inflation and other factors. The discretionary spending for Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, declined through FY2013, and has since increased. Historical benchmarks may need adjustments for inflation. The Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget request later than usual. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposed a 21% reduction for USDA, including eliminating funding for some programs. Congress reminded the Administration of its authority to determine final funding levels for FY2018. The USDA and FDA should respect Congress's authority in setting final funding levels for fiscal year 2018 and not make assumptions about program funding outcomes. The Trump Administration requested $15.82 billion for Agriculture appropriations, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. Congressional appropriations committees are evaluating the request. The Trump Administration requested $15.82 billion for Agriculture appropriations, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017.

The House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation was $1.13 billion less than enacted in FY2017. The House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation bill was $1.13 billion less than enacted in FY2017, achieving reductions in various areas such as rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research. The Senate Appropriations Committee also made allocations to its subcommittees for FY2018.

It reduced rural development by $119 million and agricultural research by $57 million, while increasing foreign food aid by $140 million. Additionally, it made $220 million more in reductions through rescissions and changing mandatory programs. FY2018 began without an enacted appropriation, leading Congress to pass CRs to fund the government, with the Office of Management and Budget prorating funding to agencies on an annualized basis. The first CR for FY2018 (Division D of P.L. 115-56) lasted until December 8, 2017, maintaining FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies for the agriculture appropriation. Anomalies included a 0.6791% across-the-board reduction, sufficient funding for mandatory program levels, and an increase of about $2 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. The CR for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program provides about $238 million, slightly higher than the FY2017 funding level. Additional provisions and anomalies were extended through subsequent CRs until January 19, 2018, including a waiver of PAYGO rules for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to prevent sequestration of mandatory spending. The CR (P.L. 115-96) extended funding until January 19, 2018, and waived PAYGO rules for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to prevent sequestration. Subsequent CRs extended funding further, with a government shutdown occurring until a fifth CR (P.L. 115-123) extended funding to March 23, 2018.

The Act also extended sequestration on mandatory accounts under the BCA for two more years, offsetting some of the funding additions. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended sequestration on mandatory accounts under the BCA for FY2026 and FY2027, impacting agriculture accounts by $2.6 billion. It raised budget caps for discretionary spending, leading to increased appropriations for FY2018 and FY2019.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act compares funding amounts by agency and programs to prior years. Sequestration is a process of automatic budget reductions triggered when federal spending exceeds statutory goals. Sequestration is a budget enforcement mechanism triggered when federal spending exceeds statutory goals. It cancels budget authority and is authorized in the BCA for discretionary spending through FY2021 and mandatory spending through FY2027. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration, but it still applies to certain mandatory spending accounts. The Bipartisan Budget Acts raised discretionary budget caps to allow for larger appropriations, avoiding sequestration for discretionary spending. However, sequestration still applies to certain mandatory spending accounts, with extensions made until FY2025 as offsets in various budget acts. Congress extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts until FY2027 as offsets in budget acts. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, such as nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. OMB determines exemptions for crop insurance and farm commodity programs. Sequestration on nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture accounts continues in FY2018, with a 6.6% reduction rate resulting in about $1.3 billion less authorized from mandatory agriculture accounts. Most crop insurance is exempt from sequestration, while farm commodity programs and conservation programs have been subject to it. In FY2018, sequestration on nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture accounts led to a reduction of about $1.3 billion from authorized funds.
