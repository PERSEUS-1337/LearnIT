Congress acknowledges the importance of a strong automotive industry for the economic health of the United States, highlighting the historical significance of automotive sales in retail spending. The period from June 2006 to May 2008 saw fluctuations in automotive sales, with rates above the indicator of a robust industry. The automotive industry has seen a decline in sales, with rates below the robust indicator of 13,000,000 units annually. Despite this, new vehicle dealers contribute significantly to the national economy, with total sales in 2008 reaching $576 billion. In 2008, new-vehicle dealerships in the United States had total sales of $576 billion, employing 1,057,500 people with an average annual salary of $48,963. This industry plays a crucial role in supporting the national economy and generating substantial tax revenue for state and local governments. The network is crucial for the success of automobile manufacturers, especially in challenging economic times, as it supports the new-vehicle dealer industry and benefits the national economy. Reducing the cost of capital for purchasing new vehicles can boost consumer confidence and incentivize purchases, strengthening the automotive manufacturing industry and the economy.
