    "content": "Some in the 112th Congress wanted to cut international affairs spending, including foreign aid programs, to reduce the federal budget deficit. However, others believed a strong foreign affairs budget was crucial for national security and foreign policy interests, potentially saving money by avoiding costly military interventions. Congress considered the FY2013 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies appropriations in light of the Budget Control Act of 2011. In FY2013, Congress passed legislation (H.R. 933) to fund federal programs for the remainder of the fiscal year, including the State-Foreign Operations appropriation. This funding supports international affairs programs and activities, typically representing about 1.5% of the total federal budget. The State-Foreign Operations appropriation, signed into law on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), supports international affairs programs, including foreign economic and security assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting. Food aid and certain commissions are also part of these programs but funded separately. The State-Foreign Operations appropriation bill, signed into law on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), supports international affairs programs, including foreign economic and security assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting. Food aid and various commissions are funded separately through different appropriations bills. A chart illustrating the organizational structure of the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill is provided in the report. Abbreviations of terms used throughout the report are also included. The report focuses on accounts funded through the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill and provides appropriations figures for the entire international affairs budget. The report, focusing on State-Foreign Operations appropriations, provides funding details for international affairs programs. President Obama signed the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA Continuing Resolution, funding accounts at FY2012 levels.

President Obama signed the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175) on September 28, 2012, funding the government until March 27, 2013. The resolution would provide 0.612% more than FY2012 levels for State and Foreign Operations non-OCO funded activities, while OCO-designated activities would be funded at the FY2012-enacted level. The annualized State-Foreign Operations funding rate under the CR was estimated to be $53.52 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2013 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill, providing $52.3 billion, including $2.3 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funds. This was 5% below the requested amount and 2% below the FY2012 estimated level.

Funding for the State Department's operations also supported the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization activities were absorbed into the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. Funding for the State Department's Counterterrorism mission increased to $19 million in FY2013. The Bureau of Counterterrorism requested funds for 12 new positions.

The FY2013 request aimed to address pay disparities for Foreign Service employees, with Congress approving prior adjustments to reduce the pay differential. The House Appropriations Committee did not allocate funds for hiring above attrition and rejected the extension of authority for overseas comparability pay. This issue could impact diplomatic readiness by increasing attrition and recruitment challenges. The House Appropriations Committee rejected funding for hiring above attrition in FY2013 and the extension of authority for overseas comparability pay. The Senate Appropriations Committee also did not include overseas comparability pay authority or funding in its FY2013 proposal. The United States' opposition to Palestinian statehood outside of a negotiated agreement with Israel is being debated in the State-Foreign Operations appropriations process. The U.S. opposes Palestinian statehood outside of negotiations with Israel, withholding funding to U.N. agencies that accept Palestinians as full members. The Administration sought $80 million for UNESCO contributions in 2012, but the House committee report stated they would withhold these funds. In 2012, the House committee report stated that U.S. contributions to UNESCO would be withheld. Both House and Senate legislation included restrictions on funding for the Palestinian Authority if they gain full membership in the United Nations. The proposals also included less funding than requested for International Organizations and Programs.

Recent popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa have raised questions about using foreign assistance for democracy promotion, especially in light of the fall of the Mubarak regime in Egypt and the U.S. involvement in ousting Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. The use of foreign assistance for democracy promotion has come under scrutiny, especially after the fall of the Mubarak regime in Egypt and the U.S. involvement in ousting Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. The 112th Congress expressed interest in supporting uprisings against undemocratic regimes but had concerns about accountability and unintended consequences. To address the evolving situation in the Middle East, the Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund in its FY2013 budget request. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund in its FY2013 budget request.

The Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq, a vital part of U.S.-Iraqi relationship, faced scrutiny in 2012 amid reports of reduction. Despite U.S. Embassy's support, doubts linger due to security challenges and Iraqi indifference. House legislation expressed support for PDP but required Administration to report on revised personnel, scope, and costs. The House report expressed support for the Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq but required the Administration to report on revised personnel, scope, and costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include funding for the PDP due to Iraqi disinterest and inadequate planning. The Administration requested $2.5 billion in foreign operations funds for Afghanistan in FY2013, with almost half designated as OCO.

The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) received a requested budget of $770 million for activities related to climate change adaptation and clean energy technologies. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) receives funding from various sources, including World Bank Trust Funds. The House and Senate had differing views on GCCI funding in their FY2013 proposals, with the House recommending zero funding for certain funds and the Senate not specifying a minimum funding level.

The Mexico City Policy, initiated by President Reagan in 1984, has been rescinded and reissued by past and current Administrations. President Obama rescinded it in January 2009. The FY2013 House legislation proposed codifying the policy, while the Senate bill did not. Previous Administrations have suspended grants to UNFPA due to evidence of coercive family planning practices in China. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008. President Obama resumed U.S. contributions to UNFPA. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 following a State Department investigation of family planning programs in China.

Both the House and Senate bills included the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Administration proposed that the AEECA account be dissolved in FY2013. The Administration proposed to dissolve the AEECA account in FY2013, merging its funds with ESF, GHP, and INCLE accounts. This change reflects the end of special focus on former Soviet and Eastern bloc states transitioning to democracy and free market economies. The House legislation adopted this approach, stating it does not signal diminished support for the region. The Senate proposal also included provisions for using funds from ESF and other accounts to provide assistance to countries. The Senate proposal does not provide a minimum funding level for AEECA-eligible countries, but funds from ESF and other accounts can be used to assist them. U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests drive international affairs activities, which have evolved from an anti-communist focus during the Cold War to include promoting economic development, trade, education, health care, human rights, and environmental protection. After the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy shifted towards objectives like nuclear non-proliferation, drug control, peace efforts in the Middle East, regional stability, religious freedom, and counter-trafficking. Following the 9/11 attacks, national security became a primary focus, with an emphasis on counterterrorism efforts. President Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy included global development as a key component of U.S. national security. In 2002, President Bush established global development as a key component of U.S. national security, alongside defense and diplomacy. Foreign assistance budget priorities shifted towards supporting countries involved in the war on terrorism. Reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq became prominent in foreign aid budgets, reflecting the use of foreign aid as a tool for national security. Diplomatic security and effectiveness were key focuses for the State Department. The Bush Administration emphasized using foreign aid for national security, with large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. Efforts also focused on diplomatic security and public diplomacy in Muslim communities. Aid was increased for combatting HIV/AIDS globally through PEPFAR, and a new approach to development assistance was explored with the creation of MCC. The Obama Administration continued many of these initiatives, including MCC and global health funding. The Obama Administration continued Bush's foreign aid initiatives, including MCC and global health funding. Funding for these initiatives was requested within Overseas Contingency Operations in regular appropriations bills. The first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review was completed in 2010, naming USAID as the leading agency for development assistance and implementing reforms for the Department of State. In the context of the first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review completed in 2010, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was designated as the primary government agency for development assistance. Reforms for the Department of State were also outlined, including the establishment of the Bureau of Energy and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction to the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. Additionally, in the FY2012 budget proposals, the Department of State requested a change in funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, extending Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds to cover temporary costs in these front line states. This request was adopted by Congress in the FY2012 State-Foreign Operations appropriations legislation. The Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) designation, initially extended to cover temporary costs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, gained significance with the Budget Control Act of 2011. OCO funds do not count towards budget caps but are subject to automatic reductions. This designation helps prevent war-related funding from overshadowing core international affairs activities in the budget allocation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determined that OCO funds are not exempt from BCA automatic reductions starting January 2, 2013. Emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations in Iraq and Afghanistan were not counted towards budget allocations in FY2002-FY2010. The Obama Administration criticized this practice and increased base funding in FY2010, but supplemental funds were still requested and enacted. The Obama Administration increased base funding in FY2010 for international affairs activities, leading to a sharp increase in funding. Supplemental funds were still requested for emergencies like the earthquake in Haiti, but FY2011 saw all international affairs funding appropriated as part of the base budget. The OCO approach was adopted for FY2012, allowing all funding to be considered simultaneously in the regular appropriations process. For FY2013, $8.24 billion was designated as OCO, about 15% of the international affairs request. In FY2013, the Administration requested $8.24 billion, or 15% of the international affairs budget, to be designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. This was a 5% decrease from the previous year and 26% less than what Congress enacted. The House legislation allocated $8.3 billion as OCO, while the Senate bill allocated $2.3 billion, mainly due to no funding for the Iraq Police Development program. State Department-Foreign Operations funding trended upward until 2011, with a spike in FY2004 for Iraq and Afghanistan reconstruction. FY2011 saw a significant reduction in foreign affairs spending to meet deficit reduction goals. FY2012 and FY2013 funding leveled off due to deficit reduction efforts, remaining below FY2009 levels after adjusting for inflation. See Table 2 and Figure 3 for appropriations over the past decade. State-Foreign Operations appropriations have been below FY2009 levels after adjusting for inflation. State Department funding saw a slight increase in recent years, reflecting efforts to increase human resource capacity. Foreign aid spiked in 2004, but diplomacy funding lagged. Overall, State Department and related agencies funding trends upward at a steeper rate than foreign affairs spending. The George W. Bush and Obama Administrations aimed to boost human resource capacity at the Department of State. Foreign aid appropriations have shown fluctuations over the past decade, with Israel and Egypt historically receiving the most aid. Funding for Iraq has decreased in recent years due to completion of reconstruction efforts. Israel has been the top recipient of U.S. foreign aid since 1978, with Afghanistan and Pakistan also receiving significant amounts. Aid to Iraq has decreased due to completed reconstruction efforts. Afghanistan received $2,505 million in aid, with a portion designated as OCO funds. Pakistan ranked third in aid recipients. In FY2013, Israel received $3,100 million in Foreign Military Financing, Afghanistan ranked second with $2,505 million requested, and Pakistan ranked third at $2,228 million. Aid to Africa would have declined by 10%, aid to the Near East would have increased by 12%, and aid to South Central Asia would have increased by 6%. In FY2013, aid to Africa would have declined by 10%, while aid to the Near East would have increased by 12% and aid to South Central Asia would have increased by 6%. The Near East region's assistance continued to be dominated by Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. Europe and Eurasia saw a 14% decline in aid due to progress made by many countries in the region. East Asia and Pacific aid remained relatively low and consistent with past years' levels. Aid to East Asia and Pacific remained low and consistent with past years' levels. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors like education, trade capacity, maternal and child health, and biodiversity. Administrations present budget requests highlighting key interest areas, but comparison data is limited. Comparing FY2012 and FY2013 budget requests provides insight into Administration's priorities. The Administration's FY2013 budget request showed declines in funding for key interest areas compared to FY2012, including Food Security and Global Climate Change. Other sectors with reduced funding requests included Sustainable Landscapes, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Nutrition, Maternal and Child Health, Higher Education, Clean Energy, and Basic Education. Increased funding was emphasized for Gender Funding. The Administration's FY2013 budget request included increased funding for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation, while reducing funding for key interest areas such as Food Security and Global Climate Change.
