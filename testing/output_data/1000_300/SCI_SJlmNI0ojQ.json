Contextual acoustic word embeddings are constructed directly from a supervised sequence-to-sequence model, showing competitive performance on standard sentence evaluation tasks and spoken language understanding. In the natural language processing and speech recognition communities, research focuses on learning fixed-size representations for variable length data like words or sentences. Popular methods include word2vec, GLoVE, CoVe, and ELMo, which are used in various language processing tasks. In speech recognition, input consists of short-term audio features, leading to research advancements in handling speaker and acoustic variability. In speech recognition, research has focused on learning word representations from variable length acoustic frames. Techniques involve aligning speech and text or segmenting input speech into fixed-length segments. However, these methods do not capture contextual dependencies in speech. Our work focuses on constructing individual acoustic word embeddings grounded in utterance-level acoustics, unlike techniques that learn word embeddings from audio fragment and word pairs without capturing contextual dependencies in speech. We present methods for obtaining acoustic word embeddings from an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model trained for direct Acoustic-to-Word speech recognition, eliminating the need for pre-defined word boundaries. Our work demonstrates the usability of attention for aligning words to acoustic frames and constructing Contextual Acoustic Word Embeddings (CAWE) directly from a speech recognition model. These embeddings are competitive with text-based word2vec embeddings and show promise in non-transcription downstream tasks. Contextual Acoustic Word Embeddings (CAWE) are constructed directly from a speech recognition model and are competitive with text-based word2vec embeddings. CAWE shows promise in speech-based downstream tasks and can be used for transfer learning. The work highlights the need for large training data for speech recognition models, with progress showing the possibility of training with smaller data but limited vocabulary. Solutions for generating out-of-vocabulary words involve using smaller units like characters or sub-words. Previous work introduced S2S models for large vocabulary speech recognition, with further improvements made in subsequent studies. In the 300-hour Switchboard corpus, BID12 improves upon previous work by enhancing training for large vocabulary A2W recognition. The model can learn word boundaries without supervision and is considered the best pure-word S2S model. Various methods, including BID4, BID5, BID7, BID25, and BID8, explore ways to learn acoustic word embeddings using unsupervised learning techniques. BID6, on the other hand, utilizes a supervised Convolutional Neural Network for speech recognition with short speech frames as input. BID6 uses a supervised Convolutional Neural Network for speech recognition with short speech frames as input, while BID4 proposes an unsupervised method to learn speech embeddings using a fixed context of words in the past and future. Learning contextualized word embeddings is also a rich area of research with established techniques such as BID0 and BID1. Our work ties A2W speech recognition model with learning contextual word embeddings from speech. The S2S model is similar to the Listen, Attend and Spell model, consisting of an encoder network, a decoder network, and an attention model. The encoder uses a pyramidal multi-layer bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM) network to map input acoustic features into higher-level features. The decoder network is an LSTM network that models the output. The encoder network uses a pyramidal multi-layer BLSTM network to map input acoustic features into higher-level features, while the decoder network is an LSTM network that models the output distribution over the next target. The decoder generates targets using an attention mechanism that enforces monotonicity in the alignments. The model utilizes a convolved attention feature for calculating attention at the current time step, leading to a peaky distribution. Acoustic word embeddings are obtained from an end-to-end trained speech recognition system, using hidden representations from the encoder and attention weights from the decoder. This method is similar to CoVe for text embeddings but differs in learning embeddings from a supervised task. Our method of constructing \"contextual\" acoustic word embeddings involves using a location-aware attention mechanism to segment continuous speech into words and obtain word embeddings. Attention weights on acoustic frames reflect their importance in classifying a particular word, aiding in the process. Our method involves constructing contextual acoustic word embeddings by using attention weights on acoustic frames to reflect their importance in classifying a word. This process provides a correspondence between the frame and the word within a given acoustic context, allowing for the construction of word representations based on the attention weight of hidden representations of acoustic frames. Our method constructs contextual acoustic word embeddings using attention weights on acoustic frames to reflect their importance in word classification. The model obtains mappings of words to acoustic frames and describes three ways of using attention to obtain acoustic word embeddings. These include unweighted Average, Attention weighted Average, and maximum attention methods. The Contextual Acoustic Word Embeddings (CAWE) are created using attention weights on acoustic frames to capture word classification importance. Three methods are used: unweighted Average, Attention weighted Average, and maximum attention. The datasets used are the 300-hour Switchboard corpus and a subset of the How2 BID27 dataset of instructional videos. The A2W achieves a word error rate of 22.2% on Switchboard and 36.6% on CallHome set from the Switchboard Eval2000 test set, and 24.3% on dev5 test set of How2. The embeddings are evaluated in 16 benchmark sentence evaluation tasks covering Semantic Textual Similarity, classification tasks like Movie Review, product review, sentiment analysis, and question type. In downstream tasks, embeddings are evaluated in 16 benchmark sentence tasks covering Semantic Textual Similarity, classification tasks like Movie Review, product review, sentiment analysis, and question type. The evaluation includes tasks measuring correlation between embedding-based similarity and human scores, as well as classification accuracies using logistic regression. In downstream evaluations, embeddings are tested on classification tasks using logistic regression. CAWE-M outperforms U-AVG and CAWE-W on Switchboard and How2 datasets for STS tasks. CAWE-W generally performs worse than CAWE-M due to noisy word embeddings estimation. The comparison between CAWE-W and CAWE-M shows that CAWE-M generally outperforms CAWE-W on STS tasks. CAWE-W may perform worse due to noisy word embeddings estimation. U-AVG also performs worse than CAWE-W on STS and SICK-R tasks. The comparison between CAWE-W and CAWE-M shows that CAWE-M generally outperforms CAWE-W on STS tasks. CAWE-W may perform worse due to noisy word embeddings estimation. U-AVG also performs worse than CAWE-W on STS and SICK-R tasks. Hidden representations are weighted equally irrespective of their attention scores. Training details involve comparing embeddings from the training set of the speech recognition model with text-based word embeddings obtained from a CBOW word2vec model trained on all transcripts. Despite the limited vocabulary captured by the A2W speech recognition model, CAWE's performance remains competitive with word2vec. The CAWE model captures a limited vocabulary but remains competitive with word2vec. CAWE-M outperforms CAWE-W on STS tasks, showing improved performance when acoustic embeddings are concatenated with text embeddings. The gains are more significant in Switchboard compared to How2 dataset due to the nature of the speech. The CAWE model, evaluated on the ATIS dataset for Spoken Language Understanding, uses a simple RNN-based architecture with an embedding layer and dense layer. The dataset consists of spoken language queries for airline reservations, similar to Switchboard, making it a suitable test bed for evaluating the model on speech-based tasks. Our model, similar to a simple RNN architecture, includes an embedding layer, RNN variant, dense layer, and softmax. Trained for 10 epochs with RMSProp, we compare speech-based word embeddings to text-based ones, showing comparable performance.

These embeddings show promise in spoken language understanding and can be used as pre-trained models for other speech-based tasks. Future work will focus on scaling the model to larger datasets and comparing with non-contextual acoustic word embedding methods."
