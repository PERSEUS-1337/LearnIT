    "title": "AB 1847",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature amended Section 19851 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to address the underutilization of the federal earned income tax credit (EITC) by working poor families in California. In 2015, the State of California implemented a state EITC to complement the federal program and help reduce poverty among low-income workers. In 2015, California authorized a state EITC to enhance the federal EITC for the poorest working Californians by providing information on claiming credits on tax returns. The act aims to provide cost-effective assistance to eligible taxpayers through employer and state notices, and by ensuring Californians claim both federal and state EITC. Definitions for terms like \"employer,\" \"employee,\" and \"Federal EITC\" are clarified in the Revenue and Taxation Code. The act defines key terms such as \"employee,\" \"Federal EITC,\" and \"California EITC.\" State departments and agencies providing services to potential EITC qualifiers are specified. The State Department of Education, Employment Development Department, and State Department of Health Care Services provide programs such as free or reduced-price meals, California Unemployment Insurance, and the Medi-Cal program. Employers must notify employees about eligibility for federal and California EITC when providing annual wage summaries. State departments and agencies must inform program recipients annually about potential eligibility for federal and California EITC, either between January and April or during regular contact. Communication can be direct or indirect through other entities serving eligible individuals. Effective notification methods are encouraged. State departments and agencies are encouraged to develop effective methods to notify recipients of federal and California EITC eligibility, either directly or indirectly through other entities. The notice should contain substantially the same language as described in Section 19854. The employer must provide notification directly to the employee or by mail, including instructions on obtaining IRS and Franchise Tax Board notices. Posting on a bulletin board or sending through office mail does not satisfy the notification requirement. These methods are encouraged to inform all employees about federal and California EITC. The employer must provide direct notification to employees about the availability of federal and California EITC. Posting on a bulletin board or sending through office mail is not sufficient. Amendments to this section apply to notices given after the effective date of the act. Based on your annual earnings, you may be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) from the federal government. The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit for low-income working individuals and families. It does not affect certain welfare benefits. You must file a federal tax return to receive the EITC, even if you don't owe federal taxes. Contact the Internal Revenue Service for more information on eligibility and how to obtain necessary forms. The California Earned Income Tax Credit (California EITC) is available starting from the 2015 tax year for low-income working individuals and families. To claim the California EITC, you must file a California income tax return and complete the California EITC form (FTB 3514). Contact the Franchise Tax Board for more information on eligibility and how to obtain the necessary forms. Amendments to this section apply to notices furnished after the effective date of the act."
