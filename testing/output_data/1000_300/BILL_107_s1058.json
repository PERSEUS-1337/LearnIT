    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" and includes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding a credit for biodiesel used as fuel. The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a biodiesel fuels credit based on the biodiesel mixture credit for the taxable year. The biodiesel mixture credit is calculated by multiplying the biodiesel mixture rate by the number of gallons of qualified biodiesel mixture blends used by the taxpayer. The biodiesel mixture rate varies based on the blend percentage: 0.5-2.0% for B-1, 2.0-20% for B-2, and 20% for B-20. These blends are defined by the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. The term 'qualified biodiesel mixture' refers to a blend of diesel and biodiesel, with specific percentages defining B-1, B-2, and B-20 blends. The 'applicable amount' is calculated based on the biodiesel percentage in the blend.

The biodiesel mixture credit is only applicable if sold or used in the taxpayer's trade or business for the taxable year. No credit is allowed for casual off-farm production.
