    "content": "The \"Airline Passenger Fairness Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section of the Act highlights key points related to airline passengers. The Congress finds that the number of airline passengers on US carriers is expected to grow significantly, the number of certified large air carriers has decreased, and many communities that had scheduled air service in 1978 no longer have it. The Department of Transportation's report in 1997 showed a significant increase in fares for 75 major city pairs, leading to a decrease in total traffic by over 20%. A 1998 study found that large US air carriers charge twice as much at hub airports without low fare competition compared to those with low fare competitors. Fares at hubs dominated by one carrier or consortium can be 12% to 71% higher. The General Accounting Office found that fares are significantly higher at hubs dominated by one carrier or consortium. Complaints about airline travel have increased by over 25% from the previous year, with a rise in complaints against large US air carriers. The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission reported worsening flight delays, with a 20% increase in daily aircraft delays of 15 minutes or longer in 1996 compared to 1995. The Commission also forecasted a 52% increase in US domestic and international passenger enplanements. The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission forecasted a 52% increase in US domestic and international passenger enplanements between 1996 and 2006. Additionally, a 1998 Department of Transportation study revealed that large US air carriers charge about 60% more for passengers traveling to or from small communities compared to those traveling between large communities. Congress has directed the Secretary of Transportation to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in the airline industry. SEC. 3. FAIR PRACTICES FOR AIRLINE PASSENGERS.
