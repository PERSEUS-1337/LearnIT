    "content": "The Middle East poses challenges to U.S. foreign policy due to various state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests, including Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is a major concern, with potential consequences for regional balance of power and proliferation. There are fears of a preemptive strike by Israel against Iran triggering a wider war. Iran's strong ties to Syria further complicate the situation. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability poses serious balance of power and proliferation concerns in the region and globally. There are fears that Israel may preemptively strike Iran, leading to a wider war. Iran's strong ties to Syria complicate U.S. efforts to advance Israeli-Arab peace. Despite some improvement in the U.S. image in the Middle East under the Obama Administration, dissatisfaction with U.S. policy remains. Muslim world outreach and attempts to close Guantanamo have not reduced the influence of actors like Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas. The ongoing war in Afghanistan and U.S. struggles in the Israel-Palestinian conflict add to the challenges in the region. Efforts to close Guantanamo have not limited the influence of state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests in the Middle East. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey are taking more responsibility for resolving disputes. The region faces challenges from the global financial crisis, domestic socioeconomic issues, and lack of respect for human rights and democracy. The Middle East is dealing with a financial crisis, poverty, inequality, population growth, unemployment, and water scarcity. Lack of human rights and democracy are criticized. The US advocates for reform. Congressional questions include addressing Palestinian divisions, Hamas control, Israeli settlements, and supporting regional initiatives despite budget constraints. The 112th Congress may face various issues in the Middle East, including the war in Afghanistan, terrorism, and foreign policy challenges such as Israeli settlements and obstacles to the peace process. The United States must continue to support regional initiatives despite budget constraints, address radical regimes like Iran and Syria, and balance counterterrorism strategies with diplomatic efforts to improve relationships with Arab regimes. Policymakers in the 112th Congress will need to balance counterterrorism strategies with diplomatic efforts to improve U.S. bilateral relationships with Arab regimes. There is a growing international consensus to impose stricter economic sanctions on Iran to halt its nuclear development. The international consensus is to impose stricter economic sanctions on Iran to halt its nuclear development. The United States and its allies are targeting Iran's energy sector to isolate it from the international financial system. The Iran Sanctions Act, implemented in 1996, penalizes foreign companies conducting business with Iran's energy sector. This effort aims to persuade foreign firms to choose between Iran and the U.S. The Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) was implemented in 1996 to penalize foreign companies doing business with Iran's energy sector. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) expanded ISA to restrict Iran's gasoline imports and added measures to limit access to the U.S. market for banks and high technology trade with Iran. CISADA, enacted in 2010, expanded sanctions on Iran by limiting access to the U.S. market for banks and high technology trade. This followed the adoption of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929, which imposed a ban on heavy weapons sales to Iran and sanctioned Iranian entities affiliated with its Revolutionary Guard. Additionally, the European Union and countries like Japan and South Korea implemented similar restrictions on trade with Iran. EU, Japan, and South Korea have imposed sanctions on Iran's energy sector, trade financing, and banking relationships. These measures are impacting Iran's economy, with major international firms exiting the Iranian market. However, the impact on Iran's nuclear program is uncertain. The 112th Congress may consider additional sanctions and support for Iran's domestic opposition. The 112th Congress may consider additional sanctions on Iran and support for its domestic opposition. The strong bilateral relations between the United States and Israel are based on shared strategic goals, democratic values, and historic ties dating back to 1948. U.S. foreign aid has played a significant role in strengthening these ties. The strong bilateral relations between the United States and Israel are based on shared strategic goals, democratic values, and historic ties dating back to 1948. U.S. aid packages for Israel reflect this sentiment, with Congress and successive administrations affirming the commitment to strengthening Israel's security and maintaining its qualitative military edge over neighboring militaries. Critics argue that U.S. aid exacerbates tensions in the region and indirectly causes suffering to Palestinians by supporting Israeli arms purchases. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. aid to Israel to preserve its qualitative military edge (QME). The Obama Administration reaffirmed its commitment to Israel's security, requesting $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for FY2011. Defense appropriations for missile defense systems co-research and development with Israel may also be a key issue. The 112th Congress may address defense appropriations for U.S.-Israeli missile defense cooperation, including funding for the Iron Dome system. Since 1948, U.S. aid to Israel has been crucial in resolving conflicts with its neighbors and reinforcing peace treaties. Since 1948, U.S. aid has been crucial in resolving conflicts between Israel and its neighbors, reinforcing peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and facilitating the peace process with the Palestinians. President Obama declared Israeli-Palestinian peace a U.S. national security interest due to its impact on relations in the Middle East and elsewhere. His call for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank led to a limited 10-month moratorium. The call for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank by Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Mahmud Abbas was tied to his participation in direct talks with Israel. Despite a limited 10-month Israeli moratorium on settlement activity, settlements remained an obstacle to talks as Israel continued with settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Administration offered incentives to Israel for an additional three-month settlement freeze to achieve a breakthrough in talks. The Administration offered incentives to Israel for a three-month settlement freeze to advance talks on final status issues like borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and water. Congress remains interested in the Arab-Israeli peace process due to its oversight role in U.S. foreign policy and support for Israel. Resolutions were introduced in the 111th Congress to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the U.S. embassy there. Foreign operations appropriations legislation restricts U.S. official conduct. In the 111th Congress, resolutions were introduced to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the U.S. embassy there. Foreign operations appropriations legislation emphasizes Congress's commitment to an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The Obama Administration maintains that Jerusalem is a final status issue for negotiation. Appropriations legislation also required a new Palestinian state to act peacefully and counter terrorism. Congress passed resolutions supporting Israel's right to self-defense against rocket attacks and a flotilla attempting to break Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip. In the 112th Congress, legislation may revisit moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, conditions for a new Palestinian state, and reactions to possible violent confrontations between Israeli forces and Palestinian groups. U.S. aid to the Palestinians supports U.S. policy priorities of combating terrorism from Hamas. U.S. aid to the Palestinians in the 111th Congress aligns with U.S. policy priorities of combating terrorism, promoting stability and prosperity in the West Bank, and addressing humanitarian needs, following the split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza Strip in 2007, annual U.S. bilateral assistance to the region has averaged over $600 million, with peaks reaching nearly $1 billion in 2009. This aid includes direct budgetary assistance, non-lethal security assistance, and humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees, primarily through UNRWA. The U.S. provides security assistance to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees in Gaza through UNRWA. Congressional concerns about funds being diverted to terrorist groups have led to strict oversight and vetting requirements. U.S. policymakers urge Arab states to increase their contributions, as their pledges are often late or insufficient. Additionally, the Administration has proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia. The Obama Administration notified Congress of proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion. The sales include fighter aircraft, helicopters, upgrades, and related weaponry. The Administration hopes the sales will sustain long-term relationships and U.S. influence for decades, raising policy questions for Congress. The Obama Administration aims to strengthen Saudi Arabia against Iran and ensure long-term U.S. influence with proposed military sales. Policy questions for Congress include the rationale for sales, impact on regional security balance, and effects on Israel's security. Concerns persist about human rights, terrorist financing, and religious extremism in Saudi Arabia. Improvements in U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism cooperation with concerns remaining on terrorist financing and human rights. Saudi leaders are cautious about embracing Iraq's government and engaging with Israel. Congressional committees reviewed proposed arms sales with some members raising strategic questions to the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration faced concerns from Congress regarding proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia in 2010. The Administration believed in strengthening the U.S.-Saudi military partnership while preserving Israel's military edge. Additionally, a bill introduced in December 2010 aimed to prohibit the proposed sales. The United States is pursuing an initiative to supply Israel with advanced F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to maintain Israel's military edge in the region. Congress may seek additional oversight of military training, arms sales, and counterterrorism cooperation with Saudi Arabia. U.S. has been involved in training and arming the Saudi military since the 1940s, with ongoing support programs in place. New programs for Saudi security forces and infrastructure are also being implemented. Congress retains the option to approve proposed arms sales. Training and equipment support programs in the kingdom are key aspects of U.S.-Saudi relations. New U.S. programs for Saudi security forces and infrastructure are being implemented. Congress has the option to block or modify arms sales, subject to presidential veto. Legislation seeking to alter or enhance oversight of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia may be pursued. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen due to the threat of Yemen-based terrorists. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has attempted attacks on the U.S., including bombing attempts on flights and radicalization of U.S. citizens by Anwar al Awlaki. Congress may seek to alter oversight of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia. American citizen Anwar al Awlaki, AQAP's radical ideologue, has been linked to radicalizing individuals involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen without militarizing the U.S. presence, potentially using drones or military units overseen by the CIA. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to counter terrorism without overly militarizing the U.S. presence. Options include using drones or placing military units under CIA control. Congress may assess the balance between short-term counterterrorism needs and long-term stabilization goals in Yemen. In response to the terrorist threat in Yemen, Congress may consider increasing U.S. military involvement and appropriations for the country. The Obama Administration is exploring options such as using drones or placing military units under CIA control to counter terrorism. Additionally, there is a proposal to increase security assistance to Yemen to $1.2 billion over a five- or six-year period. The Yemeni government has cautioned against overreacting to the terrorist threat, but there is a growing demand for Yemen to cooperate with the United States in apprehending wanted AQAP operatives. The Defense Department has proposed increasing security assistance to Yemen to $1.2 billion over a five- or six-year period. Yemeni forces have launched campaigns against suspected AQAP strongholds. Disagreements may arise over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists to placate tribal leaders and domestic Islamist politicians. U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation sustainability is a key question for lawmakers and policymakers. Iraq's political system has seen peaceful competition and attempts to form cross-sectarian alliances, but ethnic and factional infighting persists, delaying agreement on leadership after the 2010 elections. U.S. intervention helped break the deadlock, leading to the formation of a new government with major factions agreeing on senior positions. Since November 10, 2010, major ethnic and sectarian factions in Iraq have agreed on senior positions in a new government with U.S. intervention. However, concerns remain about the government's direction, influence, and dominance by parties aligned with Iran. There are also worries about potential conflicts between Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government and nationalist Arabs. Despite the drawdown of U.S. forces, ongoing high-profile attacks contribute to a sense of uncertainty and disillusionment among Iraqis. The ongoing violence in Iraq has led to uncertainty and disillusionment among Iraqis, despite the drawdown of U.S. forces. Experts are concerned about the stability of Iraq after all U.S. forces depart in 2011, fearing that the country could become a \"failed state\" without U.S. troops remaining. U.S. officials do not expect Iraqi Security Forces to meet benchmarks by the end of 2011, raising concerns about the country's future. The formation of the government will allow for a long-term strategic partnership with the U.S. and define the terms of continued security. The formation of the government in Iraq will enable U.S. officials to address their goals of securing a long-term strategic partnership and defining terms of security cooperation. However, opposition from some Iraqi parties may complicate efforts to secure lasting cooperation. The U.S. government is transitioning from military to civilian leadership in Iraq, with the State Department overseeing an expansion in civilian personnel and associated costs. Economic assistance to Iraq has decreased significantly since the 2003-2007 period. U.S. economic assistance to Iraq has declined significantly since the 2003-2007 period, with FY2010 ESF assistance reaching $382.5 million. The Administration's FY2011 request aimed to maintain economic aid at that level and support Iraq's security forces, despite Senate appropriators recommending cuts in both areas. FY2011 funding for Iraq is provided under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. The FY2011 funding for Iraq under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 faces potential resistance in Congress due to concerns about Iraq's reconstruction and security forces. Iraq's oil revenues are expected to increase, but it still faces challenges with domestic investment needs and financial management. The transition to a U.S. civilian-led presence in Iraq opens new avenues for congressional oversight. Congress may need to review appropriations, authorization requests, and proposed arms sales to support Iraq. The transition from U.S. military operations to a U.S. civilian-led presence in Iraq opens new avenues for congressional oversight. Congress may need to review appropriations, authorization requests, and proposed arms sales to support U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation. Turkey's complex relationship with the U.S. has drawn congressional attention, particularly regarding issues of interest to diaspora communities. Turkey has not been a major recipient of U.S. foreign aid since the 1990s, and possible reorientation of Turkey's foreign policy has been discussed in hearings. Turkey's complex relationship with the U.S. has drawn congressional attention, particularly regarding issues of interest to diaspora communities. Congressional concern increased after Turkey voted against U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran and had a violent confrontation with Israeli commandos. Legislation in the 111th Congress called on Turkey to respect the property and religious rights of the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved H.Res. 252, calling on the Administration to affirm the U.S. historical record of the Armenian genocide. H.Res. 1631 was passed by the House, protecting Greek Orthodox religious sites in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. Concerns regarding the rights of the Greek Orthodox Church and the genocide resolution may resurface in the 112th Congress. Turkey is expected to play a critical role in a new missile defense architecture adopted at the NATO summit in Lisbon in November 2010. In the 112th Congress, potential issues with Turkey may include the Greek Orthodox Church's rights and the genocide resolution. Ankara may seek US funding for missiles and radar as part of a new missile defense system. Congressional interest may also focus on political changes after the 2011 Turkish election. US policy towards Syria may also be a topic of interest. Francis J. Ricciardone's nomination in the 112th Congress was not voted on in the 111th Congress due to a hold by a member. U.S. policy towards Syria under the Obama Administration involved engaging in diplomatic dialogue with the Syrian government to secure cooperation on various issues. Sanctions against Syria have been in place since 2009. The Obama Administration's policy towards Syria involved diplomatic engagement and sanctions since 2009. Recently, there has been a shift towards pressuring Syria to play a more constructive role in Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli peace process, coinciding with concerns about Lebanon's stability due to Hezbollah threats. Hezbollah threatens Lebanon over potential indictments by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon for the murder of Rafiq Hariri. The US shifts policy towards Syria, considering new sanctions amid tensions and failed peace talks with Israel and Syria. Congress debates imposing sanctions on the Asad regime and introduces the Syria Accountability and Liberation Act targeting those aiding Syria's access to weapons of mass destruction. Introduced H.R. 1206, the Syria Accountability and Liberation Act, proposing sanctions on countries aiding Syria's access to weapons of mass destruction and those investing $5 million or more in Syria's energy sector. Congress may fund democracy programs for opposition members and human rights activists repressed by the Asad government. The nomination of Robert S. Ford as Ambassador-Designate to Syria is on hold, with no confirmation vote scheduled. Supporters argue for sending an ambassador to Syria to benefit U.S. interests, while opponents view it as a concession to a rogue regime. The lack of a U.S. Ambassador in Damascus since 2005 is seen as detrimental to U.S. interests. Current U.S. policy towards Lebanon aims to limit Iranian and Syrian influence, support the unity government led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, and contain Hezbollah. The U.S. provides economic and military assistance to strengthen state institutions, particularly in the security sector, and supports the Special Tribunal for Lebanon with an annual contribution of $10 million. Prime Minister Hariri's government faces challenges, including increased sectarian tension due to pending STL indictments and Hezbollah's public relations campaign. The Hariri government's legitimacy depends on the success of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), but Hezbollah's opposition may threaten Hariri's power if the STL proceeds with indictments. Hezbollah's escalating rhetoric and Hariri's retracting claims about Syria's involvement in the assassination raise concerns about potential conflicts between U.S. support for Hariri and the STL. The Hariri government's legitimacy relies on the success of the STL, but Hezbollah's opposition may jeopardize Hariri's position if the STL issues indictments. Changes in the Lebanese government could impact U.S. policy and assistance, especially if Hezbollah gains more power. The U.S. Congress may need to consider the Obama Administration's request for $246 million in foreign assistance for Lebanon to strengthen the central authority and deter non-state actors. On August 3, 2010, the Lebanese Armed Forces fired on an Israeli Defense Force unit near the Blue Line, leading to casualties on both sides. On August 3, 2010, the Lebanese Armed Forces fired on an Israeli Defense Force unit near the Blue Line, resulting in casualties. Some members of Congress halted a $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon over concerns about U.S. equipment being used against Israel. The hold was lifted in December 2010, but raised questions about future U.S. assistance to Lebanon. The incident in Lebanon raised questions about future U.S. assistance. The 112th Congress may express support for a more democratic government in Egypt. Egypt is a key partner of the U.S. in regional affairs and the Arab-Israeli peace process. Political liberalization in Egypt could have a ripple effect in the Middle East. Some argue for gradual change, while others prefer a stable, autocratic Egypt at peace with Israel. In the November and December 2010 parliamentary elections in Egypt, the ruling National Democratic Party won over 90% of all seats, with just one independent from the Muslim Brotherhood gaining a seat. The U.S. expressed concern over the election conduct, fearing a sudden takeover by the Muslim Brotherhood could threaten American interests in the region. The Administration expressed concern over irregularities in the parliamentary elections in Egypt, including disruptions of opposition campaign activities, arrests of supporters, and election-day interference by security forces. Congress has provided Egypt with significant military and economic aid, with funding for democracy promotion being a controversial issue. Egypt has received $1.5 billion in military and economic aid from the US. Funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been controversial, with the government opposing support for independent NGOs working on political reform. Congress directed Economic Support Funds towards USAID programs and direct support for Egyptian NGOs, with a directive in FY2005 that democracy and governance activities should not require government approval. In FY2005, Congress directed that democracy and governance activities in Egypt should not require government approval. U.S. democracy assistance has decreased as overall economic aid to Egypt has decreased. Some analysts believe the Obama Administration wants to de-emphasize democracy assistance to ease tensions with the Egyptian government. Critics suggest that U.S. funding for democracy promotion has been ineffective and should be redirected to areas with a more immediate impact on average Egyptians. Some critics argue that U.S. funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been ineffective and should be redirected to areas that have a more immediate impact on average Egyptians. The U.S. government's global war against Al Qaeda and its affiliates since 9/11 has weakened the organization's ability to attack the United States, but challenges remain with Al Qaeda's survival, regional affiliates, and appeal among some Muslims. Al Qaeda operatives are still determined to attack the U.S. and exploit vulnerabilities. Al Qaeda's persistence in targeting the United States and its citizens, along with the spread of its ideology through sophisticated online outreach, poses challenges for U.S. and allied counterterrorism efforts. The organization's supporters are promoting independent, low-cost operations by individuals with limited connections to established terrorist networks, making threats more diffuse and less predictable. In the Middle East, U.S. policymakers face dilemmas in balancing counterterrorism goals with other strategic priorities. In the Middle East, U.S. policymakers are dealing with overlapping dilemmas as they pursue counterterrorism goals alongside other strategic priorities like securing energy supplies, preventing nuclear proliferation, and promoting peace. The costs, benefits, and limits of military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have been demonstrated over the past decade, with ongoing concerns about Al Qaeda's rhetoric against U.S. presence in the region. Limited operations against Al Qaeda figures and counterterrorism assistance programs have faced criticism. South Asia continues to be a focus of Al Qaeda's rhetoric against U.S. occupation and imperialism, despite the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. U.S. support for democratic reform in countries like Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank has strained relations with allied governments and empowered Islamist parties. Public opinion polls show skepticism towards U.S. intentions and policies among Muslims in many countries, despite increased U.S. outreach efforts. Observers suggest more direct and robust efforts are needed to combat Al Qaeda and religious extremism. Public opinion polls show Muslim skepticism of U.S. intentions and policies despite increased outreach efforts. Suggestions include more direct efforts to combat Al Qaeda and extremism, a containment strategy, and a positive U.S. agenda for the Middle East beyond security concerns. The 111th Congress focused on U.S. counterterrorism policy, including specific threats, foreign assistance, and financing. Legislative input was through appropriations and authorization legislation. The 112th Congress may further evaluate counterterrorism strategy and engagement with Muslim countries. Congressional interest in the Middle East includes maintaining the U.S.-Iraqi counterterrorism partnership. The 112th Congress may seek to evaluate U.S. counterterrorism strategy and engagement with Muslim countries in the Middle East. Key issues include maintaining the U.S.-Iraqi counterterrorism partnership, defeating Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and the Sahel, securing greater counterterrorism cooperation from Gulf allies, and promoting peace between Israel and its neighbors. Relevant Congressional Research Service reports on Iran sanctions and policy responses are also available.
