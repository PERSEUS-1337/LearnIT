    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, with a maximum credit amount of 2.3 cents per kWh for 2013-2016 and 2.4 cents per kWh for 2017-2018. The credit can be claimed for a 10-year period once a qualifying facility is in service, with different technologies qualifying for varying credit amounts. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is available for renewable electricity generated from qualified energy resources. Different technologies qualify for varying credit amounts, with wind facilities having a construction deadline of January 1, 2020. The credit amount may be reduced for facilities that begin construction after 2017. The PTC used to have a placed-in-service deadline before 2013. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is available for renewable electricity generated from qualified energy resources. The credit amount may be reduced by 60% for facilities that begin construction in 2019. The PTC expiration date used to be a placed-in-service deadline before 2013. The PTC is set to phase out once the market price of electricity exceeds threshold levels, but this has not happened yet. The ability to claim the PTC was also limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) before 2018. Unused credits could be carried forward to offset future regular tax liability. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was available for taxpayers subject to the AMT until 2018. Unused credits could be carried forward to offset future tax liability. The corporate AMT limitation was significant for some firms but was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. Taxpayers could opt for the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) from 2009 to 2017. Additionally, there were options for an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Section 1603 grant and production tax credits for Indian coal and refined coal facilities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Section 1603 grant allowed taxpayers to claim grants instead of tax benefits. Production tax credits were available for Indian coal and refined coal facilities. Indian coal facilities had to be in service before January 1, 2009, to receive credits for coal produced before January 1, 2016. There is no placed-in-service limitation for coal produced and sold after December 31, 2015. Credits are not available for coal produced after 2017. The base rate for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, with an inflation-adjusted credit of $2.4 in 2017. For refined coal, the base credit amount is $4.375 per ton, with a 2018 credit of $7.307 per ton after inflation adjustment. Refined coal facilities had to be in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It has been extended 11 times since 1999. Initially available for wind and biomass systems, the PTC has been extended to include poultry waste as a qualifying technology. The credit for refined coal facilities is $7.307 per ton, with a requirement that facilities must have been placed in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been extended multiple times since 1999, with new qualifying resources added such as poultry waste, geothermal energy, solar energy, and municipal solid waste. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 limited these new resources to a five-year claim period instead of the original ten years. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 limited new qualifying resources for the Production Tax Credit (PTC) to a five-year claim period instead of ten years. It also introduced a PTC for refined coal at a rate of $4.375 per ton, available until January 1, 2009. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the PTC for all facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years, adding hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for all facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years, adding hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources. Indian coal could qualify for a credit over a seven-year period, with the credit amount set at $1.50 per ton for the first four years, and $2.00 per ton for the last three years, adjusted for inflation. The PTC was further extended and modified in subsequent acts. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through 2008 for all qualifying facilities except solar, refined coal, and Indian coal. The PTC was further extended in 2008, with wind and refined coal extended through 2009, and other resources extended through 2010. New qualifying resources were added, including marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy, and a credit for steel industry fuel was introduced. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through 2008 for qualifying facilities, with a credit available for steel industry fuel produced and sold between October 1, 2008, and January 1, 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) further extended the PTC for wind through 2012 and other renewable energy technologies through 2013, allowing taxpayers to elect a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) in lieu of the PTC. ARRA also introduced the Section 1603 grant program for PTC- and ITC-eligible taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind through 2012 and other renewable energy technologies through 2013. It also introduced the Section 1603 grant program for eligible taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the Section 1603 grant program through 2011. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended the PTC for wind through 2013 and changed the credit expiration date to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind and changed the credit expiration date to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The PTC and the ITC in lieu of PTC option were extended through 2014 by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295). The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 extended the PTC expiration date for nonwind facilities through 2016. Indian coal facilities also saw an extension of the production credit through 2016. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind was extended through 2019, with reductions for facilities starting construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTC for nonwind technologies and Indian coal facilities was retroactively extended for tax year 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for nonwind technologies and Indian coal facilities was extended through 2019, but will not be available for facilities beginning construction after December 31, 2017. Estimated revenue losses associated with the PTC between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion, with most of it attributed to wind energy. Between 2018 and 2022, estimated revenue losses associated with the PTC are $25.8 billion, with $24.0 billion attributed to wind energy. Other PTCs include geothermal, open-loop biomass, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower. Production credits for refined coal and Indian coal also contribute to revenue losses. JCT's tax expenditure estimates are based on current law, and extending the PTC would increase these estimates. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed the PTC. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed the PTC totaling $2.8 billion. Unused credits can be carried forward to offset tax liability in future years. In 2010, $1.2 billion in PTCs were carried forward from previous tax years, reflecting the impact of policy actions in response to the economic downturn on renewable energy tax credit claims. The number of taxpayers claiming the PTC increased between 2008 and 2009 but decreased after 2009, with fewer taxpayers opting for the Section 1603 grant option instead. $15.5 billion in grants was claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible, but the costs are not directly comparable as grants were one-time payments while PTC can be claimed for 10 years. The economic downturn also affected tax credit carry forwards. The economic downturn impacted renewable energy tax credit claims, with PTC carry forwards doubling between 2008 and 2010. Taxpayers faced challenges due to lower net income and weak tax equity markets. Estimates show a long-term PTC extension would reduce revenues, with a permanent PTC for nonwind technologies projected to decrease revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending the PTC for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the Indian Coal Production Credit would reduce revenues by $0.4 billion. Extending the wind construction start date beyond 2019 would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027. The PTC was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources, and its extension in 1999 aimed to further develop environmentally friendly power resources. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended in 1999 to promote renewable energy development, reflecting a belief that tax incentives drive growth in the wind industry. While further extensions may lead to more investment, short-term extensions have limitations. Retroactive extensions are seen as windfall benefits for taxpayers. The PTC has increased the use of renewable electricity resources, but research on its impact continues. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has led to increased use of renewable electricity resources, but its impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Research suggests that removing tax credits for renewable electricity would result in a small increase in power-sector emissions. Recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar have contributed to reduced emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Government intervention in energy markets is justified by the presence of externalities and market failures caused by pollution. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources aim to address market failures caused by pollution externalities. However, subsidies may not be the most efficient way to achieve the policy objective as they reduce the average cost of energy, leading to increased consumption. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are not the most efficient policy option as they reduce energy costs, encourage consumption, counter conservation efforts, and offset emissions reductions. They may not provide equal incentives for all emission reduction alternatives and can favor costly reductions. These subsidies also decrease tax revenues and economic efficiency. A more direct and efficient approach would be a carbon tax to address pollution and environmental concerns in the energy sector. A more efficient approach to addressing pollution in the energy sector would be a carbon tax, which could generate revenues to offset other taxes, achieve distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. Tax incentives are not the most effective way to support renewable energy projects, as they often rely on outside investors to monetize tax benefits. Tax equity financing arrangements involve outside investors to monetize tax benefits, reducing federal financial support for renewable energy. Production-based tax incentives lead to more renewable electricity per federal subsidy dollar. The PTC interacts with state-level RPS policies, reducing compliance costs. Nonwind projects after 2017 and some wind projects are not eligible for the PTC without legislative action. Subsidies for renewable energy, like the PTC, lower compliance costs with state RPS mandates. Options include letting the PTC expire or temporarily extending it. Congress may extend the PTC for nonwind technologies retroactively for 2018. With the enactment of P.L. 114-113, Congress may extend the PTC for nonwind technologies retroactively for 2018. Options include applying the phaseout currently for wind to other technologies or removing the phaseout for wind so that all PTC-eligible technologies qualify at the same rate. In 2014, a proposal suggested reducing the PTC value for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh by eliminating the inflation adjustment factor. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed reducing the value of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh by eliminating the inflation adjustment factor. This would have affected facilities still within their 10-year PTC eligibility window. The proposal aimed to raise $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. A similar proposal was introduced in the 114th Congress as the PTC Elimination Act (H.R. 1901). President Obama's FY2017 budget also addressed the issue. The JCT estimated that the proposal to reduce the value of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for renewable electricity would raise $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed making the PTC permanent, adding solar facilities as qualifying property, and making the credit refundable. The investment tax credit (ITC) for renewable energy would also be made permanent. The JCT estimated that these changes would cost $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026."
