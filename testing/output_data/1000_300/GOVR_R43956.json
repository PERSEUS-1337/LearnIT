    "content": "The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), enacted in 1990, provides one-time cash benefits to individuals exposed to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing or uranium industry work between 1942 and 1971. Administered by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion have been approved, with the majority related to atomic weapons testing. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program, administered by the Department of Justice, has approved over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion in benefits. Most claims are related to atomic weapons testing. The program will sunset on July 10, 2022, and all benefit applications must be filed before that date. On July 16, 1945, the US conducted the first atomic bomb test at Trinity Test Site in New Mexico, leading to further atomic weapons testing until 1992. The majority of the 1,054 tests were done at the Nevada Test Site, with 828 underground and 100 atmospheric tests releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. Between 1951 and 1962, the Nevada Test Site conducted 100 atmospheric atomic weapons tests, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. The largest test, the Hood Test in 1957, had an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. Participants present at the test site during these tests may be eligible for benefits under the RECA program. The RECA program offers benefits to onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers affected by atomic weapons testing. Benefits are one-time lump sum payments not adjusted for inflation and not subject to federal income tax. They may be reduced by other payments for related illnesses or injuries. The RECA program provides one-time lump sum payments to onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers affected by atomic weapons testing. These payments are not subject to federal income tax and may be reduced by other payments for related illnesses or injuries. Eligible uranium workers also receive an additional $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits under EEOICPA. If the claimant is deceased, the benefit is paid to the surviving spouse or other eligible survivors. To qualify for RECA benefits, an onsite participant must meet exposure and disease requirements. Eligible survivors for benefit payments include spouse, children, parents, grandchildren, and grandparents in that order. If no eligible survivors are found, no benefit is paid. To be eligible for RECA benefits, a person must have been present onsite during atmospheric atomic weapons testing in specific geographic areas, including NTS, Pacific Test Sites, Trinity Test Site, and South Atlantic Test Site for Operation Argus. The eligibility for RECA benefits requires individuals to have been present at specific geographic areas during atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including NTS, Pacific Test Sites, Trinity Test Site, and South Atlantic Test Site for Operation Argus. This includes designated test sites, official exclusion zones, decontamination locations, and monitoring sites related to nuclear detonations. Eligible individuals must have held specific occupations and performed relevant activities during and after the testing period. Individuals eligible for RECA benefits must have been present at specific geographic areas during atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including NTS. Eligible occupations include members of the Armed Forces, civilian employees of various government agencies, and members of specific health and civil defense organizations. Required activities include duties within the operational area around each atmospheric nuclear test site. Individuals eligible for RECA benefits must have been present at specific geographic areas during atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including NTS. Eligible occupations include members of the Armed Forces, civilian employees of various government agencies, and members of specific health and civil defense organizations. Required activities include duties within the identified operational area around each atmospheric detonation of a nuclear device, decontamination of equipment, cloud tracking, garrison or maintenance duties on Enewetak atoll, and monitoring fallout patterns as part of a radiological safety team. An onsite participant must have contracted one of the listed cancers after exposure. To be eligible for RECA benefits, individuals must have been present at specific geographic areas during atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including NTS. Eligible occupations include members of the Armed Forces, civilian employees of government agencies, and specific health and civil defense organizations. An onsite participant must have contracted one of the listed cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation. As a downwinder, physical presence near NTS for a specified period is required, along with contracting one of the listed cancers. To qualify for RECA benefits, downwinders must have been present at specific geographic areas during atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including NTS, and contracted one of the listed cancers. Uranium miners must have worked in a uranium mine for at least one year between 1942 and 1971, or have been exposed to at least 40 working-level months of radiation during this period in certain states. Uranium miners, millers, and ore transporters may qualify for RECA benefits if they meet specific exposure and disease requirements. A WLM is defined as one working level of radiation exposure every work day for a month. Lung cancer or specific respiratory diseases must have developed after exposure to radiation for eligibility. Uranium millers and ore transporters may qualify for RECA benefits if they meet specific exposure and disease requirements. They must have worked in a uranium mill or transporting uranium ore from 1941 to 1971 and developed certain conditions like lung cancer or respiratory diseases after radiation exposure. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides benefits for individuals who have been exposed to radiation while working in uranium mills or transporting uranium ore. Eligibility is based on specific exposure and disease requirements, such as lung cancer, respiratory diseases, primary renal cancer, chronic renal disease, or non-malignant respiratory diseases like pulmonary fibrosis. Claimants must submit written documentation of their illnesses to qualify for benefits, with special considerations for Native Americans. Application decisions for RECA benefits are made by the Department of Justice's Civil Division. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) requires DOJ to consider Native American law, tradition, and custom in application procedures. Decisions on benefits are made within 12 months, with automatic approval if no decision is reached. The 2000 RECA amendments allow HHS to provide grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance for RECA claims. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) mandates grants from HHS for cancer screenings and medical documentation aid for RECA claims. RESEP clinics in several states offer these services, with a specific clinic for Native Americans. RECA applicants can appeal denials to the DOJ within 60 days of the initial decision. An applicant denied RECA benefits can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days. Appeals are ruled on by an officer appointed by the assistant attorney general of the Civil Division. If dissatisfied, applicants can seek judicial review in the U.S. district court. Representation by licensed attorneys or non-attorney tribal organization representatives is allowed, with non-attorneys not permitted to charge fees. Attorneys and non-attorney tribal organization representatives can represent RECA claimants, with specific limitations on fees for attorneys based on the date of the contract. Attorneys can recover costs for unsuccessful claims. Some Members of Congress are proposing legislation to expand RECA benefits for downwinders and uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. RECA program has not seen statutory changes since 2000, but these issues are likely to keep it on the congressional agenda. To qualify for RECA benefits as a downwinder, presence in a designated area is required. Some Members of Congress are proposing legislation to expand RECA benefits for downwinders and uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. Current law requires presence in designated areas to qualify for RECA benefits as a downwinder. Residents of other areas affected by fallout from atomic weapons testing are not eligible for benefits. Residents outside the current downwinder eligibility area have sought compensation for health effects from atomic weapons testing fallout. Congress created the RECA program in 1990 due to downwinders' inability to win civil judgments. Bills for compensation were introduced in 1979, aiming to hold the US liable for damages caused by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS. In 1979, H.R. 4766 aimed to make the US liable for damages from atmospheric atomic testing at NTS, providing coverage for downwinders with cancer in specific geographic areas. The proposed boundaries of the affected area for downwinder eligibility under H.R. 4766 included parts of Nevada, Utah, and California, as well as northern portions of Mohave and Coconino Counties in Arizona. The bill also aimed to hold the United States accountable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, affected sheep herds, and uranium miners, with a federal advisory board having the authority to expand the list of specified cancers. The proposed boundaries for downwinder eligibility under H.R. 4766 included areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The bill aimed to hold the United States accountable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, affected sheep herds, and uranium miners. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare would have the authority to add to the list of affected areas. The RECA downwinder eligibility areas covered regions in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The 2000 RECA amendments expanded the eligibility area, and there have been efforts to further expand it to include Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico. Members of Congress have introduced bills to expand downwinder eligibility areas, including states like Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico, as well as Guam and areas affected by fallout from atomic testing. In 2002, HRSA requested a study on the health effects of radiation exposure. The National Research Council (NRC) studied the health effects of radiation exposure for the Appropriations Act for Further Recovery From Terrorist Attacks. The NRC recommended a science-based approach for determining downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, advising against solely expanding geographic areas. The NRC recommended a science-based approach for determining downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like exposure to fallout and ingestion of Iodine 131 through milk consumption. They suggested using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for benefits. The NRC recommended a science-based approach for determining downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for benefits. This model would estimate each applicant's absorbed dose of radionuclides based on various factors, allowing every person in the country to apply for benefits. The estimated dose would then be used to calculate the probability that the individual's specific type of cancer was caused by exposure to ionizing radiation, with Congress setting the threshold for awarding benefits. The RECA program has never used a probability of causation model for downwinder eligibility, unlike other benefit programs. Advocates prefer the current presumptive eligibility model over a probability of causation model, as it may result in fewer successful claims due to low radiation exposure levels. The RECA program's presumptive eligibility model is favored over the probability of causation model recommended by the NRC, as it may result in fewer successful claims due to low radiation exposure levels. The NRC's report indicates that exposure to radiation from fallout is unlikely to be a substantial cause of cancer, leading to potentially few successful claims under scientifically based changes in eligibility criteria. Under current law, RECA benefits for uranium miners, millers, and ore transporters are only available if the worker was exposed to radiation during uranium work before 1972. The December 31, 1971 cut-off date for uranium worker eligibility was chosen due to the federal government's procurement of uranium for atomic weapons ending in 1971. Private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants has been legal since 1964, creating an additional market for mined and milled uranium. Since 1964, private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants has been legal, creating a new market for mined uranium. Legislation has been introduced to expand RECA eligibility to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, including mine core drillers and research into health effects of uranium tailing piles. Advocates argue that despite safety regulations, uranium workers, especially miners, remain at risk. Advocates push for extending RECA eligibility for uranium workers after 1971 due to continued risks despite safety regulations. Current exposure limits for radiation are higher than recommended, putting miners at elevated risk for radon-induced diseases. The RECA program aims to provide restitution to those affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium mining. The RECA program aims to provide restitution to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium mining. Advocates are pushing for an extension of RECA eligibility to cover post-1971 uranium activities, which would include workers in the commercial uranium sector. This expansion would go beyond the original statutory intent of the program. The RECA program aims to provide restitution for individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium mining. Advocates are seeking an extension of RECA eligibility to include post-1971 uranium activities in the commercial sector, potentially beyond the program's original intent. Illnesses from uranium mining for commercial clients may be covered by state workers' compensation systems."
