    "content": "The Act titled \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon. After model year 2011 and before model year 2015, the standard shall be 36 miles per gallon, and after model year 2014, it shall be 40 miles per gallon. Amendments to subsection (c) include removing paragraph (2) and adjusting the language regarding increasing the standard applicable. The amendment to the fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles includes setting standards of 17 miles per gallon after model year 1984, 19 miles per gallon after model year 2005, and 21.5 miles per gallon after model year 2008. The fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles are set to increase to 24.5 miles per gallon after model year 2011 and 27.5 miles per gallon after model year 2014. If the Secretary does not raise the standards within 24 months after the latest increase, further action may be taken. If the Secretary does not increase fuel economy standards within 24 months after the latest raise, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons for not increasing the standard. The report is due within 90 days after the 24-month period expires. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE. (a) Automobile.--Paragraph (3) of section 32901(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to increase weight limits and fuel economy standards. (b) Passenger Automobile.--Paragraph (16) of the same section is amended to define \"passenger automobile.\" The weight limit for a passenger automobile is increased from 8,500 pounds to 14,000 pounds. The definition of a passenger automobile is clarified to exclude vehicles with a primary load carrying device, seating capacity of more than 12 persons, or more than 9 persons behind the driver's seat. The amendments in this section apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act. The definition of a passenger automobile excludes vehicles with a seating capacity of more than 12 persons or more than 9 persons behind the driver's seat, as well as vehicles with a cargo area of at least 6 feet in length that is not readily accessible from the passenger compartment. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. Increased penalty for violations of fuel economy standards under section 32912 of title 49, United States Code. The penalty amount is now $10 and will be adjusted annually based on the price index. The penalty for violations of fuel economy standards will be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers. The amendments apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the accuracy of automobile fuel economy testing, including assessments of fuel economy accuracy and discussions on testing methodology changes. The Secretary of Transportation must submit a biennial report to Congress on the accuracy of automobile fuel economy testing, including assessments of fuel economy accuracy and discussions on planned changes in testing methodology. The Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency are required to consult on the preparation of this report. The Secretary of Transportation will submit a biennial report to Congress in 2005 on improving the process for measuring automobile fuel economy. This includes a study to determine the most accurate testing process for highway, urban, and combined fuel economy measurements. The Secretary of Transportation will submit a report to Congress two years after the enactment of the Act on a study to improve measuring automobile fuel economy for highway, urban, and combined use. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress two years after the Act's enactment, detailing determinations and comparisons from a study on improving automobile fuel economy measurements. The report will also include an estimate of the average adjustment to fuel economy ratings. The Secretary of Transportation will revise the testing procedure for automobile fuel economy ratings to align them closely with the most accurate calculations within 180 days of submitting a report to Congress as required by the Act. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure for measuring automobile fuel economy within 180 days of submitting a report to Congress. This procedure will be applied to determine the average fuel economy of automobiles manufactured after model year 2006. The Secretary of Transportation will amend fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured after model year 2006 based on a revised testing procedure for accurate measurement. The Secretary of Transportation will amend fuel economy standards to reflect improved accuracy in calculating automobile fuel economy using a revised testing procedure. The standards must be at least as stringent as they would have been without the revised procedure. Standards for executive agency automobiles will be amended to reflect improved accuracy in calculating fuel economy using a revised testing procedure. The standards must be at least as stringent as they would have been without the revision. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to establish fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. The amendment to Section 32917 of title 49, US Code sets fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles, including specific requirements for model years and fiscal years. The amendment to Section 32917 of title 49, US Code requires that at least 20 percent of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executive agencies in a fiscal year have a vehicle fuel economy rating. The President must regulate that 20% of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executive agencies have a fuel economy rating at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard. Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2009, at least 10,000 vehicles in the executive agencies' fleet must have a fuel economy at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard."
