    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf War Veterans' Iraqi Claims Protection Act of 1998\". Adjudication of claims is addressed in the Act. The United States Commission is authorized to receive and determine claims by U.S. nationals against Iraq, applying applicable law and principles of justice. Priority is given to non-commercial claims related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait or the attack on the USS Stark before other claims are decided. The United States Commission handles claims by U.S. nationals, including military personnel, related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait or the attack on the USS Stark. The International Claims Settlement Act applies to these claims, with some exceptions. SEC. 3. CLAIMS FUNDS. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to establish the Iraq Claims Fund for payment of claims. Proceeds from Iraqi asset liquidation will be allocated by the President between the Iraq Claims Fund and other accounts for the payment of claims, subject to limitations. The Iraq Claims Fund is established by the Secretary of the Treasury for payment of claims of the United States Government, with a limitation on the amount allocated. Certified claims outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations Commission and deemed valid by the Secretary of State are eligible for payment from this fund. The President is authorized to vest and liquidate Iraqi assets in the US to satisfy claims under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Reimbursement for administrative expenses includes a 1.5% deduction from the Iraq Claims Fund. Payments are made from the fund for valid claims outside the UN Commission's jurisdiction. The United States Commission certifies awards under section 2, with payments made from the Iraq Claims Fund in order of priority. This includes a $10,000 payment or the award's principal amount, additional payments for claims with priority, and proportional payments towards unpaid balances of all awards. After payment of awards from the Iraq Claims Fund, any remaining funds will be transferred to the Treasury of the United States. Payment of awards does not extinguish unsatisfied claims against the Government of Iraq. SEC. 7. AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER RECORDS. The head of any Executive agency may transfer records to the United States Commission for adjudication. SEC. 8. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS; DISPOSITION OF UNUSED FUNDS. The statute of limitations for certified awards under this Act is one year after the publication date of the required notice. The Secretary of the Treasury must publish a notice in the Federal Register after 9 years, detailing the statute of limitations and identifying unpaid claims. Unused funds must be disposed of after a 2-year period. The Secretary of the Treasury will dispose of any unused funds in the Iraq Claims Fund after a 2-year period by depositing them into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts if not used for additional payments. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, including \"Executive agency,\" \"Government of Iraq,\" \"United Nations Commission,\" and \"United States Commission.\""
