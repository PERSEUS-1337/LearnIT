This arrangement is not considered a health plan or insurance for tax purposes. The Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015 allows for direct primary care service arrangements with fixed fees for ongoing services. The Act also includes a provision for periodic provider fees to be treated as medical care. The Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015 allows for direct primary care service arrangements with fixed fees for ongoing services, including a model under which qualified direct primary care medical home practices are reimbursed a periodic fee for services provided to individuals enrolled under part B of title XVIII. The Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015 allows for direct primary care medical home practices to receive a periodic fee for services provided to individuals enrolled under part B of title XVIII. The fee is established by the Secretary and ensures affordable primary care. The Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015 allows direct primary care medical home practices to receive a periodic fee for services provided to individuals enrolled under part B of title XVIII. The fee is set by the Secretary to ensure affordable primary care, with a limit of twenty percent of the average per capita monthly amount payable from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015 allows direct primary care medical home practices to receive a periodic fee based on performance benchmarks set by the Secretary. Qualified practices meeting or exceeding the benchmarks can participate in the model under this subsection. Direct primary care medical home practices can receive a periodic fee based on performance benchmarks. If a practice meets or exceeds the benchmark, the fee for each individual enrolled will increase by 5 percent; if it does not meet the benchmark, the fee will be reduced by 5 percent. The periodic fee paid to the practice for each individual enrolled shall be reduced by 5 percent if performance benchmarks are not met for 2 consecutive years. Qualified direct primary care medical home practices must provide preventive care and wellness counseling. The direct primary care medical home practice must offer preventive care, wellness counseling, primary care, coordination with specialty and hospital care, 7-day per week appointments, secure e-mail and telephone consultation, 24/7 telephone access, and maintain a primary care provider panel size that supports the scope of services. The direct primary care medical home practice must have a primary care provider panel size that supports the scope of services. Priority is given to practices enrolling dual eligible individuals. Dual eligible individuals are those enrolled in part B of title XVIII. The term 'dual eligible individual' refers to someone enrolled in part B of title XVIII and described in section 1935(c)(6) of the Social Security Act. Care provided in a qualified direct primary care medical home practice under this model is not considered insurance and is not regulated as such by State insurance commissioners. Reporting to the secretary is required. A qualified direct primary care medical home practice participating in the model under this subsection must report annually to the Secretary on the progress of individuals with chronic conditions, including emergency room visits, hospitalizations, surgeries, specialist visits, and use of advanced radiology. The Secretary will provide qualified direct primary care medical home practices with necessary patient data for clinical purposes and evaluation of the model. Additionally, physicians or practitioners currently opted out of Medicare are included in the provisions. Providers currently opted out of Medicare can participate in a qualified direct primary care medical home practice under the model, and payment can be made for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Fraud by physicians or practitioners excluded from Federal health care programs is also addressed. The model under this subsection allows providers opted out of Medicare to participate in a qualified direct primary care medical home practice. Fraud by excluded physicians from Federal health care programs is prohibited. The Secretary will conduct the model for a minimum of 3 years, with the possibility of expansion after the third year. After 3 years of conducting the model, if a qualified direct primary care medical home practice meets requirements, it can continue permanently. If a majority of practices meet requirements, the model will expand nationwide. The text chunk \"SEC. 5. USE OF DIRECT PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL HOMES UNDER THE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PROGRAM.\" is about the utilization of direct primary care medical homes within the Medicare Advantage program. The text chunk allows Medicare Advantage organizations to contract with qualified direct primary care medical home practices to offer primary care services under the plan, including provisions for shared savings. A qualified direct primary care medical home practice is defined as described in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
