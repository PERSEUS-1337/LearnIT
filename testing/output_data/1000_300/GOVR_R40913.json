    "content": "The United States has historically relied on domestic energy sources, but growing industrialization and population led to increased dependence on foreign energy in the 20th century. Federal efforts have focused on increasing energy independence, reducing consumption, and developing renewable energy sources. Many programs have been established over the past 40 years to promote energy efficiency and conservation. Several programs have been established over the past 40 years to promote energy efficiency and conservation, targeting the development of renewable energy sources. These programs have been periodically reauthorized and redesigned to meet changing economic conditions and national interests, applying broadly to various sectors. Congress has enacted several major energy laws since 2005 to address energy independence and security. Since 2005, Congress has enacted major energy laws to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The Department of Energy operates the most incentive programs, with other departments also offering various programs. The Department of Energy, along with other government agencies like the Treasury, Agriculture, Interior, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Affairs, and Small Business Administration, operate programs providing grants, loans, and incentives for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D. These programs are detailed in the report, with references to agency websites and summarized incentives in the appendixes. Program descriptions are sourced from statutes, the U.S. Code, budget documents, and external databases like DSIRE and Assistance Listings. The U.S. government operates programs providing grants, loans, and incentives for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D.

Budgetary figures are compiled from executive agency justifications and congressional reports. For more information on related grant programs, refer to CRS Report R43416 and for alternative fuel programs, refer to CRS Report R42566. For more information on programs supporting alternatives to conventional fuels and engines in transportation, refer to CRS Report R42566. Tax credits for biofuels and vehicles are covered in detail in the same report. Appendices provide a summary of federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives, an index of programs by applicant eligibility and technology type, and expired federal energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs. Expired Federal Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Incentive Programs include various initiatives such as the Assisted Housing Stability and Energy Program, Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants Program, and Renewable Energy Grants."
