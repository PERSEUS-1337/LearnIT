    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define key terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"active militia,\" \"armed services,\" \"board of trustees,\" \"district,\" and \"domestic partner.\" (e) \u201cDomestic partner\u201d refers to two adults in an intimate and committed relationship registered with the Secretary of State. \n(f) \u201cFamily member\u201d includes spouses, domestic partners, children, parents, siblings, and other relatives.\n(g) \u201cFirefighter\u201d is defined as per Section 1797.182.\n(h) \u201cInterment right\u201d is the owner's rights to use a plot for human remains interment. (i) \"Nonresident\" refers to individuals who do not reside within a district or pay property taxes in the district.\n(j) \"Peace officer\" is defined as per Section 830 of the Penal Code. Chapter 5.5 (9069.10) of the Health and Safety Code outlines interment rights, specifying that disinterment of human remains requires consent from the cemetery district and the surviving spouse, child, parent, or sibling in that order of priority. Interment rights do not include the right for disinterment of human remains without consent from the cemetery district and the specified family members. The chapter also allows for the removal of remains within the same cemetery under certain circumstances, with proper documentation and record-keeping requirements in place. The cemetery district must keep a duplicate order and record of removal of remains, including date, person's name, cemetery, and reinterment details if applicable. An interment right provides a transferable property interest to the owner listed in the cemetery district records, with the option for written designation or transfer to a successor. The person making the removal must provide a complete record to the cemetery district, including details of reinterment if applicable. The owner of an interment right can designate others for burial in the plot and must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase. The transfer of interment rights must comply with state and local laws and district policies. If the owner of an interment right dies without a valid disposition, the right will pass according to intestate succession laws. The district must follow abandonment procedures if the owner has no heirs. Use of transferred interment rights must comply with state and local laws and district policies. When a public cemetery district transfers ownership rights based on a sworn affidavit, they are not liable for any claims unless they knew the information was false. The successor of an interment right must sign an affidavit declaring their entitlement to the right. A successor owner of an interment right must sign an affidavit declaring their entitlement, efforts to find other claimants, and lack of opposition. When a plot is sold in a cemetery district, the purchaser must be informed of interment rights and district policies. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement may be made for other mandated costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
