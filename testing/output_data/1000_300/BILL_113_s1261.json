    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" may be cited as the short title. It focuses on energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technologies. Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies. Each Federal agency must collaborate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop an implementation strategy within one year of enactment. The Federal agency must develop an implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies, focusing on flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and specific operational needs. This strategy should consider advanced metering infrastructure, ICT services, products, and efficient data center strategies. The Federal agency must develop an implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies, focusing on advanced metering infrastructure, ICT services, efficient data center strategies, power management, building information modeling, secure telework, and travel substitution tools to realize savings and rewards through increased efficiency and utilization. Performance goals should be established. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information and communications technology systems, including data centers. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information and communications technology systems, including data centers. These goals will include specifications, benchmarks, and recommendations for increasing energy efficiency and cost savings in Federal data centers. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information and communications technology systems, including data centers. The goals will measure IT costs over 3 to 5 years and cost savings from energy-efficient practices. Recommendations will include using energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting. The Director will establish performance goals for Federal agencies to improve energy-efficient IT systems, including data centers. This includes measuring IT costs over 3 to 5 years, cost savings from energy-efficient practices, and maintaining a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force. The Director will maintain a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force comprised of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. The task force members will collaborate to achieve agency and Federal energy efficiency goals, exchange best practices with the private sector, and submit reports as required by each agency. The Federal agencies are required to report their efforts and results on energy efficiency in their annual reports under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Director of OMB will also include a description of agency efforts and results in the annual report and scorecard starting from October 1, 2013. The Director is required to include a description of Federal agencies' efforts and results on energy efficiency in the annual report and scorecard under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization to coordinate a program and conduct a study by a specific deadline. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to require a study on server and data center energy efficiency by a specific deadline. The study includes a comparison of estimates from 2007 to 2012 and an analysis of technology solutions' impact. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to require a study on server and data center energy efficiency by a specific deadline. The study includes an analysis of information and communications technologies, virtualization, cloud computing-based solutions, updated projections, and recommendations for best practices. Additionally, a Data Center Energy Practitioner Program will be maintained to certify energy practitioners qualified to evaluate energy usage. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to require a study on server and data center energy efficiency by a specific deadline. A Data Center Energy Practitioner Program will be maintained to certify energy practitioners qualified to evaluate energy usage. Additionally, an open data initiative will be established by the Secretary in collaboration with designated organizations. The Secretary will establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while protecting national security interests. Additionally, efforts will be made to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency. The Secretary will collaborate with designated organizations to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency, including developing an efficiency metric for overall data center energy efficiency."
