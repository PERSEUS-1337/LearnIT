    "content": "Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness was historically less generous than for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer covered services, and higher cost sharing. Mental health parity laws were enacted to address this disparity in insurance coverage. Mental health parity laws aim to equalize insurance coverage for mental health services with medical and surgical services. Policymakers have developed approaches based on coverage mandates and parity requirements to achieve this goal. Mental health parity laws may require insurers to cover certain mental illnesses with mandated coverage and parity requirements. Different policy approaches include full parity, minimum mandated benefit, and mandated offering parity. The federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA employed a mandated offering parity approach. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements by mandating coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level, but contains provisions that mandate coverage. The ACA does not have an explicit coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level but includes provisions mandating coverage for certain plans. It expands federal mental health parity requirements by applying them to specific financing arrangements, building on existing laws like MHPA and MHPAEA. The MHPA and MHPAEA laws require parity in mental health coverage, including treatment limitations and financial requirements. Employers have adjusted benefits in response to MHPAEA, with some eliminating limits on coverage while others have increased utilization management. The ACA does not mandate coverage for specific mental health conditions but expands federal parity requirements. The MHPA and MHPAEA laws require parity in mental health coverage, with some employers adjusting benefits by eliminating coverage limits or increasing utilization management. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services for certain plans, impacting decisions on coverage retention. The federal mental health parity law, MHPA, mandates offering parity with no coverage mandates but requiring partial parity. It ensures that annual and lifetime dollar limits for mental health services are no less than those for medical and surgical services. MHPA amends ERISA, PHSA, and IRC to apply parity coverage requirements to all group health coverage arrangements. It establishes a small employer exemption for businesses with 2-50 employees. MHPA establishes a small employer exemption for businesses with 2-50 employees from federal mental health parity requirements. MHPAEA expands the scope of parity requirements to include substance use disorders and additional parity in treatment limitations and financial requirements. The MHPAEA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders and additional parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits for small employers. The federal mental health parity requirements do not apply to the individual market and were codified at PHSA Section 2705 before the ACA. The ACA extended federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders and additional parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits for small employers. Medicare is not required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA mandates coverage of certain mental health services by specific plan types. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders and additional parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits for small employers. It mandates coverage of certain mental health services by specific plan types, including qualified health plans, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and plans offered through the individual market. The ACA modifies existing parity law to require compliance with federal mental health parity requirements by plans offered through the individual market, while maintaining the small employer exemption. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders and additional parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits for small employers. Plans offered through the individual market must comply with federal mental health parity requirements, including coverage of mental health services. Medicaid benchmark plans offering mental health services must also adhere to federal parity requirements. The interaction between these requirements and the small employer exemption may need to be addressed through rulemaking. Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans offering mental health services must comply with federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA mandates coverage of certain mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid plans, and new plans in the individual and small group markets. The application of federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans is explained in detail. The main considerations for coverage of mental health and substance abuse services are the existence of a coverage mandate and whether services are covered at parity. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services in QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets. It requires these services to be offered at full parity with medical or surgical services. Federal mental health parity law does not include a coverage mandate but requires full parity when benefits are offered. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services in QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets, ensuring full parity with medical or surgical services. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance abuse services in QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets, ensuring full parity with medical or surgical services. The essential health benefits package (EHBP) must include services within 10 general categories, with coverage determined through the rulemaking process. The scope of benefits provided should be equal to those in a typical employer plan, with specific elements outlined for consideration. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health services in various health insurance plans, ensuring parity with medical services. While not a comprehensive federal mandate, it creates a requirement for mental health benefits coverage by many insurers. Some states also have parity laws mandating coverage for certain mental health conditions. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health services in health insurance plans, creating a federal-level requirement for insurers. Some states also have parity laws mandating coverage for certain mental health conditions. ACA Section 1311(d)(3) allows states to require additional benefits in Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), but the state must cover the cost of these benefits. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health services in health insurance plans, creating a federal-level requirement for insurers. States can require additional benefits in Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), with the state covering the cost. ACA Section 1311(j) ensures federal mental health parity requirements apply to all QHPs. QHPs offered through Exchanges will be available in small group and individual markets, with large group plans allowed to participate starting in 2017. Small employers are exempt from certain requirements. Plans offered through the Exchange may have less incentive to participate due to the exemption of small employers from federal mental health parity requirements. This exemption applies to small employers with 2 to 50 employees and extends to states where the exemption is in place. The small employer exemption from federal mental health parity requirements applies to employers with 2 to 50 employees and extends to group health plans in the individual market. ACA Section 1563(c)(4) extends these requirements to plans in the individual market but does not explicitly remove the small employer exemption. The ACA conforming amendment extends federal mental health parity requirements to plans in the individual market, but the small employer exemption may still apply based on the amended statutory language. Based on the amended statutory language, the small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still apply to employers with 1 to 100 employees, expanding the previous range. States have the option to use the pre-ACA definition of small employer until 2016 for plans offered through an Exchange. Until 2016, states can use the pre-ACA definition of small employer for plans offered through an Exchange. Questions may arise regarding the federal mental health parity requirements for plans offered to individuals in the individual market versus group coverage for single individuals as employers. The small employer exemption may still apply to small employer QHPs under ACA Section 1311(j). The ACA does not specify if small employer QHPs offered inside or outside of an Exchange might be exempt from federal mental health parity requirements. Medicaid can be offered through traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage, including managed care plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, in addition to Medicaid managed care plans. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans, which must comply with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans must comply with federal mental health parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements, excluding aggregate lifetime and annual limits. Plans offering EPSDT services meet the parity requirement, but Medicaid managed care plans must comply with all federal parity requirements. Plans offered under traditional Medicaid may not need to comply with federal mental health parity requirements for annual and lifetime limits and in- and out-of-network benefits, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. It is unclear if these requirements extend to non-managed care plans under traditional Medicaid. Requiring all types of Medicaid plans to adhere to federal mental health parity requirements, while exempting plans offering EPSDT services, could impact coverage for mental health and substance abuse services for Medicaid enrollees. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to newly eligible Medicaid populations, while existing CHIP provisions already apply these requirements to CHIP plans. Changes may be needed to align existing CHIP provisions with ACA requirements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to newly eligible Medicaid populations, while existing CHIP provisions already apply these requirements to CHIP plans. Changes may be needed to align existing CHIP provisions with ACA requirements, specifically in conforming statutory provisions in SSA Title XXI. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, similar to existing CHIP provisions. However, it is unclear if offering EPSDT services in CHIP plans would fulfill all federal mental health parity requirements outlined in SSA Section 2103. Compliance with the full set of parity requirements is required under SSA Section 2103(f)(2), which includes adherence to subpart 2 of part A of Title XXVII of the PHSA. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include CHIP plans, individual market plans, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It mandates compliance with the full set of parity requirements outlined in SSA Section 2103(f)(2) and Title XXVII of the PHSA. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include CHIP plans, individual market plans, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It creates a mandate for coverage of certain mental health services for specific plan types, representing a significant change from prior federal law. Small employer exemption is maintained, but questions arise about its impact on small employer plans in the Exchange. Federal mental health parity requirements under the ACA extend to all qualified health plans, including small employer plans in the Exchange. Some requirements apply to Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, but it's unclear for traditional Medicaid plans. The CHIP statute includes two parity provisions, one with limited reach and another applying requirements to CHIP plans entirely."
