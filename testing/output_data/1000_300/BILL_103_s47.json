Chapter 154 of Title 28, United States Code, introduces special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. This chapter applies to cases under section 2254 brought by prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence, addressing the appointment of counsel and procedures for appointment. This chapter applies to cases under section 2254 brought by prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence, requiring the appointment of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners. The State must establish a mechanism for appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses, with standards of competency for appointed counsel. The chapter applies to cases under section 2254 for State prisoners under a capital sentence, requiring competent counsel in post-conviction proceedings. The mechanism must appoint counsel for indigent prisoners with standards of competency. The chapter applies to cases under section 2254 for State prisoners under a capital sentence, requiring competent counsel in post-conviction proceedings. Counsel appointed for indigent prisoners must not have previously represented the prisoner at trial or on direct appeal unless requested. Ineffectiveness of counsel in post-conviction proceedings is not grounds for relief in subsequent proceedings. In capital cases, the ineffectiveness of counsel during post-conviction proceedings is not a basis for relief under this chapter or section 2254. Different counsel can be appointed during these proceedings. A mandatory stay of execution can be granted upon application to the appropriate court, if the State has invoked post-conviction review procedures. A stay of execution can be granted upon application to the court if the State has invoked post-conviction review procedures. The stay expires if the prisoner fails to file a habeas corpus petition within the required time or if the petition for relief is denied after district court and court of appeals review. If relief is denied and the time for filing a petition for certiorari has expired or the Supreme Court denies the petition, or if a State prisoner under a capital sentence waives the right to pursue habeas corpus review, then no stay of execution can be granted. If relief is denied and the time for filing a petition for certiorari has expired or the Supreme Court denies the petition, or if a State prisoner under a capital sentence waives the right to pursue habeas corpus review, then no stay of execution can be granted. Habeas corpus review under section 2254 of this title must be done in the presence of counsel and after being advised of the consequences of waiving the right. No Federal court can enter a stay of execution or grant relief in a capital case unless the claim was not previously presented, the failure to raise the claim was due to State action violating the Constitution or laws, a new retroactively applicable Federal right was recognized by the Supreme Court, or the claim is based on new evidence. Sec. 2258 outlines the requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition, including time limits and tolling rules. The petition must be filed in the appropriate district court within specified timeframes. The petition must demonstrate that the claim is based on new evidence or a new retroactively applicable Federal right recognized by the Supreme Court, and that the facts underlying the claim could undermine the court's confidence in the jury's determination of guilt in a capital case. The death penalty was imposed, and Sec. 2258 outlines the time requirements and tolling rules for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 of this title. The petition must be filed within 180 days after an order is issued in compliance with section 2256(c) of this title. Time requirements can be tolled in certain circumstances, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court seeking review of a capital sentence. The time requirements and tolling rules for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 of this title are outlined in Sec. 2258. The petition must be filed within 180 days after an order is issued in compliance with section 2256(c) of this title. Time requirements can be tolled in certain circumstances, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court seeking review of a capital sentence. Additionally, there are provisions for extending the filing deadline in specific situations, including when a State prisoner has a pending request for post-conviction review or when there is a showing of good cause for the delay. Sec. 2259 outlines the rules for evidentiary hearings and the scope of Federal review for State prisoners under a capital sentence. The time requirement for filing a habeas corpus petition is continuously tolled during post-conviction review until final disposition by the highest State court, as long as State filing rules are met. Tolling does not occur during a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court after State post-conviction review. Sec. 2259 outlines rules for evidentiary hearings and Federal review for State prisoners under a capital sentence. The district court determines the sufficiency of the evidentiary record for habeas corpus review based on claims presented in State courts, unless certain exceptions apply. Sec. 2260 states that a certificate of probable cause is not required to appeal from the district court to the court of appeals. The district court will decide on the claims before it. A certificate of probable cause is not needed to appeal from the district court to the court of appeals in habeas corpus cases under this chapter, except for second or successive petitions."
