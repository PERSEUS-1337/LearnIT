    "content": "This report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020, comparing enacted FY2019 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request, and the enacted appropriations measures. It also provides additional informational resources on DHS appropriations and lists CRS policy experts for consultation. The CRS reports on homeland security appropriations track legislative action and congressional issues related to discretionary funding amounts. The curr_chunk discusses appropriations legislation related to DHS, focusing on discretionary funding amounts and specialized budgetary concepts. It does not analyze mandatory funding issues or other legislation related to DHS programs. The Appendix explains budgetary terms and the appropriations process. For more information, refer to CRS Report R42388. The curr_chunk provides detailed information on appropriations for homeland security, including budget authority, unrounded data calculations, and data sources for FY2019. It references the Budget Control Act, CRS Report R42388, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. The curr_chunk provides data on FY2019 appropriations for homeland security, sourced from P.L. 116-6 and two supplemental acts. It also includes FY2020 requested and House Appropriations Committee-recommended levels from H.Rept. 116-180. The curr_chunk provides data on FY2020 appropriations for homeland security, sourced from various congressional reports and acts. The scoring methodology is consistent and relies on data provided by the Appropriations Committees developed with Congressional Budget Office (CBO) methodology. Comparisons with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) data are not attempted due to technical scoring differences. The curr_chunk provides an overview of the legislative process for appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2020, sourced from Appropriations Committees with CBO methodology. OMB data on mandatory spending is no longer included in this report for consistency. The Trump Administration released its detailed budget request for FY2020 on March 18, 2019. The Trump Administration requested $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2020, representing a 4.6% increase from the previous year's appropriations. The Trump Administration requested a $2.27 billion increase in annual net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2020. This includes funding for FEMA in disaster relief and Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror designated funding for the Coast Guard. The House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 3931, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, which included $52.80 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.12 billion above the Administration's request. The bill also included $14.08 billion in disaster relief-designated funding and OCO funding from the Defense Appropriations bill. The House committee bill for FY2019 included $14.08 billion in disaster relief funding and OCO funding for the Coast Guard. Amendments in the full committee markup led to a CBO scoring exceeding the subcommittee allocation by $3 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up S. 2582 for the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, with $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.50 billion above the Administration's request. The Senate committee bill for FY2020 included $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.50 billion above the Administration's request. It also included increased funding for border barrier construction, Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and FEMA. Additionally, the bill included $17.35 billion in disaster relief-designated funding and $190 million in OCO-designated funding for the Coast Guard. In late September 2019, Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) to temporarily extend funding at the FY2019 rate for operations through November 21, subsequently extended through December 20. The CR included provisions addressing needs of DHS under a CR, such as special apportionment of funds for Secret Service expenses related to the FY2020 presidential campaign and an accelerated rate of apportionment for the Disaster Relief Fund. Section 133 of the FY2020 presidential campaign allows for an accelerated rate of apportionment for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) to ensure program funding. Section 134 extends authorization for the National Flood Insurance Program to issue new policies, while Section 135 allocates funds for a planned restructuring of some DHS management activities. Additionally, Section 101(6) extends immigration provisions linked to the appropriations cycle. Explanatory statements for two consolidated appropriations bills were released on the House Rules Committee website on December 16, 2019. On December 16, 2019, the House Rules Committee released explanatory statements for two consolidated appropriations bills. One bill, using H.R. 1158 as a legislative shell, included the FY2020 DHS annual appropriations measure with $50.47 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The bill passed in the House by a vote of 280-138 on December 17 and in the Senate by a vote of 81-11 on December 19. It was signed into law on December 20, 2019. The FY2020 DHS annual appropriations bill included $190 million in Overseas Contingency Operations funding for the Coast Guard. It was passed by the House and Senate with votes of 280-138 and 81-11 respectively, and signed into law on December 20, 2019 as P.L. 116-93. The bill allocates resources to every departmental component of DHS, with discretionary appropriations making up the majority of funding. The Department of Homeland Security's funding includes fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles, with the first four grouping components thematically and the fifth providing general direction. Congress and the Administration initially used existing account structures for funding after DHS was established in 2003. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure to standardize appropriations format. In 2014, DHS started developing a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format. The CAS aimed to streamline over 70 different appropriations and over 100 Programs, Projects, and Activities to enhance transparency and simplify spending decisions. After negotiations with Congress, DHS implemented the CAS in its budget request for FY2017, converting legacy appropriations structures into four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements. The Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) was implemented by DHS in its budget request for FY2017, converting legacy appropriations structures into four categories: Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance. Operations and Support cover operating salaries and expenses, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements fund planning and deployment of assets, Research and Development identify new technologies, and Federal Assistance supports grant funding managed by DHS components. The Federal Protective Service and USCG's Retired Pay are two appropriations not included in the CAS structure. The FPS account allows funds to be spent as needed, while the USCG's Retired Pay covers costs for retired personnel entitlements. The USCG's Retired Pay appropriation supports retired personnel entitlements, including pensions, Survivor Benefits Plans, and medical care. It is categorized as appropriated mandatory spending and does not count against discretionary allocation. FEMA receives a separate appropriation for disaster relief activities authorized under the Stafford Act. FEMA receives separate appropriations for its disaster relief activities under the Stafford Act, allowing for consistent tracking of spending and transparency. The National Flood Insurance Program has mandatory spending but certain functions are funded through discretionary appropriations and fees collected by the government. Certain program costs related to floodplain management, flood mapping, and flood insurance operations are funded through discretionary appropriations and fees collected by the government. Prior to the FY2017 act, appropriations included specific conditions on how budget authority could be used, but in the FY2017 act, these provisions were grouped at the ends of titles where their targeted components are funded. In the FY2017 act, provisions within appropriations and component-specific general provisions were grouped as \"administrative provisions\" at the ends of titles where their targeted components are funded. This report tracks changes in administrative and general provisions compared to the prior year's enacted measure, noting dropped, added, and modified provisions for various reasons such as time passage, legislative priorities, and compromises between chambers. The report discusses appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, categorizing its components into Law Enforcement Operational Components, Incident Response and Recovery Operational Components, and Support Components. The bills developed by one chamber may not necessarily reflect the other chamber's priorities. The Department of Homeland Security is divided into operational components, support components, and headquarters components. Each group's role is described with their funding details for FY2019 and FY2020. Law enforcement operational components are funded in Title II of the annual DHS appropriations act. Funding for law enforcement operational components in the Department of Homeland Security is generally provided in Title II of the annual appropriations act. This includes agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, and U.S. Coast Guard, each with specific responsibilities for securing borders, preventing terrorism, and ensuring transportation security. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provides security for the U.S. transportation system, while the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is responsible for maritime safety and security in U.S. ports. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) protects the President, Vice-President, and other designated individuals and locations. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) protects key individuals and locations, investigates financial crimes, and enforces counterfeiting laws. Budget breakdown for USSS components is detailed in appropriations legislation. House Appropriations Committee bill H.R. 3931 had 31 administrative provisions for Title II, dropping eight from the previous year, including provisions related to ICE, TSA, and USCG funding allocations. The House Appropriations Committee bill H.R. 3931 included various provisions such as reprogramming funding for ICE detention, mandating TSA to monitor airport exit lanes, allowing USCG to allocate OCO funding, authorizing a TSA pilot program for screening services, requiring USCG to maintain staffing at its Operations Systems Center, prohibiting competitions to privatize USCG activities, allowing funds to alter USCG Civil Engineering program activities, and requiring DHS collaboration with local governments on border barrier siting. The House Appropriations Committee bill H.R. 3931 included provisions for reprogramming ICE detention funding, TSA monitoring of airport exit lanes, USCG allocation of OCO funding, a TSA pilot program for screening services, maintaining USCG staffing at its Operations Systems Center, prohibiting privatization competitions for USCG activities, and requiring DHS collaboration with local governments on border barrier siting. The Senate Appropriations Committee's S. 2582 had 33 administrative provisions in Title II, with modifications to three previously carried provisions and the addition of seven new provisions. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included 36 administrative provisions in Title II, dropping Sections 225 and 232 from the FY2019 act, modifying four provisions, and adding six new administrative provisions. The FY2019 act had provisions dropped, modified, and new ones included. Funding for operational components, including FEMA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is found in Title III of the annual DHS appropriations act. Title III of the annual DHS appropriations act includes funding for the National Flood Insurance Program and the newly restructured Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which promotes information sharing and leads cybersecurity initiatives. The reorganization shifted the Federal Protective Service from CISA to the Management Directorate, reducing budgetary resources in this title. FEMA leads efforts to protect the US from natural disasters, terrorism, and other hazards through a comprehensive emergency management system. FEMA leads federal efforts to protect the US from various hazards through an emergency management system. Table 4 breaks down budget resources for FEMA, including appropriations from outside Title III. H.R. 3931 had eight administrative provisions. The House Appropriations Committee's H.R. 3931 included eight administrative provisions, with some modifications and additions, such as allowing governors to resubmit requests for FEMA assistance for certain disasters.

The Senate dropped three provisions from the FY2019 act. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included seven administrative provisions, with some modifications and additions. The administrative provisions in P.L. 116-93, Div. D, include modifications and additions, with funding for support components typically in Title IV of the annual DHS appropriations bill. USCIS administers U.S. immigration laws, while FLETC provides technical training for law enforcement professionals. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) is a technical training school for law enforcement professionals, serving federal, state, and local agencies. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) leads research and development for DHS, while the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD) focuses on defending against weapons of mass destruction. Budgetary resources for these components are controlled through appropriations legislation. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees made changes to administrative provisions in budgetary resources for DHS components. H.R. 3931 dropped two provisions and added two new ones, while S. 2582 dropped one provision from the previous year. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees made changes to administrative provisions for DHS components.

D, includes seven administrative provisions in Title IV, with sections 402 and 408 from the FY2019 act being dropped and one new provision added. Funding for headquarters components in the annual DHS appropriations act is traditionally in Title I. Office of the Secretary and Executive Management (OSEM) provides central leadership and oversight. Departmental Management Directorate (DM) offers mission support services. Analysis and Operations (A&O) includes the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination (OPS). Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations independently. The Office of Operations Coordination (OPS) provides operations coordination and information sharing for DHS, ensuring continuity and resilience. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent body that audits DHS efficiency and effectiveness to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Table 8 breaks down budgetary resources for these components controlled through appropriations legislation. The table shows the breakdown of budgetary resources for DHS components funded within Title I and outside the title, with details on administrative provisions in H.R. 3931 and S. 2582. The House bill included a new provision to create an Immigration Detention Ombudsman, while the Senate bill retained all six previously enacted provisions without substantive modifications. The final appropriations act included the new provision with minor modifications. General provisions in the DHS appropriations act remain largely unchanged from year to year. The annual DHS appropriations act contains general provisions that impact the entire department, with most provisions remaining unchanged from year to year. The FY2019 act included 40 general provisions, while H.R. 3931 carried 36 provisions, including modifications and new additions. Six provisions from the FY2019 act were not retained in the House committee version of H.R. 3931.

D, allocated $41 million for Presidential Residence Protection Cost Grants. S. 2582 did not include additional appropriations for any DHS activities in Title V. Rescissions of prior-year appropriations reducing net funding levels were also included in the bill. Rescissions of prior-year appropriations reducing net funding levels are included in the bill. For FY2019, $303 million in rescissions and a provision to use $300 million of unobligated balances from the DRF offset new appropriations. The Administration proposed rescinding $250 million from the DRF for FY2020. Section 536 of H.R. 3931 included $657 million in rescissions, with the largest reduction coming from CBP's PC&I appropriation for FY2019 by $601 million.

For more on FY2020 DHS appropriations, refer to CRS reports R45972, R44604, and R44052. The FY2020 DHS appropriations involved a multistep process of budget authority, obligations, and outlays. Budget authority is enacted by Congress, funds are obligated for activities, and payments are made to liquidate obligations. Congressional clients can consult CRS experts for more information on DHS appropriations. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite or available on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Budget authority can be one-year, multiyear, or no-year. One-year funds must be spent within that fiscal year, while multiyear and no-year funds can be spent over a longer period. Obligations are incurred when agencies make contracts or receive services, creating a legal requirement to pay. Outlays are the actual funds spent in a fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority. Funds can be obligated in one year but spent in a future year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It includes discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funds appropriated yearly by Congress. Gross budget authority is the total funds available for spending, composed of discretionary and mandatory spending. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 distinguishes between discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is annually appropriated by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws outside of appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs require yearly appropriations, such as Coast Guard retirement pay within DHS. Offset funds are collected by the government through business transactions. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) distinguishes between discretionary and mandatory spending. Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending within DHS. Offset funds collected by the government are not considered federal revenue but are counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget to calculate gross budget authority. The DHS budget includes offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget to calculate gross budget authority. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process involving 302(a) and 302(b) allocations. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary totals available to the Committees on Appropriations for annual appropriations bills. The appropriations committees then allocate the 302(a) funds among subcommittees for each bill as 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made during the year as bills progress. Table A-1 provides comparable figures. The 302(b) allocations can be adjusted by the appropriations committee throughout the year. Table A-1 compares the 302(b) allocation for FY2020. The House markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill exceeded the 302(b) discretionary allocation by $3.066 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. These provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending. Adjustments can be made to cover funding for overseas operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud control. The Budget Control Act allows for adjustments to statutory caps to fund overseas operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud control. Adjustments are determined by the Office of Management and Budget based on a formula involving a rolling average of disaster relief spending over the last ten fiscal years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula for disaster relief cap adjustments, increasing the allowable size by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020 estimating an allowable adjustment of $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history. In August 2019, OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020 estimating an allowable adjustment of $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history. This estimate includes the 10-year average, 5% of emergency-designated Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The final adjustment for FY2020 may still vary from this estimate."
