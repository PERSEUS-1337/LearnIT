    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crane Conservation Act of 2003\". The findings section follows. Congress finds that crane populations in many countries have experienced serious decline in recent decades, threatening the long-term survival of the species in the wild in Africa, Asia, and Europe. 5 species of Asian crane are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Convention, including the Siberian crane, red-crowned crane, white-naped crane, black-necked crane, and hooded crane. The Crane Action Plan of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature focuses on 4 species of cranes. The Crane Action Plan identifies seriously threatened crane species including the wattled crane, blue crane, grey-crowned crane, black-crowned crane, and sarus crane. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are listed as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are endangered species with populations at risk of extinction due to hunting and habitat loss. Conservation efforts have been insufficient to address the decline in crane populations. Cranes are important for the conservation of wetland, grassland, and agricultural landscapes. Cranes are flagship species for wetland and grassland conservation, providing benefits to other species. Threats to cranes include egg collection, poisoning, collisions, disturbance, and trapping. Conservation programs are needed to address these threats effectively. Cranes face threats such as warfare, human settlement, trapping for sale, and conservation efforts require joint commitment from countries in Africa, Asia, and North America. Cranes are important ambassadors for promoting goodwill among countries due to their migration across continents. Conservation successes and methods developed in one region can be applied globally, and there is much to learn and teach among conservationists worldwide. Conservation successes and methods developed in one region have wide applicability globally. Conservationists in the United States can learn from colleagues in other countries where government and private agencies cooperate to conserve threatened cranes. The Act aims to support the conservation of cranes by perpetuating healthy populations, assisting in conservation efforts globally, and providing financial resources for programs and organizations dedicated to crane conservation. The Act defines conservation as methods to ensure crane populations in the wild are sufficient to prevent extinction, including habitat protection, research, and management assistance. The Crane Conservation Act outlines various conservation measures including research, monitoring, management plan development, enforcement, habitat protection, reintroduction, conflict resolution, and community outreach. The Act also defines key terms such as \"Convention\" and \"Fund.\" The Crane Conservation Act defines key terms such as \"Convention\" (as per the Endangered Species Act of 1973) and \"Fund\" (Crane Conservation Fund), as well as the term \"Secretary\" referring to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 5. CRANE CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects with approved proposals. Applicants must submit project proposals meeting specified requirements for consideration. Eligible applicants include relevant wildlife management entities. Eligible applicants for financial assistance for crane conservation projects include wildlife management authorities within the range of crane species, the Convention's Secretariat, and individuals or organizations with expertise in crane conservation. Eligible applicants for financial assistance for crane conservation projects include wildlife management authorities, the Convention's Secretariat, and individuals or organizations with expertise in crane conservation. Project proposals must include a concise statement of purpose, names and qualifications of project personnel, and descriptions of methods, staff, and community management. The project proposal must include methods, staff and community management details, logistics, estimated funds and time needed, government support, and matching funding information. The Secretary reviews project proposals to determine eligibility for assistance under the Act, including the need for support, matching funding details, and any other necessary information. Other federal officials are provided with a copy of the proposal within 30 days for review. The Secretary reviews project proposals for eligibility under the Act, consulting with other federal officials.

The Secretary reviews project proposals for eligibility under the Act, consulting with federal officials. Within 180 days, the Secretary approves or disapproves the proposal and notifies the applicant, other federal officials, and relevant countries. The Secretary may approve a project if it enhances conservation programs for cranes, addresses conflicts with humans, and ensures compliance with the Convention. The curr_chunk focuses on implementing conservation programs, addressing conflicts between humans and cranes, enhancing compliance with laws, developing scientific information on crane habitat and population, and promoting cooperative projects among governmental entities. The curr_chunk focuses on threats to crane habitat, promoting cooperative projects, scientific research, reintroducing cranes into the wild, and providing training for effective conservation efforts. The curr_chunk emphasizes providing training and support for staff managing crane habitats to enhance conservation capacity. Preference is given to projects ensuring long-term conservation or with matching funds available. Recipients of assistance must submit periodic reports to the Secretary. Each recipient of assistance must submit periodic reports to the Secretary, including necessary information for project evaluation and public availability. The Secretary shall convene a panel of experts to identify conservation needs for cranes biennially. SEC. 6. CRANE CONSERVATION FUND. Establishment of the Crane Conservation Fund within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, consisting of transferred amounts, appropriations, and interest earned. Expenditures from the Fund are subject to approval by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Crane Conservation Fund is established within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury can transfer necessary amounts for assistance under section 5. Administrative expenses are limited to 3% or $80,000. Up to 50% of the Fund can be used for projects related to North American crane species conservation. The Crane Conservation Fund, part of the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, limits the use of funds for North American crane species projects to 50%. The Secretary of the Treasury invests excess funds in interest-bearing US obligations through original issue or market purchase. The Secretary of the Treasury invests excess funds in interest-bearing US obligations through original issue or market purchase. Any obligations acquired by the Fund may be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited to the Fund. Transfers of amounts to the Fund are done monthly based on estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury. Adjustments are made to transferred amounts based on prior estimates. The Secretary may accept donations for assistance under section 5, which will be transferred to the Treasury for deposit in the Fund. Adjustments are made to transferred amounts based on prior estimates. SEC. 7. ADVISORY GROUP. The Secretary may convene an advisory group of individuals involved in crane conservation. The group will hold open meetings for public participation, provide notice of meetings, and keep minutes available to the public. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Fund is set at $3,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2007, with funds remaining available until expended."
