    "content": "The federal government has a strong interest in regulating hazardous chemicals security to prevent terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001. Congress focuses on the security of hazardous chemicals in transportation and storage facilities to reduce the risk of exploitation by terrorists. Congressional attention has shifted to reviewing federal policies related to marine transportation of hazardous chemical cargo, with a focus on increasing penalties for criminal or terrorist activities around ports and marine vessels. This report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, discussing the general risks in the homeland security context. This report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, focusing on the risks, federal statistics on shipments, relevant maritime security regulations, and policy issues associated with security. It discusses the potential impact of hazardous chemicals in terrorist attacks and the security measures needed to protect against such threats. The report focuses on marine shipments of acutely hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose a catastrophic hazard to the public. It does not address other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. Due to legal limitations, detailed statistics are not provided. The report highlights the potential threat of terrorist attacks on marine shipments of hazardous chemicals, which are considered critical infrastructures. Protection of these shipments is crucial for U.S. homeland security strategy. The protection of hazardous chemical shipments passing through U.S. waterways and ports is vital for homeland security. While no marine vessel carrying hazardous chemicals has been used in a terrorist attack on civilians, accidents have shown the potential impact on nearby communities. Intelligence suggests terrorists may have the interest and capability to execute such attacks in the United States. Major accidents involving hazardous chemical transportation are rare but have resulted in some of the deadliest industrial disasters in history. For example, the explosion of the Mont-Blanc in 1917 killed over 1,900 people in Halifax, and the 1947 Texas City explosion killed nearly 600. Improved safety measures have prevented similar disasters in the past 60 years. Intelligence suggests terrorists may target hazardous chemical shipping in the United States. The Texas City disaster in 1947 killed nearly 600 people and injured 3,500. Since then, there have been incidents involving chemical marine shipments, such as fires and accidents, but no major disasters like Texas City. In the late 1990s, there were attempts by international combatants and domestic terrorists to release chemicals from land-based manufacturing and storage facilities, including attacks on plants producing various hazardous chemicals. These incidents raised concerns for public safety and led to evacuations, although terrorists have never used a marine cargo vessel for a chemical attack on the general public. In the late 1990s, there were attempts to release chemicals from land-based facilities producing pesticides and pharmaceuticals near population centers. Terrorists targeted marine vessels, with incidents involving attacks on warships and an oil tanker off the Yemeni coast. Foreign governments expressed concerns about terrorists commandeering hazardous chemical vessels. The oil tanker Limburg was attacked off the Yemeni coast by a bomb-laden fishing boat. Foreign governments are concerned about terrorist groups targeting hazardous chemical vessels. The Department of Homeland Security in the United States is focused on securing chemical infrastructure, including chemical tanker ships. LNG has received particular public attention as a hazardous marine cargo. The National Strategy highlights the security challenges posed by hazardous marine cargo, specifically liquefied natural gas (LNG), which has been identified as a potential terrorist target. The risks associated with LNG shipments are real and cannot be entirely eliminated, with potential terrorist attacks on LNG tankers considered credible. Various attack methods on LNG tankers have been identified, including ramming, explosives, insider takeover, hijacking, and external terrorist actions. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) directs federal homeland security activities to focus on preventing terrorist attacks. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) directs federal homeland security activities to focus on preventing terrorist attacks involving hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels that could pose catastrophic hazards to the general public, such as poisoning, asphyxiation, chemical burns, or thermal burns. Numerous federal standards identify potentially hazardous chemicals for public security. The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates hazardous materials transportation under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975. They classify materials like toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable ones for safe shipping. The DOT classifies hazardous materials for safe transportation, including toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable materials. They group materials by type of hazard but not by relative degree of hazard. The DOT also requires shippers of certain \"highly hazardous\" cargo to develop security plans for materials like radioactive material and explosives. The DOT defines highly hazardous cargo to include radioactive material, explosives, poisonous inhalation materials, bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, packaged hazardous material, CDC regulated agents, and materials requiring placarding. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels in U.S. waters, regulating hazardous cargo and prescribing special requirements for vessels carrying certain hazardous materials. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels in U.S. waters, regulating hazardous cargo with special requirements for vessels carrying specific hazardous materials such as bulk solid, liquid, liquified gas, compressed gas, and incompatible chemicals. The Coast Guard identifies hazardous marine cargoes through regulations for waterfront facilities. Hundreds of hazardous materials are listed, but the relative degree of hazard is not specified. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling potentially hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act, requiring risk management plans for facilities with specified quantities of hazardous substances. Plans must include off-site consequence analysis for worst-case accidents and measures to prevent and mitigate releases. Hazardous substances include listed chemicals and those designated by the EPA. The Clean Air Act requires risk management plans for facilities handling hazardous substances, including 14 listed substances and additional chemicals designated by the EPA based on risk criteria. The EPA's list includes acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile liquids. High explosives were removed from the list in 1998, and flammable substances used as fuel are excluded. The current EPA/RMP list is in Appendix 2. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous materials excludes high explosives and flammable substances used as fuel. Most hazardous materials on DOT and Coast Guard lists do not pose catastrophic health hazards to the general public due to limited quantities or physical properties. The EPA list identifies chemicals with the greatest potential consequences to the public. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous materials focuses on chemicals with catastrophic health hazards, which are also found on the DOT and Coast Guard lists. The report uses EPA/RMP chemicals for marine cargo hazard analysis, with exceptions for radioactive materials and explosives not on the EPA/RMP list. Army Corps of Engineers statistics for 2003 show the presence of explosives in marine commerce. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous materials focuses on chemicals with catastrophic health hazards, cross-referenced to the DOT categories. Explosives and radioactive materials, not on the EPA/RMP list, make up less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo. The EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable, with variations in toxicity and flammability among specific chemicals like Ammonia. Ammonia is a toxic, potentially explosive gas used in various industries. It can cause skin and respiratory irritation, eye corrosion, and fatal lung fluid buildup. Methane, on the other hand, is not inherently toxic but can cause asphyxiation at high concentrations. Cryogenic methane can freeze body parts on contact. Methane is highly flammable and may cause asphyxiation at high concentrations. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in manufacturing various industrial products, with potential irritant and fire hazard risks. Uncontrolled release of chemicals on the EPA/RMP list can have varying effects. Methyloxirane vapor is highly flammable and reacts explosively with certain substances. An uncontrolled release of chemicals on the EPA/RMP list can have varying effects on the exposed population. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals hazardous and subject to special regulatory treatment. This report assumes all hazardous chemicals warrant public concern as potential terrorist targets. Certain shipments of specific hazardous cargoes are assumed to be potential terrorist targets. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous chemicals was developed for land facilities, but the health hazards may differ if released over water. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing the hazard in a marine incident. Others evaporate quickly or create larger hazard zones in a marine release compared to a land release. Certain hazardous chemicals may behave differently when released over water compared to land. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing the hazard in a marine incident, while others evaporate quickly and create larger hazard zones in a marine release. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains statistics on marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate the shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. According to ACE statistics, significant quantities of EPA/RMP chemicals are transported through U.S. waters. In 2003, over 48 million tons of these hazardous chemicals passed through U.S. waters, accounting for 2% of total waterborne cargo tonnage. Table 1 summarizes the 2003 U.S. waterborne tonnage of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways. The hazardous materials on the EPA/RMP list are included primarily due to their chemical properties that make them hazardous to human health. The overall volume of a hazardous material in a marine shipment becomes an important consideration when evaluating potential public impacts of a terrorist attack. Additionally, a larger number of shipments could potentially increase the overall terrorist risk. Over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways in 2003, with varying cargo tonnage per shipment. The EPA regulations set minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds for these chemicals. Figure 1 illustrates the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment in 2003, plotted on a logarithmic scale for clarity. The EPA regulations set minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds for EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals. The average shipment volume for these chemicals generally exceeds the 20,000 pound threshold, requiring an off-site risk management plan. Each category of chemicals was typically shipped between several hundred and several thousand times in 2003. In 2003, hazardous cargoes were shipped between several hundred and several thousand times. Cargo vessel characteristics are important for security considerations, determining vulnerability to accidents or attacks. Over 67% of EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo was shipped in tankers or self-propelled liquid chemical barges. In 2003, hazardous marine cargo was primarily shipped in tankers or self-propelled liquid chemical barges, with liquefied gas tankers designed to carry various types of liquefied gas cargoes. Liquefied gas tankers are designed to carry various chemicals such as butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and more. These tankers have onboard tanks that are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to meet different cargo requirements. International shipping codes enforce strict standards for their construction and operation, with robust double-hulled cargo tanks that can withstand high pressures or low temperatures. LNG tankers are designed with robust double-hulled cargo tanks to withstand impact damage and distortion without failure. They carry only LNG, unlike other liquefied gas tankers that may carry a combination of different cargoes, creating unique multi-chemical hazards. Liquefied gas carriers vary in capacity, with LNG tankers having capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, and plans for new construction of 200,000 m3 capacity. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry various liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They typically have 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks and range in total cargo capacity from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. These tankers are governed by international construction standards and may have cargo tanks lined with stainless steel. Chemical parcel tankers, like gas carriers, adhere to international construction standards with cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or specialized coatings. They have double bottoms or hulls to prevent incompatible cargoes from mixing and can carry multiple hazardous chemical cargoes simultaneously. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed for bulk liquid chemicals in coastal regions and inland waterways, with multiple separate cargo tanks lined with stainless steel. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals primarily in coastal regions and inland waterways. They range in size from 700 tons to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity and may be unpowered, relying on tugboats for movement. Inland barges usually travel in groups of two to eight per towboat, with larger barges being double-hulled and self-propelled. Liquid chemical barges are typically 300 feet long and may be refrigerated with insulated cargo tanks capable of carrying hazardous chemicals. Pressurized cargo tanks are also available for liquid cargoes. Hazardous chemicals can be transported on conventional container ships in various cargo consignments. Hazardous chemicals can be transported on container ships in various cargo consignments, including tankcontainers, drums, and portable tanks. Large quantities of chemicals may be present on modern container ships. Hazardous chemicals must be shipped in designated cargo areas on vessels like container ships, general cargo ships, container barges, ferries, and other vessels. In 2002, a vessel caught fire off South Africa carrying hazardous chemicals. These chemicals are transported on various vessels including container ships, general cargo ships, container barges, and ferries. The public hazards of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo are proportional to volume, which can be compared to volumes in other transportation modes and storage facilities. Hazardous chemicals are transported in bulk on marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks, with rail tank cars having a cargo capacity of 50 to 90 tons. The cargo capacity of rail tank cars ranges from 50 to 90 tons, while containerized tank cars on flatbed railcars can carry up to 70 tons per tank. Highway tanker trucks have a standard cargo capacity ranging from 15 to 30 tons for EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals. Multiple tanks are usually found on liquefied gas shipments. Table 2 summarizes the typical range of cargo tank capacity for marine, rail, and highway tankers transporting EPA/RMP chemicals. Marine tankers generally have a much larger capacity than rail or highway tankers. Comparing actual volumes shipped across these modes is challenging due to partial cargoes and multiple barges or rail tank cars involved. Based on marine shipment volumes and tank capacities, it seems that many marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous materials are larger than individual land shipments. The EPA database tracks on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans, providing estimates of maximum and average quantities of EPA/RMP chemicals. These facilities represent a subset with the highest on-site quantities of these chemicals. The text discusses the comparison between marine shipping volumes and land storage volumes of nine EPA/RMP chemicals. The chemicals include high, medium, and low volume shipments of toxic and flammable chemicals. The results are summarized in Table 3, showing the differences in quantities between marine and land facilities. Table 3 summarizes the comparison between marine shipping volumes and land storage volumes of nine EPA/RMP chemicals. The average marine shipments for higher volume chemicals were generally larger than the volumes stored at chemical plants, except for chemical #3. Marine shipments of hazardous chemicals either originate or terminate in U.S. ports, with port facilities serving as transportation hubs for temporary storage and transfer. Port facilities in the U.S. serve as transportation hubs for hazardous chemicals, with some facilities also using the cargo directly for industrial processes. The total marine shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals vary significantly from port to port, as do the specific types of chemicals being shipped. Security hazards at ports may be influenced by both the volume and type of hazardous cargo moving through them. Shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals vary significantly across U.S. ports, with the top 30 ports handling 95% of the hazardous cargo tonnage. There are over 360 commercial ports in the United States, with 113 of them handling EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals in 2003. The concentration of hazardous marine shipments through these ports is important for security considerations. The top 30 ports in the United States handle 95% of hazardous cargo tonnage, with 22 EPA/RMP chemicals shipped through the port of Baton Rouge in large volumes in 2003. The concentration of hazardous marine shipments in these ports is a significant security concern, as an attack on a single hazardous cargo vessel could have serious public consequences. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports in the United States are a significant security concern due to the potential consequences of an attack on a hazardous cargo vessel. These ports are mainly located in the Gulf of Mexico, with LPG and ammonia being the most frequently shipped hazardous chemicals. The top hazardous cargoes shipped through US ports are LPG (propane) and ammonia, both posing significant risks due to their flammability and toxicity. The list of ports handling these hazardous cargoes is based on EPA/RMP estimates, with other key factors affecting terrorism risk in ports including DOT hazardous cargo shipments, non-chemical cargo hazards, marine passenger traffic, and proximity to populations. The Department of Homeland Security considers various factors in its Port Security Grant Program for U.S. ports, including hazardous cargo shipments, passenger traffic, and proximity to populations. DHS evaluated 129 ports in FY2005, identifying 66 eligible for security grants. The Coast Guard leads efforts to enhance maritime security. The Coast Guard oversees maritime security, including vessel and port security. They track, board, and inspect commercial ships, with a special focus on hazardous cargo. Coast Guard regulations ensure safe operation of vessels carrying hazardous materials. The Coast Guard has a history of concern for ships and barges carrying hazardous cargo, with safety regulations in place to mitigate damage from accidents and potential terrorist attacks. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded its maritime security regulations to distinguish between safety and security measures. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has enhanced its maritime security regulations to differentiate between safety and security measures. Area maritime security committees, led by local captains of the port, assess port vulnerabilities and develop plans to address them, focusing on preventing terrorist attacks on vessels and facilities under Coast Guard jurisdiction. The Coast Guard has enhanced maritime security regulations post-9/11, focusing on preventing terrorist attacks on vessels and facilities. Vulnerability assessments cover vital port infrastructure like bridges, channels, and tunnels. The Coast Guard has used these assessments to augment security and develop new maritime security standards under the MTSA. They also led in creating the ISPS Code, which sets standards for safe ship and port operation. The ISPS Code, implemented in 2004, requires ships and ports worldwide to have approved security plans with measures for different threat levels. Security officers must ensure compliance, deploy necessary equipment, monitor access, and maintain security communications. Over 9,000 vessel security plans were reviewed and approved by the Coast Guard by July 1, 2004. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels under the MTSA and ISPS Code by July 1, 2004. They also conducted on-site inspections to ensure implementation. Additionally, security assessments were completed for the nation's strategic ports. Specific measures were taken to prevent terrorist attacks on hazardous chemicals vessels and high consequence shipping. The Coast Guard has implemented specific measures to prevent terrorist attacks on hazardous chemicals vessels and high consequence shipping. They evaluate vulnerabilities of marine tankers to various types of attacks and conduct special assessments on inland barges carrying dangerous cargoes. Vessels carrying hazardous chemicals are required to report information four days prior to arrival or departure to determine potential security risks. The Coast Guard evaluates potential security risks of vessels carrying hazardous cargo by requiring them to report information four days prior to arrival or departure. They may board vessels, post armed sea-marshals, and enforce security zones during harbor transit. Vessels carrying hazardous cargo may need to provide roving patrols while moored at a terminal. Non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat levels or sensitive harbor areas. The Coast Guard requires vessels carrying hazardous cargo to provide roving patrols on deck and at the terminal. Non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat levels or sensitive harbor areas. The Coast Guard maintains Maritime Safety and Security Teams nationwide for security operations at ports. Cargo and passenger vessels at U.S. ports must have Automatic Identification System transponders for tracking vessel movement. The Coast Guard is implementing AIS transponders for vessel tracking at ports and developing Joint Harbor Operations Centers (JHOCs) to monitor vessel traffic using various equipment and intelligence databases. They are also enlisting the help of the public through the \"Waterways Watch\" program. The Coast Guard is working on implementing AIS transponders for vessel tracking at ports and developing Joint Harbor Operations Centers (JHOCs) to monitor vessel traffic. They are also enlisting the public through the \"Waterways Watch\" program to identify and report suspicious activity. Additionally, the Coast Guard is collaborating with the Transportation Security Administration to enhance security for merchant mariners and landside workers. NOAA maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities that can be utilized by the Coast Guard. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides hazardous material emergency response capabilities for the Coast Guard and other agencies. This includes the CAMEO program, which offers chemical dispersion software models and a database with response recommendations for over 6,000 chemicals. NOAA has also linked its air dispersion models to improve support for emergency planners and first responders. NOAA partners with the Coast Guard and Office of Naval Intelligence for risk assessments on hazardous chemicals at U.S. ports. They coordinate federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. Industry groups also work on promoting security of hazardous marine cargo. Industry groups, including the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) and the American Waterways Operators (AWO), collaborate with the Coast Guard to enhance security for hazardous marine cargo. CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security in 2002 to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. The American Waterways Operators (AWO) collaborated with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers to create a model vessel security plan to protect against terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The plan includes a list of high consequence cargoes. The Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. The American Chemistry Council has also issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy, especially on marine vessels and in ports. Despite new maritime security measures post-9/11, policy issues like risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness require further Congressional attention. Terrorism risk is a key concern in the transportation of hazardous marine cargo. The potential threat of terrorism targeting hazardous marine cargo in U.S. waters has sparked debate since 9/11. Experts acknowledge the threat information provided by government agencies, but there are uncertainties regarding the specific risks posed by terrorists. Some believe that public concern about these threats is exaggerated and should not hinder maritime trade, while others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipments to harm the general population. The debate over threats to hazardous chemicals shipping due to terrorism is ongoing. Some believe the concerns are overstated and should not impact maritime trade, while others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipments. The uncertainty of threat intelligence and the shifting goals of attackers make it difficult to assess the probability of a terrorist attack. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels, but vulnerability and consequence analysis of marine chemical hazards still face uncertainties. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels, including hazardous chemical risk assessments at U.S. ports. However, analysts suggest that the potential vulnerabilities and consequences of a terrorist attack on marine cargo vessels are not well understood. Public controversy over terrorist risks to LNG shipping is driven by conflicting studies from government and private sector groups, making it difficult to evaluate physical vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. The security sensitivity of vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans complicates evaluation efforts. Limited public information is available on physical vulnerabilities of marine vessels to terrorist attacks. Little research is directly related to intentional release of hazardous chemicals. Understanding vulnerability and consequence is crucial for effective maritime security strategy. The effectiveness of security strategies for hazardous chemicals carriers may be limited without a full understanding of vulnerability and consequence for attacks affecting the general public. Federal officials may struggle to determine the precise risk of terror attacks on marine cargoes, but reducing risk uncertainty can help prioritize maritime security activities. The Coast Guard could focus on port security by receiving timely intelligence information, while security experts can analyze vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences using standard models and methodologies. The analysis of vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences can benefit from standard models and methodologies maintained by NOAA and EPA. A federal role may be important to ensure methodological consistency across chemicals, vessel types, and locations. Concerns about the costs of hazardous marine cargo security and potential diversion of resources have been raised by policymakers. Coast Guard officials note that maritime security expenditures are part of their general mission to protect the nation's waters and coasts. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security, representing a 6% increase from the previous year. Hazardous marine cargo security funding comes from the Coast Guard's general maritime security budget, raising concerns about resource allocation for other missions such as boating safety, search and rescue, and drug interdiction. The President requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion for port, waterway, and coastal security, a 6% increase from FY2005. Additional funding of $11 million is sought for general maritime security, including new response boats and crew. The budget also includes $5.7 million for a vessel monitoring system and $87.4 million for increased aircraft surveillance of vessels. State and local agencies are seeking more funding for hazardous marine cargo security. The curr_chunk discusses the funding concerns for hazardous marine cargo security, particularly for LNG tankers. State and local agencies are worried about the high costs of securing LNG shipments, which may force them to divert resources from other public services. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover the costs of additional maritime security. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires cost-sharing for LNG tanker security between the private and public sectors. The curr_chunk discusses concerns over funding for LNG terminal security. Some government officials worry about the ambiguous accounting of security costs, while some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, citing their tax contributions. Others are willing to pay for extra security only if it exceeds the standard level. The curr_chunk highlights the significant costs associated with securing hazardous marine cargo from terrorist attacks, suggesting a review of cost-sharing mechanisms. The effectiveness of current security measures by the Coast Guard is questioned, with concerns about the efficient deployment of resources. The effectiveness of security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping by the Coast Guard is questioned, with concerns about resource deployment and evaluation of security activities. The lack of performance measures hinders the assessment of progress in enhancing maritime security. The Coast Guard's security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping are questioned due to a lack of performance measures to assess progress. Concerns arise regarding resource allocation and the adequacy of security activities in addressing terrorism risks within ports. Some question if Coast Guard security for hazardous chemical vessels appropriately reflects their relative risk, with concerns about varying levels of protection between ports. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of the agency's security activities for hazardous marine cargo in the context of maritime security responsibilities. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks is a concern among security analysts, with potential high casualties and overwhelming federal and local emergency agencies. Specialized response teams may be required for attacks involving toxic chemicals. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks may overwhelm emergency agencies and medical facilities. Specialized teams and medical treatment may be needed for poisoning and burns. Salvage of damaged vessels could be challenging due to chemical hazards. It is prudent for authorities near waterways to develop specific measures for chemical cargo releases. Assistance from federal or private sectors may be necessary for communities lacking emergency response capabilities. The report highlights the importance of developing emergency response plans for marine chemical cargoes, with potential funding sources from the DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides a legislative model for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to those stored at chemical plants, emphasizing the need for preparedness. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to quantities stored at large chemical plants and are often targeted by terrorists due to their proximity to populated areas. The Coast Guard has authority over the security of hazardous marine shipping and is continuously improving maritime security measures. The Coast Guard has authority over maritime security of hazardous chemical cargo, evolving its security activities to address terrorism risk uncertainty. Congress may question the effectiveness of current security measures and emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards. The Coast Guard oversees maritime security for hazardous chemical cargo, adapting security measures to counter terrorism risks. Congress may evaluate the effectiveness of current security measures and emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards. Bulk quantities of hazardous chemicals are present in marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities on land, posing a policy challenge in balancing resources across these sectors. The policy challenge of balancing resources for chemical security across marine transportation, land transportation, and chemical facilities is complicated by limited vulnerability and consequence information. Without a comprehensive perspective on hazardous chemical risks, security analysts may struggle to prioritize assets for protection and allocate security resources effectively. Diverting resources from safety to enhance security in one sector may reduce terrorism risk but increase overall risk if safety programs become less effective as a result. The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics to plan and manage projects. Domestic and foreign commerce data is recorded separately for U.S. ports and waterways. The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics to plan and manage projects, maintaining separate databases for domestic and foreign commerce. Data includes vessel trips, tonnages, and vessel types. Vessel operators are required to report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE. The ACE waterborne commerce databases collect data on vessel movements and cargo, including hazardous chemicals. The data is used for planning and managing projects, with vessel operators required to report domestic waterborne commercial movements. The ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics, which are considered accurate but should be viewed as estimates with limitations. Cargo is classified using standardized commodity codes in the ACE databases. The ACE databases use standardized commodity codes to classify cargo, including hazardous chemicals. However, these codes may not always correspond accurately to individual chemicals listed in the EPA/RMP due to aggregation or definition differences. Efforts have been made to correct inconsistencies by comparing codes and consulting with experts. For example, LNG and LPG are classified under the same code (34000) in the WCSC system. Cargo volumes and data quality are important considerations when analyzing hazardous chemical shipments. The ACE data may not accurately reflect the total tonnage of cargo carried on vessels due to partial cargoes being loaded or unloaded at multiple locations. Efforts have been made to correct inconsistencies in classification codes by comparing WCSC and UN codes and consulting with experts. For example, LNG and LPG were separated using trade data from the Department of Energy. However, shipment estimates for other chemicals may still include volumes of chemicals not on the EPA/RMP list. The ACE data report the movement of cargo at various locations during a shipment, but cannot provide the total tonnage carried on a vessel. Data quality issues may exist in the ACE waterborne commerce databases, with errors in classification, entry, and processing. Despite efforts to correct inconsistencies, additional data quality errors may still be present. The ACE waterborne commerce databases contain detailed commercial information about private companies, with summary estimates of chemicals shipping data. However, specific shipping data for individual shipments, vessels, or operators is considered privileged information not for public release. CRS products are not intended for general public distribution."
