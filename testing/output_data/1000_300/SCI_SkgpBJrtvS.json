    "content": "Knowledge distillation is a common method for transferring representational knowledge between neural networks. However, it overlooks important structural knowledge of the teacher network. A new approach called contrastive learning aims to train a student network to capture more information from the teacher's representation of the data. This method outperforms knowledge distillation in various knowledge transfer tasks such as model compression, ensemble distillation, and cross-modal transfer. Our new contrastive learning objective outperforms knowledge distillation in various knowledge transfer tasks, including model compression, ensemble distillation, and cross-modal transfer. When combined with knowledge distillation, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in many transfer tasks, sometimes even surpassing the teacher network."
