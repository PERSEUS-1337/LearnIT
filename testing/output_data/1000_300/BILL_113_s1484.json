    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sabine National Forest Land Exchange Act of 2013\" and includes definitions for key terms. The \"Sabine National Forest Land Exchange Act of 2013\" defines key terms such as \"Authority\" as the Sabine River Authority of Texas and \"Federal land\" as including National Forest System land within the Sabine National Forest and Toledo Bend Project boundary in Texas, as well as additional Federal land occupied by Forest Service campgrounds adjacent to the Toledo Bend Project. The Forest Service campgrounds, structures, roads, and improvements adjacent to the Toledo Bend Project are defined as Federal land. Non-Federal land refers to private land near Sabine National Forest owned or to be acquired by the Sabine River Authority of Texas. The Secretary of Agriculture oversees these lands through the Forest Service. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service. The term \"Toledo Bend Project\" is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project numbered 2305. The term \"wilderness area\" is the Indian Mounds Wilderness Area, Sabine National Forest. The term \"wilderness candidate land\" refers to the surface estate of land adjacent to the wilderness area, owned or to be acquired by the Authority. SEC. 3. LAND EXCHANGE, SABINE NATIONAL FOREST. In exchange for non-Federal land, wilderness candidate land, and any cash payment, the Secretary will convey all US interests in Federal land to the Authority, subject to existing rights. Within 180 days of enactment, an appraisal of surface estates will be completed according to standards. The Secretary will appraise Federal land according to specific standards and consider any restrictions on its use. A survey will determine the exact acreage and legal description of the land. The land exchange under subsection (a) will be subject to limitations on Federal land use after conveyance, determined by surveys agreed upon by the Secretary and the Authority. Costs will be shared equally, and the exchange will be conducted on an equal value basis with waived limits on land values. The land exchange under subsection (a) will be conducted on an equal value basis with the option to equalize land values through a cash payment exceeding statutory limits. Any cash payment received will be deposited into a specific fund for the Secretary's discretionary use without further appropriation. Public Law 90-171 (Sisk Act) allows the Secretary to use funds for acquiring land to add to the National Forest System. Title to non-Federal land conveyed must meet Secretary's approval and Attorney General's standards. Deed must reserve any subsurface mineral estate owned by the United States. The Federal Government reserves the mineral estate in Federal land when conveyed to the Authority, including oil, gas, rock, sand, and gravel. A restrictive covenant is included in the deed to ensure the land is used in a manner consistent with adjacent National Forest System or wilderness area land, remains unsubdivided, and is not used for commercial purposes. The Authority may operate Forest Service campgrounds and maintain them as per Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorization. Congress intends for the land exchange to be completed within one year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT, INDIAN MOUNDS WILDERNESS AREA, SABINE NATIONAL FOREST. SEC. 4 of the Indian Mounds Wilderness Area in the Sabine National Forest involves boundary adjustments post-land exchange. This includes excluding previous wilderness area land within the Toledo Bend Project and adding acquired wilderness candidate land to the wilderness area. The Secretary will modify boundaries accordingly. The Secretary will designate land as wilderness under section 3(a) and provide a map and legal description of boundary changes after completion of the land exchange. The map and legal description filed under paragraph (1) will have the same force and effect as if included in the Act, with the Secretary allowed to correct errors. They will also be available for public inspection in Forest Service offices."
