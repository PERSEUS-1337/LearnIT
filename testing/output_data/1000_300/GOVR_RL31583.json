    "content": "The federal K-12 education legislation, starting with the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994, has focused on granting flexibility to grantees. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 extended and introduced new flexibility authorities. This report outlines the authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, with updates on major developments and impacts. The report discusses flexibility authorities in federal K-12 education programs, allowing waivers for program requirements and fund transfers among programs to broaden the use of federal aid. These authorities apply to programs authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The report focuses on flexibility authorities in federal K-12 education programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), allowing waivers for program requirements and fund transfers. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is not included in these authorities. The report will be updated to reflect legislative developments regarding the ESEA. The report discusses flexibility authorities in federal K-12 education programs under the ESEA, excluding the IDEA. It covers program requirements, waivers, fund transfers, and legislative developments. The report will be regularly updated to reflect major changes. The report analyzes issues specific to individual authorities under the ESEA, focusing on flexibility in program requirements. These requirements can be waived for states and LEAs to ensure accountability in the use of federal funds for K-12 education programs. Federal K-12 education programs aim to ensure federal funds are used in line with program purposes, with specific requirements for pupil eligibility and fund allocation. These programs focus on student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, and innovative approaches like charter schools. Federal K-12 education programs, categorized into specific areas like instructional services and innovative approaches, are often referred to as \"categorical\" programs. However, the Innovative Programs authority of ESEA Title V-A is considered a \"block grant\" due to its support for a broad range of activities. The ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs authority is considered a \"block grant\" due to its broad support for various activities. Federal requirements and guidance are provided to state and local recipients of federal aid, with a distinction between \"requirements\" that must be met by grantees as a matter of law. Program regulations, published in the Federal Register and integrated into the Code of Federal Regulations, supplement statutory language on complex issues prioritized by the U.S. Department of Education. Non-regulatory policy guidance is also provided by ED for many aid programs. The U.S. Department of Education publishes regulations and non-regulatory policy guidance for aid programs. Non-regulatory guidance, such as \"Dear Colleague\" letters, provides specific answers to program-related questions, but grantees are not legally required to follow it. The \"non-regulatory\" guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Education for aid programs may lead grantees to believe they will face fewer challenges if they follow it. This guidance is often treated as equivalent to regulations, even when not explicitly required. Additionally, competitive priorities set by ED for grant programs establish preferences for certain applications, such as those providing services in schools. The U.S. Department of Education sets priorities for grant programs, giving preferential consideration to applicants who meet them. These priorities are not regulations but are published in the Federal Register. There has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs in recent years. Since the adoption of the IASA in 1994, there has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs. Some programs have no regulations published, relying on statutory guidance. For programs like ESEA Title I-A, regulations are briefer and address fewer issues than before the early 1990s. The proposed program regulations for ESEA Title I-A after the IASA in 1994 took a minimalist approach, focusing on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation. The Department of Education has followed a similar strategy post-NCLB of 2001, regulating only when necessary for clarity or flexibility, with a preference for issuing nonregulatory guidance on legal and policy issues under Title I programs. The Secretary plans to issue nonregulatory guidance on legal and policy issues under Title I programs to inform schools and other parties about flexibility in meeting program requirements for federal K-12 education assistance. This guidance aims to establish accountability for the appropriate use of federal aid funds. Federal elementary and secondary education programs require accountability for the appropriate use of federal aid funds. This includes target accountability, outcome accountability, and fiscal accountability to ensure funds are focused on eligible areas, improve student achievement, and maintain financial integrity. Federal elementary and secondary education programs focus on improving student achievement and enhancing K-12 instruction. Fiscal accountability ensures that federal aid funds are used to supplement, not replace, state or local funds. Specific requirements include targeting resources to high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high-priority services, and implementing minimum qualifications for schools. Federal elementary and secondary education programs have specific requirements to ensure fiscal accountability, such as targeting resources to high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high-priority services, implementing minimum qualifications for school staff, and reporting program activities to parents and the public. Grantees that violate these regulations may face sanctions, including repaying funds or being prohibited from receiving further grants. Sanctions may be imposed on grantees for violating specific requirements in federal education programs, with limited, program-specific sanctions for states or LEAs. General requirements, outlined in EDGAR and OMB circulars, apply to all recipients of federal education assistance. Additional regulations cover civil rights, student privacy, and compliance with child nutrition program requirements for LEAs. LEAs participating in federal child nutrition programs must comply with various requirements, including providing free or reduced-price school lunches to low-income students. Additionally, federal regulations from agencies other than ED, such as workplace safety and labor relations, may also apply to LEAs and schools. State and local educational agencies have flexibility in areas like grade levels and instructional techniques, with federal education assistance focusing on specific requirements like civil rights and student privacy. The ESEA and related programs give state and local educational agencies flexibility in areas like grade levels and instructional techniques. Complaints about specific requirements often focus on prohibitions against commingling funds and restrictions on resource use. The ESEA and related programs provide flexibility to state and local educational agencies, including prohibitions against commingling funds and restrictions on resource use to ensure fiscal accountability and target aid to those with the greatest needs. Eligibility thresholds for special forms of flexibility and outcome accountability requirements are also included. The ESEA and related programs aim to provide flexibility to state and local educational agencies, focusing on targeting aid to those with the greatest needs. Eligibility thresholds for special flexibility programs and outcome accountability requirements are included to improve the effectiveness of federally supported education services. The ESEA and related programs provide flexibility to state and local educational agencies to target aid to those with the greatest needs. However, the categorical approach of larger ED programs may lead to fragmentation of services, inefficient resource use, and partial treatment of needs, impacting the effectiveness of education services for children with special needs. The traditional federal categorical approach criticized for fragmented instruction and focusing on resources rather than improving outcomes for special needs pupils. Difficulties in implementing federal programs due to varying educational policies and demographic conditions. Problems with categorical program structures may stem from misunderstandings of federal statutes and regulations. Some problems with categorical program structures and requirements in states and LEAs may arise from misunderstandings of federal statutes and regulations, strict interpretations by state or local authorities, and efforts to target aid to students in need. State and local education officials often express concerns about constraints on the use of federal funds. The 1998 GAO report highlighted concerns from LEA staff about difficulties in obtaining accurate information on federal requirements for K-12 education assistance, leading to limited flexibility in compliance. LEA staff often lack awareness of available flexibility, express concerns about meeting administrative responsibilities and timelines for federal education programs. Waivers exist for certain federal K-12 program requirements, but are limited in scope. Waivers for federal K-12 program requirements allow flexibility for SEAs and LEAs, with different limitations and accountability measures. Various waiver authorities exist, including Ed-Flex and Secretarial case-by-case waivers, providing school-level flexibility in fund usage. Additionally, schoolwide program authority under ESEA Title I-A and the Innovative Programs block grant offer further flexibility. The use of funds under federal programs is provided under the schoolwide program authority, Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs. Ed-Flex allows SEAs to waive requirements for selected ESEA programs. Ed-Flex allows SEAs to waive requirements for selected ESEA programs. The original Ed-Flex authority was granted to 12 states, and Ed-Flex status under P.L. 106-25 was obtained by 10 states. The cap on the number of participating states was removed by the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. Legislation was enacted in 2006 to extend Ed-Flex authority until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. The Ed-Flex authority, originally granted to 12 states, was extended in 2006 until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. Under P.L. 106-25, 10 states obtained Ed-Flex status. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002, and the authority to grant it to additional states expired in FY2004. Recent congressional action (P.L. 109-211) ensured that all 10 Ed-Flex states retained their authority until January 2007. Under P.L. 109-211, all 10 Ed-Flex states retain their authority until ESEA Title I, Part A is reauthorized. States must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, adhere to curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, monitor performance, and submit annual reports to ED. Under ESEA Title I-A, states monitor LEAs and schools with waived federal or state requirements, submitting annual reports to ED. Ed-Flex applies to various federal programs including ESEA Titles I-A, I-B-3, I-C, I-D, I-F, II-A, II-D-1, III-B-4, IV-A-1, V-A, and the Perkins Act. Title III-A, IV-A-1 (Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities), V-A (Innovative Programs), and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act) are ESEA programs administered by SEAs. Ed-Flex allows states to waive certain administrative requirements for these programs, except for fiscal accountability requirements. States must still meet the underlying purposes of the statutory requirements to satisfy the Secretary of Education. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain administrative requirements for ESEA programs, except for fiscal accountability requirements. States must still meet the underlying purposes of the statutory requirements to satisfy the Secretary of Education, including fiscal accountability, equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers, parental involvement, allocation of funds, school selection requirements, and civil rights requirements. LEAs or schools requesting waivers in Ed-Flex states must apply to their SEA. States participating in the Ed-Flex program can waive certain administrative requirements for ESEA programs, excluding fiscal accountability. Local waivers may be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines for two consecutive years. States must submit annual reports on granted waivers, including their effects on student performance. States must submit annual reports on waivers granted under the Ed-Flex program, including information on the effects on student performance. However, a report prepared in 2001 lacked details on the use of Ed-Flex authority by states and its impacts, as it focused only on new activities under a specific authority, overlooking ongoing activities in states with earlier Ed-Flex authority. The Ed-Flex program allows states to request waivers for education programs, with a focus on new activities under specific authority. Annual reports on waivers granted must be submitted, but a 2001 report lacked details on the impacts of Ed-Flex authority in states with earlier waivers. Another type of flexibility authority involves waivers granted by the U.S. Secretary of Education on a case-by-case basis, primarily under Title IX, Part D of the ESEA. The Secretary of Education can waive requirements for programs under Title IX, Part D of the ESEA, as requested by SEAs, LEAs, Indian tribes, or schools. Waiver requests must include specific educational goals and methods for measuring progress. Certain requirements cannot be waived, including prohibitions against using ESEA funds in state school finance. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority allows for waivers of certain requirements, but there are four types of requirements that cannot be waived. These include prohibitions related to state school finance, religious worship or instruction, certain aspects of sex education, and eligibility requirements for charter schools. Waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D cannot exceed four years. Waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D may be waived if statutory requirements are still met to the Secretary's satisfaction. The waivers cannot exceed four years but may be extended if they improve student achievement. The Secretary can terminate waivers if pupil performance is inadequate or if the waiver is no longer necessary. The Secretary must publish waiver decisions in the Federal Register. The Department of Education failed to publish waiver notices for several years, but eventually published a list of 197 waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D between 2002 and 2006. Most waivers were for administrative cost limitations and fund obligation extensions, with some related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In total, 197 waivers were granted under ESEA Title IX-D between 2002 and 2006. Most waivers were for administrative cost limitations and fund obligation extensions, with some related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Other waivers allowed states to participate in pilot programs, provide supplemental educational services, or act as providers for schools needing improvement. Additionally, there were \"general programmatic waivers\" for exceptions to fiscal accountability and school selection requirements. The Secretary is required to submit annual reports on waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D, with a focus on waivers for schools participating in the Public Charter Schools program. Unlike other waiver authorities, the PCS waiver authority allows for the waiver of any requirement over which the Secretary of Education \"exercises administrative authority.\" Under the PCS waiver authority, the Secretary of Education can waive any requirement over which they have administrative authority, except for those related to the definition of a charter school eligible for PCS funds. This authority is used infrequently and for limited purposes. Schools with 40% or more low-income students in the ESEA Title I-A program can implement schoolwide programs with flexibility in fund usage across various federal education programs. Schoolwide programs allow flexibility in fund usage under federal education programs, including Title I-A. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other federal and non-federal funds. Regulations are exempted for schoolwide programs that meet the intent and purposes of Title I-A and other federal programs. Title I-A and other federal program funds must supplement, not supplant, other funds received by the school. Schoolwide programs offer flexibility in fund usage, primarily significant for Title I-A, focusing on individual schools rather than LEAs overall. The IDEA's programmatic requirements must still be met in schoolwide programs. The ability to use Title I-A funds on a schoolwide basis, combining them with state and local funds without separate accounting, is a significant form of flexibility compared to traditional targeted assistance programs. Schoolwide programs have few additional requirements and have seen rapid growth in recent years. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB, allowing more high poverty schools to operate schoolwide programs. This increased flexibility has led to a rapid growth in the number of schoolwide programs, with a large majority of Title I-A pupils now being served by them. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families, allowing more high poverty schools to operate such programs. This change has led to a significant increase in the number of schoolwide programs, with a majority of Title I-A pupils now benefiting from them. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families, allowing more high poverty schools to operate such programs. This change has raised questions about the validity of the rationale for schools meeting the new threshold. There is limited evidence on the achievement effects of this expansion. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) provides flexibility for small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. Only certain rural LEAs with specific criteria are eligible for this flexibility. Certain rural LEAs with specific criteria can combine or transfer funds received under certain ESEA programs for various educational activities. This flexibility is provided to small LEAs with low attendance or located in sparsely populated areas. Certain rural LEAs with specific criteria can combine or transfer funds received under ESEA programs for educational activities to address the small size of grants they receive. This flexibility allows for more effective use of funds by allowing LEAs to merge or reallocate funds among program activities. The \"REAP Flex\" authority allows eligible small, rural LEAs to transfer 100% of funds under certain programs, including ESEA Titles III and IV-B. This authority also grants supplementary grants for various purposes. Approximately 4,781 LEAs are eligible for REAP Flex, with an estimated 51% participation rate. Participation in REAP Flex is widespread among approximately 4,781 eligible LEAs, with 51% participating in the rural LEA flexibility authority in 2005-2006. Funds are often transferred from ESEA Titles II-A and IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A, as small formula allocations were insufficient for school improvement activities. Confusion at the LEA level was also noted in the evaluation. The evaluation found that many LEAs found flexibility in REAP Flex useful due to small formula allocations for school improvement activities. There was confusion at the LEA level between REAP Flex and Transferability authority. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, offers special flexibility for states and LEAs in using federal aid funds, considered a block grant in K-12 education. ESEA Title V-A is a major K-12 education program considered a block grant, offering flexibility to states and LEAs in using funds. Funds are allocated based on population aged 5-17, with a majority required for specific purposes. ESEA Title V-A funds are allocated to states, DC, and Puerto Rico based on population aged 5-17, with a minimum grant requirement. Funds are mostly given to LEAs using state-developed formulas that consider pupil enrollment, with adjustments for high-cost pupils. Minimum percentage of funds for LEAs varies based on funding level and state grant amount. The specific minimum percentage of funds that must be suballocated to LEAs varies depending on the program's aggregate funding level and whether the state receives the minimum grant amount. States must suballocate at least 85% of the grant received under the program for FY2002 to LEAs. Additionally, states are required to suballocate 100% of their Title V-A grants in excess of the FY2002 level to LEAs, with exceptions for states receiving the minimum grant amount. Of the funds retained by states, no more than 15% can be used for administrative costs, with the remainder allocated to specified programs and services. The Title V-A funds allocated to LEAs is only 50%, with states allowed to retain a portion for administrative costs. The remaining funds are to be used for specified programs and services, including pupil assessments, achievement standards, charter schools, school choice options, school repair, and statewide education reform initiatives. LEAs can use their funds for various innovative assistance programs listed in Section 5131. LEAs can use their Title V-A funds for a variety of innovative assistance programs listed in Section 5131, including specific programs like charter schools and school nurses, as well as broader initiatives to improve academic achievement. This flexibility in fund usage categorizes Title V-A as a block grant, with a prohibition against SEAs influencing LEA decisions. Title V-A is considered a block grant due to the broad categories of authorized fund use by LEAs and states. The program was first enacted in 1981 as Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, consolidating over 40 federal K-12 education programs in response to a Reagan Administration proposal. Despite initially reducing the number of federal education programs, new categorical programs were authorized in the years following its adoption. The Title V-A block grant initially reduced federal education programs but new categorical programs were authorized later. A study found that recipient LEAs used funds for instructional materials, educational technology, and targeted academic services. Large LEAs used funds for teacher professional development and school-based improvement efforts. The Title V-A block grant funded educational technology and academic services, with large LEAs focusing on teacher development and school improvement. However, funds were not always targeted at high-need pupils or schools. Appropriations for Title V-A have declined significantly over the years, with the possibility of the program being terminated due to lack of funding. The Title V-A block grant for educational technology and academic services has seen a decline in funding, with the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 providing zero funds for the program. Lack of constituencies advocating for increased funding has led to the possibility of the program being effectively terminated. Funding for Title V-A has been supplemented by other sources, but limited information on its effectiveness has reduced incentives to maintain its funding level. Title V-A funding has seen a decline, with limited information on its effectiveness reducing incentives to maintain its funding level. The program has received less favorable treatment in funding decisions compared to programs with demonstrated targeting of funds or improved educational outcomes. Amendments under NCLB require states to submit annual summaries on how the assistance is contributing to student achievement. Authorities under NCLB allow for increased funding by transferring funds from selected sources. Authorities under the NCLB allow SEAs and LEAs to increase Title V-A funding by transferring funds from selected federal programs. Additional provisions for flexibility, such as consolidated applications and reports, have been implemented but have a marginal impact compared to the funding transfer option. The NCLB provides flexibility for SEAs and LEAs through consolidated applications, plans, and reports for ESEA programs. It also allows for the consolidation of certain funds for administrative purposes. Additionally, Title VI, Part A, Subpart 2 of the ESEA permits LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs. Title VI, Part A, Subpart 2 of the ESEA, as amended by the NCLB, allows most LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs. LEAs identified as failing to meet state AYP requirements can transfer only 30% of their grants to address AYP standards, with restrictions for LEAs under corrective actions. The Transferability authority allows LEAs to transfer 30% of their grants to address AYP standards, with restrictions for LEAs under corrective actions. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds among selected programs, totaling approximately $3.5 billion in FY2008 appropriations. The Transferability authority for states is limited, with FY2008 appropriations totaling $3.5 billion for programs subject to LEA Transferability authority. It is a simple process available to most LEAs without specific approval, allowing funds to be used for a wide range of purposes. However, all program requirements still apply to transferred funds, including restrictions on transferring funds across fiscal years. The Transferability authority allows LEAs to block grant funds for various purposes, with program requirements still in place. Participation rates are low, with confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities causing discrepancies in reported usage. There is confusion at the LEA level regarding the REAP Flex and Transferability authorities, leading to conflicting reports on the use of Transferability. LEAs mostly transfer funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A to Title I-A and Title V-A, often to compensate for reductions in formula grants or target resources on underperforming schools. The evaluation report found that LEAs cited reasons such as lack of information, satisfaction with existing flexibility, and insufficient funding as barriers to participating in Transferability. Up to seven states may consolidate state administration and activity funds under a new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act. Up to seven states may be authorized to consolidate state administration and activity funds under the Education for the Disadvantaged, Reading First, Even Start, Teacher and Principal Training Fund, State and Local Technology Grants, Safe and Drug Free Schools, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, and Innovative Programs block grant programs. This \"State-Flex\" authority allows funds to be used for any purpose authorized under any ESEA program. States would have this authority for five years but would lose it if they fail to meet state AYP requirements for two consecutive years. States granted State-Flex authority can consolidate funds under any ESEA program for five years. They must meet state AYP requirements or risk losing the authority. Selected states must enter agreements with 4-10 LEAs, with at least half serving high-poverty areas. LEAs can align and consolidate funds under local flexibility authority. School-age child poverty rates of 20% or more can lead to LEAs consolidating funds under local flexibility authority. Participating states may specify purposes for LEAs to use funds received under the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant. State-Flex authority has only been granted to Florida, but they withdrew before implementation. No state has participated in the State-Flex program yet. No state has participated in the State-Flex program yet. Under the \"Local-Flex\" authority, up to 80 LEAs can consolidate funds from various programs for five years, with a 4% limit for administration use. Under the Local-Flex authority, LEAs can consolidate funds from various programs for five years, with a 4% limit for administration use. LEAs may lose the authority if they fail to meet state AYP requirements for two consecutive years or fail to comply with the flexibility agreement. If goals are met, authority is renewed for another two-year term. Certain requirements cannot be waived, including those related to civil rights, fiscal accountability, and equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers. States and LEAs must also prepare and disseminate annual reports. Under the Local-Flex authority, LEAs can consolidate funds from various programs for five years, with a 4% limit for administration use. Certain requirements related to civil rights, fiscal accountability, and equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers cannot be waived. Participating states and LEAs must prepare and disseminate annual reports on fund usage. Seattle, Washington, the only LEA to participate, had its eligibility suspended for failing to make AYP for two consecutive years. Despite a series of competitions by ED, there has been little interest from states and LEAs in obtaining Local-Flex authority. Seattle has applied for a new Local-Flex agreement, but there has been little interest from states and LEAs in obtaining this authority. Only one LEA has participated in Local-Flex, and no states in State-Flex. Major barriers to participation include additional responsibilities with few benefits, limited organizational capacity, and limited dissemination of information about the programs. A new round of competition for these authorities began in March 2004. A new round of competition for State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities began in March 2004, offering preference in future grant competitions for participants. The State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities offer preference in grant competitions for participants who have undergone comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and academic achievement, especially for disadvantaged students. These authorities allow for broad use of funds authorized under any ESEA program, with only a few specified requirements. Participation is limited to a maximum of seven states and a small number of LEAs, generating interest in these programs. The State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities have limited participation, with only a few states and LEAs eligible. Despite multiple invitations, interest in these provisions has been low. State-Flex authority allows for some flexibility in fund use but states must still meet administrative responsibilities. The share of funds for state administration and activities is small, especially for the largest affected program. The overall share of funds for state administration and activities is relatively small under various programs, ranging from 1% to 26.5%. Participating states have influence over fund use by LEAs and Innovative Programs block grant funds. LEAs in the state demonstration program may have limited flexibility as their fund use must align with state requirements. LEAs in the state demonstration program may have reduced flexibility as their use of funds must align with state requirements. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance, as those funds can already be used for a wide range of activities. Comparing State-Flex and Local-Flex authority with earlier versions of legislation shows similarities in local flexibility demonstrations but differences in broader state authority. The final provisions of H.R. 1, enacted as the NCLB, are similar to the House version authorizing local flexibility demonstrations. The Senate version had broader flexibility/performance agreement authority, but was not included in the final legislation. The Senate's provisions would have offered more flexibility with increased outcome accountability compared to the State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities. The H.R. 1 version offered more flexibility than State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. It was more limited than optional performance agreement proposals from the 106th Congress. The scope of the flexibility authority was the same for participating states but narrower for LEAs. The types of program requirements remained similar, but the range of ESEA programs covered was broader with higher funding levels. The H.R. 1 version provided more flexibility and accountability than State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities. It covered a broader range of ESEA programs with higher funding levels, allowing funds to be reallocated among LEAs to target poor children effectively. Participating states could reallocate funds among and within LEAs to target poor children effectively under H.R. 1, with the requirement to exceed AYP goals significantly. This outcome accountability element ensures achievement gains are not due to random variations in pupil scores. The report discusses the impact of flexibility in federal aid funds on pupil achievement scores, highlighting that the increase in flexibility allows states and LEAs to prioritize their own needs over federal priorities. The special flexibility authorities are limited in participation and size. The special flexibility authorities allow states and LEAs to prioritize their own needs over federal priorities, with limited participation and size. States and LEAs can waive federal program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. The outcome accountability requirements under the special flexibility authorities, particularly those from the NCLB, offer increased attention and consequences for all states and LEAs participating in Title I-A and other ESEA programs. These authorities provide flexibility in meeting accountability requirements, with Transferability being the most utilized by 12-16% of LEAs. REAP Flex is the most widely used authority among eligible small, rural LEAs. Regular reporting on the use and impact of these authorities is required. The most widely used flexibility authority among eligible small, rural LEAs is REAP Flex. There is limited information on the specific impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement. The current flexibility authorities may not fully address the primary concerns of states and LEAs regarding restrictions on the use of federal funds or administrative burdens. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority is limited to schools with slightly above average low-income pupil rates. The Secretarial waiver authorities require individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. States and LEAs can transfer up to 50% of funds received under any program. The Ed-Flex authority allows LEAs to apply for waivers through their SEAs. States and LEAs can transfer up to 50% of funds received under any program, but all requirements must still be met. Rural LEA flexibility is limited to low-enrollment LEAs, while State-Flex authority is available in only seven states. Local-Flex authority is limited to 80 LEAs and 28-70 LEAs in State-Flex states. Participation in these authorities is low due to the limited flexibility they offer. Certain requirements cannot be waived under these authorities. The Ed-Flex authority allows LEAs to apply for waivers through their SEAs, with limited flexibility for rural and State-Flex LEAs. Participation is low due to the limited flexibility offered. Certain requirements cannot be waived under these authorities, including fiscal accountability and ESEA Title I-A standards. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to reallocate funds among LEAs, but the flexibility authorities do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs. Some states find Ed-Flex of limited value due to the few programs and requirements that may be waived, while others see it as encouraging innovation and flexibility. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to reallocate funds among LEAs, with some states finding it of limited value due to the few programs and requirements that may be waived. However, other states believe it encourages innovation and flexibility, especially with the increased flexibility in federal program requirements. The NCLB provides increased flexibility in using funds for schoolwide programs, giving states and LEAs more control. Waivers can remove regulatory barriers to local educational reform, but there is limited information on their use. Pre-NCLB waivers were used for few purposes not clearly related to innovation or reform. The NCLB allows for flexibility in using funds for schoolwide programs, giving states and LEAs more control. Waivers granted under pre-NCLB authorities have been used for few purposes not clearly related to innovation or reform. The ESEA Title IX-D authority has been used for a growth model pilot for determining adequate yearly progress. A recent study found that flexibility authority was mostly used to move funds between different education programs, such as Teacher and Principal Training and Education for the Disadvantaged. This was done to compensate for reductions in formula grants and target resources on schools failing to meet standards. Pre-NCLB flexibility authorities were also utilized in the late 1990s. In the pre-NCLB era, Secretarial waivers and other flexibility authorities were used to waive requirements related to ESEA Title I-A programs, including schoolwide program eligibility, targeting funds on schools with high numbers of low-income students, deadlines for standards and assessments, and limitations on teacher recruitment and training programs. In the pre-NCLB era, Secretarial waivers and other flexibility authorities were used to waive requirements related to ESEA Title I-A programs, including schoolwide program eligibility, targeting funds on schools with high numbers of low-income students, deadlines for standards and assessments, and limitations on teacher recruitment and training programs. However, questions have been raised about granting schools with low poverty rates the authority to operate schoolwide programs, as their impact may be limited due to the basis of Title I-A grants on the number of children from low-income families. The scope of schoolwide Title I-A programs may be limited due to grant size based on low-income student numbers, making significant schoolwide impact difficult. There is no systematic evidence that schoolwide programs are more effective than targeted assistance programs for disadvantaged pupils. Waivers could disperse funds to low-poverty schools, reducing concentration on high-poverty schools. Ed-Flex allows waivers for Title I-A school selection but may undermine program outcomes. Ed-Flex allows waivers for ESEA Title I-A school selection, impacting program outcomes by potentially delaying standard and assessment requirements. Waivers were commonly requested for various purposes such as teacher hiring focus, consortia formation for small LEAs, and allocation of teacher training funds. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of low-income students nationwide, impacting the relevance of Ed-Flex waivers. The CSR and Eisenhower programs were merged into a more flexible ESEA Title II program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training. The ESEA Title II program consolidated the CSR and Eisenhower programs to support teacher and principal recruitment and training. Limited information is available on the impact of flexibility waivers on pupil achievement. Anecdotal information suggests that the achievement effects of waivers granted under the Ed-Flex authority are not well-documented. The impact of flexibility waivers granted under the Ed-Flex authority on pupil achievement is not well-documented. Anecdotal information on the effects of waivers in a limited number of LEAs was included in a 1999 ED report. Supporters of flexibility authorities argue that Ed-Flex has supported standards-based reform in affected states by facilitating program coordination. The 1998 ED report on Ed-Flex highlighted that the authority supports standards-based reform in states by facilitating program coordination, streamlining administration, and focusing on outcomes to improve student achievement and reduce achievement gaps. The use of resources, along with standards-based approaches, aims to improve student achievement and reduce achievement gaps by shifting focus towards outcomes. Limited data on improved pupil outcomes with special flexibility raises questions about the benefits and impact of these authorities. The statutes authorizing flexibility in education lack sufficient reporting on pupil achievement effects, hindering evaluation of their benefits and impact. The dissemination of relevant information by the Department of Education has been limited, making it challenging to assess the significance and drawbacks of these flexibility authorities. The emphasis on outcomes associated with these authorities raises questions about their effectiveness compared to traditional accountability requirements. The question surrounding special forms of flexibility is whether increased emphasis on outcomes can adequately replace other forms of accountability requirements. Outcome accountability requirements for special flexibility authorities include goals set by states and LEAs, as well as meeting state-established AYP requirements under ESEA Title I-A. The GAO study found that states granted Ed-Flex authority differed in the clarity and specificity of their outcome goals related to granting waivers. Five of the original 12 Ed-Flex states had set no specific objectives for LEAs or schools granted waivers, with only one state linking outcome objectives to the affected entities. The GAO study found that most Ed-Flex states lacked specific outcome objectives for LEAs and schools granted waivers. Only one state had outcome objectives linked to the affected entities. The study also highlighted limited ED oversight of Ed-Flex implementation, with varying levels of detail in the annual reports submitted by states. The current flexibility authorities do not impose substantial additional outcome accountability beyond meeting AYP requirements. The current flexibility authorities do not require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states beyond meeting AYP requirements. Special flexibility authority emphasizes consequences for failing to meet outcome accountability requirements, providing an additional incentive for compliance. The NCLB requires schools, LEAs, and states to meet certain requirements with consequences for non-compliance. Special flexibility authority provides an extra incentive to meet these requirements to maintain eligibility. This enhanced outcome accountability aligns with the nature of special flexibility authorities. The provisions come into effect alongside recent legislation expanding outcome accountability and flexibility in federal aid fund usage. The NCLB requires schools, LEAs, and states to meet specific requirements with consequences for non-compliance. Special flexibility authority serves as an additional incentive to maintain eligibility. This aligns with recent legislation expanding outcome accountability and flexibility in federal aid fund usage. Critics argue that increasing state and local flexibility in fund usage may not require additional accountability measures. The ability of states and LEAs to use federal funds as they see fit is seen as justification for policies that can lead to improved pupil outcomes. Critics argue that granting special flexibility without sufficient accountability measures may not result in increased program effectiveness."
