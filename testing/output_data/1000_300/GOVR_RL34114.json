Congress has three formal methods to combat noncompliance, including the inherent contempt power to detain and imprison a contemnor until compliance is achieved. The three formal methods Congress can use to combat noncompliance with a congressional subpoena are inherent contempt power, criminal contempt statute, and reliance on the judicial branch for enforcement. Inherent contempt allows Congress to detain and imprison a contemnor until compliance is achieved, criminal contempt involves certifying a contempt citation for criminal prosecution, and reliance on the judicial branch enforces the subpoena. Congress has the power to enforce a congressional subpoena through inherent contempt, criminal contempt, or civil enforcement. Inherent contempt allows Congress to detain a contemnor until compliance is achieved, criminal contempt involves prosecution for noncompliance, and civil enforcement seeks a court judgment to compel compliance with the subpoena. This report examines Congress's contempt power and the procedures for enforcing subpoenas. This report explores Congress's contempt power and the enforcement of congressional subpoenas, including inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement. It discusses the challenges Congress faces in enforcing contempt actions against executive branch officials. The authority of Congress to investigate and obtain information is broad, and enforcement may be necessary to ensure compliance with subpoenas. The power of Congress to punish for contempt is closely tied to its authority to investigate and obtain information, which is broad and essential to its legislative function. The Supreme Court has established this power through rulings like McGrain v. Daugherty, emphasizing the importance of enforcing informational demands. The Supreme Court, in McGrain v. Daugherty, emphasized the Senate's inherent contempt power as essential for obtaining information necessary for effective legislation. The Court stated that compulsion is often needed to obtain accurate and complete information, highlighting the importance of enforcing informational demands. The Supreme Court emphasized the Senate's inherent contempt power as essential for obtaining accurate and complete information necessary for effective legislation. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness at congressional hearings refused to provide answers and was prosecuted for contempt of Congress. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness at congressional hearings was prosecuted for contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions due to a pending lawsuit between the government and Mammoth Oil Company. The Supreme Court upheld the witness's conviction, stating that the pendency of lawsuits did not excuse withholding information. Congress retained the power to investigate despite ongoing legal proceedings. The Supreme Court has affirmed that Congress retains the power to investigate despite ongoing legal proceedings. Congress's investigative authority is broad and can require disclosures to aid its constitutional power, even if the information may also be useful in pending lawsuits. Subsequent rulings have consistently upheld the scope of Congress's power of inquiry as extensive and far-reaching. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that it is as far-reaching as its power to enact laws. The Court emphasized that Congress's power to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process and is at its peak when addressing waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments. The Supreme Court affirmed Congress's broad investigative authority, stating it is at its peak when addressing waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments. Congress's power to inquire into corruption, inefficiency, or waste is recognized, with the Court emphasizing the importance of probing corruption in the Executive Branch. The Court also acknowledges Congress's power to publicize corruption, maladministration, or inefficiencies in government agencies. The Congress has the power to inquire into corruption, maladministration, or inefficiencies in government agencies. The inherent contempt power allows individuals to be brought before the House or Senate, tried, and potentially imprisoned for punitive or coercive reasons. This power was upheld in Supreme Court decisions such as Anderson v. Dunn and McGrain v. Daugherty. The House or Senate can use inherent contempt power to imprison individuals for punitive or coercive reasons, as seen in the case of Anderson v. Dunn in 1818. The House or Senate can use inherent contempt power to imprison individuals for punitive or coercive reasons, as seen in the case of Anderson v. Dunn in 1818. A resolution was passed for the arrest of Anderson by the Sergeant-at-Arms, who was brought before the House to answer the charge. Anderson was granted counsel, defense witnesses, and a copy of the accusatory letter. After a hearing, he was found guilty of contempt and reprimanded before being discharged from custody. This established a pattern of attachment, appearance before the bar, provision for charges, compulsory process, counsel, hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of penalty. The inherent contempt process allows for the imprisonment of individuals by the House or Senate for punitive or coercive reasons. It includes provisions for charges, identification of the accuser, compulsory process, counsel, hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of penalty. Prompt judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus is available for witnesses cited for contempt. The court's review focuses on whether the congressional actions were within jurisdiction and if due process standards were met. While not required to provide all procedural rights of a criminal defendant, Congress must grant notice and an opportunity to be heard. Inherent contempt proceedings afford procedural rights to a contemnor similar to a defendant in criminal proceedings, including notice and an opportunity to be heard. Courts may impose fines instead of incarceration to avoid habeas corpus challenges. Congress could potentially impose fines as a form of punishment under its inherent authority. Drawing on the analogous inherent authority that courts have to impose fines for contemptuous behavior, it appears possible to argue that Congress could also impose fines instead of incarceration. Support for this argument can be found in dicta from the 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson, which discussed the extent of punishing power that legislative bodies may exercise for self-preservation. The power of imprisonment is considered the least possible power adequate to the end proposed, with other forms of punishment being mere commutation for confinement. The power of imprisonment is considered the least possible power adequate to the end proposed, with other forms of punishment being mere commutation for confinement. In certain cases where Congress has authority to investigate, it may compel testimony in the same manner as a court of justice. No person can be punished for contumacy as a witness before either House unless his testimony is required in a matter within that House's jurisdiction to inquire. The power of imprisonment is the least possible punishment for contempt of Congress, with no precedent for imposing fines. Inherent contempt proceedings do not require cooperation from other branches, allowing the House or Senate to conduct summary proceedings independently. Judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus may have limited scope compared to plenary review. The House or Senate can conduct summary proceedings for contempt, and the offender can seek judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus. However, inherent contempt has limitations such as limited imprisonment until the end of the current session of Congress. This process is described as cumbersome and ineffective, leading to its disuse since 1935. The inherent contempt process, last used in 1935, is seen as outdated and ineffective for a modern Congress with a heavy legislative workload. One suggestion to improve the process is to have initial fact-finding and witness examination done by a special committee, with the full House or Senate making the final decision on guilt. In the past, some contempt proceedings were conducted before a committee, with the final decision made by the full body. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by Congress, with 8 considered successful. However, these proceedings were seen as time-consuming and cumbersome. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted, shifting the trial to a United States Attorney rather than the chamber itself. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted, allowing for judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States Attorney instead of the House or Senate. This legislation was intended as an alternative to the inherent contempt procedure, not a substitute for it. Under 2 U.S.C. Section 192 and 194, a witness who fails to testify or produce documents can be fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for up to one year. The House or Senate can refer a non-compliant witness to the courts for criminal prosecution. The criminal contempt statute allows for the referral of a non-compliant witness to the courts for prosecution, following specific steps outlined in Section 194. This procedure is punitive in nature and aims to deter similar conduct in the future. The criminal contempt statute is punitive and used to punish non-compliant witnesses, deterring others from similar conduct. Once voted in contempt, witnesses lack incentive to cooperate. In some cases, compliance with subpoenas after contempt citations have been voted may lead to the House not pursuing further proceedings. The House has certified to the U.S. Attorney that further proceedings concerning contempts may not be necessary if compliance with subpoenas occurs after contempt citations have been voted but before referral to grand juries. It is unclear whether the U.S. Attorney's duty to present contempt to the grand jury is mandatory or discretionary, with conflicting guidance from relevant case law. In Ex parte Frankfeld, the District Court granted petitions for writs of habeas corpus for witnesses charged with violating 2 U.S.C. Section 192 before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The District of Columbia granted petitions for writs of habeas corpus sought by two witnesses before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The witnesses were charged with violating 2 U.S.C. Section 192 and were released due to procedural errors. The court also mentioned the process for dealing with uncooperative witnesses before Congress. The District of Columbia granted petitions for writs of habeas corpus sought by two witnesses before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, who were charged with violating 2 U.S.C. Section 192. The court emphasized the mandatory nature of certifying facts to the district attorney and submitting them to the grand jury, as observed in previous cases. The District of Columbia court emphasized the mandatory nature of certifying facts to the district attorney and submitting them to the grand jury in cases involving contempt procedures. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the duty of the Speaker when certifying contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory. Congress's view is that a committee's contempt resolution can only be referred to the U.S. Attorney after approval by the parent body when Congress is in session. The court emphasized the discretionary nature of reviewing a committee's contempt citation by the Speaker or President of the Senate during adjournments. In Wilson, convictions were reversed due to the Speaker certifying contempt citations without exercising discretion. This suggests the U.S. Attorney's function may also be discretionary, not mandatory as previously concluded by other courts. The U.S. Attorney's function is discretionary, even when a statute uses mandatory language. U.S. Attorneys have broad prosecutorial discretion. Congress can enforce a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement in federal district court. Noncompliance may result in contempt of court. The U.S. Attorney's function is discretionary, even when a statute uses mandatory language. Congress can enforce a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement in federal district court, where noncompliance may lead to contempt of court. The House has pursued civil enforcement in the past, and in 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate. This statute gives the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia jurisdiction over actions to enforce, secure a declaratory judgment, or prevent noncompliance with Senate subpoenas. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction over civil actions to enforce Senate subpoenas. The Senate can seek compliance or a declaratory judgment through a two-step enforcement process. It is up to the Senate's discretion to choose the enforcement method. The Senate has the option to enforce a subpoena through a two-step process, with the court first reviewing the subpoena's validity. The court's jurisdiction is limited to aiding Congress in enforcing the subpoena, and it cannot enjoin the congressional proceeding even if the subpoena does not meet legal standards for enforcement. The court can only refuse to issue an order instructing compliance with the subpoena, but if compliance is ordered and refused, the individual may face contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when the subpoena is issued to a federal government officer or employee in their official capacity. The House of Representatives cannot use the Senate's civil enforcement statute, but past precedent suggests alternative actions may be pursued. The House of Representatives may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action to compel compliance with a subpoena, as seen in the 2008 case involving Harriet Miers. This marked the first attempt by Congress to seek civil enforcement solely through a resolution of a single house, resolving jurisdictional questions. In 2012, the House authorized a congressional committee to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena issued to an executive branch official. Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for not fully complying with subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. In 2012, the House held Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for not fully complying with subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. A civil lawsuit was filed to enforce the outstanding subpoenas, with the court rejecting the Department of Justice's motion to dismiss. The court addressed federal court jurisdiction, standing, causes of action, and separation-of-powers concerns. Since then, motions for summary judgment from both parties have been denied. The court, following Miers and Holder, requires authorization by resolution of the full House for civil enforcement of subpoenas. The court has yet to decide on the executive privilege question and has ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents. Authorization for civil enforcement of subpoenas or other orders by Congress requires resolution by the full House. The courts will not entertain civil motions without such authorization. If an authorizing resolution by the House is obtained, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia may allow civil enforcement. The DOJ prefers properly authorized procedures for enforcing subpoenas against executive officials, but the executive branch argues that Congress lacks statutory or constitutional authority. The executive branch prefers civil enforcement for subpoenas against executive officials, but argues that Congress cannot use inherent or criminal contempt procedures. The Attorney General has directed against pursuing criminal contempt prosecutions in such cases. This stance is supported by DOJ opinions from the 1980s and actions in contempt proceedings against EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford. The DOJ's stance on using criminal contempt procedures against executive branch officials invoking executive privilege is ineffective, leading Congress to rely on civil enforcement through federal courts for subpoenas. This was evident in cases involving Anne Gorsuch Burford, Harriet Miers, Josh Bolten, and Eric Holder. The President's criminal contempt provision may be ineffective, leading Congress to seek other ways to enforce subpoenas, such as civil enforcement through federal courts. The 2014 case of IRS official Lois Lerner refusing to testify and being held in contempt by the House suggests a broadened executive branch position on criminal contempt against executive officials. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform rejected Lois Lerner's Fifth Amendment privilege claim when she refused to testify, citing her opening statement as a waiver. Despite the House approving a contempt citation, the DOJ has not pursued criminal action against Lerner. Unlike past cases involving executive privilege, Lerner's refusal did not involve such interests. The dispute with Lois Lerner over a congressional subpoena did not involve executive privilege but her personal Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The DOJ's decision not to pursue criminal contempt charges against her raises questions about enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials. The official is asserting executive privilege, making it difficult for Congress to enforce a subpoena through criminal contempt. Past disputes with Burford, Miers, Holder, and Lerner show that the DOJ may not prosecute noncompliance with a subpoena if the President endorses it. Prosecutorial discretion is likely used to avoid pursuing criminal contempt charges in such cases. The DOJ may not prosecute noncompliance with a subpoena if the President endorses it, citing prosecutorial discretion. However, in cases where an executive branch official acts against the President's endorsement, criminal contempt may still be used to punish them. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute to avoid setting a precedent for Congress's authority to use the criminal contempt statute. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute an official for contempt, either due to the merit of the citation or to avoid setting a precedent. Congress may struggle to enforce its subpoenas through civil action, as seen in the Miers case, where a favorable decision was obtained but not enforced before the end of the Congress and administration. In the Miers case, the committee received a favorable decision from the district court but was unable to enforce it before the end of the Bush Administration. The resulting litigation would likely involve a lengthy appeals process. The committee gained access to withheld information, but the change in administrations and time passing diminished its ability to effectively use the information for oversight. Congress may not always rely on the executive branch to enforce subpoenas effectively. The passage of time has diminished the committee's ability to effectively use information for oversight. Congress may not always rely on the executive branch to enforce subpoenas effectively, leading to the need for Congress to exercise its own authorities to enforce a subpoena through inherent contempt."
