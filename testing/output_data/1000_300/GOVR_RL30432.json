    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires preconstruction review and permits for major modifications or new sources of air pollution. States with EPA-approved SIPs must approve construction or modifications to ensure compliance with NAAQS. Applicants must demonstrate that their proposal will not violate NAAQS or increase air pollution levels. The New Source Review (NSR) process ensures that new sources or modifications do not violate NAAQS or increase air pollution levels. NSR is triggered for sources potentially emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or causing a significant increase in emissions. Sources subject to PSD must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) on a case-by-case basis. NSR requirements depend on whether sources are subject to PSD or non-attainment provisions. PSD requires installation of Best Available Control Technology (BACT) while non-attainment requires Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) and offsets. Few permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants despite the broad coverage of NSR. Few permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants despite the broad coverage of NSR. Current U.S. coal-fired electric generating capacity has remained steady at about 300,000 MW for the last ten years. Emissions trends for electric utilities show a generally static situation with NOx emissions remaining constant and a significant drop in SO2 emissions in 1995. Emissions of NOx from coal-fired electric generating facilities have remained constant over the last ten years. In contrast, SO2 emissions saw a significant drop in 1995 due to the acid rain control program under title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments. 111 powerplants were required to reduce their emissions by about 30% from baseline levels specified in the title. The affected phase 1 units emitted about 10 million tons of SO2 in 1990, reduced to 5.3 million tons in 1995. Similarly, NOx emissions were reduced by about 0.4 million tons in 1996 compared to 1990 levels. However, some of the reductions achieved under title IV have been offset by increases in emissions from other sources. The acid rain control program under title IV of the 1990 CAA Amendments led to reductions in SO2 emissions by 4.7 million tons by 1995 and NOx emissions by 0.4 million tons by 1996. However, data shows that overall emissions only decreased by 3.6 million tons for SO2 and 0.1 million tons for NOx. This discrepancy is due to some coal-fired facilities not being covered by phase 1 of the program, resulting in increasing emissions from certain sources. Despite the overall reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from the acid rain control program, there are some coal-fired facilities that have seen increasing emissions. The continuing operation and optimization of existing coal-fired facilities have led to a climb in coal-fired electricity generation and consumption over the past decade. Contrary to expectations, the utilization of coal-fired capacity has increased, and the efficiency of units has not decreased, suggesting that plant maintenance economics have played a role in this trend. The increase in coal-fired capacity utilization over the past decade suggests a shift in plant maintenance economics, allowing utilities to spend more on maintaining their facilities. The question raised by EPA lawsuits is whether this maintenance represents a \"major modification\" requiring pollution control equipment under the CAA. The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires pollution control equipment for \"major modifications\" to power plant facilities, but not for routine maintenance. Utilities are avoiding the term \"life extension\" for spending on old plants due to CAA regulations exempting pre-1971 plants from emissions restrictions. This issue is becoming more critical as the electric utility industry focuses on plant economics. The 1970 Clean Air Act requires power plants built after August 1971 to restrict emissions of pollutants like sulfur dioxide. Plants constructed before 1971 are exempt, but can lose their exemption if they are modified in a major way. There is ongoing regulatory activity related to electricity generation and air quality, including the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 Petitions, and new NAAQS for Fine Particulates. The Department of Justice/EPA lawsuits under NSR are aimed at enforcing existing laws and regulations, not introducing new ones. NSR is a key enforcement tool for stationary sources, separate from regulatory development activities. EPA has clarified that NSR enforcement is unrelated to other regulatory initiatives and stems from an examination of coal-fired utilities starting in late 1996. The enforcement action under NSR is not tied to regulatory activities and stems from an examination of coal-fired utilities since 1996. NSR allows EPA to impose penalties and require affected sources to install BACT, such as FGD units for SO2 reduction and SCR units for NOx reduction. The EPA is enforcing new regulations on coal-fired utility boilers to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by requiring the installation of control devices like scrubbers and SCR units, which could lead to a 70-90% reduction in emissions. This could result in a significant decrease in pollutants, equivalent to removing 26 million cars from the road and reducing acid rain by 15%. The focus on NSR reflects the belief that continuing operation of aging coal-fired plants is a future trend under electric utility restructuring. Extending the life of existing coal-fired capacity is cost-effective and competitive in a restructured industry, encouraging renovation of existing plants. Requiring Best Available Control Technology (BACT) through NSR could mitigate environmental effects of this trend. EPA is taking legal actions against utilities for non-compliance. The EPA is taking legal actions against utilities for non-compliance with Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirements under NSR for existing coal-fired plants. Enforcement of NSR on these facilities has been challenging due to various factors, including budget constraints and priorities. The primary difficulty in enforcing NSR on existing coal-fired electric generating facilities is defining a major modification. The definition of modification under the Clean Air Act has evolved over time to include any physical or operational change that increases the emission of air pollutants. EPA regulations further specify that any replacement of existing components can also be considered a modification. The EPA regulations define modification as any change that increases emissions, with a focus on compliance with NAAQS and PSD. Facilities exceeding a 40-ton threshold for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are subject to NSR. Enforcement of these thresholds has proven challenging. EPA defines a \"significant\" increase in emissions as exceeding 40 tons per year for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from a major source, triggering NSR. Enforcing these thresholds has been challenging. Life extension efforts by utilities typically improve availability and reliability of generating units without increasing maximum hourly emission rates or exceeding 50% asset value threshold. However, these efforts may lead to increased emissions due to improved availability and reliability. NSR review has a more sensitive trigger - tonnage increase in pollutant output. Life extension improves availability and reliability, likely increasing emissions. EPA enforced NSR against facilities in the late 1980s. In 1988, EPA ruled a life extension project by WEPCO met NSR trigger due to potential increased emissions. EPA modified the emissions trigger for electric utilities in 1992. The new test compares a facility's actual emissions before the project. After litigation and debate, EPA changed the emissions trigger for electric utilities in 1992. The new test compares a facility's actual emissions before and after a modification. NSR regulations for utility plants also consider life extension activities, excluding routine maintenance, repair, and replacement. The current NSR regulations for utility plants exclude routine maintenance, repair, and replacement from being considered modifications. Increases in production rates without capital expenditures are also not considered modifications. Utilities have adapted by integrating life extension efforts into routine maintenance schedules, using terms like capital improvement and rehabilitation program instead of \"life extension.\" The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce New Source Review requirements of the Clean Air Act regarding new construction and modifications of coal-fired facilities by investor-owned utilities. EPA's Compliance Order addresses instances of modifications by utilities. The distinction between modification and routine maintenance is blurred by integrating life extension efforts into maintenance schedules. The Justice Department and EPA are enforcing New Source Review requirements for coal-fired facilities by investor-owned utilities. EPA's Compliance Order addresses modifications by utilities, blurring the line between modification and routine maintenance. Tables identify facilities violating NSR requirements, with complaints subject to modification and new allegations. The Justice Department and EPA are enforcing New Source Review requirements for coal-fired facilities by investor-owned utilities. Complaints seek injunctive relief and civil penalties for violations, requiring compliance with CAA requirements, installation of BACT, permit applications, and audits for NSR compliance. EPA's Compliance Order for TVA includes developing a schedule for meeting requirements, auditing coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance, and retiring SO2 allowances for reductions. The industry's response to EPA's enforcement action focuses on an exemption under NSR for \"routine maintenance.\" Industry argues that EPA has not objected to utilities engaging in activities now cited as triggering NSR, accusing EPA of changing the rules mid-game. Industry is accusing EPA of changing the rules mid-game by citing activities as triggering NSR that were previously allowed under the \"routine maintenance\" exemption. The industry argues that these activities are necessary for the reliable operation of plants and should not be considered major modifications triggering NSR. The EPA Administrator announced that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants, resulting in reductions of 1.87 million tons of SO2 and 0.63 million tons of NOx emissions. This would more than compensate for any erosion in original reductions under title IV. The EPA Administrator announced significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions, with potential cuts of 1.87 million tons of SO2 and 0.63 million tons of NOx. These reductions would compensate for any erosion in original reductions under title IV, indicating the potential for substantial emission cuts through EPA's NSR action. However, complexities arise due to interactions with existing reduction programs like title IV's limits on SO2 emissions from utilities. Title IV limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons starting in 2000, with interim reductions required in 1995. Emissions are capped based on historical data, not regulatory limits, and an allowance system was created for compliance. EPA issues allowances to facilities for emitting SO2. The 1990 CAA Amendments program under Title IV established an emissions allowance system for SO2, with allowances allocated to existing facilities based on emission rate/fuel consumption formulas. Allowances can be used at the allocated plant, traded, or banked for future use or sale. The program has achieved 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program, as they have little in common besides focusing on existing facilities and SO2 emissions. Compliance with the emissions cap is the key criterion for Title IV, while NSR is concerned with modifications and installation of BACT at existing facilities. The NSR focuses on modifications and BACT installation at existing facilities, while Title IV is a program to reduce aggregate SO2 emissions with flexibility for compliance strategies. The current SO2 NSPS sets a percentage reduction requirement, but title IV allows for less stringent allocations for existing coal-fired facilities. Facilities installing BACT under NSR may \"overcontrol\" SO2 under title IV, leading to excess allowances for sale or future use. The allocations under Title IV for existing coal-fired facilities are less stringent and can be met with low-sulfur coal. Facilities that install BACT under NSR may have excess allowances available for sale due to \"overcontrol\" of SO2 under Title IV. Any reductions achieved through NSR enforcement could be nullified if the plant sells its SO2 reduction to a facility not covered by NSR. There is no provision in Title IV for adjusting allowance allocations based on NSR enforcement. Congress would need to change the law or utilities would have to agree to avoid this \"allowance trap.\" The law regarding allowance allocations is based on historical data, not compliance with NSPS or SIP requirements. To avoid the \"allowance trap,\" Congress would need to change the law or utilities would have to surrender excess allowances. The interaction between NSR and NOx NSPS is complex, with the NOx NSPS historically lagging in technology development. The 1979 NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities could be met with simple modifications and did not require pollution control devices like SCR. In 1998, EPA set a new NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities at 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu, a standard more aligned with available technology. However, this standard was challenged in court, and in 1999, the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the new NOx NSPS for modified utility boilers. As a result, the NSPS for modified sources reverts to the 1979 standard until EPA proposes a revised NSPS. The vacating of the modified standard in 1999 resulted in uncertainty regarding the floor for determining BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources. The interaction of NSR and title IV further complicates the situation, as the NOx reduction program under title IV differs from the SO2 program. The confusion arises from the differing emission rate standards and timelines set for existing facilities under title IV. The title IV NOx program, like the NSPS program, is based on emission rates for existing facilities to be achieved in 1995 or 2000. The emission rate limitation for most boilers under title IV is more stringent than the 1979 NOx NSPS. Some existing coal-fired facilities have had emission controls since 1995 that are more stringent than the existing NSPS. It is currently difficult to project what any actual NOx reduction may be. The EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions, but it is uncertain if this will lead to actual NOx reduction or just costly litigation. NSR was implemented to control emissions from existing sources, but there are concerns about its efficiency. The Clean Air Act's NSR approach may result in reduced emissions or costly litigation, but more efficient methods like title IV have been developed to decrease emissions from existing sources. Title IV significantly reduced SO2 and NOx emissions from utility plants, surpassing NSR's impact in its first year. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV achieved full compliance, while NSR's compliance is questioned. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV achieved full compliance, surpassing NSR's impact in its first year. Lowering the existing cap on SO2 emissions from coal-fired powerplants could be a straightforward alternative to reduce emissions. The 1990 SO2 cap reduced emissions from existing facilities to 1971 NSPS levels. Lowering the cap by two-thirds could achieve similar reductions with flexibility for utilities. A new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx could eliminate uncertainties in EPA initiatives. A new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx could eliminate uncertainties in EPA initiatives and require new legislation. Implementing a regionwide cap and trade program for NOx under the stalled SIP Call would need extraordinary cooperation between states or new EPA authority. Another alternative to NSR is focusing on SO2 emissions. Implementing a regionwide cap and trade program for NOx under the stalled SIP Call would require extraordinary cooperation between states or new EPA authority. Other regulatory initiatives at EPA, such as the fine particulate NAAQS and regional haze rule, will also lead to reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, but with long implementation schedules extending beyond 2010. Unlike tightening the title IV SO2 cap and creating an NOx cap, these initiatives do not need further legislative authority. The implementation schedules for regulatory initiatives at EPA have long timelines, extending beyond 2010. Alternative approaches to addressing emissions from coal-fired power plants include controlling pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide, which could also reduce SO2 and NOx emissions. The regulation of CO2 and mercury under the Clean Air Act is controversial and slow-moving. EPA argues it has the authority to regulate CO2, but the process for controlling mercury emissions from utility boilers has been sluggish. The process to control Hg emissions from electric utility boilers has been slow due to EPA's determination of its appropriateness and necessity. EPA's authority to regulate CO2 under the CAA is controversial, leading to potential CO2 reductions through voluntary initiatives or ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. Reforming NSR could involve defining \"modification\" based on plant age, simplifying the trigger for NSR, but requiring legislative action. Another reform possibility could arise from a current EPA initiative. One potential reform to the New Source Review (NSR) could involve excluding older electric utility generating facilities from the complex NSR applicability rules if they already have state-of-the-art pollution control technology. This \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" would recognize that NSR may not lead to significant emission reductions for units that are already well-controlled. The proposal defines a \"clean unit\" as one that has installed Best Available Control Technology (BACT) or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) within the last 10 years, allowing for modifications that do not increase the unit's maximum hourly emissions. EPA has been considering NSR reforms for years, with a focus on implementing off-ramps to NSR. EPA is considering reforms to the New Source Review (NSR) program, including a \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for older facilities with advanced pollution control technology. This proposal aims to reduce emissions without the need for additional regulations or legislation. EPA is also exploring cap and trade programs as a more cost-effective and environmentally beneficial alternative to NSR. The EPA is considering reforms to the NSR program, including a \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for older facilities with advanced pollution control technology. The debate on NSR has focused on \"grandfathered\" power plants emitting high levels of pollution due to exemptions. Industry lobbyists argued for exemptions, claiming older plants would soon retire, but many are still operating decades later. The term \"grandfathered powerplant\" is used in debates on emissions from existing power plants, indicating if they are covered under the Clean Air Act. Industry argued against retrofits for older plants, claiming they would retire soon, but many are still operating without environmental controls. Section 111 of the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to establish New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new sources, including power plants. These standards mandate the installation of proven emission reduction systems for major new sources. Power plants are subject to NSPS regulations for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. \"Grandfathered\" power plants, built before NSPS regulations, are not required to meet these standards. NSPS regulations for power plants were first issued in 1971 and revised in 1979 and 1998. Instead of NSPS requirements, grandfathered sources must adhere to emission rate limits. The NSPS regulations for power plants, established in 1971 and revised in 1979 and 1998, require new sources to meet emission reduction standards. \"Grandfathered\" power plants, built before these regulations, are exempt from NSPS requirements and must adhere to state emission rate limits instead. However, the term \"grandfathered\" becomes ambiguous or meaningless for certain pollutants like carbon dioxide and mercury, as all power plants are essentially \"grandfathered\" for these non-criteria air pollutants. EPA reviews NSPS every eight years to increase stringency as technology advances. The NSPS regulations for power plants, established in 1971 and revised in 1979 and 1998, require new sources to meet emission reduction standards. \"Grandfathered\" power plants, built before these regulations, are exempt from NSPS requirements and must adhere to state emission rate limits instead. EPA reviews NSPS every eight years to increase stringency as technology advances. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed the regulation of existing power plants with respect to SO2 and NOx, making some requirements more stringent than existing NSPS. Under Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, existing \"grandfathered\" power plants are required to meet more stringent standards for SO2 and NOx emissions compared to the existing NSPS regulations. The focus of debate should be on fuel sources rather than the age of the plant when it comes to increasing NOx controls for coal-fired facilities. The term \"grandfathered\" becomes meaningless in these circumstances. If the focus is on reducing SO2 emissions from power plants, shrinking the current cap on SO2 is the most logical approach. Age of the plant is not relevant for NOx emissions, but rather the fuel source. New power plants must offset their emissions under the cap, making NSPS for SO2 effectively nil. A cap on NOx emissions is a logical extension. The EPA favors reducing SO2 emissions from electric generating facilities by shrinking the current cap on SO2. They also propose state-by-state emissions caps for NOx emissions. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional oversight, similar to the DOJ/EPA actions on NSR. These issues revolve around interpretations of CAA provisions and may require new legislation for consistency in addressing NSR problems. The interpretation of CAA provisions and the need for new legislation to address NSR issues are key factors in regulating the environmental impact of the electric utility industry."
