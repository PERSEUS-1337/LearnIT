    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\" with the purpose outlined in section 2. The Act, known as the \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997,\" aims to establish early detection networks for hearing loss in babies, ensuring screening before leaving hospitals or within the first 3 months of life for non-hospital births. Diagnostic testing should be done promptly, and all newborn screening programs should be universal. Diagnostic audiologic testing should be done promptly for appropriate referral before 6 months of age. Newborn hearing screening programs should include linkage to diagnosis and early intervention services. Public policy should consider the unique needs of deaf or hard-of-hearing infants and involve consultation with relevant sectors. STATEWIDE EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTION NETWORKS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes developing state capacity, monitoring hearing detection in birthing hospitals, and ensuring effective screening and referral services. The grants aim to develop statewide models for effective screening, referral, and linkage with early intervention services, collect data on early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for research and policy development. SEC. 4. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, DATA MANAGEMENT, AND APPLIED RESEARCH. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes data collection, standardized procedures for quality monitoring, cost-effectiveness studies, and identifying causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss. The curr_chunk discusses studying the costs and effectiveness of hearing detection, identifying causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss, assessing early detection programs' effectiveness, and sharing data with monitoring programs. The curr_chunk focuses on research conducted by the National Institutes of Health on new screening techniques and technology for hearing loss. The curr_chunk focuses on coordination and collaboration. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with other agencies, consumer groups, individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, professional personnel, and health and education professionals. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health collaborate on policy development for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment/intervention at Federal and State levels, with private sector involvement. The Health Resources and Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborate to assist States in establishing early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks and developing a data collection system. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks is set at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as needed for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. Technical assistance, data management, and applied research funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is authorized at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as necessary for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. Funding for the National Institutes of Health for this purpose is set at $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as needed for subsequent years. The National Institutes of Health is authorized to receive $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and additional funding as necessary for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 for carrying out section 4(b)."
