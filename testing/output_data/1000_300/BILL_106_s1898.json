    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Interstate Transportation of Dangerous Criminals Act of 2000\" or \"Jeanna's Act.\" Congress finds that States are increasingly using private prisoner transport companies for violent prisoners, leading to escapes and the need for oversight by the Attorney General. While most prefer law enforcement officers, fiscal or logistical concerns may necessitate private companies. While law enforcement officers are preferred for transporting violent prisoners, fiscal or logistical concerns may lead to the use of private prisoner transport companies. If a government entity chooses to use a private company, it should be regulated to ensure public safety. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms including \"crime of violence,\" \"private prisoner transport company,\" and \"violent prisoner.\" SEC. 4. FEDERAL REGULATION OF PRISONER TRANSPORT COMPANIES. The Attorney General, in consultation with relevant organizations, will establish regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines. These regulations will cover background checks, drug testing, and training requirements for employees. The regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines include preemployment drug testing, 100 hours of training on prisoner transportation, restrictions on duty hours, and minimum personnel requirements for supervising violent prisoners. Minimum standards for personnel supervising violent prisoners, employee uniforms with identification, categories of prisoners wearing brightly colored clothing, and requirements for restraints during transportation. Standards for transporting violent prisoners include wearing brightly colored clothing for identification, using leg shackles and double-locked handcuffs, and notifying law enforcement 24 hours in advance of scheduled stops. In case of an escape, immediate notification to law enforcement and the contracting entity is required. The regulations require immediate notification to law enforcement and the contracting entity in case of an escape by a violent prisoner. Federal standards for private prisoner transport companies must not be stricter than those for federal agencies like the United States Marshals Service. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.\n\nViolators of the regulations established by this Act may face a civil penalty up to $10,000 per violation, along with prosecution costs. They must also reimburse any entity that incurred expenses in apprehending an escaped violent prisoner due to a violation of the regulations."
