    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code allows cities or counties to declare privately owned offstreet parking facilities open to the public for parking, with regulations on unauthorized parking. If a city or county enacts an ordinance allowing privately owned offstreet parking facilities to regulate unauthorized parking, the owner must include contest instructions in parking fee invoices. If a city or county authorizes privately owned offstreet parking facilities to regulate unauthorized parking, the owner cannot submit parking fee invoices to the Department of Motor Vehicles to collect unpaid fees by withholding licenses or vehicle registrations. An ordinance or resolution enacted for offstreet parking facilities must have a notice posted at each entrance warning of public moving vehicle laws and potential parking invoice fees. A public hearing and written notice to the owner and operator are required before enacting such ordinances. (c) Prior written notice and a public hearing are required before enacting an ordinance or resolution for privately owned offstreet parking facilities. Enforcement of Section 22507.8 may proceed without the need for an ordinance or resolution, and the Department is not obligated to patrol or enforce code provisions on such facilities, except for those applicable to private property. Cities or counties authorizing private parking regulation must include specific provisions in their ordinances or resolutions. A city or county authorizing private parking regulation must include dispute resolution procedures in its ordinance, such as a written policy with specified time periods, an administrative hearing process with options for in-person or mail hearings, administrative review, and a hearing by a third-party examiner. The examiner must be trained and provide an independent, fair, and impartial review, with the decision delivered in person or by mail. The ordinance for private parking regulation must include dispute resolution procedures such as administrative review by a trained third-party examiner, delivery of decision by mail or in person, and the option for payment in installments for those unable to pay in full. Additionally, there should be a prohibition on incentives based on the number of invoices issued or disputed, and a cap on parking invoice fees. The private parking regulation ordinance includes measures such as a prohibition on incentives based on the number of invoices issued or disputed, a cap on parking invoice fees, and preventing private parking regulators from posing as government enforcement agencies."
