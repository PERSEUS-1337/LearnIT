The value of the coin is designated on the obverse side, while the reverse side will feature designs emblematic of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands, selected by the Secretary after consultation with the respective territories' chief executives. Designs for quarter dollars are selected by the Secretary in consultation with the chief executive of the District of Columbia or the territory being honored, the Commission of Fine Arts, and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. The Secretary may include participation by District or territorial officials, artists, engravers, and the general public in the design selection process for quarter dollars to ensure dignified designs for the Nation's coinage and currency. The Secretary shall not select any frivolous or inappropriate design for any quarter dollar minted under this subsection, including no head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person, living or dead. All coins minted under this subsection shall be considered numismatic items. The Secretary may mint and issue quarter dollars in uncirculated and proof qualities, with the option to mint silver coins with 90 percent silver content. Timing and order of issuance are determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may mint quarter dollars with 90 percent silver content to honor the District of Columbia and territories in 2009 in a specific order. If the District of Columbia or any territory becomes a state within 10 years, provisions apply. If the District of Columbia or any territory becomes a state within 10 years, specific provisions will apply. If a territory becomes independent before quarter dollars are minted to honor it, this subsection will no longer apply to that territory. The subsection applies to territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, US Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands. If a territory becomes a state or independent before coins are minted, the subsection no longer applies. The House of Representatives passed the legislation on January 23, 2007, as attested by Clerk Karen L. Haas."
