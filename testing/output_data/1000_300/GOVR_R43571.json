    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in existence since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for service in specific fields or professions. Currently, there are over 50 federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs available. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are created by the federal government to forgive or repay a portion of an individual's student loan debt in exchange for service in specific fields or professions. Over 50 programs exist, with approximately 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. Benefits are often contingent on completing a period of employment in public service or other occupations. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are designed to forgive or repay a portion of student loan debt in exchange for service in specific fields. Benefits are often contingent on completing a period of employment in public service or other occupations. Loan forgiveness benefits are now offered in certain income-driven repayment plans to provide financial incentives for entering or remaining in high-need professions. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who enter public service or specific professions. Other forms of debt relief include loan discharge for disability, death, school closure, or false circumstances. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch in 1957, was one of the earliest federal student loan forgiveness programs. Other forms of debt relief include loan discharge for various circumstances such as disability, death, and school closure. The NDSL program was established in 1958 in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch, aiming to improve education for national security. It provided low-interest loans to college students and included a student loan forgiveness component to incentivize teaching in public schools. The NDSL program included a student loan forgiveness component to encourage teaching in public schools. Eligible individuals teaching in schools with low-income students or students with disabilities could have up to half of their student loans cancelled. Loan forgiveness benefits were also available to those serving in Head Start programs or in the Armed Forces. The NDSL program included loan forgiveness benefits for individuals serving in Head Start programs and the Armed Forces. Qualified borrowers could have a portion of their loans canceled based on years of public service. The program was later renamed the Federal Perkins Loan Program. Other federal student loan forgiveness programs were established for professions in high-need areas, such as the Health Professions Student Loan Program. Several federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs were established to target borrowers in high-need areas. One example is the Health Professions Student Loan Program (HPSLP), which offered loan forgiveness for medical professionals working in underserved areas. Currently, there are over 50 such programs authorized by federal law, providing policymakers with information on their purpose and design. The curr_chunk provides brief descriptions of over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. These programs aim to offer debt relief to borrowers through specified service, employment in certain professions, or serving in specific areas. Readers seeking comprehensive details are advised to refer to federal statutes, regulations, and agency guidance. Several federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs are authorized under federal law, each designed to provide debt relief to borrowers through specified service, employment in certain professions, or serving in specific areas. These programs have unique characteristics such as borrower eligibility criteria, benefit amounts, means of providing benefits, and funding sources. The terms used to describe the benefits offered through these programs may vary, leading to inconsistencies across different programs. The report provides a consistent set of parameters to characterize various aspects of federally authorized loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Borrowers may need to work in specific roles or locations for a set period to qualify for benefits. Repayment plan-based forgiveness requires adhering to an income-driven plan for a specified time. Loan forgiveness programs require borrowers to repay according to an income-driven plan for a specified period to qualify for benefits. At the end of the term, some or all of the qualifying student loan debt is forgiven. The availability of benefits may be an entitlement or at the discretion of the program administrator. Loan forgiveness benefits are available to qualified borrowers based on program administration and fund availability. These benefits are outlined in loan documents and entitlements for borrowers who meet eligibility criteria. Funding for entitlement benefits comes from mandatory appropriations and is part of federal student loan subsidy costs. Loan forgiveness benefits are entitlements for qualified borrowers funded through mandatory appropriations. There are two categories: forgiveness for public service employment and forgiveness following income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs offer debt relief for specific service, profession, or location, with the entity either repaying the borrower's debt or providing funding for repayment. Loan repayment programs provide debt relief by either directly repaying some or all of the borrower's student loan debt or funding a separate entity to do so. These programs are designed to address employment needs or shortages, recruit and retain qualified employees, and are available to a limited number of qualified borrowers. Loan repayment benefits are discretionary and serve as an additional form of compensation. Loan repayment benefits are often used as an additional form of compensation for targeted employees who may be difficult to recruit or retain. These benefits are discretionary and subject to fund availability. One key difference in debt relief programs is the tax liability incurred by the individual receiving the benefit. Forgiveness under an employment-focused program is tax-exempt, while forgiveness under income-driven repayment or public service employment may result in a tax liability. The borrower may not be responsible for paying federal income tax on loan forgiveness for public service employment, but may have to pay income tax on forgiveness following income-driven repayment or repayment for public service employment. There are three categories of debt relief programs: loan forgiveness for public service employment, loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment, and loan repayment for public service employment. There are three categories of loans eligible for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs: federal student loans under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, student loans under Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, and private education loans. Eligible loans for most programs include federal student loans under HEA or PHSA programs. Private education loans may also be eligible for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, in addition to federal student loans under HEA or PHSA programs. Federal student loans are currently only available through the Direct Loan program authorized under Part D of Title IV, after previously being offered through the Federal Family Education Loan program until June 30, 2010. Until June 30, 2010, federal student loans were made through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, a guaranteed loan program, authorized under Part B of Title IV. Loans in the Direct Loan program are made by the government with federal capital, while in the FFEL program, loans were made by nonfederal lenders with nonfederal capital. Loan origination, servicing, and collection in the Direct Loan program are performed by federal contractors. In the FFEL program, loans were made by nonfederal lenders with nonfederal capital, while in the Direct Loan program, loans are made by the government with federal capital. Nonprofit guaranty agencies administer federal loan insurance and process loan forgiveness benefits. Perkins Loans are made by institutions of higher education with a combination of federal and institutional capital. Loan forgiveness benefits availability differed between the FFEL and Direct Loan programs. In the Perkins Loan program, institutions of higher education act as lenders and are responsible for loan origination, servicing, and processing loan cancelation benefits. Direct Subsidized Loans in the Direct Loan program are available to undergraduate students with financial need, with the government subsidizing interest charges during enrollment and a grace period. Loan forgiveness benefits availability varies between different federal student loan programs. Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need, subsidized by the government to cover interest charges during enrollment and a grace period. Borrowing limits apply, and in FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans totaling $21.5 billion were issued. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. Loan proceeds can be used to finance a student's cost of attendance. Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. Borrowers are responsible for paying all accrued interest, with borrowing limits in place. In FY2017, 8.1 million Direct Unsubsidized Loans totaling $49.8 billion were issued. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans were made to parents of undergraduate students and graduate/professional students without explicit borrowing limits. Totaling $12.5 billion for parents and $12.5 billion for graduate/professional students. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans totaling $12.5 billion were made to parents of undergraduate students and $9.9 billion to graduate and professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan and extend repayment period. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine different types of federal student loans, including Health Professions Student Loans, Loans for Disadvantaged Students, Nursing Student Loans, and Health Education Assistance Loans. This feature enables borrowers to access loan forgiveness and repayment benefits for loans that were originally made without those benefits. Direct Consolidation Loans currently have fixed interest rates based on the weighted average of the loans being consolidated. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made. Perkins Loans were available to undergraduate and graduate students with a fixed interest rate of 5% per year. Borrowers engaged in public service may have a portion of their Perkins Loans cancelled for each year of service. In FY2017, Perkins Loans totaling $782.23 million were made, with a portion cancellable for public service. HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students, making 20,849 loans in 2016-2017 totaling $162.8 million. These loans are available for dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, and veterinary medicine students. The HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students pursuing degrees in dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, or veterinary medicine. In 2016-2017, 6,842 loans totaling $64.2 million were made, with a 5% fixed interest rate. Students must complete a residency in a primary care field in exchange for receiving a primary care loan. The HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in various fields. Recipients must complete a residency in a primary care field and practice in that field for 10 years. Loan recipients failing to meet service requirements must repay loans at a higher interest rate. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated 252 loans totaling $17.8 million were made. The HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in various fields such as allopathic or osteopathic medicine, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, and nursing. The program is administered by individual schools selecting students who are U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. In the academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 1,619 loans totaling $21.7 million for various health professions and 10,138 loans totaling $31.8 million specifically for nursing students. The Nursing Faculty Loan Program provides loans to registered nurses completing graduate studies to become nursing school faculty. Administered by nursing schools, it offers loans to U.S. citizens or lawful residents. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 10,138 loans totaling $31.8 million. Additionally, the Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program, no longer issuing new loans, continues to manage outstanding loans. The Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program, authorized in Title VII, Part A-I of the PHSA, made 1,998 loans totaling $27.3 million. The program supported students pursuing degrees in various healthcare fields. Although new loans are no longer available, borrowers are still responsible for repayment. Additionally, nonfederal entities also provide student loans. The program loans have been terminated, but borrowers remain responsible for payments. Private student loans are offered by nonfederal entities like banks and credit unions. These loans have specific terms set by the lender. Some federal loan repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers of private education loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide debt relief to eligible borrowers. Education loans are not part of federal loan programs, but some federal loan repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers. All student loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide debt relief to eligible borrowers. These programs have unique characteristics and qualifying criteria. The report outlines three categories of debt relief programs and their qualifying criteria, as well as program components for comparison. The report outlines three categories of debt relief programs based on program components such as types of qualifying service, borrower economic circumstances, amounts and timing of debt relief, and exclusions or limitations on benefits. Loan forgiveness entitlement programs are presented first, with programs for public service and income-driven repayment. See Appendix A for program-specific details. Loan forgiveness entitlement programs are presented in three categories: programs for public service, income-driven repayment, and loan repayment for public service or employment needs. These programs vary in scale and target different groups of borrowers. Public service employment loan forgiveness provides debt relief to qualified borrowers in specific sectors. Loan forgiveness for public service employment is more narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs. It provides debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations or public service roles. These benefits are entitlements written into federal student loan terms and conditions. Table 1 summarizes the various programs offered, highlighting eligibility criteria such as specific employer requirements. Table 1 summarizes public service employment programs for loan forgiveness, detailing eligibility criteria based on employer and occupation requirements, as well as economic circumstances during repayment. Programs are ranked by the scale of benefits available to borrowers. Table 1 summarizes public service employment programs for loan forgiveness, ranking them by the scale of benefits available to borrowers. To qualify for benefits, borrowers must meet specific eligibility criteria, such as completing a specific type of service or entering a particular occupation. These programs are widely available to individuals serving as teachers, with Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation also open to law enforcement personnel and public defenders, and Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness available to a broader range of individuals employed full-time in public service. Loan forgiveness programs are available for public service occupations, including law enforcement personnel and public defenders. Eligible individuals must be employed full-time in public service, such as federal, state, local, or tribal government agencies, and certain nonprofit organizations. Service commitments typically range from 1 to 10 years. Loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment offers debt relief to borrowers who repay their federal student loans based on their income for an extended period. These benefits are entitlements written into the terms of widely available federal student loans. Loan forgiveness programs are available for individuals who have not repaid their entire student loan debt after repaying based on their income for an extended period. These benefits are entitlements written into federal student loans terms. The programs are distinct from those targeting public service employment and are available to a wide number of qualified borrowers. Table 2 summarizes various loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment, organized by eligibility date. Unlike Table 1, these programs are not grouped by availability scope and financial resources. Table 2 shows various loan forgiveness programs available to borrowers who meet income-driven qualifications. These programs do not have specific employer or occupational requirements, making them widely accessible to a potentially unlimited number of borrowers. Loan forgiveness or repayment programs do not have specific employer or occupational requirements. Borrowers must make monthly payments towards their federal student loans for 20-25 years based on factors like debt amount and income. Monthly payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income. At the end of the repayment period, the remaining loan balance is forgiven. Public service employment can also provide debt relief benefits to borrowers in specific occupations. Loan repayment for public service employment offers debt relief benefits to borrowers in specific occupations or working for specific employers. The outstanding balance of a borrower's loans is forgiven at the end of the repayment period. These programs aim to address employment needs or shortages and help government agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. The benefits are not entitlements and are subject to the availability of program funds. Loan repayment programs for public service employment are available to qualified borrowers, subject to program funds. They aim to address employment needs or shortages and help agencies recruit and retain employees. These programs are not entitlements and are smaller in scale compared to loan forgiveness programs. Table 3 summarizes the various loan repayment programs available for meeting broad employment needs or shortages. It outlines the eligibility criteria based on the employer and employment status of borrowers. Loan repayment programs for public service employment are available to qualified borrowers based on employer and employment status. The table organizes programs by operational status and administering department. Unlike loan forgiveness programs, these programs do not group by availability or financial resources. Loan repayment programs are grouped by administering department or agency, not by availability or financial resources. Table 3 shows the variety of employment needs these programs aim to meet, with 19 programs in total. 15 programs target health-related occupations, including addressing provider shortages and faculty needs. Other targeted occupations include legal professions and large animal veterinarians providing emergency services. Borrowers in these programs typically do not need to meet specific criteria. Loan repayment programs target various occupations, including health care faculty, legal professions, and large animal veterinarians providing emergency services. Borrowers may work for multiple employers within the same class, with some programs requiring service in underserved areas. Service commitments typically last between one and five years. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees are agency-specific. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees have service commitments lasting between one and five years, targeting agency-specific recruitment and retention needs. Information on the scale of these programs is not always readily available, but the Office of Personnel Management reports annually on the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program. Table 4 summarizes the various loan repayment programs offered by individual federal agencies for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. Table 4 summarizes federal government loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees, detailing eligibility criteria and benefits available. Programs vary in operational status and may require service commitments ranging from one to five years. Table 4 summarizes federal government loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees, organized by operational status and administering department. There are 25 programs, including 8 specifically for Armed Forces recruitment, with varying availability across federal agencies. Eligibility criteria may include economic circumstances assessment. Several federal government loan repayment programs are available to recruit and retain qualified employees, with varying eligibility criteria and service commitments ranging from one to five years. These programs are designed to address employment needs or shortages in specific fields or occupations within federal agencies. Loan repayment programs require borrowers to serve for a minimum period of time, typically between one and five years. Eligibility for benefits can be based on economic circumstances at the time of borrowing or during the repayment period. Economic circumstances may also be considered alongside other factors such as qualifying types of service. Loan repayment programs can provide benefits based on economic circumstances at the time of borrowing or during the repayment period. Eligibility for benefits may consider factors like disadvantaged backgrounds or high monthly loan payments. Programs vary in the amount and schedule of loan forgiveness or repayment benefits provided. Several loan repayment programs offer benefits based on economic circumstances, with eligibility determined by factors like disadvantaged backgrounds or high monthly loan payments. Benefits can be provided through forgiveness of the entire outstanding balance, repayment of a flat dollar amount, or a percentage of the loan. Some programs require borrowers to make a certain number of payments before forgiving the remaining balance, while others offer repayment benefits in the form of a lump sum or regular payments from employers. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer benefits through forgiveness of outstanding loans, flat dollar amounts, or a percentage of loans. Restrictions may apply, and defaulting on loans can make borrowers ineligible for benefits. Many loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions that may limit benefits, such as ineligibility for borrowers who have defaulted on loans. Some programs also restrict individuals from receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service. Many federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions on receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service, with penalties for not completing the term of service. Some programs require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents. Many federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions on receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service, with penalties for not completing the term of service. Some programs specifically require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents, while others may only be available to these groups based on the type of loan eligible for forgiveness or repayment. Federal student loans under the Higher Education Act are only available to certain eligible individuals, restricting the availability of forgiveness or repayment benefits based on citizenship. The availability of loan forgiveness and repayment benefits in federal programs may be restricted based on a borrower's citizenship and immigration status. Defaulted loans may also impact eligibility for benefits, with some programs requiring certain characteristics of the defaulted loans to be met. For example, in the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, borrowers may be ineligible for teacher loan forgiveness on defaulted loans unless satisfactory repayment arrangements have been made. Loan forgiveness may be granted to borrowers who have made satisfactory repayment arrangements for their loans in the Perkins Loan Cancellation program. Clawback provisions may require recipients to pay back benefits if they fail to complete service obligations. Clawback provisions in federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs may require participants to repay unearned benefits, plus interest and punitive fees. Some programs exempt borrowers from liability if they become disabled or pass away. forgiven or repaid student loan debt is considered part of gross income for federal income taxation. Some federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs may exempt participants from liability for unearned benefits in case of disability or death. Student loan debt forgiveness or repayment is typically considered part of gross income for federal income taxation, but certain programs may exclude these benefits from income tax liability. For example, the Higher Education Act specifies that forgiven Federal Perkins Loans are excluded from gross income. The Federal Perkins Loan forgiveness excludes forgiven amounts from gross income, subject to certain conditions in IRC Section 108(f). Loans must be borrowed for education, have cancellation terms for work in specific professions, and be made by specified lenders. Exclusions also apply to programs like the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program. The Federal Perkins Loan forgiveness excludes forgiven amounts from gross income under certain conditions in IRC Section 108(f). Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may provide supplemental funds to offset tax liability. Recipients can avoid significant taxation if their benefits are excluded from gross income. Many recipients of loan forgiveness and repayment benefits can avoid tax liability if benefits are excluded from gross income. $200 million in revenue was lost in FY2017 due to the exclusion of income from student loan debt forgiveness. Researchers debate the effectiveness of loan forgiveness in encouraging specific career choices. The effectiveness of loan forgiveness programs is analyzed based on whether they incentivize individuals to enter or stay in certain fields, if student loan debt is a significant barrier, and if they encourage students to take on more debt. Another aspect to consider is the cost of these programs to the government compared to the benefits received. The analysis discusses the effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs for individuals, considering their influence on career choices. It also examines the costs incurred by the federal government in operating these programs. Evaluations comparing the career paths of individuals with access to these benefits and those without can provide insights into the impact of such programs. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) examined the career trajectories of loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and compared them with similar individuals who did not receive loan repayment. Individuals receiving loan repayment benefits were more likely to continue careers in medical research. The NIH's loan repayment program aims to encourage individuals to pursue medical research careers. A study found that recipients were more likely to stay in medical research at the NIH or in general. While the program may be effective, other factors also influence career choices. The loan repayment program at NIH may not be the sole reason for individuals to stay in targeted positions. Other factors like career choices and job availability also play a role. Loan repayment incentives may be more effective when job opportunities are abundant. Some individuals might have taken the same job even without loan repayment benefits. Law school graduates facing limited private sector opportunities may opt for public interest or government jobs. Some individuals may have taken a job even without loan repayment benefits. Evidence suggests that loan repayment programs can be a deciding factor for participants, especially in competitive job markets like healthcare and NIH employment for physicians. The NIH found that its loan repayment program was a key factor in attracting physicians with competing job offers. The program helped retain physicians in research roles, showing its effectiveness as a recruitment and retention tool. However, challenges exist with funding uncertainties and program design that may undermine its effectiveness. Other federal agencies have also seen success with loan repayment programs in recruiting and retaining staff. Loan repayment programs may face challenges with funding uncertainties and program design, potentially undermining their effectiveness as recruitment and retention tools. Researchers suggest that the financial benefits should be meaningful enough to offset a significant portion of education costs to attract and retain individuals in certain professions. Loan repayment benefits need to be meaningful enough to offset costs associated with borrowing for education. Some programs, like the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program, require participants to pay federal income taxes on the benefits, making them less attractive. Additionally, the short-term nature of many programs, with benefits tied to a two-year employment commitment, may also impact their appeal. Loan repayment benefits must be substantial to offset education borrowing costs. Taxation on benefits makes programs less appealing. Short-term programs may lead to turnover, creating an unstable workforce. Concerns include whether individuals would enter a field without student loan debt. Loan forgiveness programs assume debt influences career choices. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are based on the assumption that student loan debt influences career decisions. However, research shows that career choices are complex and debt may not always be a significant factor. Other deterrents, such as lower compensation and geographic limitations, also impact employment decisions. For example, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program offers benefits to physicians who work in specific areas, but factors like compensation levels can still deter them from entering primary care. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program (NHSCLRP) provides loan repayment benefits to physicians in primary care in specific areas. Factors like lower compensation, preference for specialties, and debt levels influence career decisions. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to address these challenges, but may not always be effective. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to address challenges in career choice influenced by debt levels. However, the financial inducement provided may not fully compensate for the lower lifetime earnings in fields like primary care compared to specialties. Studies show that high levels of debt do influence job choice, as seen in the influence of law school debt on legal practice. High levels of loan debt can impact job choice, leading individuals to pursue higher-paying jobs to offset their debt. Research shows that graduates with high levels of debt are more likely to work in sectors with higher salaries, such as large law firms, rather than lower-paying fields like education or non-profit organizations. This trend is also seen in undergraduates, where higher debt levels lead to career choices focused on higher income opportunities. Some studies suggest that law school debt levels may not heavily influence career choices for graduates, with demographic factors playing a more significant role. Loan repayment programs may not impact career decisions, and there is a question of whether debt relief programs encourage students to take on more student loans for their education expenses. The issue of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs revolves around whether these programs incentivize students to rely more on student loans for their education expenses. Programs like income-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness offer debt relief after a certain period of capped payments based on income. Monthly payments are limited to a percentage of discretionary income, with the possibility of full loan forgiveness under certain conditions. Some argue that tying monthly payments to income and not debt may make the size of the debt irrelevant to borrowers, potentially encouraging over-borrowing. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits under programs like income-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness may lead to students being less sensitive to the cost of education. The PSLF program allows individuals to receive forgiveness benefits by repaying loans under an IDR plan for 10 years while working in public service. This results in costs to the federal government, including loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. Loan forgiveness programs are part of federal credit programs for federal budgeting purposes. The federal student loan programs offer benefits incorporated into loan terms, classified as federal credit programs. These programs include the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program and the Federal Family Education Loan program. Loan subsidy costs are funded through mandatory appropriations, measured based on estimated long-term costs to the government. The federal budget reflects the costs of making or guaranteeing loans, including the subsidy cost of loans and administrative costs. Loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, discounted to the time of loan disbursement. A positive loan subsidy cost indicates a cost to the government in providing the loan subsidy to borrowers. Loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, discounted to the time of loan disbursement. A positive cost means a cost to the government, while a negative cost indicates a positive return. Loan forgiveness benefits increase subsidy costs, such as Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers discharging a portion of borrowers' loan balance. Loan forgiveness benefits, like Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers, discharge a portion of borrowers' loan balance, leading to an increase in loan subsidy costs for programs such as the Direct Loan program. Other examples include the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and loan forgiveness after the maximum repayment period. Loan forgiveness benefits increase loan subsidy costs for federal credit programs like the Direct Loan program. Programs such as PSLF, IBR, and ICR offer loan forgiveness after a set repayment period. Funding for borrower benefits is allocated through discretionary or mandatory appropriations. Loan repayment benefits are available through discretionary or mandatory appropriations, with funding limitations that may not extend benefits to all eligible borrowers. Examples include GESLR, JRJ, and NHSCLRP programs. Perkins Loan Cancellation funding is provided differently. The Perkins Loan Cancellation program is funded through discretionary appropriations, unlike other loan forgiveness programs. Funding for Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits is authorized through discretionary appropriations, with the last appropriation made in FY2009. The Perkins Loan Cancellation program is funded through discretionary appropriations. While funding was last appropriated in FY2009, qualified borrowers have had their loans canceled without reimbursement. Institutions have absorbed the costs of loan cancellation without federal government reimbursement. The ED maintains a record of eligible reimbursement amounts for institutions. The costs of administering loan forgiveness and repayment programs are funded separately from programmatic costs. Administrative costs for federal credit programs are accounted for separately and funded through annual appropriations. Different agencies administer loan repayment programs with varying methods of funding administrative costs. Limited information is available on how administrative costs are funded for ED programs administered by Federal Student Aid. Loan repayment programs are administered by various agencies with different methods of funding administrative costs. Limited information is available on the actual costs of loan forgiveness and repayment programs, with estimates provided for future benefits. Cost estimates for loan forgiveness programs where benefits have not yet been realized are discussed. In loan repayment programs, information is available on benefits provided and recipients. Cost estimates for loan forgiveness programs are discussed, with details on debt relief and recipients in some programs. For the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, estimated government costs were $1.5 billion over FY2008-FY2012. The Reduction and Access Act of 2007 estimated a cost of $1.5 billion over FY2008-FY2012 for loan forgiveness programs. Approximately 6 million borrowers will be eligible for the REPAYE plan, costing $15.4 billion. The availability of the REPAYE plan would cost approximately $15.4 billion, with an estimated 2 million borrowers choosing to enroll. The Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) repayment plan was estimated to cost $2.1 billion over a 10-year period, with approximately 1.67 million borrowers opting for the plan. Around 400,000 borrowers were projected to receive loan forgiveness through public service loan forgiveness or after 20 years of repayment, with an average original loan balance of $39,500. Borrowers under the PAYE plan would have an average of $41,000 in loans due to paying only interest and no principal. In 2012, ED estimated that 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts would choose the IBR plan, but did not provide estimates on forgiveness benefits. For pre-July 1, 2014 borrowers, 126,000 from the FY2009 cohort were estimated to repay under IBR, with 44,000 having some loan forgiveness after 25 years. For the FY2012 cohort, 146,000 borrowers were estimated to repay under IBR. For the FY2009 loan cohort, 126,000 borrowers are expected to repay under IBR, with 44,000 receiving loan forgiveness after 25 years. The FY2012 cohort is estimated to have 146,000 borrowers on IBR, with 52,000 potentially receiving debt forgiveness. Congress may need to review federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs for potential changes. Congress may need to review federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs to determine if changes are necessary. Issues such as the availability of multiple programs, potential financial windfalls for borrowers, and the effectiveness of existing programs should be examined. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may overlap if they have similar goals and activities. Multiple student loan forgiveness and repayment programs may overlap if they have the same goals and activities, potentially leading to unnecessary administrative costs. Some borrowers could receive benefits from multiple programs for the same service, raising questions about the effectiveness and efficiency of these programs. Some student loan forgiveness and repayment programs may allow recipients to qualify for benefits from multiple sources for the same service performed. For example, an individual working in a federal agency could receive benefits from the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment program (up to $10,000 per year) and qualify for forgiveness of the remainder of their student loan debt after 10 years of service under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Some student loan forgiveness programs may overlap, allowing individuals to receive benefits from multiple sources for the same service. This can result in receiving benefits under two programs for the same federal government service, or the federal government funding administrative costs for two separate programs serving the same purpose or group of people. For example, the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) provides repayment benefits to nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools, while the Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) also offers similar benefits. The Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and the Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) both provide repayment benefits to nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. The NFLRP grants money to nursing schools to establish their own loan repayment programs, creating an administrative burden on the HRSA. The Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) may be creating an administrative burden on HRSA by offering double benefits to the same group of individuals. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing these programs to avoid duplication and ensure efficient use of resources. Loan forgiveness programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter specific fields, but they could also result in windfalls for some individuals. Loan forgiveness programs, such as the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, offer benefits to individuals entering certain fields. Concerns have been raised about the potential for individuals to borrow large amounts, especially under non-need-based PLUS Loans. Concerns have been raised about the potential for individuals to borrow large amounts, especially under non-need-based PLUS Loans, which may lead to situations where individuals borrow more than they would otherwise, knowing that loan forgiveness is possible. Congress may need to consider setting limits on forgiveness amounts. Some research suggests that individuals may choose certain fields or positions for reasons other than loan forgiveness.

Insufficient data are available to assess the programs' effectiveness due to limited programmatic data and the long period required to qualify for benefits. Limited data is available for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs due to the long period required to qualify for benefits.

Borrowers first became eligible to apply for forgiveness benefits under this program on October 1, 2017, so little is known about the forgiveness benefits received.

Loan forgiveness and repayment programs, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, require borrowers to remain employed in public service jobs for a specified period and make monthly payments. However, data on program participants is limited as borrowers are not required to document their employment, making it challenging to track their eligibility for benefits. Additionally, longitudinal data on participants beyond program administration needs is often not collected, making it difficult to verify continued employment in qualifying positions. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs, like the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, lack sufficient data on participants beyond program administration needs. This makes it challenging to track eligibility for benefits and verify continued employment in qualifying positions. Improved data collection and reporting are necessary to assess program effects and potential design changes for better effectiveness. Variations exist in the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for debt relief across different programs.

Concerns have been raised about over-borrowing due to loan forgiveness programs. Should limits be set on the amount or type of student loan debt eligible for relief?
