    "content": "Both House and Senate bills competing to become the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address issues related to detainees at Guantanamo Bay and hostilities against Al Qaeda. H.R. 1540 passed the House in May 2011, focusing on counterterrorism, while Senate bills S. 1253 and S. 1867 address detainee matters. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, incorporating its provisions into H.R. 1540. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, incorporating its provisions into H.R. 1540. The White House has criticized aspects of the bill and threatened to veto any legislation that challenges the President's authorities in collecting intelligence and prosecuting terrorists. The report provides an analysis of the House- and Senate-passed bills regarding military detention of certain persons and detainee transfer from U.S. custody. Both bills aim to confirm or expand the detention authority granted to the President after 9/11 through the Authorization for Use of Military Force. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Congress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), granting the President authority to use force against those involved in the attacks. Many captured individuals have been detained to prevent future terrorist activities, with some facing trial in military or civilian courts. The 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld was a significant Supreme Court decision in this context. The 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld recognized the President's authority to detain enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, as a necessary incident to the AUMF. Subsequent judicial activity in the D.C. Circuit has focused on defining the scope of detention authority conferred by the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit has been handling habeas petitions from Guantanamo detainees challenging their detention under the AUMF. Court rulings have mostly favored the government's position on detention authority. Congress has not passed any laws to clarify the AUMF's scope of detention authority. The Supreme Court may review these rulings in the future. The D.C. Circuit has endorsed the government's interpretation of the AUMF for military detention. Post-AUMF legislation has guided the court in determining who can be detained, including those associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Most detainees under the AUMF are combatants. The AUMF allows for the detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad. Most detainees are held at Guantanamo Bay or in Parwan, Afghanistan. Future captures outside of Afghanistan are handled on an ad hoc basis. The AUMF allows for the detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad. Most detainees are held at Guantanamo Bay or in Parwan, Afghanistan. In cases of persons arrested in the United States for terrorist activity, they are usually prosecuted in federal court instead of being placed in military detention. There have been rare instances where individuals were transferred to military custody and labeled as \"enemy combatants\". The detainees labeled as \"enemy combatants\" were a U.S. citizen arrested for alleged Taliban involvement and a legal resident accused of being an Al Qaeda \"sleeper agent\". They were transferred back to civil authorities for trial in federal court amid uncertainty over their military detention's legality. Controversy surrounds the handling of suspected terrorists in U.S. custody. There is ongoing controversy over the appropriate method for handling suspected terrorists and belligerents in U.S. custody, with debates between military custody, civilian law enforcement, or executive discretion for each case. The controversy over handling suspected terrorists and belligerents in U.S. custody has led to debates on the appropriate model to employ, with disagreements on whether executive discretion or specific legislative measures should be used. Congress passed funding restrictions to prevent the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the U.S. for criminal prosecution, extending the prohibition through FY2012. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 extends the prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees into the United States for criminal prosecution through FY2012. This restriction effectively limits prosecution options to military commissions as no civilian court operates at Guantanamo. Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali national, was brought to the U.S. to face charges in 2011. Some terrorist suspects apprehended by U.S. authorities faced controversy over whether they should be held in military or civilian custody. Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali national, was brought to the U.S. in 2011 to face terrorism-related charges in a civilian court after being detained on a U.S. naval vessel for interrogation. Other cases, like Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad, also sparked debate on the appropriate handling of suspects. The Administration faced criticism for bringing civilian charges against Iraqi refugees suspected of insurgent activities in Iraq. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the handling of persons apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda, with provisions in H.R. 1540 defining the conflict's scope and imposing restrictions on transferring wartime detainees to the U.S. H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives, reaffirms the conflict with Al Qaeda, imposes restrictions on detainee transfers, and requires foreign nationals involved in terrorist offenses to be tried by military commission. The White House criticized the detainee provisions and threatened to veto any bill challenging executive authority. The White House criticized detainee provisions in S. 1253, threatening to veto any bill challenging executive authority. The bill authorized detention of certain persons, required military detention for some, regulated status determinations, periodic review proceedings for Guantanamo detainees, and made funding restrictions on detainee transfers permanent. Senate Majority Leader Reid delayed consideration of the bill due to objections from the White House and Senate committees. The Senate passed S. 1867 with revised detainee provisions despite objections from the White House and Department of Defense. The bill clarified that it did not modify existing authorities regarding the detention of U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens. The Senate passed S. 1867 with an amendment clarifying detainee provisions, affirming authority to detain persons captured in conflict with Al Qaeda without modifying existing authorities for U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens. The bill was later amended into H.R. 1540. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities on detainee matters in the FY2012 NDAA is being considered in conference. The scope of detention authority under the AUMF and current practices for initial status determinations are addressed. The FY2012 NDAA addresses the scope of detention authority under the AUMF and current practices for initial status determinations and periodic reviews of detainee cases. The Obama Administration's detention authority under the AUMF is not clearly defined and can be subject to differing interpretations. The Obama Administration's detention authority under the AUMF is not clearly defined and can be subject to differing interpretations. The President has the authority to detain persons involved in the 9/11 attacks, Taliban, or al-Qaida forces. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" raises questions due to its indeterminate breadth. The AUMF grants the executive detention authority over individuals involved in belligerent acts or supporting enemy forces like Al Qaeda or the Taliban. However, the inclusion of \"associated forces\" and the criteria of \"substantial support\" raise questions about the extent of this authority. The government has not clarified when indefinite detention under the law of war applies solely based on support to a belligerent force. The government has not clarified the criteria for indefinite detention under the law of war based on support to a belligerent force, with recent court decisions providing little clarity on the \"substantial support\" requirement. Recent court decisions have not shed much light on the \"substantial support\" prong of the test to determine detention eligibility, with cases relying on proof that a detainee was part of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or an associated force. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority since 2004, after the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi. The AUMF does not limit the covered organizations to just Al Qaeda or the Taliban. The AUMF does not limit the covered organizations to just Al Qaeda or the Taliban, allowing for detention of individuals associated with other groups in Afghanistan. The US has authority to detain individuals who would be detainable under principles of co-belligerency in a traditional international armed conflict. This authority was demonstrated in the detention of Chinese Uighur dissidents captured in Afghanistan as members of an \"associated force.\" The D.C. Circuit rejected the government's argument in Parhat v. Gates that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" The court found the evidence did not support the petitioner's association with al Qaida or the Taliban, so it did not address the issue of being part of or supporting \"forces\" engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The court in Parhat v. Gates rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant\" due to lack of evidence supporting association with al Qaida or the Taliban. The government's definition of \"associated force\" was questioned, requiring a close operational nexus in the current armed conflict. The court in Parhat v. Gates rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM alone made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant\" without evidence of ties to al Qaida or the Taliban. The definition of \"associated force\" was scrutinized for requiring a closer operational connection in the current armed conflict. The evidence presented did not establish ETIM's sufficient connection to Al Qaeda as an \"associated force,\" suggesting a need for further development in defining the term through concrete cases. The government is working on defining \"associated forces\" further through application to specific cases in habeas cases. Examples include \"Zubayda's militia\" assisting Osama bin Laden and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin supporting attacks against coalition forces. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the detention of a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the detention of a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade, which supported attacks against coalition forces. There is uncertainty about the scope of detention authority under the AUMF for individuals captured outside of Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens or those with ties to the United States. The AUMF permits detention of individuals captured outside of Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens or those with ties to the United States. The D.C. Circuit and Fourth Circuit have upheld military detention of individuals designated as enemy combatants by the executive branch. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and a resident alien captured in the United States as enemy combatants. The Pentagon established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) in response to Supreme Court decisions in 2004 related to \"enemy combatants.\" The Pentagon established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) to determine detainee status at Guantanamo based on enemy belligerency. CSRTs confirmed 539 enemy combatants between 2004 and 2009. The process has been largely inactive since 2007, but new detainees may still go through a CSRT. The CSRT process at Guantanamo has been inactive since 2007, with few new detainees brought in. Non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan have a different review process with fewer rights. While Guantanamo detainees can challenge their detention in federal court, this privilege does not extend to detainees in Afghanistan. President Obama created task forces to study these issues shortly after taking office. The Obama Administration created task forces to study Guantanamo detention issues. A new review system was implemented for detainees at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. The process for determining the status of detainees captured in hostilities remains unclear. The Obama Administration established a review process for detainees at Guantanamo through Executive Order 13567, including the creation of a Periodic Review Board to assess the need for continued detention based on security threats. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the need for continued detention of individuals at Guantanamo based on security threats. If continued detention is not warranted, efforts will be made to transfer detainees outside the United States. An initial review must occur within a year of the order's issuance. The executive order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the need for continued detention of individuals at Guantanamo based on security threats. A review of each individual covered by the order must occur within a year, with the detainee and his representative able to challenge the government's basis for detention. The process is discretionary and does not create additional detention authority. Congress has placed limits on detainee transfers due to concerns about potential terrorist activity post-release. Concerns about detainees released from Guantanamo engaging in terrorist activities have led Congress to restrict transfers, requiring certification of preventive measures in the destination country. Post-release detainee activities are classified, but some have been involved in terrorism. Debate surrounds the significance of these activities and the policy implications, with differing views on continued detention without trial. The Pentagon reported that some former Guantanamo detainees engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda after their release in 2007. Researchers at Seton Hall University challenged these numbers, citing discrepancies in the data and lack of identifying information for verification. The debate continues on whether remaining prisoners should be transferred or detained without trial. Researchers at Seton Hall University questioned the Pentagon's classification of former Guantanamo detainees' activities as \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement,\" pointing out discrepancies in the data and lack of identifying information for verification. They suggested that post-release terrorist behavior could be due to radicalization during internment, rather than prior involvement in terrorist activities. The Defense Intelligence Agency reported in 2008 that 36 ex-Guantanamo detainees were confirmed or suspected of engaging in deadly activities after their release. The Defense Intelligence Agency reported in 2008 that 36 ex-Guantanamo detainees engaged in deadly activities post-release. In 2009, the Pentagon reported that 74 out of 534 transferred prisoners were believed to have participated in terrorism or militant activities. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of National Intelligence to release a report on recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees, which was published in December 2010. The report released in December 2010 assessed recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees. Of the 598 transferred detainees, 81 were confirmed and 69 suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. Out of 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are deceased, 54 in custody, and 83 at large. Since Executive Order 13492, 66 detainees were transferred, with 2 confirmed and 3 suspected of terrorist activities. The report excludes detainees based solely on anti-U.S. statements or writings. Since Executive Order 13492, 66 Guantanamo detainees were transferred, with 2 confirmed and 3 suspected of terrorist activities. The accuracy of recidivism numbers has been questioned, with estimates suggesting a higher threat level. Intelligence data discrepancies make it challenging to explain the differences in reported recidivism rates. Despite this, there is a consensus that the number of released detainees engaging in terrorism has increased. The House of Representatives passed subtitle D of title X of H.R. 1540 on May 26, 2011, which defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-U.S. citizens or non-U.S. Armed Forces members held at Guantanamo under the Department of Defense's control since March 7, 2011. The term is not limited to those detained under the AUMF authority. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" is broadly defined to include non-U.S. citizens or non-U.S. Armed Forces members held at Guantanamo under the Department of Defense's control since March 7, 2011, without limiting it to those detained under the AUMF authority. The provision aims to cover detainees held at Guantanamo who are not enemy belligerents but remain under DOD supervision until their transfer or release. The term \"effective control\" of the Department of Defense is not clearly defined, potentially covering situations where detainees are technically in the custody of another agency while still under DOD supervision. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" is broadly defined to include non-U.S. citizens or non-U.S. Armed Forces members held at Guantanamo under the Department of Defense's control. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 allows guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions. It permits the death penalty in cases where the accused has pled guilty, as long as the military commission panel members unanimously approve the sentence. Additionally, pre-trial agreements can now reduce the maximum sentence, but a military judge alone cannot impose the death penalty. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 allows guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, with the death penalty permitted if approved unanimously by the panel. Section 1034 affirms the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and grants the President authority to detain captured belligerents. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to use necessary force in the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and detain captured belligerents until hostilities end. This provision is the most controversial in the bill, with supporters arguing it simply confirms the President's powers. The President's authority under the AUMF includes the power to detain belligerents, including those associated with Al Qaeda, until the end of hostilities. This provision in H.R. 1540 is contentious, with supporters arguing it confirms the armed conflict's evolution since the 2001 AUMF, while opponents fear it expands the conflict to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda. The proposed language in H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority under the AUMF to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda, without geographical or time limitations. Some view this as significant, as it goes beyond the executive branch's characterization of the conflict. The proposed language in H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority under the AUMF to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda, without geographical or time limitations. This goes beyond the executive branch's characterization of the conflict by identifying belligerent parties not only directly engaged in hostilities against the United States but also those who have supported hostilities in aid of these entities. The requirement for entities in subparagraph 3(B) to engage in or support hostilities suggests a nexus to armed hostilities, while the use of the past tense could imply that entities could be deemed belligerents even if their support is no longer ongoing. The proposed language in H.R. 1540 expands the President's authority under the AUMF to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda, without geographical or time limitations. It identifies belligerent parties engaged in or supporting hostilities against the United States, potentially allowing for targeting decisions or other operations. The legislative history suggests Section 1034 is not meant to significantly expand the conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations. The legislative history of H.R. 1540 indicates that Section 1034 reaffirms the current interpretation of the AUMF in habeas litigation involving wartime detainees. It acknowledges the evolving terrorist threat from Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations, emphasizing the continued grave threat to U.S. national security. The committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force, acknowledging the ongoing threat posed by Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. This affirmation does not limit the President's existing authority under the AUMF, and remains consistent with Congress's intent. The term \"associated forces\" is construed to include armed organizations fighting alongside the Taliban. The Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force remains consistent with Congress's intent. The term \"associated forces\" includes armed organizations fighting alongside the Taliban or Al Qaeda. The language in H.R. 1540 Section 1034 may not expand the authority to use force beyond that already permitted under the AUMF. Congress's codification of the language without further definition could supersede the AUMF interpretation. The language in paragraph (3) of H.R. 1540 echoes the criteria used by Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo for detaining individuals associated with Taliban or Al Qaeda forces. It also applies to nations and organizations involved in the conflict, potentially leading to different interpretations in habeas cases. The White House strongly objects to section 1034 of H.R. 1540, arguing that it could recharacterize the scope of the conflict and create confusion. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a review process for Guantanamo detainees to determine the necessity of continued military detention for national security. The periodic review process under Section 1036 requires military officers to assess the need for continued detention of Guantanamo detainees for national security. It includes stringent criteria and limits on private counsel assistance. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 180 days on establishing this review process. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 180 days on establishing a process to periodically review the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. The review process involves full reviews every three years and limited reviews annually, conducted by a panel of military officers with expertise in operations, intelligence, and counterterrorism. Detainees undergoing trial or with court-ordered release are exempt from the review. The review process for Guantanamo detainees involves a panel of military officers conducting full reviews every three years and limited reviews annually. The detainee is entitled to be assisted by a military representative with the appropriate security clearance, present a statement, introduce evidence, respond to questions, and call witnesses. They are provided with an unclassified summary of information the panel will consider before the hearing. The detainee is provided with information before a hearing, including mitigating details. The detainee's representative receives the government's submission. Outside parties can submit written information with detainee's authorization. Annual file reviews consider new information on the threat posed by the individual. Relevant information must be provided by submitting officials. The military panel reviews new information on the threat posed by Guantanamo detainees to determine if continued internment is necessary. Factors considered include the likelihood of terrorist activity upon release, reestablishing ties with hostile organizations, behavior in custody, and information reviewed by officials. The interagency review board, composed of senior officials from various government departments, is responsible for reviewing the military panel's assessment of Guantanamo detainees to ensure accuracy and can reject recommendations if necessary. The interagency review board, consisting of officials from different government departments, reviews the military panel's assessment of Guantanamo detainees for accuracy. It can reject recommendations by majority vote and find a suitable country for transfer based on various factors. The interagency review board evaluates Guantanamo detainees for transfer based on factors like housing facility, prosecution ability, and humane treatment assurances. Rejected recommendations can be reevaluated or forwarded to the Secretary of Defense for approval. The detainee has no right to seek redress in U.S. courts. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540 potentially leading to a presidential veto. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540 potentially leading to a presidential veto due to its impact on the periodic review process and interference with DOD's detention operations. Section 1039 limits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody. Section 1039 restricts the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody, particularly prohibiting their transfer into the United States. This limitation was enacted in response to the Obama Administration's plan to close the Guantanamo detention facility. The 2012 Minibus funding measures prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. These restrictions were motivated by plans to transfer detainees for trial in civilian courts, making military commissions the only viable option. Sheik Mohammed and other Guantanamo detainees cannot be transferred to the US for trial in civilian courts due to funding restrictions. Military commissions remain the only option for prosecution until the end of FY2012. Section 1039 of H.R. 1540 broadens the detainee category covered by funding restrictions, including those held at foreign locations under the AUMF. Section 1039 of H.R. 1540 expands funding restrictions to include non-citizen detainees held at foreign locations under the AUMF, prohibiting their transfer or release into the United States. This restriction differs from current law and would expire at the end of FY2012, while other provisions in H.R. 1540 extend beyond that timeframe. The White House strongly opposes Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which prohibits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held at foreign locations under the AUMF into the United States. The Obama Administration argues that this measure interferes with executive discretion to prosecute detainees in Article III courts in the U.S., posing a challenge to critical Executive branch authority. The White House opposes Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which limits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad into the United States. This measure challenges Executive branch authority to prosecute detainees in U.S. courts, hindering counterterrorism efforts and national security. Additionally, Section 1037 prohibits the use of funds to construct or modify facilities in the U.S. for Guantanamo detainees. Section 1040 of H.R. 1540 restricts funds for the Department of Defense from transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries, except under certain conditions like a court order for release. These restrictions are similar to those in previous defense authorization acts. The restrictions in Section 1040 of H.R. 1540 prevent the Department of Defense from transferring or releasing Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries without specific conditions. These restrictions aim to address concerns about potential recidivism among released detainees. Critics argue that the restrictions are too strict and hinder the executive's ability to transfer low-risk detainees. Since the implementation of these restrictions in 2011, no Guantanamo detainee has been transferred or released from U.S. custody. Since the implementation of restrictions in 2011, no Guantanamo detainee has been transferred or released from U.S. custody. The Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress before a transfer can occur, ensuring the destination country is not a sponsor of terrorism and can effectively control the detainee. The Secretary of Defense must certify that the facility housing a transferred detainee is secure and can prevent future threats. The destination country must agree to share information and allow access to the detainee if requested. These requirements mirror those considered for continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. Section 1040 sets certification requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees, including the need for the receiving country to allow access to the detainee if requested. The White House opposes these restrictions on detainee transfers. The White House opposes restrictions on detainee transfers from Guantanamo, citing interference with foreign policy decisions. Section 1035 mandates the Secretary of Defense to submit a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees' communications within 90 days. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a detailed national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees' communications within 90 days. The protocol must outline limitations and privileges for detainees regarding legal representation, communications, information receipt, contraband possession, and enforcement measures. Monitoring procedures for legal materials and communications are also required to protect national security while preserving detainee privileges for military commission trials or habeas proceedings. Additionally, DOD funds in FY2012 cannot be used to allow family visits for Guantanamo detainees. Section 1038 of the protocol prohibits DOD funds in FY2012 from allowing family visits for Guantanamo detainees. Section 1043 restricts repatriated detainees to Micronesia, Palau, or Marshall Islands from receiving benefits under the Compact of Free Association. Repatriation refers to returning a person to their home country, not applicable to former detainees resettled in these countries. Section 1043 restricts repatriated detainees to Micronesia, Palau, or Marshall Islands from receiving benefits under the Compact of Free Association. This provision does not apply to former Guantanamo detainees resettled in these countries, but it does apply to citizens of these countries who were detained at Guantanamo and then returned home. Section 1042 requires consultation before prosecuting non-citizens for offenses that could be tried by military commission. Section 1042 mandates consultation with high-level officials before prosecuting non-citizens for offenses that could be tried by military commission, involving decisions on venue and custody. The White House opposes this provision, citing existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. The White House opposes Section 1042, which mandates consultation with high-level officials before prosecuting non-citizens for terrorism-related offenses. It claims that existing interagency coordination would be undermined by requiring institutions to assume unfamiliar roles, potentially causing delays in taking individuals posing imminent threats into custody. Section 1046 requires foreign nationals engaged in terrorism-related conduct to be tried only by military commission, without defining its terms. The provision in question applies to offenses related to terrorist attacks within the United States or against U.S. government property or personnel abroad, but lacks clear definitions. It is uncertain if the provision covers prospective attacks that are not carried out. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian accused of attempting to destroy an airliner in 2009, may provide insight into how the provision could be applied to failed attacks. The provision in question applies to offenses related to terrorist attacks within the United States or against U.S. government property or personnel abroad. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian suspect accused of trying to destroy an airliner in 2009, may provide insight into how the provision could be applied to failed attacks. It would need to be established that the \"offense\" related to the \"attack\" is one that can be tried by military commission pursuant to the MCA, and that the accused is subject to the jurisdiction of such a military commission. The attempted use of an explosive device to bring down a civilian aircraft seems amenable to prosecution under criminal prohibitions over which military commissions have jurisdiction. The accused must have a connection to opposing forces in an armed conflict for military commission jurisdiction to apply. The accused must also be a non-U.S. citizen and an unprivileged enemy belligerent. The criteria for a military commission to have jurisdiction over an accused include being a non-U.S. citizen and an unprivileged enemy belligerent. This definition excludes individuals who qualify for prisoner of war status under the Third Geneva Convention. The bill does not specify how these criteria are determined. Military commissions have the authority to determine their own jurisdiction. The bill does not specify how criteria for determining unprivileged enemy belligerent status are to be determined. Military commissions or Article III courts could make jurisdictional determinations. The provision may complicate extradition or trial of terrorism suspects. The provision in the bill may complicate extradition or trial of terrorism suspects, especially for foreign nationals in U.S. custody. It does not specify how criteria for determining unprivileged enemy belligerent status are to be determined, potentially leading to challenges, particularly for those in the United States. The bill does not preclude trials in Article III courts or require military commission trials for the individuals it describes. The bill may complicate extradition or trial of terrorism suspects, especially for foreign nationals in U.S. custody. It does not specify how criteria for determining unprivileged enemy belligerent status are to be determined, potentially leading to challenges. The bill does not preclude trials in Article III courts or require military commission trials for the individuals it describes. A determination may be subject to habeas challenge, but the provision allows for broader discretion among executive branch officials over prosecutorial decisions. Section 1042 allows broader executive branch discretion in prosecutorial decisions compared to Section 1046. Challenges to Article III court jurisdiction could arise if a federal criminal offense is charged. If a trial before a military commission is impeded, a criminal trial may not be possible, especially if a defendant is extradited from a country that does not permit trial by a military court. Executive branch officials criticize the provision for limiting their discretion in choosing the appropriate prosecution forum. Section 1032 extends the authority to offer rewards for information or assistance to individuals for two years, up to $5 million. Section 1032 extends the authority to offer rewards for information or assistance to individuals for two years, up to $5 million, and moves the related reporting requirement to February. Section 1041 requires quarterly briefings on global Department of Defense counterterrorism operations to include legal issues and limitations. Section 1044 approves DOD anti-terrorism efforts. Section 1045 of the Department of Defense counterterrorism operations requires improved interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups. The President must issue planning guidance identifying geographic areas of concern and provide goals for each area, agency roles, and gaps in U.S. capabilities. The guidance must be reviewed and updated as needed, with copies submitted to Congress within 15 days of completion. The President is required to issue planning guidance for counterterrorism operations, identifying areas of concern, agency roles, and gaps in U.S. capabilities. The guidance must be reviewed and updated as necessary, with copies submitted to Congress within 15 days. Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" and was passed with amendments on December 1, 2011. S. 1867, passed by the Senate on December 1, 2011, clarified detainee provisions and affirmed the legal authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The bill's language was incorporated into H.R. 1540. Section 1031 of S. 1867 authorizes the U.S. Armed Forces to detain \"covered persons\" as unprivileged enemy belligerents under the law of war. The bill passed by the Senate clarified detainee provisions and affirmed the legal authority for the U.S. Armed Forces to detain \"covered persons\" as unprivileged enemy belligerents under the law of war. It defines \"covered persons\" as those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting enemy forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. The Senate bill affirmed the legal authority for the U.S. Armed Forces to detain \"covered persons\" involved in 9/11 attacks or supporting enemy forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. The earlier version of Section 1031 in S. 1253 authorized detention of covered persons captured in hostilities under the AUMF. The White House objected to limiting detentions to those captured during military operations. The White House objected to language in the Senate bill related to detainment of \"covered persons\" under the AUMF, as it could limit detentions to those captured during military operations. Section 1031 of the bill allows for various options for dispositions under the law of war, including detention without trial, trial by military commission, or transfer to another court or foreign entity. It does not clarify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens are considered \"covered persons.\" Section 1031 of the bill allows for various options for dispositions under the law of war, including detention without trial, trial by military commission, or transfer to another court or foreign entity. It does not clarify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens are considered \"covered persons.\" S. 1867 provides that nothing in Section 1031 \"is intended to limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force.\" The revised provision of S. 1867, as reported out of committee, aimed to reinforce the executive branch's view of its detention authority under the AUMF. There was significant debate on the potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens and an amendment was adopted to add a proviso to Section 1031. The floor debate on S. 1867 included consideration of an amendment regarding long-term military detention of U.S. citizens, which was rejected. An amendment was adopted to clarify that Section 1031 does not affect existing law on detention of U.S. citizens or resident aliens. This provision aims to maintain the executive's authority for detentions, which have been rare and contentious in the courts. The detention of individuals captured in the United States has been rare and controversial, with no definitive resolution in the courts. While the Supreme Court has ruled on military detention of individuals captured in Afghanistan, the circumstances for those captured elsewhere remain unclear. Section 1031 does not clarify the rules for detaining U.S. citizens or residents in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The criteria for detaining individuals in the U.S. under the AUMF have not been conclusively determined. The revised provision in S. 1867 does not provide additional clarification on terms like \"substantial support\" or \"associated forces,\" potentially allowing for a broadening of the conflict scope. However, it does require the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the provision applies to \"covered persons.\" This may necessitate an ongoing assessment of entities considered to be involved. The revised Section 1031 in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the provision applies to \"covered persons,\" potentially necessitating an ongoing assessment of entities involved. The Administration has not raised specific objections but cautions against codifying existing authorities, warning of unintended consequences that could compromise national security efforts. The current language in the legislation aims to minimize risks in military detention authority, specifically focusing on Section 1032 which requires temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces. This provision excludes U.S. citizens but applies to U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities. The Administration cautions against unintended consequences that could compromise national security efforts. The legislation aims to minimize risks in military detention authority by requiring temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces. It excludes U.S. citizens but applies to U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities. The mandatory detention requirement applies to covered persons captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF, defining \"covered persons\" as those who are determined to be part of Al Qaeda or an associated force and have participated in planning or carrying out an attack against the United States or its coalition partners. The legislation requires military detention for certain individuals associated with Al Qaeda who have participated in attacks against the US or its allies. These individuals can be held in military custody, tried before a military commission, transferred to another court, or transferred to a foreign government, subject to specific requirements. The bill allows for the transfer of individuals associated with Al Qaeda to military custody, trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign government if certain requirements are met. It specifies that covered forces are those that act in coordination with or under the direction of Al Qaeda, without explicitly mentioning the Taliban. The bill allows for the transfer of individuals associated with Al Qaeda to military custody, trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign government if certain requirements are met. It specifies that covered forces are those that act in coordination with or under the direction of Al Qaeda. This raises questions about whether all members of an associated force would be subject to mandatory detention, or only those involved in coordinating activities with Al Qaeda. The determination could be based on the specific attack the individual is involved in. For example, captured Taliban insurgents not suspected of Al Qaeda cooperation could be turned over to the Afghan government without certification, while a Taliban member engaged in planning an attack with Al Qaeda would be subject to mandatory detention. The bill allows for the transfer of individuals associated with Al Qaeda to military custody, trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign government if certain requirements are met. It raises questions about whether all members of an associated force would be subject to mandatory detention, or only those involved in coordinating activities with Al Qaeda. The term \"attack\" is not clearly defined, leaving room for interpretation on what constitutes an attack against the United States or coalition partners. The provision in the bill allows for military detention of persons captured during hostilities, including potential detention of lawful resident aliens based on conduct in the US. It is unclear if attacks against civilian targets elsewhere would qualify as an \"attack against the United States.\" The mandatory detention requirement is related to hostilities authorized by the AUMF and may not apply to insurgents targeting US or coalition forces in Iraq. S. 1867 includes a new requirement for the President to submit to Congress, within 60 days of enactment, a report describing the procedures for implementing the provision, including designating who is authorized to determine a covered person and preventing interruption of ongoing surveillance. The procedures for implementing the provision in S. 1867 include designating authorized personnel to determine a covered person and preventing the interruption of ongoing surveillance or intelligence gathering. Other procedures involve preventing interruptions during interrogation sessions and transferring a covered person from a third country if necessary. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those under Section 1036. The bill outlines procedures for designating authorized personnel to determine a covered person, preventing interruptions during interrogation sessions, and transferring a covered person from a third country if needed. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those under Section 1036, which requires DOD to submit procedures for status determinations for persons detained under the AUMF. Section 1032 of the bill allows for multiple processes to determine if someone qualifies as a covered person for mandatory military detention. This process may implicate constitutional due process requirements, especially if the detainee is in the United States. It does not prevent Article III trials for covered persons, but time spent in military custody could complicate prosecution. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032 of the bill, as it could complicate prosecution of covered persons and limit counterterrorism tools. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta doubts its advantages for national security and criticizes its failure to clearly limit detention to persons captured abroad. Secretary Panetta and the White House strongly object to Section 1032 of the bill, citing concerns about its impact on national security and the President's authority in defending against terrorist threats. They criticize the provision for not clearly limiting detention to persons captured abroad and for potentially restricting counterterrorism tools. The Administration opposes Section 1032 of the bill, expressing concerns about its impact on national security and the President's authority to defend against terrorist threats. They doubt that the committee revisions will address the fundamental problems and argue that requiring the President to develop procedures does not provide a sufficient solution. Section 1033 of the bill extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries, similar to previous years. It would prohibit the use of DOD funds for transfers unless Congress is notified 30 days prior. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries by prohibiting the use of DOD funds for transfers unless Congress is notified 30 days prior. The certification by the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, ensures the destination country is not a designated state sponsor of terrorism or a designated foreign terrorist organization, maintains control over the detention facility, and has taken measures to avert any threat posed by the individual. The certification requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries include measures to prevent the individual from engaging in terrorism and sharing relevant information with the United States. Unlike H.R. 1540, the Senate bill does not require access to the transferred individual by U.S. authorities. The Senate bill does not require the Secretary of Defense to certify that the receiving foreign entity allows U.S. authorities access to transferred detainees. Transfers from Guantanamo to foreign countries are prohibited if a previously transferred detainee has engaged in terrorist activity, except in cases of pretrial agreements or court orders. The prohibition on transferring detainees from Guantanamo to foreign countries applies unless a detainee has engaged in terrorist activity, with exceptions for pretrial agreements or court orders. The Secretary of Defense can waive certification and recidivism requirements if alternative actions will address the risks. The Secretary may issue a waiver for transferring detainees from Guantanamo if alternative actions mitigate the risk of recidivism. The transfer must be in the national security interests of the United States, with notification to congressional defense committees. Transfer restrictions apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. The Senate bill's transfer restrictions apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" is broad enough to cover foreign refugees at the Migrant Operations Center. The White House has expressed disapproval of the transfer restriction. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of transfer restrictions in the 2012 NDAA. Section 1034 prohibits the use of DOD funds to house Guantanamo detainees in the US without congressional authorization. Similar restrictions were in the 2011 NDAA and CAA. The 2012 NDAA includes restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US without congressional approval, similar to previous years. The Senate bill does not have a provision prohibiting such transfers. The White House objects to these restrictions. The Senate bill on defense authorization does not prohibit transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US, allowing for transfers to civilian law enforcement for prosecution. It also does not prevent the release of cleared detainees into the US, except for continued military detention. Section 1035 addresses Executive Order 13567 on detention reviews at Guantanamo, without seeking to replace the periodic review process established by H.R. 1540. Section 1035 of the Senate bill clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. It emphasizes that reviews are to determine ongoing security threats, not legality of detention. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for final decisions based on panel recommendations. The periodic review process at Guantanamo focuses on assessing if detainees pose a continuing threat to U.S. security. The Secretary of Defense makes final decisions on detainee release or transfer, considering factors like the likelihood of terrorist activity resumption and family support. The Administration opposes this provision as it shifts responsibility from a collaborative interagency review process to the Defense Department. The Administration objects to a provision that shifts responsibility for detainee status determination to the Defense Department. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to report on procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF within 90 days. It is unclear if this refers to determining if a detainee is a \"covered person\" under Section 1031 or their disposition under the law of war. The provision in question pertains to the determination of status for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention, ensuring a military judge presides over proceedings and allowing for representation by military counsel. These requirements apply regardless of the detainee's location, potentially granting detainees in Afghanistan more privileges during status determination hearings. The provision in question pertains to the determination of status for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention, ensuring a military judge presides over proceedings and allowing for representation by military counsel. This may grant detainees in Afghanistan more privileges during status determination hearings, but its impact on Guantanamo detainees and habeas challenges is unclear. The provision under discussion relates to status determination for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention, potentially affecting Guantanamo detainees and their habeas challenges. The implications of Section 1036 on Guantanamo detainees may vary depending on its interpretation and application to detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention under the AUMF. The provision does not clarify how new captures will be determined for long-term detention prior to a status hearing. Prior to the status hearing, it must be determined if a detainee will be held in long-term detention, subject to special requirements. \"Long-term detention\" could mean holding enemy belligerents for the duration of hostilities to prevent their return to combat, allowed under Sections 1031 and 1032 of the bill. However, this raises questions about when the disposition determination should be made and if a second status determination is needed for those designated for long-term detention. Unprivileged enemy belligerents destined for trial or transfer would not have military counsel or a military judge at their status determination proceedings. The status determination process for detainees designated for long-term detention may not involve military counsel or a military judge. Multiple status determinations may be held to change their disposition, such as transferring them to another country or prosecuting them. The status review process under Section 1036 may only apply to detainees already designated for long-term detention. Section 1036 of the MCA may only apply to detainees already designated for long-term detention, while the White House disapproves of the provision, citing conflicts with established military review procedures. Section 1037 allows plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540. Section 1037 of the MCA allows plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540. It does not amend the MCA to insert references to capital cases into existing sections."
