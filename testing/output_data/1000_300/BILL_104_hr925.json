    "content": "The \"Private Property Protection Act of 1995\" ensures that no law or agency action should diminish the value of privately owned property. Federal agencies must exercise authority to prevent such limitations and property owners have the right to compensation. The Federal Government compensates property owners for limitations on property use that decrease its value by 20% or more under regulatory laws. If the value diminishes by over 50%, the government can buy the affected portion. Once compensated, the property cannot be used against the limitation even if it is later rescinded. Compensation paid under this Act cannot be used against the limitation imposed by agency action, even if later rescinded. If the action is rescinded, the owner can refund the compensation to the Treasury and use the property. SEC. 4. EFFECT OF STATE LAW.\n\nIf a use is a nuisance or already prohibited under local zoning, no compensation shall be made under this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. EXCEPTIONS.\n\nNo compensation for actions preventing hazards to health, safety, or specific property damage. No compensation for agency actions under the Federal navigation servitude, except for wetlands.\n\nSEC. 6. PROCEDURE. An owner must request compensation from the agency within 180 days of receiving notice of the agency action. The agency can negotiate the amount with the owner, and if no agreement is reached within 180 days, the owner can choose arbitration or civil action for compensation. Arbitration procedures will be similar to those under title 9, United States Code. The owner has the right to seek compensation through arbitration or civil action if an agreement with the agency is not reached within 180 days. Arbitration procedures will follow those established under title 9, United States Code, and a successful civil action will entitle the owner to attorney's fees and other litigation costs. An owner who prevails in a civil action under this section is entitled to a reasonable attorney's fee, litigation costs, and interest on compensation. Payments to the owner and judgments are to be made from the agency's annual appropriation. If the agency action was due to another agency's requirement, reimbursement may be sought from the other agency's funds. The agency making payment or satisfying judgment may seek reimbursement from another agency's funds. The head of the agency can transfer appropriated funds if needed, and if insufficient funds exist, they must seek appropriation for the next fiscal year. SEC. 7. LIMITATION. Any payment under this Act by the United States is subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\nSEC. 8. DUTY OF NOTICE TO OWNERS. Agencies must provide notice to property owners affected by agency actions limiting property use, explaining their rights and compensation procedures under this Act.\n\nSEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not limit any existing right to compensation under the Constitution or other US laws. Payment under this Act does not grant the Federal Government any additional rights except for use limitations resulting from agency actions.
