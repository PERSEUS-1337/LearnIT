    "content": "The United States is a key player in the global economy, being the largest investor and recipient of foreign direct investment. Its foreign investment policy aims to benefit both the U.S. and foreign investors, with exceptions for national security risks. The Trump Administration has not formally outlined its foreign investment policy but has expressed openness to foreign investment. The United States welcomes foreign investment into its economy, with a global inward foreign direct investment position of around $6.4 trillion in 2016. The Commerce Department publishes data on U.S. direct investment using three different measures. In 2016, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States increased by $876 billion at market value and $390 billion in terms of historical cost and current cost. The total cumulative FDI reached $7.4 trillion at market value. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States increased by $876 billion at market value and $390 billion in terms of historical and current cost in 2016. The total cumulative FDI reached $7.4 trillion at market value. The United Kingdom and Japan often compete as the largest foreign direct investors in the U.S. economy. The drop in FDI in 2014 was due to a $130 billion stock buyback between Verizon and France's Vodafone. Foreign investment in the U.S. and U.S. firms' investments abroad can vary significantly from year to year. In 2014, a $130 billion stock buyback between Verizon and France's Vodafone impacted foreign direct investment in the United States.

Labor productivity in the U.S. manufacturing sector has doubled from 1993 to 2010, outperforming other sectors and advanced economies.

National security-related concerns have become more prominent in investment policies globally, leading to new measures to restrict foreign investment. The United States addresses national security concerns related to foreign acquisitions through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews transactions to determine threats to national security, foreign government control, or impacts on homeland security and critical infrastructure. The CFIUS reviews foreign investment transactions for national security threats, foreign government control, and impacts on homeland security or critical infrastructure. The President can block transactions that threaten national security. The process is voluntary but firms risk future review and possible divestiture if they do not notify CFIUS. Manufacturing accounted for 42% of notified transactions from 2008 to 2014, with finance, information, and services sectors making up 31%. Investments notified to CFIUS from 2008 to 2014 were mainly in manufacturing (42%) and finance, information, and services sectors (31%). Within manufacturing, over 40% were in computer/electronic products. Concerns arise over foreign government-owned firms' increasing international presence and investment activity. The growing international presence and investment activity of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are raising concerns over economic and security implications. An estimated 22% of the world's largest 100 firms are effectively under state control, leading to worries about preferential treatment and anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) with close associations to governments may create anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace, offering market protection and financing advantages. This blurs the line between commercial activities and government objectives, raising concerns about compromising national security. Some policymakers worry that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) engaging in foreign investments may compromise national security. However, the OECD found little evidence that advantages given to SOEs affect their international economic performance.

The performance of foreign-owned establishments compared to US-owned ones shows a historical gap in return on assets, although it has narrowed over time. Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the United States have lower rates of return on assets compared to U.S.-owned firms, but the gap has narrowed over time. This is attributed to age effects and startup costs that diminish over time.

They also exhibit higher capital intensity in more industries than all U.S. establishments. The differences between foreign-owned and U.S. firms should be viewed cautiously due to factors like the size and technology of foreign firms investing in the U.S. Foreign investors tend to choose larger-scale, higher-capital-intensity plants to offset risks of investing abroad. Foreign direct investment in the United States rose sharply in 2015, reflecting a growing economy and rising equity values.

Public concerns over globalization's impact on jobs and the economy will be important factors to consider. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy is expected to increase slightly in 2016. Public concerns revolve around globalization's impact on jobs, with worries about potential job losses from mergers and acquisitions, regardless of whether the acquiring company is foreign or U.S.-owned. Despite these concerns, benefits are seen in capital inflow and the creation of new jobs. Opposition to certain types of foreign direct investment also stems from job security issues. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. is influenced by perceived benefits such as capital inflow and job creation. Concerns about national security and economic impact exist, but the U.S. remains a top destination for foreign investment. As the U.S. economy grows, foreign investment is expected to increase further."
