    "content": "For the first 100 years of the electric power industry, electricity generation was centralized in large power plants. In response to the 1970s energy crisis, Congress promoted distributed generation, including customer-sited generation. One policy to encourage this is net metering, defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 as allowing customers to offset energy provided by the utility with energy generated on-site. State net metering policies, particularly for solar PV, play a significant role in discussions about renewable energy. These policies interact with federal and state incentives to determine the deployment of distributed solar energy sources. Some states have modified their net metering policies in recent years, impacting the deployment pace of distributed generation. Net metering policies interact with federal and state incentives to determine the deployment of distributed solar energy sources. Some states have modified their policies, impacting stakeholders. Congress could choose to restrict, encourage, or require state policy modifications. This report provides background information on net metering policies. Net metering policies determine compensation for electricity delivered to the grid from distributed generation. It involves net energy metering (NEM) where electricity delivered is compensated on a one-to-one basis for electricity purchased. Different policy options include buy-all, sell-all, where a utility buys all generated electricity at a lower rate and sells consumed electricity at a different rate. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place that require utilities to offer net metering to customers, with some policies including alternatives to net energy metering. Some of these policies predate EPACT05. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), almost 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in the United States in 2018, representing about 1% of all electricity customers. The number of net metering customers has been increasing since 2013. The number of net metering customers in the United States increased from 2013 to 2018, with participation levels varying by state. Hawaii has the highest participation rate at over 15%, while in many states, less than 0.1% of electricity customers participate in net metering programs. Factors influencing participation include state policies and other related factors. The participation rates in net metering programs vary among states, with Hawaii having the highest rate at over 15%. Factors influencing participation include state policies, renewable portfolio standards, electricity prices, and solar resource quality. The process of setting electricity rates involves allocating total costs incurred by utilities to customers, with many complexities and local factors at play. Ratemaking is the process of allocating total costs incurred by utilities to customers. State regulators design rates for investor-owned utilities to recover costs through customer bill payments, including building and operating power plants and compliance with regulations. Utilities recover costs through customer bill payments, including building and operating power plants, maintaining transmission systems, and providing grid services. Rates are set based on volumetric rates, where all customers within a class pay the same rate per kilowatt-hour. The more electricity used, the higher the bill. The utility sets volumetric rates for all customers within a class, with bills varying based on electricity consumption. Regulators estimate rates to cover total costs, including generation, transmission, and distribution expenses. Customer charges for services like billing are separate from electricity rates and appear as fixed values on bills. The customer charges for services like billing are separate from electricity rates and appear as fixed values on bills. Some customer classes, such as large industrial facilities, may have special system modifications and incur demand charges in addition to volumetric charges. States with net metering have taken different approaches in compensating customers. EPACT05 encouraged states to adopt net metering, but did not specify compensation methods. States have varied approaches, impacting DG markets. Net metering often compensates customers at the utility's retail rate. States have varied approaches to implementing net metering, often compensating customers at the utility's approved retail rate of electricity. Initially, policymakers viewed the retail rate as a \"close-enough proxy\" for rate setting, assuming it was acceptable when markets for solar PV and other DG were uneconomic. The retail rate is considered a close proxy for the value of solar or DG, with small numbers of participating customers and kilowatt hours credited at retail price. Retail rates provide high compensation for net metering generation, reflecting total utility costs. This encourages participation as customers can recover upfront costs of a DG system more quickly. Retail rates for net metering may lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy. Net metering customers generate their own electricity, reducing utility costs for electricity production, but not necessarily for other services like maintaining the grid. Net metering customers generate their own electricity, reducing utility costs for electricity production. However, they still rely on the grid for reliability benefits and may increase rates for non-net metering customers to cover grid maintenance costs not recovered from net metering customers. Concerns over potential equity issues arise as net metering customers tend to have higher incomes. Studies vary on the extent of cross-subsidization between net metering and non-net metering customers. Studies have shown varying estimates on the extent of cross-subsidies between net metering and non-net metering customers, with methodological differences contributing to the lack of consensus. Local factors like DG penetration and electricity demand growth can also impact observed cross-subsidies. Estimates from around 2015 suggest net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per net metering customer annually. One synthesis of estimates conducted in or around 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per net metering customer per year. Observers may disagree on how much of a cross-subsidy is large enough to warrant policy action. Net metering, and any associated cross-subsidies, is only one factor affecting electricity rates. A 2017 study assessed the potential rate effects of various factors, including net metering, energy efficiency, natural gas prices, state renewable portfolio standards, the federal Clean Power Plan, and utility capital expenditures. The study found that the rate effects of distributed generation would likely result in increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to increases up to 3.6 cents/kWh caused by other factors. The study on distributed generation (DG) found rate effects could increase between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to up to 3.6 cents/kWh from other factors. Cost shifts are not unique to DG, and addressing them may be delayed due to inherent time lags in ratemaking processes. States aim to mitigate cost shifts in rate design principles. Some states are considering adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates for net metering customers to address concerns about cross-subsidies. This is meant to help utilities recover costs for grid maintenance and operation. Some states are considering adding fixed charges to net metering customers' bills to help utilities recover costs for grid maintenance and operation. Proponents argue that this approach reduces cost shifting and increases fairness, while opponents, including the solar industry and environmental advocates, believe it ignores the societal benefits of distributed generation. Some states are considering adding fixed charges to net metering customers' bills to help utilities recover costs for grid maintenance and operation. Opponents, such as the solar industry and environmental advocates, argue that fixed charges ignore the societal benefits of distributed generation. Determining a value for fixed charges that accurately reflects net metering customers' use of the grid has been complex and controversial. Some states have adopted an alternative compensation rate called an avoided cost rate to represent the energy costs utilities avoid when net metering customers supply their own energy. Customers may supply their own energy, referred to as an avoided cost rate, which reflects costs associated with producing energy. Some states consider network upgrades for distributed generation, like solar PV. Avoided cost rates are typically lower than retail rates. Net metering customers with solar PV may be compensated based on a value of solar rate. Avoided cost rates are usually lower than retail rates and apply to net metering customers with solar PV. The value of solar (VOS) rate compensates customers based on societal benefits of distributed solar PV, such as reduced air emissions. Solar advocates support including societal benefits in net metering policy and rate design. VOS rates are typically higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates, with the potential for states to set a VOS rate greater than retail depending on the perceived benefits of solar. The value of solar (VOS) rate compensates customers for societal benefits of distributed solar PV, potentially exceeding retail rates. New York is among the states adopting this approach for distributed energy resources (DERs). Debate surrounds quantifying costs and benefits, with challenges in assessing the time-sensitive nature of distributed generation (DG) impacts. Points of debate around alternative compensation approaches for distributed generation (DG) include which costs and benefits to consider, and how to quantify them. States vary in their evaluation of net metering, as shown in a 2018 analysis for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that reviewed 15 state studies. The set of value categories and assumptions used in these studies significantly impact the results. State net metering policies vary in compensation and other aspects such as program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, all of which can impact the deployment of distributed generation (DG). Program caps set limits on participation based on factors like power units or percentage of electricity demand, influencing the promotion of DG under a state's net metering policy. Program caps in state net metering policies can impact the promotion of distributed generation (DG). These caps are set to reduce risks to the electricity system and prevent cross-subsidies. They may also limit sales losses for utilities but could hinder achieving renewable energy goals. States specify which generation sources can participate, with solar energy being dominant, but some states allow other energy types as well. Net metering policies specify eligible generation sources based on capacity limits and technology type. Solar energy is the primary source, but other energy types may participate. Factors like cost, customer type, and location influence participation. Customers may have periods of surplus generation that can be delivered back to the grid. Net metering customers can deliver surplus generation to the grid and receive compensation for it. States have varying policies on crediting surplus generation, which can help reduce total electricity costs. Many customers have a single generator behind a single electricity meter, often a rooftop solar panel. Credit retention policies can determine how long credits can carry over for net metering customers, potentially reducing their total electricity costs to $0. Different arrangements like aggregate net metering for farms or shared net metering for community solar projects are possible. Third party participation in net metering is another related policy consideration. Shared net metering, including virtual net metering for onsite projects like multi-family dwellings, allows third party participation in solar projects. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation to address state net metering policies, such as limiting regulators' ability to lower compensation rates or add fixed charges to bills. Legislation in Congress has aimed to address state net metering policies, including limiting regulators' ability to adjust compensation rates or add fixed charges to bills. Some bills require studies to understand the costs and benefits of net metering, such as a DOE report requested by Congress in 2017 and transmitted in 2019. Additionally, there are proposals for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to study various aspects of net metering. In 2019, the DOE transmitted a report to Congress on solar generation and net metering. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to study alternative incentives for distributed generation and net metering planning techniques."
