Analysts and officials believe that using data more effectively in acquisition decision-making could save billions, allocate resources efficiently, and improve military operations. The National Defense Industrial Association emphasized data as a critical step in improving defense acquisitions. Congress has taken various steps to enhance DOD's efficiency, including requiring auditability and incorporating acquisition reform provisions in National Defense Authorization Acts. The report examines DOD's use of data for decision-making in defense acquisitions, highlighting critical elements and recent efforts to improve data analysis. Congress may enhance oversight in this area to enable more effective decision-making. This report focuses on DOD's use of data for decision-making in defense acquisitions, emphasizing the importance of data analysis in policy decisions. It highlights recent efforts to improve data utilization and suggests potential questions for Congress. Many analysts believe data analysis is crucial for making well-informed policy decisions and managing government programs. Access to sufficient data allows decisionmakers to measure program effectiveness, inform policy decisions, and provide transparency. A lack of data can lead to incorrect conclusions and ineffective policies. Data-driven decisions are emphasized for better outcomes. The importance of data-driven decisions in government programs and military operations is highlighted by various reports. In 2015, a GAO report revealed a lack of data access for acquisitions and requirements development. An Inspector General report in the same year showed DOD's failure to review spare parts data, leading to excess inventories exceeding $1 billion. In 2014, unreliable data in the Army's appropriations status report jeopardized audit readiness. A 2013 GAO report pointed out that the lack of data hindered supply chain management in Afghanistan, affecting operations. DOD's mismanagement of the supply chain in Afghanistan hindered distribution of supplies and equipment, impacting operations. Despite the lack of consolidated databases for tracking spending on reconstruction and contracting, DOD does not effectively incorporate data into decision-making, leading to policy decisions based on assumptions rather than substantive data. Program reviews may not adequately consider relevant data for measuring success. In Afghanistan, policy decisions are often made without substantive data, leading to assumptions and inadequate incorporation of relevant data in program reviews. Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz emphasized the importance of data-driven decisions in both the private sector and government settings. Congress has recognized the significance of data in improving government operations, enacting the DATA Act in 2014 to enhance transparency in Federal spending. The DATA Act, enacted in 2014, aims to improve government operations by establishing data standards for financial information and enhancing transparency in Federal spending. Lack of basic data hinders management of the Department of Defense, as highlighted by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain. Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain highlighted the management problems within the Department of Defense due to a lack of essential data. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates also emphasized the difficulty in obtaining accurate information, leading to inefficiency, wasted resources, and harm to national security. This information shortfall hinders the ability to measure the results of national security policies, assess military priorities, and make informed decisions. The lack of essential data within the Department of Defense hinders the ability to measure national security policy results, assess military priorities, and make informed decisions. Analysts and officials argue that key elements for effective data use include information systems, comprehensive and accurate data, and data-informed decision-making. In some cases, decision-makers lack even a basic database, like the Joint Staff's absence of a system to manage weapon system portfolios according to GAO. The lack of essential data within the Department of Defense hinders the ability to measure national security policy results, assess military priorities, and make informed decisions. According to GAO, the Joint Staff lacked a database for managing weapon system portfolios, leading to manual, paper-based processes that are labor-intensive and prone to errors. This manual process creates separate and conflicting data sources, hindering leaders from fully utilizing valuable program information. Effective data systems are crucial for managing multibillion dollar programs efficiently. The Department of Defense faces challenges with multiple flawed data systems hindering its ability to improve budgetary accounting and financial management. Efforts to enhance financial management systems are ongoing, with completion expected by 2017. Having a single, agreed source for analyzing data sets is crucial, as multiple IT systems and databases within DOD contain similar information. The Department of Defense is working to improve its data systems for better financial management. There are challenges with multiple flawed systems containing similar information, leading to concerns about data accuracy and reliability. Calls have been made to enhance the architecture of data systems to ensure reliable and complete information for analyzing DOD acquisition data. The Department of Defense faces challenges with unreliable and incomplete data in various data sets, including contract obligations, workforce, contractor performance, and costs. The Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation (FPDS) is a key database for government procurement, but its data reliability and sufficiency are problematic. FPDS is crucial for Congress, agencies, analysts, and the public to understand federal spending and make informed policy decisions. The FPDS database is crucial for understanding federal spending and making informed policy decisions. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy and reliability of the data, prompting analysts to rely on it only for identifying broad trends and making rough estimations. The Office of Management and Budget has issued guidance to improve FPDS data quality. The General Services Administration (GSA) is overhauling data systems, including FPDS, to improve reliability and usefulness. Stakeholder feedback is being gathered to enhance data quality. Upgrades are expected in 2017 or 2018. Tracking Operations and Support (O&S) costs is a focus area. The General Services Administration is updating data systems, including FPDS, to improve reliability and usefulness. Officials aim to complete the upgrades in 2017 or 2018. In 2012, GAO found that DOD reports on weapon system O&S costs were inconsistent and unreliable, hindering effective oversight. DOD lacked comprehensive data to analyze cost growth, identify drivers, and develop cost management plans. Incomplete and inconsistently reported O&S data further complicated the issue. The DOD has struggled with incomplete and inconsistent reporting of O&S costs, hindering effective oversight. The office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is working on requiring more consistent use of units for calculating O&S, but building a bank of data for analysis will take time. Data access, quality, and availability problems persist in other phases of the acquisition process, and even when reliable data exist, they may not reach decision-makers effectively. The DOD faces challenges with data access, quality, and availability throughout the acquisition process. Decision-making is often based on perceptions or anecdotal evidence due to a lack of reliable data reaching decision-makers. Institutional and cultural barriers hinder data sharing, such as the stovepiped structure of the DoD limiting information visibility. The DOD faces challenges with data access, quality, and availability. Institutional and cultural barriers hinder data sharing, with a stovepiped structure limiting information visibility. There is a conservative bias in labeling and a reluctance to share data. Decision-makers may not effectively use existing data due to a lack of people capable of complex data analysis. Some senior leaders within DOD may not understand how to use data effectively for decision-making. Accuracy of data is crucial for effective use. Some analysts and government personnel believe senior leaders in DOD lack understanding of using data effectively for decision-making. Data accuracy and relevance are crucial. Unchecked statistics and slick presentations are sometimes used without validation of underlying assumptions. Decision-makers may avoid using data that does not support their intended decisions. DOD officials emphasize the importance of understanding data limitations in a data-driven approach. Concerns include avoiding gathering data unnecessarily and falling into traps of data misuse. In pursuing a data-driven approach to decision-making, DOD officials and analysts stress the importance of understanding data limitations. Concerns include avoiding unnecessary data collection and ensuring data analyses outweigh the costs. Some observers caution against collecting data without a clear understanding of its purpose, as it could lead to limited usefulness and divert attention from program management. Some observers caution that the benefit of data analyses should outweigh the cost of collecting and analyzing data. Striving for more and better data can sometimes hinder effective analysis, as data do not need to be perfect to be useful. Decision-makers should focus on whether there is sufficient data to draw reasonable conclusions. Decision-makers should focus on whether there is sufficient data to draw reasonable conclusions. Imperfect data can still be useful, and even perfect data may not yield perfect analysis. Cost estimating, for example, is imprecise but can help understand potential risks. All models are wrong, but some are useful. From FY2007 to FY2013, DOD spent over $80 billion on contracts in Afghanistan, but lacked reliable data to make strategic contracting decisions due to inadequate IT systems. The Afghan government and international community cannot determine the amount of money spent in Afghanistan over the past 10 years. The Department of Defense (DOD) lacked IT systems to track data effectively, hindering supply chain management and distribution of supplies. Conflicting information from different systems further complicated the tracking of spending on reconstruction and contracting in Afghanistan. The lack of interoperability and reliability in IT systems hindered supply chain management in Afghanistan, leading to wasteful spending and poor data sharing between agencies. Data was often incomplete and unreliable, with information not flowing effectively to the central database. The reliability of data in Afghanistan was questionable due to incomplete and inaccurate tracking. Only about 10% of all data records were eventually put into the central database, leading to wasteful spending and poor data sharing between agencies. The Commanders Emergency Response Program data was not accurately tracked until 2009, with an estimated 10% of data records put into the central database and a 50% error rate. Officials were often unaware of existing data, such as the Central Command quarterly contractor census, leading to a lack of awareness and utilization of important contracting information. DOD officials were not aware of the Central Command quarterly contractor census and contracting data in FPDS related to Afghanistan. They acknowledged data shortcomings and worked to improve reliability. Significant progress has been made in identifying necessary data for better contract decisions. Leveraging data systems from Afghanistan operations for future operations could provide timely critical information to commanders and policymakers. The Department of Defense (DOD) is working on improving data systems to support operations in Afghanistan and future operations. Analysts and senior DOD officials recognize the need for better use of data in decision-making. Efforts are underway to gather and analyze data for policy decisions, but there are gaps in available data and its reliability. Changing the culture within DOD to value data-driven decisions and integrate data gathering into standard procedures is seen as crucial for success. To succeed in improving data systems for operations, DOD culture must value data-driven decisions and integrate data gathering into standard procedures. Leadership support is crucial for a successful analytics program, with senior officials emphasizing the need for a more data-informed decision-making process.

Senior leadership is promoting a more data-driven process for supply chain management, with investments in information technology systems and analytical tools to support decision-making. DOD is investing billions in building IT systems and tools for data-based decision-making. Efforts are underway to improve data quality, overhaul data systems like FPDS, and enhance operations data consistency. An analytics center was established in 2013 to analyze data for acquisitions effectiveness and policy crafting. The analytics center analyzes data for acquisitions effectiveness and policy crafting. CAPE launched the CADE project to consolidate historical acquisition data for decision-makers and cost analysts. Military services are integrating data into decision-making, with the Navy reassessing IT systems for data needs. The military services are focusing on integrating data into decision-making processes. The Navy is reevaluating its IT systems to determine data requirements and justifications for investment. The Air Force has established an IT Business Analytics Office, identifying over $500 million in potential cost savings. Congressional actions have been credited with helping improve the use of data in decision-making within the DOD. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act, credited with improving DOD's use of data in decision-making, focused on early acquisition stages, independent cost estimates, and root cause analysis for major defense programs. The FY2010 NDAA required DOD to conduct root cause analysis of major defense programs with cost growth exceeding thresholds, improve financial statement audit readiness, and enhance data-based decision-making for greater efficiency. Despite past challenges, success in improving DOD's management and efficiency is not guaranteed. Despite efforts to improve data-based decision-making, success is not guaranteed in deploying resources within the DOD. Past attempts to enhance efficiency have had mixed results, with some successes like the Navy's Air System Command but also failures such as the Air Force's cancelled ERP system after spending over $1 billion. It will take years for the DOD to implement and improve data systems and foster a culture that uses data to support decisions. Historic data limitations make it challenging to assess contemporary situations accurately. The DOD aims to enhance data-based decision-making and build a robust historical database to understand acquisition system performance. Congressional support is crucial for promoting the use of data in decision-making. Robert Hale emphasizes the importance of congressional support in promoting data-driven decision-making within the Department of Defense. Congress could allocate resources to build necessary systems and workforce for data analysis, similar to past legislation like the Weapons System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. Key questions for Congress include investing in IT systems and personnel to enhance analytical capabilities for defense acquisitions. Data analysis requires appropriate information systems and qualified personnel for effective analysis. Congress should consider investing in IT systems and increasing capacity within DOD offices like Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation. Key questions for Congress include examining DOD's strategy for data needs, technology deployment, and in-house analytical capabilities. Congress should also assess DOD's strategy for hiring qualified personnel. To effectively utilize data in decision-making, Congress should assess DOD's culture, incentives, and strategy for data analysis. Legislation could be considered to promote the integration of data into standard routines and operating procedures within the organization. Congress could consider legislation to promote the use of data in decision-making within DOD. Key considerations include assessing the organization's culture, incentives, and strategy for data analysis. A recent RAND report highlighted inefficiencies in data access for acquisition processes, indicating a need for improvement in data-sharing practices. The acquisition process in government is often inefficient, with personnel not receiving their preferred data choices in a timely manner. Data-sharing can be beneficial, but security concerns may limit its appropriateness. Congress may question how the Department of Defense can balance data-sharing for efficiency with information protection."
