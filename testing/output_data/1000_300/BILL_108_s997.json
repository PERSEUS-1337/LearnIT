FINDINGS.\" Summarized chunk: \nCongress finds that the Middle Rio Grande bosque in Albuquerque, New Mexico is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in the Southwest, an old inhabited area, home to 6 pueblos, and a critical habitat for migratory birds. The bosque provides water to many in New Mexico and should be maintained to protect endangered species and the flow of the river while being more accessible to the public. The State of New Mexico aims to protect the Middle Rio Grande bosque, ensuring the flow of the river and accessibility to the public. Environmental restoration is a priority for the Corps of Engineers, who should also work on reestablishing hydrologic connections for healthy vegetation growth. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Critical restoration project: Immediate and substantial ecosystem restoration, preservation, recreation, and protection benefits.\n(2) Middle Rio Grande: Portion of the Rio Grande from Cochiti Dam to Elephant Butte Dam in New Mexico.\n(3) Secretary: Secretary of the Army.\n\nSEC. 3. MIDDLE RIO GRANDE RESTORATION. The Secretary will implement critical restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande, selecting projects based on feasibility studies and utilizing existing studies and plans. Local participation is required, with consultation and consideration of priorities from public and private entities involved in ecosystem restoration in the Rio Grande watershed. The Secretary will consult with public and private entities involved in ecosystem restoration in the Rio Grande watershed, including the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program and the Bosque Improvement Group of the Middle Rio Grande Bosque Initiative. Non-Federal interests will be required to cost-share by paying 25% of the total costs of critical restoration projects and providing necessary land and resources. The critical restoration project includes providing land, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and dredged material disposal areas. It also involves covering 100% of operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation costs incurred after the enactment of the Act.

The critical restoration project includes land, easements, rights-of-way, and dredged material disposal areas. Recreational features should not exceed 30% of the total project cost, with non-Federal interests covering any excess costs. Non-Federal interests will receive credit towards their share of design or costs. Non-Federal interests will receive credit towards their share of design or construction costs if the work they perform is integral to the project.
