Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs between different regions. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, and the Water Resources Development Act is the main legislative tool for altering harbor maintenance policy. The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) is the main legislative tool for altering harbor maintenance policy, with decisions on harbor maintenance having a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The cost of harbor maintenance is supported by a harbor maintenance tax (HMT) on imported and domestic waterborne cargo and cruise passengers, with the tax rate at 0.125% of the value of cargo shipped or cruise tickets sold. The tax is generally assessed at coastal and Great Lakes ports, with almost all revenue generated by imported waterborne cargo. The harbor maintenance tax rate is 0.125% of the value of cargo or cruise tickets, generating revenue mainly from imported waterborne cargo. The tax funds the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF) for dredging channels, maintaining jetties, and operating locks. HMTF surplus reduces the federal budget deficit, with over half of the annual revenue spent on harbor maintenance. The Harbor Maintenance Tax funds the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for dredging channels and maintaining jetties. The trust fund balance was $8.5 billion in July 2013, with annual revenue of $2.05 billion expected in FY2014. Bills in Congress aim to increase spending on harbor maintenance, requiring HMT revenues to be used for this purpose. Bills in the 113th Congress aim to double annual spending on harbor maintenance by using Harbor Maintenance Tax revenues for this purpose. H.R. 3080 proposes increasing HMTF expenditures each year, with 80% of the prior year's HMT collected funds to be spent on harbor maintenance by FY2020. This increased spending may impact funding for other Corps activities like harbor construction or flood control. Congress could offset this by allocating more funds to the energy and water development. Congress established the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) in 1986 to pay for eligible operations and maintenance costs of commercial navigation in harbors and inland harbors. Increasing HMTF expenditures may impact funding for other Corps activities, such as harbor construction or flood control, requiring Congress to allocate more funds to the energy and water development appropriation. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established by Congress in 1986 to cover maintenance costs for commercial navigation in harbors and inland harbors. The definitions of \"harbors\" and \"inland harbors\" were outlined by Congress, with a key distinction being that inland harbors must currently handle cargo. These definitions have remained unchanged since 1986, and the Corps did not conduct a rulemaking to implement the provisions. The Corps interprets the term \"commercial navigation\" to mean any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as an authorized purpose. Most harbor projects are authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects, with all O&M costs payable from the HMTF. If a project is authorized as a \"multi-purpose\" project, only expenditures for commercial navigation and joint-use costs are covered by the HMTF. In high-use ports, 90% of maritime commerce is handled, with two-thirds of HMTF spending going to these ports in FY2013. Moderate-use ports, accounting for 9% of commerce, received 19% of HMTF spending. Low-use ports make up 7% of commerce. In FY2013, \"moderate use\" ports handling 1-10 million tons of cargo received 19% of HMTF spending, with 7% of \"low use\" ports also having federally funded O&M projects planned. This allocation of funds sparked debate over how HMTF funds should be distributed between high, moderate, and low-use ports. The allocation of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending has sparked debate over the distribution of funds between high, moderate, and low-use ports. H.R. 3080 aims to prevent funds from being allocated solely based on tonnage, while S. 601 appears to prioritize funding for large commercial cargo ports. Out of 1,228 waterways eligible for HMTF funds, 61% carried no cargo from FY2005 to FY2009, raising concerns about the equitable distribution of funding. Out of 1,228 waterways eligible for Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) funds, 61% carried no cargo from FY2005 to FY2009. Almost 75% of eligible waterways handled little or no cargo, with high-use harbors defined by volume of cargo rather than value. Volume-based metric favors ports handling tankers and bulk ships. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending is directed towards high-use harbors based on the volume of cargo, favoring ports handling tankers and bulk ships. Using a value-based metric could allocate more funds to ports handling container ships, concentrating funding on the five largest container ports in the US. Despite being labeled as \"high use,\" these ports received only half of the requested O&M funds in FY2011. In 2012, U.S. ports handled 56% of maritime container shipments. High-use ports received only half of the O&M funds requested in FY2011, while moderate-use ports received 30% and low-use harbors received 10%. The total amount requested for low-use harbors almost matched that of the busiest harbors. This funding shortfall is concerning as the busiest commercial shipping channels were operating at their authorized capacities. The most economically significant ports received only half of the funds requested, leading to a shortfall in maintaining authorized widths and depths of commercial shipping channels. The Corps allocates funding based on financial stresses, resulting in partial investments across many facilities rather than larger investments in critical ones. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in top ports, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in top ports, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports. The Corps may concentrate O&M funds on high-use harbors, potentially hindering the development of moderate-use ports. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with many requiring maintenance only once every few years. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with many requiring maintenance only once every few years. In any given year, the Corps performs maintenance work on 400 to 500 harbors and channels. The Corps is authorized to maintain more than 1,400 coastal navigation projects but actively maintains only 360 of them. It is unclear if the Corps is maintaining fewer projects due to policy, funding levels, or maintenance needs. The Corps' lack of systematic reevaluation of harbor maintenance funding and inefficient project management have led to passive stewardship of resources. Explicit policy guidance is needed to address these issues. The Corps' current policies and management tools are inadequate for identifying inefficient harbor projects and ensuring their economic viability. Many harbor projects were authorized decades ago, before alternative transportation methods were available. The 2003 Corps study highlights the need for explicit requirements and procedures to reevaluate harbor projects when economic indicators fall below threshold values. In the early 1900s, regular line boats provided scheduled service at 50 Great Lakes ports for passengers and freight. The Corps retains responsibility for maintaining small harbors and channels, funded by a cargo tax. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest inland waterways projects not needed for commercial cargo. Recent initiatives prioritize harbor maintenance projects of greatest commercial importance. The Corps developed a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" in 2008 to assist in this process. The Corps has not been relieved of responsibility for harbors but has initiated efforts to prioritize funds for harbor maintenance based on commercial importance. They developed a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" in 2008 to allocate funds objectively using data on commercial tonnage and ship transits. Recent budget guidance shows the Corps using metrics to group projects and allocating O&M funds based on performance criteria like tonnage and cost per ton. Other criteria include support for commercial fishing and public. The Corps uses objective performance-based criteria to allocate O&M funds to projects, including tonnage, cost per ton, support for commercial fishing, public transportation, public safety, infrastructure condition, reliability, and legal requirements. The criteria aim to address concerns raised in a 2003 study, but the large number of criteria raises questions about project eligibility for priority funding. In 2008, the GAO recommended creating an advisory committee to provide input on national harbor projects. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended creating an advisory committee for harbor maintenance projects in 2008. Congress is concerned about the lack of transparency in the Corps' project prioritization criteria, as highlighted in a 2010 GAO report. The Corps' budget process focuses more on anticipated rather than demonstrated project performance, but actual performance is assessed for completed projects in the Operation and Maintenance program. The GAO clarified that the O&M budget reflects actual performance for completed projects, with a focus on budget priority determined by commercial use. Opportunity cost is a significant metric for efficient fund distribution to harbors, although not explicitly mentioned in the Corps' budget guidance. Former Secretary of the Army emphasized the principle of prioritizing economic benefits in maintenance decisions. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly, making an average over several years a better indicator. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly, making an average over several years a better indicator. However, the Corps has not jointly analyzed the datasets on O&M expense and waterway usage, so the data spanning several years are not readily available to Congress. The HMTF pays 100% of the federal cost of maintaining harbors up to 45 feet in depth, with a non-federal sponsor responsible for 50% of the additional cost for harbors deeper than 45 feet. S. 601 proposes changing the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M, requiring local cost-sharing only for maintenance of channels deeper than 50 feet. S. 601 would modify the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M, with local cost-sharing needed only for channels deeper than 50 feet. Construction costs for deepening or widening channels are not covered by the HMTF and are funded by general government revenues. The federal share of construction costs varies based on harbor depth, with general fund expenditures for construction partially offsetting HMT collections. Berths and private side channels are not eligible for HMTF funding for dredging or widening. S. 601 would allow ports with excess revenue from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to use funds for dredging berths or removing contaminated sediments. This could benefit deep ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach, potentially reducing funds for other ports. H.R. 3080 expands the use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for dredging and contaminated sediments, with a focus on deep ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach. There is a disparity in HMT revenue generated by different ports, with the top 15 harbors collecting over 75% of total revenue, raising concerns about equity and efficiency. The top 15 harbors collect over 75% of total HMT revenue, leading to concerns about equity and efficiency. The Corps maintains harbors for public safety reasons, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft. These harbors were authorized by Congress between 1850 and 1950 and are prioritized based on various criteria such as supporting Coast Guard stations and providing supplies to isolated communities. The Corps prioritizes maintenance funding for rescue stations, subsistence harbors, and ferry channels, even if they have minimal cargo. In FY2012-FY2014, additional funding was allocated by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees for the upkeep of small, remote, or subsistence harbors. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated additional funding for small, remote, or subsistence harbors above the President's request. They urged the Corps to revise criteria for navigation maintenance projects to consider economic impact and national defense importance. Federal maintenance of recreational harbors has been a contentious issue. President Clinton proposed a two-year phase-out of federal funding for harbors not contributing to the HMTF, totaling $63 million in annual expenditures. State and local governments were suggested to take over maintenance of these harbors, while the Corps would focus on national water projects. President Reagan had previously proposed terminating funding for harbors with federal maintenance costs exceeding $1 per ton of cargo, aiming to save $150 million annually. The HMTF was enacted as a user fee during the Reagan Administration after Congress rejected a proposal to allow local port authorities to assess fees on ships for harbor maintenance. Debate over maintaining harbors with little commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s, with the Corps' policy not to maintain underused harbors. In the 1950s, the Corps had a policy not to maintain underused harbors, stating that the federal government has no obligation to maintain economically unviable waterways. However, a 1956 audit found that the Corps was maintaining channels mainly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, prompting the recommendation for Congress to establish specific policies and criteria for harbor maintenance. The Government Accountability Office found that the Corps was maintaining navigation projects predominantly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to their policy. GAO recommended Congress establish specific policies for determining federal expense projects. 11 coastal navigation projects were identified as of questionable value, receiving $12 million in O&M spending in 2011. Only two projects still carry cargo. The Okeechobee Waterway in Florida was highlighted as offering negligible navigation benefit and recommended for reclassification as a flood-control project to be ineligible for HMTF expenditures. The Okeechobee Waterway in Florida was recommended by the GAO to be reclassified as a flood-control project due to its minimal navigation benefit, but it continued to receive HMTF funds. In 2012, it handled 21 barges and 2,000 tons of cargo, along with 3,997 recreational vessels. Another criticized project, the Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas, received HMTF funds but has seen no recent cargo movement. Recent budget requests have focused on flood risk mitigation over navigation, while recreational harbors have shown positive local economic impacts. Recreational boaters on the Great Lakes and in Oregon contribute significantly to the local economy, supporting thousands of jobs and spending billions annually. They do not contribute to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) but pay federal fuel taxes for various boating-related purposes. This funding mechanism dates back to before harbor dredging was funded by a cargo tax in 1986. The use of boat fuel taxes for harbor maintenance, specifically dredging, has been supported by some in the recreational boating industry. The Corps has started a pilot program to explore local financing for waterways on the Atlantic Coast. However, crucial information on current HMTF expenditure reports is not publicly available. The unavailable information includes current HMTF expenditure reports, data comparing harbor usage with O&M expense, and channel condition details. The Corps of Engineers tracks O&M expenditures on its facilities but faces challenges with facility nomenclature alignment. Reports on channel conditions lack comparisons to authorized dimensions and economic impact assessments. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program aims to develop tools for evaluating navigation improvements efficiently. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program (NETS) aims to develop economic tools for evaluating navigation improvement projects efficiently, focusing on construction dredging projects. The program supports the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' mission to invest tax dollars wisely in projects that provide long-term value. Congress requested the Corps to estimate the nationwide average availability of authorized channel dimensions maintained from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average Harbor Maintenance Tax payment for a 40-foot shipping container is $109. The HMT rate is 0.125% and is more significant when measured against typical freight charges. Shipping a 40-foot container from an Asian port to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is more significant when compared to typical freight charges, especially for containers with valuable cargo. It can raise shipping costs by about 4%. U.S. ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders claim that the HMT diverts cargo to ports in those countries where no similar tax is imposed. Factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities also influence shippers' decisions to use ports in Canada or Mexico. A 2012 FMC study found that factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities influence shippers to use ports in Canada or Mexico. The study estimated that removing the HMT would divert 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year from Canadian to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee paid by shippers bringing goods into the United States. The FMC concluded that not all cargo ports back to U.S. west coast ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee to reduce incentives for shipment through Canada. The HMT may hinder transshipment of cargo by sea, especially for coastal feeder service. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is levied twice on coastal feeder vessels, discouraging their use. CBP and the Corps estimate $500 million in uncollected HMT from domestic waterborne shippers. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable, affecting the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. Under the duty drawback program, import duties on materials used in U.S.-made products can be refunded when exported, ensuring price competitiveness. Exporters do not pay HMT for port use when exporting but do pay on materials transported through ports. The debate over WRDA is in the context of industrial supply chain cost-effectiveness. House and Senate Committees express concern over insufficient budget requests for Corps O&M to maintain competitiveness in the global marketplace. The President's budget requests for Corps O&M in FY2013 and FY2014 have been deemed insufficient to maintain competitiveness in the global marketplace. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce have initiated the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative to enhance the nation's marine transportation system and overall national competitiveness. Supply chain competitiveness impacts product costs, investments, and hiring decisions. Supply chain competitiveness impacts product costs, investments, and hiring decisions in the United States. It is crucial for policymakers, management leadership, and academicians to align supply chain management with strategic priorities. In March 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to improve transportation infrastructure investments. In March 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to improve transportation infrastructure investments by aligning waterside and landside infrastructure investment along national priorities. President Obama announced an initiative to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in response to the Panama Canal expansion. A Task Force on Ports was established in the FY2013 Budget to allocate federal investments strategically."
