    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Medicare Reimbursement Demonstration Act of 1997\" establishes a demonstration project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will jointly conduct a three-year demonstration project starting on January 1, 1998. The project involves providing reimbursement from the Medicare program for health care services to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in VA facilities. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a three-year demonstration project starting on January 1, 1998. The project involves waiving certain Medicare requirements to provide reimbursement for health care services to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in selected VA facilities. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish a plan to select facilities within designated geographic areas to participate in a project serving targeted Medicare-eligible veterans based on specific criteria. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish a plan to select facilities within designated geographic areas to participate in a project serving targeted Medicare-eligible veterans based on specific criteria. Selected facilities must have sufficient capability in billing and accounting, favorable indicators of quality of care, including patient satisfaction, and meet other relevant factors identified in the plan. Additionally, at least one facility near a closed military medical facility must be chosen. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and Title II of the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act outline the voluntary participation and cost-sharing requirements for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in a demonstration project. Participation is subject to facility capacity and funding limitations, with cost-sharing requirements matching those for Medicare-eligible patients at non-governmental facilities. The Secretary will establish cost-sharing requirements for veterans in the demonstration project, matching those for targeted Medicare-eligible patients at non-governmental facilities. Payments received will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. The determination of reimbursement amounts will be established by the Secretary, matching cost-sharing requirements for veterans in the demonstration project with those for targeted Medicare-eligible patients at non-governmental facilities. Payments received will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services provided under the demonstration project at 95 percent of regular Medicare payment rates. Payments will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds. The Secretaries will establish rules for computing payment amounts when not readily computed. Payments will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds, with an annual limit of $50,000,000. Failure to maintain VA effort may result in a reduction in payment. The annual limit on Medicare payments for the demonstration project is $50,000,000. Payment amounts may be reduced if the Department of Veterans Affairs fails to maintain a certain level of effort in providing medical services for targeted veterans. The maintenance of effort level for VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans is determined annually and must meet a certain threshold. If the expenditures fall below this level, payment amounts for the demonstration project may be reduced. The VA medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs is adjusted annually based on the percentage increase or decrease from the previous fiscal year. Additionally, the amount may be decreased based on any reduction in VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans compared to the preceding year. The VA medical care appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs are adjusted annually based on the rate of increase in health care costs. The reduction in priority in service delivery to targeted medicare-eligible veterans is also considered. The VA medical care appropriations are adjusted annually based on health care cost increases. VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans refer to funds spent on hospital care and medical services for medicare-eligible veterans, excluding certain expenditures. The Secretaries will monitor expenditures under the Medicare program for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans during a demonstration project to ensure there is no increase in costs compared to what would have been spent without the project. The Comptroller General will audit the costs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Medicare program annually during the demonstration project. If there is an increase in costs, the Secretaries must respond accordingly. During the demonstration project, the Comptroller General audits the costs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under Medicare annually. If expenditures increase due to the project, the Secretaries must take steps to recoup the amount and prevent future increases. During the demonstration project, if expenditures increase, steps must be taken to recoup the amount and prevent future increases. This includes payment from the current medical care appropriation to the medicare trust program and potentially suspending or terminating the project. SEC. 4. EVALUATION AND REPORTS. An independent entity will evaluate a health services demonstration project annually and submit reports to the Secretaries and Congress. Reports will include cost assessments and quality of care measures at participating facilities. The evaluation of a health services demonstration project will include assessing the cost of care for veterans, compliance with quality measures, comparison of costs with reimbursements, impact on Medicare programs, changes in access to care and quality for participating veterans, and effects on access to care for non-participating veterans. The Secretaries will report on the extension and expansion of the demonstration project, including recommendations on whether to extend or make it permanent, expand to cover additional sites, and modify project terms if extended. The Secretaries will report on the feasibility of a new demonstration project to reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care services provided to targeted medicare-eligible veterans in managed health-care plans by March 1, 1999.
