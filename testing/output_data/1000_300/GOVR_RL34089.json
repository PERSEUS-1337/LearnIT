    "content": "Both chambers of Congress passed legislation to reauthorize FDA programs and expand its authority for medical product safety. The bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, are the most comprehensive FDA legislation since 1997. The primary focus is renewing FDA's authority for key user fee programs set to expire in FY2007. FDA urged Congress to complete reauthorization efforts before August 1, 2007. The FDA urged Congress to reauthorize key user fee programs before August 1, 2007 to avoid layoffs and funding uncertainty. This has led to a hiring freeze and affected employee morale, with 30% eligible for retirement. The bills also address pediatric pharmaceutical authorities. The bills reauthorize key user fee programs to avoid layoffs at the FDA, where 30% of employees are eligible for retirement. The legislation also addresses pediatric pharmaceutical authorities and other issues of concern to Congress and the public. The FDA regulates products like vaccines, medical devices, and animal drugs for effectiveness through premarket approval. Products only regulated for safety may have little oversight. FDA can withdraw unsafe products from commerce. Congressional attention has been drawn to FDA's performance and funding. The 110th Congress is concerned with balancing the need for premarket approval for certain products. The 110th Congress is focused on balancing the need for FDA to speed safe and effective products to market while ensuring they are corrected or removed if necessary. FDA collects user fees from manufacturers to generate revenue for this purpose, raising questions about the agency's reliance on these fees. Congress has passed measures authorizing FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers to speed products to market. Efforts to reauthorize PDUFA and MDUFMA are underway, with these fees accounting for a significant portion of FDA's budget. PDUFA and MDUFMA generate significant user fee revenue for FDA, accounting for 87% and 19% of its budget in FY2008. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, allows FDA to collect fees for drug and biological product reviews, with performance goals to reduce review times. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, established user fees for medical device applications with similar performance goals. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, established user fees for FDA's review of medical device applications, incorporating performance goals to reduce review times. It also allowed third-parties to conduct establishment inspections and added new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. The expiring authorities within MDUFMA are related to user fees and associated performance goals. In 1997, Congress gave FDA a tool, in BPCA, to protect children in clinical trials by testing drugs on that population. This helped provide information on appropriate dosage levels and potential side effects of medications for pediatric patients. In 1997, Congress gave FDA the BPCA tool to encourage pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity for trials investigating drug effects on children. FDA's attempts to require assessments of new drugs on pediatric populations were initially stopped by courts until Congress codified the requirement in PREA in 2003. BPCA and PREA provide incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of both on- and off-patent drugs. Developing medical devices for children is reported to be less profitable and more problematic than for adults. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 contain provisions offering incentives to manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices and giving FDA the authority to require postmarket studies of approved pediatric devices to ensure their continued efficacy and safety. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 include provisions to incentivize manufacturers to develop pediatric medical devices and empower the FDA to mandate postmarket studies for ongoing safety and efficacy monitoring. Adverse effects of medical products may not always be evident during premarket trials, requiring long-term monitoring and data collection to identify rare or delayed reactions. These bills aim to strengthen the FDA's data collection system for marketed products. The FDA is working on strengthening its data collection system for marketed products to identify adverse effects that may not be evident during premarket trials. There are concerns about the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biomedical products due to undisclosed negative trial results. In 2004, Congress raised questions about the safety of FDA-approved biomedical products with undisclosed negative trial results. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 address public access to trial results. FDA uses advisory committees for independent advice on drugs, devices, and food, but conflicts of interest are a concern. In 2006 and 2007, media reports highlighted bias and conflicts of interest within FDA advisory committees regarding drug approval. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aims to address conflicts of interest among committee members. The year 2000 saw a decline in new drug submissions globally, despite advancements in biomedical sciences. In 2004, FDA investigated the decline in innovative medical products submitted for approval, noting the challenges in product development. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose creating a nonprofit corporation to support FDA in modernizing scientific tools and harnessing bioinformation for evaluating medical products. The creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation is proposed by S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 to support the FDA in ensuring the safety, effectiveness, and manufacturability of medical products. Lawmakers are exploring ways to allow access to lower-priced medications from foreign sources while maintaining safety standards. Some lawmakers are trying to allow access to lower-priced medications from foreign sources while ensuring safety standards. S. 1082 includes a title to regulate importation of prescription drugs, but an amendment requiring the Secretary of HHS to certify safety and cost-effectiveness may nullify this language. The FDA has regulated food safety since 1906, evolving its authority to address food science advances and outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. The FDA has been regulating food safety since 1906, adapting to advancements in food science and outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. Recent outbreaks have prompted congressional focus on food safety, with concerns raised about both domestic and imported food products. S. 1082 addresses some key issues in food safety reform, with provisions that may be considered by Congress. The bill aligns with two comprehensive FDA reauthorization and reform bills, covering various FDA programs and topics such as prescription drug user fees and medical device user fees. The report describes key FDA programs addressed in the bills, including prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, pediatric drugs and devices, drug safety, clinical trials databases, conflicts of interest, importation of prescription drugs, and more. FDA's authority to collect user fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act will expire in 2007 if not reauthorized by Congress. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) provides FDA with revenue from pharmaceutical manufacturers' fees to speed up product approval. PDUFA has led to shorter application review times and increased premarket review activities. Congress reauthorized PDUFA in 1997 and 2002, allowing FDA to use some fees for postmarket drug safety activities. In 1997 and 2002, Congress reauthorized the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), allowing FDA to use fees for postmarket drug safety activities. Discussions for the 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization focused on postmarket drug safety, with bills like S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 including provisions for reauthorizing fees for application, establishment, and product fees, covering both prescription and nonprescription drugs. The bills also expanded the list of postmarket safety activities that fees could be used for. The bills for the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act would cover applications for both prescription and nonprescription drugs, adding to postmarket safety activities. Both Senate and House bills would increase adverse event reporting requirements and establish fee revenues of $393 million annually with adjustments for inflation and workload. The House bill includes additional adjustments and exemptions from product and facility fees. The House and Senate bills for the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act propose adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent costs. The House bill exempts orphan drugs marketed by small companies from certain fees. Both bills introduce new fees for advisory review of drug advertisements, with voluntary pre-release review for manufacturers. The Senate bill codifies core elements of the user fee program. The Senate bill proposes new fees for drug reviews, including advisory and operating reserve fees. It would codify core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, requiring annual reports to Congress and consultations for future reauthorizations. Additionally, it would mandate a public hearing and review of the Secretary's recommendations after negotiations with the industry. The Senate bill proposes new fees for drug reviews, including advisory and operating reserve fees, codifying core elements of the prescription drug user fee program. It requires annual reports to Congress, consultations for future reauthorizations, and a public hearing and review of the Secretary's recommendations after negotiations with the industry. The House bill also includes reauthorization and report requirements, along with making negotiation minutes publicly available before presenting recommendations to Congress. The FDA website will publish negotiation minutes with industry and advocacy groups. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 introduced user fees for device reviews, allowed third-party inspections, and imposed new requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority for user fees expires in 2007 unless reauthorized by Congress. Bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization and other provisions for medical device regulation. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 introduced user fees for FDA approval of medical devices. The authority to collect these fees expires in 2007, but bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization through FY2012 with fee adjustments and new types of fees. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorizing the Medical Device User Fee program through FY2012 with fee adjustments and new types of fees, including establishment fees, registration fees, and 30-day fees. Government entities would be exempt from establishment fees, with H.R. 2900 extending this waiver to Indian tribes. The bills also include provisions for fee increases based on the number of establishments paying the fee and requirements for medical device-related appropriations to assess fees. The bills propose reauthorizing the Medical Device User Fee program through FY2012 with fee adjustments and new types of fees. They include provisions for fee increases based on the number of establishments paying the fee and requirements for device-related appropriations to assess fees. H.R. 2900 would authorize specific sums for postmarket safety information review on medical devices and amend provisions on fee adjustments. The bills propose reauthorizing the Medical Device User Fee program through FY2012 with fee adjustments and new types of fees. Both bills would reduce fees for small businesses, allow foreign firms to qualify as small businesses, and specify a new refund policy for withdrawn applications. The Secretary would have sole authority to make refund decisions, which are nonreviewable. The refund policy for withdrawn applications under the Medical Device User Fee program would be determined solely by the Secretary, with nonreviewable authority. Both bills require annual reports through FY2012, with H.R. 2900 including postmarket safety activities information and S. 1082 requiring public disclosure of previous cohorts of medical device applications. Consultation with various groups, publication of recommendations, public comment periods, and public meetings are also mandated for the agency in developing performance goal recommendations to Congress. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would require the agency to consult with various groups, publish recommendations, allow public comments, and hold public meetings. The bills specify the revision of recommendations based on public feedback, transmittal to Congress, and incorporation of consultation requirements into the FFDCA. H.R. 2900's user fee provisions take effect upon enactment, while S. 1082's provisions start on October 1, 2007, with a savings clause for fee collection continuity. Both bills include amendments related to medical device regulation, with H.R. 2900 mandating a study on nosocomial infections. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose amendments related to medical device regulation, including extending the authority for third-party review of premarket notifications until FY2012. The bills also aim to streamline requirements for inspections by accredited third parties and allow device companies to submit reports by third parties assessing conformance with international quality standards for FDA consideration during inspections. The bills aim to streamline medical device regulation by allowing device companies to submit reports by third parties assessing conformance with international quality standards for FDA consideration during inspections. They also propose reducing the registration period for device producers and amending electronic registration regulations to require electronic filing as a default. The bills aim to streamline medical device regulation by requiring electronic filing as a default for registration. Off-label prescribing of adult-approved products for children can lead to ineffective treatment or incorrect dosages due to unique side effects and variations in drug metabolism in children. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies by extending market exclusivity. It also requires pediatric studies for off-patent drugs to assess safety and effectiveness, with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) reauthorized market exclusivity provisions for off-patent drugs needing pediatric studies funded by NIH. FDA can refer on-patent drugs without pediatric studies to the Foundation for NIH. FDA's Pediatric Rule mandated pediatric testing data submission with statutory authority granted by Congress later. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) was enacted in 2003 to cover drugs and biological products, requiring pediatric assessments for approved products. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) for another five years, encouraging research on off-patent products and strengthening labeling requirements based on pediatric studies. The bills aim to reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) for another five years, encouraging research on off-patent products and strengthening labeling requirements based on pediatric studies. A key difference between the Senate and House bills is the period of exclusivity, with S. 1082 proposing to reduce it to three months for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. sales. Both bills would expand FDA's authority under PREA by strengthening standards for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize BPCA and PREA, with a key difference being the connection between PREA's authorities and BPCA authorization. Both bills also include legislation to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products, such as the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 amending the humanitarian device exemption. The legislation aims to encourage manufacturers to develop medical devices for small markets, exempting them from proving effectiveness and certain fees. It specifically targets pediatric devices for rare diseases, extending the exemption through 2012 (S. 1082) and 2013 (H.R. 2900). Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to extend the exemption for pediatric medical devices through 2012 and 2013 respectively. They both require the NIH Director to designate a contact point for funding and the FDA Commissioner to submit a plan for pediatric device research. Additionally, both bills mandate the Secretary to establish a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to establish a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. The bills focus on connecting innovators with manufacturers, managing device development, and providing business assistance. Both bills require coordination with NIH and FDA, with S. 1082 also mandating grantees to report annually on effectiveness and impact. Authorization for the demonstration grants is set at $6 million for FY2008 through FY2012. Additionally, both bills expand the focus of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics and the Pediatric Advisory Committee to include pediatric medical devices. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand the focus of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics and the Pediatric Advisory Committee to include pediatric medical devices. They also propose postmarket surveillance measures for pediatric medical devices, allowing for required postmarket studies for devices indicated for pediatric populations or expected to have significant use in pediatric populations. Since the 1938 passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, manufacturers of new drugs must demonstrate safety to FDA for approval. The Harris-Kefauver Amendments in 1962 added product effectiveness requirements. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 maintained focus on premarket review. H.R. 2900 includes a dispute resolution provision for device manufacturers. The FDA cannot guarantee complete safety of drugs due to rare adverse effects and evolving knowledge. Recent research has shown some widely used drugs to be more dangerous than previously thought. Vigilance is required to address public health and regulatory concerns. In recent years, concerns have arisen about the safety of widely used drugs, prompting questions about industry transparency and FDA's ability to address postmarket safety issues. FDA requested a report from the Institute of Medicine in 2006 to evaluate its drug safety practices. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aimed to enhance FDA's ability to protect public health regarding drug safety. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to enhance FDA's ability to identify and address postmarket drug safety issues through new authorities and public-private partnerships. The bills require the Secretary to establish a risk identification system using electronic databases and recommend postmarket studies for products on the market. The Senate and House bills propose a strengthened authority and set of procedures to support FDA's postmarket safety activities, including the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to require postmarket studies for drugs and biologics. The bills differ on the criteria for REMS, with the House bill emphasizing pre-approval assessment of benefits versus risks. The House and Senate bills propose a strengthened authority for FDA's postmarket safety activities, including the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for drugs and biologics. The House bill emphasizes pre-approval assessment of benefits versus risks, while the Senate bill focuses on serious risks and the need for REMS to assess or mitigate them. Both bills require REMS to include certain core elements. The House and Senate bills propose a strengthened authority for FDA's postmarket safety activities, including the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for drugs and biologics. Both bills call for REMS to include core elements, instructions to patients and clinicians, and restrictions on distribution or use. Waivers from REMS restrictions are allowed for certain medical countermeasures during public health emergencies. The Senate bill includes a mechanism for access to drugs with REMS for off-label use for serious or life-threatening conditions. The bill proposes creating a mechanism to ensure access to drugs with REMS for off-label use in serious or life-threatening conditions. It includes structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement processes. Both Senate and House bills require reviews of approved REMS at specified times and establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board to resolve disputes. The Secretary will evaluate REMS through the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. The bills propose creating a mechanism for resolving disputes between the Secretary and a product's sponsor regarding drug safety. They require evaluation of REMS elements to ensure safe use without limiting patient access. The Secretary may require postapproval studies or clinical trials, with criteria differing between the Senate and House bills. The Senate bill emphasizes assessing serious risks and unexpected risks in the population, while the House bill addresses issues outside the REMS process. The House bill authorizes the Secretary to require postapproval studies to assess known or serious risks of a drug. It also includes a process for resolving disputes between the sponsor and the Secretary regarding labeling changes. The Secretary's request for a supplemental application to change labeling would establish a multi-level process with defined time limits, involving meetings, dispute review, and recommendations by the Drug Safety Oversight Board. If necessary, the Secretary could order a safety labeling change, and if the sponsor disagrees, the drug may be deemed misbranded. Both the House and Senate bills include time limits for the sponsor and Secretary, as well as a dispute resolution procedure for labeling changes. Additionally, both bills authorize the Secretary to review certain advertisements before dissemination, with different criteria for decision-making. The House bill specifically mentions television ads and allows the Secretary to recommend but not require changes, while the Senate bill does not specify. Both the House and Senate bills require submission of certain advertisements to the Secretary for review before dissemination, with different criteria for decision-making. The House bill focuses on television ads and allows the Secretary to recommend but not require changes, while the Senate bill does not specify the media. Both bills mandate a clear presentation of side effects and contraindications, and authorize the Secretary to impose civil monetary penalties for violations, including fines of up to $250,000 per violation. The House bill also includes additional civil penalties for continued violations. The House bill proposes civil penalties of up to $10 million per violation, not exceeding $50 million for all violations in a single proceeding. For ongoing violations that pose a public health threat, fines of up to $1 million per day could be imposed. Both bills allow the Secretary to deem a drug misbranded if it does not comply with certain REMS elements. Additionally, the House bill prohibits marketing a product with a REMS if it is not in compliance. Separate civil penalty authority is established for false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads, with a fine of up to $250,000 for a first violation in the House bill. The Senate and House bills propose separate civil penalty authority for false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads for prescription drugs. The House bill suggests fines of up to $250,000 for a first violation and up to $500,000 for subsequent violations. The Senate bill recommends lower fines of up to $150,000 for a first violation and up to $300,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills authorize increased appropriations for drug safety provisions, with the Senate bill increasing revenue by $225 million over FYs 2008 through 2012 for drug safety activities. The Senate bill proposes increasing revenue by $225 million over FYs 2008 through 2012 for drug safety activities, including REMS and other drug safety measures. The House bill authorizes appropriations of $125 million over the same period, with additional funding for clinical trials of antibiotic drugs and orphan drug development. The Senate bill also includes provisions for antibiotic access and innovation, designating antibiotics as orphan products and authorizing $35 million annually for them. The Senate bill proposes funding for drug safety activities, including REMS and orphan drug development. It designates antibiotics as orphan products and authorizes $35 million annually for them. The bill also includes provisions for antibiotic access and innovation. The House bill focuses on securing the distribution system against counterfeit drugs and includes drug safety provisions such as reports to Congress and studies on drug safety effectiveness. The House bill focuses on securing the distribution system against counterfeit drugs and includes drug safety provisions such as reports to Congress and studies on drug safety effectiveness. The Senate bill includes provisions for drug safety activities, establishing an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and developing a website with extensive drug safety information. The Senate bill includes provisions for drug safety activities, requiring state-legalized medical marijuana to adhere to FDA regulations, awarding priority review vouchers for neglected disease products, creating a list of authorized generic drugs, and preventing delays from citizen petitions without Secretary review. The FDA Commissioner would create a list of authorized generic drugs and establish a procedure to prevent delays from citizen petitions without Secretary review. Federal registration requirements for clinical trials were established by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, currently required for trials of drugs intended to treat serious diseases. Proposals in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand the types of trials and information in the registry. The proposals in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand the types of clinical trials and information in the registry, including the publication of trial results. These bills would require registration of most trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics, even international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 delays public release of medical device information until FDA approval, while S. 1082 exempts pediatric postmarket surveillance trials from registry requirements. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements and information in the registry. H.R. 2900 delays the release of medical device information until FDA approval, while S. 1082 exempts pediatric postmarket surveillance trials from registry requirements. Both bills link certain requirements to the trial's completion date and require the responsible party to comply with the provisions. H.R. 2900 specifically requires the principal investigator to have control over the data and the right to publish trial results to serve as the responsible party. Both bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements and information in the registry. H.R. 2900 specifically requires the principal investigator to have control over the data and the right to publish trial results to serve as the responsible party. H.R. 2900 also includes additional requirements such as disclosing agreements that restrict non-employees from discussing or publishing trial results and submitting updates reflecting any changes every six months to the registry. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements. H.R. 2900 includes additional requirements like disclosing agreements restricting non-employees from discussing trial results and submitting updates every six months. S. 1082 specifies criteria for the searchable registry and a timeline for making information public. Only H.R. 2900 provides specific instructions for creating a results database. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 both address clinical trial registration requirements. H.R. 2900 provides detailed instructions for creating a public database of trial results, including searchable categories and timing of submissions. S. 1082, on the other hand, requires the Secretary to establish a database based on NIH recommendations. H.R. 2900 also mandates that information in the database be truthful and regularly updated, with a study by the Comptroller General on promotional content. H.R. 2900 requires the Comptroller General to conduct a study on promotional content in the results database. It mandates that pre-approval study results be made public within 30 days of certain events, such as receiving a not substantially equivalent (NSE) letter. This timing provision could lead to the disclosure of clinical trial information for devices still pending FDA action. A similar provision applies to studies on new uses of drugs or devices already on the market, allowing for a posting delay of up to two days. The provision in H.R. 2900 mandates the disclosure of pre-approval study results within 30 days of certain events, potentially revealing clinical trial information for devices pending FDA action. A similar provision in S. 1082 allows for a posting delay of up to two years for studies on new uses of drugs or devices already on the market. Both bills include compliance and enforcement provisions related to registry and results database requirements. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include compliance and enforcement provisions for registry and results database requirements. H.R. 2900 specifies penalties for noncompliance, allowing fines of $10,000 per day and capping penalties at $15,000. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 have penalties for noncompliance with registry and results database requirements. H.R. 2900 allows fines of $10,000 per day, capping at $15,000, while S. 1082 allows fines of $10,000 for a first violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills also address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees. The FDA's approach to conflicts of interest in advisory committees allows for exceptions under specific circumstances. The law governing conflicts of interest is primarily outlined in the Federal Advisory Committee Act, FDA advisory committee policy, and laws governing special government employees. Proposed bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to change the recruitment process for advisory committee members and the granting of conflict-of-interest waivers. The new provision in the FFDCA, effective October 1, 2007, changes the recruitment process for advisory committee members and the granting of conflict-of-interest waivers. It expands requirements to all advisory committees and defines financial interest under 18 U.S.C. 208(a) as related to employment, trusteeship, or directorship. Stock ownership, former employment, or grants/contracts do not fall under this definition. The FFDCA's new provision, effective October 1, 2007, changes the recruitment process for advisory committee members and conflict-of-interest waivers. It defines financial interest as related to employment, trusteeship, or directorship, not including stock ownership or grants/contracts. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 focus on recruiting experts from academia, medical research institutions, and public interest groups for advisory committees, with provisions to discourage financial conflict waivers. The FFDCA's new provision, effective October 1, 2007, changes the recruitment process for advisory committee members and conflict-of-interest waivers. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 focus on recruiting experts from academia, medical research institutions, and public interest groups for advisory committees, with provisions to discourage financial conflict waivers. Both bills require full financial disclosure and preclude voting by members with conflicts of interest unless exempted by the Office of Government Ethics. Waivers of the voting restriction are allowed for essential expertise, with H.R. 2900 permitting only one waiver per meeting. Public disclosures for conflict-of-interest determinations, certifications, and waivers are mandated, with the Secretary required to submit annual reports. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 focus on recruiting experts for advisory committees with provisions to discourage financial conflicts of interest. They require full financial disclosure, limit voting by members with conflicts of interest, and allow waivers for essential expertise. The bills mandate public disclosures for conflict-of-interest determinations, certifications, and waivers, and require the Secretary to submit annual reports. Additionally, both bills establish a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission, with the initial Board of Directors selecting members from a National Academy of Sciences-provided candidate list. The initial Board of Directors, including the FDA Commissioner and directors of NIH, CDC, and AHRQ, would select appointed members from a National Academy of Sciences-provided candidate list. The ongoing board would consist of representatives from various sectors. The Foundation would establish goals, coordinate with federal programs, and award grants to advance those goals. The bills would direct the Commissioner to transfer funds to the Foundation and require the Secretary to establish an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA. The Senate and House bills propose transferring between $500,000 and $1,250,000 to the Foundation. They also require the Secretary to establish an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA. S. 1082 includes provisions not found in H.R. 2900, such as allowing importation of prescription drugs and creating procedures for safety and effectiveness. The Senate bill proposes transferring funds to the Foundation and establishing an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA. It includes provisions for importing prescription drugs and creating safety procedures. The provision for drug importation addresses concerns about safety, cost savings, and administration. The Senate added a second-degree amendment requiring certification from the HHS Secretary for the provision to take effect, which has not been provided. Food safety is also addressed in the bill. Title VI of S. 1082 addresses food safety by establishing regulations for pet food processing and ingredient standards, updating nutrient and ingredient information on pet food labels, and creating an early warning system for identifying adulteration and disease outbreaks. The Secretary would be required to collect and share recall information during food recalls. H.R. 2900 does not include any food provisions. Title VI of S. 1082 focuses on food safety measures, including establishing regulations for pet food processing, updating pet food labels, and creating an early warning system for disease outbreaks. The Secretary would collect and share recall information, coordinate activities, and establish a registry for adulterated food. The Secretary would review and validate information on adulterated food before taking action to protect the public. Alerts would be issued for food linked to illness outbreaks or adulteration. Responsible parties must maintain records and report to the FDA. Deliberate adulteration cases must be reported to the Department of Homeland Security. Regulations and standards would be established for reporting suspected food adulteration. The bill requires reporting of deliberate food adulteration cases to the Department of Homeland Security. Regulations and standards for reporting suspected food adulteration must be established. Annual reports to Congress on food imports, inspectors, violations, and enforcement actions are also mandated. Certain provisions in the bill require reports on food issues such as pesticide residue monitoring programs. Certain provisions in S. 1082 Title V would require reports on various food issues, including pesticide residue monitoring, health hazards of substances used in fresh meat, color additive certification program performance, risks of genetically engineered seafood, marketing of crustaceans, detection and assessment of risks, and authorization of appropriations for aquaculture and seafood inspection. The bill also includes a provision prohibiting imports from foreign food facilities that deny access to U.S. inspectors and authorizes enhancing FDA inspection for aquaculture and seafood through partnerships. S. 1082 includes provisions for enhancing FDA inspection for aquaculture and seafood through partnerships. It also has additional provisions such as enabling the sale of pet turtles with specific requirements, requiring reports on genetic test safety and quality, and FDA report on indoor tanning device labeling and its link to skin cancer. S. 1082 includes provisions expressing the Senate's sense on FDA regulation flexibility for follow-on biologics and addressing violations of intellectual property rights. The House bill addresses public-private partnerships for FDA collaborations with educational organizations.
