    "content": "\"Services\" encompass a wide range of economic activities involving human value-added, such as labor, advice, and entertainment. They are intangible, must be consumed at the point of production, but technology is reducing these restrictions. Examples include retail trade, transportation, information, banking, education, and professional services. The service sector in the U.S. economy is significant, accounting for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs and 65% of GDP in 2010. Financial services play a crucial role in the economy by facilitating the flow of capital. Financial services, delivery services, and distribution services are essential for the economy, facilitating the flow of capital, ensuring goods are available when needed, and making goods available to consumers. U.S. trade in services plays a significant role in overall trade, accounting for 30% of total U.S. exports and 17% of total U.S. imports in 2010. In 2010, services accounted for 30% of total U.S. exports and 17% of total U.S. imports. Many service providers establish a presence in the country of the consumer for direct contact. Cross-border services trade data do not capture all trade in services, as data on sales by foreign affiliates of U.S.-owned companies provide a more accurate picture. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, while foreign firms sold U.S. residents $727 billion in services through their majority-owned foreign affiliates located in the United States. These figures, along with cross-border exports and imports, do not fully capture the total value of trade in services. The Trade Act of 1974 instructed the Administration to promote an agreement on trade in services under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during the Tokyo Round negotiations. Developing countries were less advanced in their service sectors compared to industrialized countries like the United States. During the Tokyo Round negotiations in 1979, industrialized countries, led by the United States, pushed for the inclusion of services in international trade rules. Developing countries, with less advanced service sectors, were initially hesitant. Services were eventually included in the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986, leading to the creation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty identified three main challenges in creating rules for international trade in services. Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty identifies challenges in creating rules for international trade in services, including targeting domestic regulations as barriers, distinguishing legitimate regulations from protectionism, considering services transactions behind customs borders, and adapting to technology advances like the internet enabling tradable services. The challenges in creating rules for international trade in services include adapting to technology advances like the internet, which make once non-tradable services tradable. The GATS recognizes that most services transactions occur inside borders and barriers to trade in services are within customs barriers. Effective trade rules must consider the various modes of delivery to discern barriers foreign service providers face in a trade-partner's market. Effective trade rules must consider the various modes of delivery to discern barriers foreign service providers face in a trade-partner's market. The GATS divides modes of delivery into four categories: Cross-border supply (mode 1) and Consumption abroad (mode 2). The GATS divides modes of delivery into four categories: Cross-border supply (mode 1), Consumption abroad (mode 2), Commercial presence (mode 3), and Presence of natural persons (mode 4). It provides a multilateral framework of principles and rules for government policies among 153 WTO members. The GATS is an agreement among 153 WTO members that provides a framework for trade in services. It aims to promote economic development, liberalize trade, and allow member governments to regulate services sectors. The GATS is divided into six parts, with Part I defining its scope and application to all services except those under government authority. The GATS is divided into six parts, with Part I defining the scope of the agreement and its application to all services except those under government authority. Part II outlines principles and obligations that apply to all services sectors, including most-favored-nation treatment and transparency requirements. The GATS covers services with unconditional most-favored-nation treatment, transparency, impartial administration of rules, and obligations for monopoly suppliers. Exceptions include temporary trade restrictions for balance of payments issues and national security purposes. Part III establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, binding them to their commitments once made. The GATS covers services with most-favored-nation treatment, transparency, and obligations for monopoly suppliers. Part III establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, binding them to their commitments once made. Members may not impose less favorable treatment than committed to and must accord national treatment to service suppliers from other member countries. The GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, ensuring that service providers from other member countries receive equal treatment. These obligations apply only to services listed in each member's schedule of commitments, following a positive list approach to trade. The GATS requires market access and national treatment obligations for members, applying only to services listed in each member's schedule of commitments. Parts IV-VI of the agreement mandate new negotiations to expand coverage and resolve conflicts through the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. The GATS includes annexes on MFN exemptions, financial services, transportation services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Negotiations on financial services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery were ongoing, with agreements to be included in the GATS upon entering into force. The GATS stipulated ongoing negotiations on financial services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Agreements were reached on basic telecommunications and financial services in 1997. Negotiations on mode-4 ended in 1995 with limited results, while maritime services negotiations resumed in the current round. WTO members' commitments on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors are a significant part of their obligations under the GATS and the Doha Development Agenda round. Access in specific service sectors or subsectors is a major part of a member's obligations under the GATS and a key focus during negotiations. Each WTO member must submit a schedule of commitments (SC) during GATS negotiations, with new members required to do so upon accession. The SC, comparable to tariff schedules, is more complex for services and divided into four columns detailing sector/subsector commitments and market access restrictions. The schedule for commitments under the GATS is divided into four columns, detailing sector/subsector commitments, market access restrictions, national treatment restrictions, and any additional commitments made by the member country. The schedule is split into two parts, with the first part focusing on horizontal commitments that apply to all service sectors, and the second part listing sector-specific commitments. The SCs are comprehensive documents where WTO members identify trade liberalization commitments for each service sector and subsector, along with any exceptions. The negotiations on services in the DDA aim to reform GATS rules and expand commitments to increase coverage of service sectors and reduce limitations on national treatment and market access. This section examines the evolution, structure, and status of the negotiations, along with U.S. goals and those of other major trading partners. The negotiations on services in the DDA aim to reform GATS rules, expand commitments, and reduce limitations on national treatment and market access. The evolution, structure, and status of the negotiations, along with U.S. goals and those of other major trading partners, are discussed. The negotiators acknowledged the need to maintain momentum in service negotiations post-Uruguay Round, leading to new negotiations on services under Article XIX of the GATS. This includes addressing issues like government subsidies and special treatment for least developed countries. The negotiations on services under Article XIX of the GATS aim to address issues such as government subsidies, special treatment for least developed countries, emergency safeguard measures, and government procurement in services trade. The negotiations began in 2000 but progressed slowly due to political challenges. In March 2001, the WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines for the negotiations based on GATS mandates and procedures. The WTO's Council for Trade in Services in Seattle approved guidelines in March 2001 for negotiations on services under the GATS. The guidelines aim for progressive liberalization of trade in all service sectors and modes of delivery, with a focus on economic growth while respecting members' right to regulate. Negotiations are conducted in special sessions open to all WTO members and acceding countries. Negotiations under the GATS for progressive liberalization of trade in service sectors and modes of delivery were to be completed by March 2002, later extended to the end of the DDA. Modalities and Procedures were adopted on September 3, 2003, focusing on the \"request-offer\" format for negotiating new commitments and giving special attention to the needs of developing countries. Members also agreed on modalities for negotiating credit for autonomous liberalization on March 6, 2003. After the launch of the DDA in November 2001, WTO members agreed on modalities for negotiating trade liberalization, including autonomous liberalization. The Ministerial Declaration set deadlines for market access requests and offers by June 30, 2002, and March 31, 2003, respectively. Despite progress in other DDA negotiations, the services negotiations faced challenges as deadlines passed. The DDA negotiations faced challenges as deadlines passed, leading to a potential collapse. However, a negotiating framework was established in July 2004 to put the round back on track, reaffirming the mandates of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Members were tasked with submitting initial and revised offers promptly to ensure high-quality commitments. The July 2004 framework set deadlines for negotiators to submit high-quality initial and revised offers promptly. Services were emphasized alongside agriculture and market access negotiations. Working groups handle rules negotiations, while national treatment and market access commitments are addressed by all members using the request-offer format. The negotiations on rules in the WTO are conducted by working groups of representatives of interested members. National treatment and market access commitments are addressed by all members using the request-offer format. Members submit their wish-list or request, followed by offers until consensus is reached. Unlike goods negotiations, services negotiations consist of simultaneous bilateral and plurilateral discussions. The WTO services negotiations involve simultaneous bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral negotiations among members. The negotiations have been ongoing for over five years, with delays and disappointing results similar to those in agriculture and non-agriculture market access. In 2006, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA negotiations, including services, due to disagreements on agriculture trade modalities. Negotiations resumed in 2007 and continue to the present. In July 2006, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA negotiations, including services, due to disagreements on agriculture trade modalities. Negotiations resumed in 2007 and continue to the present, with major groups of countries working to reach a consensus on negotiating objectives. The United States presented its goals for the DDA Round in July 2002, but consensus has not been reached on key issues. The United States outlined its major goals for the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) Round in July 2002, aiming to secure market access commitments from trading partners. One key objective is to address the issue of market access and national treatment commitments not being as liberal as desired. The U.S. calls for countries to bind market openness at actual levels. The United States aims to secure market access commitments from trading partners in the Doha Development Agenda Round. WTO members are urged to raise binding levels to prevent market openness from slipping. Government regulation in services trade is more prevalent than in manufactured goods trade, with GATS rules recognizing the need for regulation to ensure consumer health and safety. The United States is pushing for market access commitments in the Doha Development Agenda Round. Government regulation in services trade is more common than in manufactured goods trade, with different agencies regulating various service sectors. Lack of transparency in regulations is a barrier for U.S. service providers in foreign markets. The U.S. wants WTO member countries to establish clear domestic procedures for licenses and authorizations. The United States is urging WTO member countries to establish clear domestic procedures for licenses and authorizations, provide transparency in regulations, and eliminate unnecessary restrictions on foreign direct investment across all sectors. U.S. service providers emphasize the importance of having a commercial presence in local markets to conduct business. The United States is urging WTO members to eliminate restrictions on foreign direct investment across all sectors, including in financial services like insurance, banking, and securities. They are also requesting commitments to improve market access, transparency, and fairness in applying regulations. Specifically, in insurance, the US proposed initiatives to expedite market entry. Additionally, they are seeking increased market access in telecommunications services. The United States is pushing for WTO members to remove foreign direct investment restrictions in various sectors, including insurance, banking, and securities. They are also seeking increased market access in telecommunications services, road freight transport, and express delivery services. Additionally, the US is addressing issues of cross-subsidization in express delivery services. The United States is urging WTO members to address cross-subsidization in express delivery services and increase market access in energy services, including energy exploration, transmission, marketing, trading, conservation, and anti-pollution services. They are also requesting commitments on third-party access to energy transportation facilities and increased market access for environmental protection services. The United States is prioritizing services that protect the environment in negotiations, requesting increased market access for wastewater treatment, waste management, and biodiversity protection services. They also seek full market access for retail, wholesale, and franchising services, including remote delivery options. Additionally, the U.S. is including higher education and training services in their requests, excluding primary education. The United States is requesting increased market access for various services including wastewater treatment, waste management, biodiversity protection, retail, wholesale, franchising, higher education, and training services. This includes removing citizenship requirements for licensing, foreign ownership restrictions, and restrictions on associations with local professionals. The United States has requested increased market access for computer and related services, including computer consulting, software development, data processing, and systems integration and maintenance services. They have also requested improved market access commitments for audiovisual and advertising services. The U.S. presented initial and revised offers to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers. The United States has presented initial and revised offers to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers, including commitments to refrain from reducing current trade liberalization levels. The U.S. defends its offers by stating that its services markets are already open and competitive, expecting WTO members to meet U.S. standards. The United States has made offers to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers, with commitments to protect competitive sectors. However, not all U.S. WTO-trading partners are satisfied with the offers, which include horizontal commitments such as temporary entry of personnel for specific groups working for foreign firms with affiliates in the U.S. for limited durations. The United States allows temporary entry for various categories of personnel, including salespersons, inter-corporate transferees, personnel establishing a business entity, fashion models, and service providers in specialty occupations. Foreigners engaged in providing scheduled services are taxed similarly to U.S. residents, with some exceptions. The United States restricts initial land acquisition to U.S. citizens. Foreigners providing scheduled services are taxed like U.S. residents. The U.S. offers commitments in various sectors like business services, market research, and public opinion. Exceptions in business services mostly involve state restrictions on foreign providers. The United States has offered commitments in various services sectors including market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture-related services, telecommunication services, retail trade services, higher education, financial services, health and social services, travel and tourism, transportation services, energy services, and construction. Exceptions in business services mainly involve state restrictions on foreign providers. The United States has offered commitments in various services sectors including market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture-related services, telecommunication services, retail trade services, higher education, environmental services, financial services, health and social services, travel and tourism, recreational, cultural and specialty services, transportation services, energy services, and construction. Developing countries have criticized the U.S. for not offering broader commitments, especially in maritime and postal services. India criticizes U.S. commitments in mode-4 delivery, arguing for access for software specialists and computer experts not affiliated with Indian-owned firms in the United States. Negotiations for the DDA have been delayed past the original deadline of January 1, 2005, due to the complexity of the issues. Negotiations for the DDA have been delayed past the original deadline of January 1, 2005, due to the complexity of the issues. The United States and the EU proposed establishing \"benchmarks\" in core sectors like financial services, telecommunications, energy, express delivery, computer services, and audio-visual services. The negotiating format and challenges have slowed down the process. The EU and the US proposed \"benchmarks\" in core sectors for DDA negotiations, facing opposition from developing countries who preferred the \"request-offer\" format. Developing countries feared developed nations would influence the focus of benchmarks. US services business community expressed concerns about diverting attention. Some developing countries opposed benchmarks in DDA negotiations, fearing they would favor sectors favored by developed countries. The US services business community expressed concerns about diverting attention from negotiations. Canada, supported by the US and other developed countries, proposed changes to the negotiating process to jumpstart services negotiations. The US pushed for clearer concessions from countries before completing agriculture and non-agricultural negotiations to address frustrations with the current sequencing. Developing countries have rejected a proposal to change the sequencing of negotiations in the WTO, insisting on maintaining the current order. The positive list approach for market access commitments has been criticized for potentially hindering liberalization efforts, although it is seen as a way to engage reluctant members. The WTO negotiations on services involve the positive list approach for market access commitments, which some view as a way to engage reluctant members. The United States prefers the \"negative list\" approach for free trade agreements. Mode-4 delivery is a contentious issue, causing division between developed and developing countries, with criticism directed at the U.S. despite its small global impact. The controversy surrounding mode-4 delivery in WTO negotiations stems from its connection to immigration policies, particularly in the United States post-9/11. Despite accounting for less than 1% of global trade in services, mode-4 has caused tension between the U.S. business community and government. The controversy surrounding mode-4 delivery in WTO negotiations is linked to immigration policies, especially in the United States post-9/11. Developing countries criticize the U.S. for limited mode-4 commitments, with India opposing visa restrictions on temporary workers and calling for transparency in U.S. immigration regulations. Congressional authority is also a concern in addressing the mode-4 issue. The mode-4 issue in U.S. immigration regulations has become a matter of congressional authority. In 2003, Senate and House Judiciary Committees objected to visa policy changes being included in trade agreements, leading to compromises but bipartisan warnings against such inclusions in the future. The U.S. business community advocates for more flexibility in mode-4 offers. The U.S. business community is pushing for more flexibility in mode-4 offers to advance negotiations, proposing alternative options. However, little progress has been made on establishing rules for subsidies and emergency safeguard measures for services, which developing countries, especially in East Asia, prioritize. Negotiators are struggling to resolve key questions on countervailable subsidies and safeguard measures for import surges. Negotiations at the WTO have faced challenges in resolving key issues such as countervailable subsidies, safeguard measures, and government procurement. Services negotiations have not progressed significantly, with offers from many members, especially developing countries, remaining unchanged from previous commitments. The current offers are found to be 1.9 times more restrictive than actual policies, indicating a lack of willingness to lock in trade in services. The WTO services negotiations have been hindered by members' reluctance to lock in trade restrictions, leading to slow progress. The negotiations were suspended in 2006 due to disagreements among key members, and even after resuming in 2007, little headway has been made. Progress in the WTO services negotiations has been slow due to disagreements between developed and developing countries. The lack of advancement is attributed to the division between countries with advanced services sectors and those with less-developed industries. The halt in agriculture and NAMA negotiations has also impeded progress in services negotiations. Developing countries are reluctant to improve their offers until the United States and the European Union make concessions. The slow progress in WTO services negotiations is hindered by disagreements between developed and developing countries, with agriculture and NAMA talks also impacting services negotiations. Developing countries link their offers to reductions in US and EU agriculture subsidies. The complexity of services negotiations, involving diverse economic activities, and varying trade barriers pose challenges in formulating trade rules. \"Services negotiations in the WTO face challenges due to differences in trade barriers across sectors and the involvement of various participants. The progress is slow as participants wait to reveal their best negotiating positions close to deadlines. The completion of negotiations depends on political will and willingness of participants to overcome obstacles.\" The WTO services negotiations face challenges in reaching deadlines. Factors such as political will, willingness to compromise, and resolving issues in agriculture and market access affect the progress. The sixth WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong aimed to accelerate negotiations for completion by the end of 2006, with a focus on the needs of developing countries. The WTO services negotiations aimed to conclude by the end of 2006, with a focus on the needs of developing countries. However, by the end of 2007, countries were still divided on key objectives, with developed countries pushing for binding commitments on trade in services while developing countries resisted. In 2008, WTO General Director Lamy called a ministerial meeting in Geneva to discuss agriculture and NAMA negotiations. A \"signaling\" conference was held with 32 representatives to gauge offers and expectations, but little progress was made. The WTO members held \"cluster\" meetings in 2009 to boost negotiations, but progress was limited. Little was achieved in services negotiations in 2010 due to reluctance to increase liberalization levels. Senator Grassley expressed concern over the stalled Doha services negotiations."
