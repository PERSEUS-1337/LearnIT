    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the official title. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes under the Clean Air Act. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to provide estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator must report on each cellulosic biofuel production facility's output during the period from January 1 to October 31 of the current calendar year. The Energy Information Administration must determine the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility based on actual production during a specific period. The Energy Information Administration determines the estimated annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility based on the average monthly production volume. The Energy Information Administration estimates the annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility based on monthly production averages. For each cellulosic biofuel production facility starting production after January 1 of the current year, specific requirements apply. The Energy Information Administration estimates the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility based on actual production from initial production to October 31. The Energy Information Administration estimates the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility from initial production to October 31 of the current calendar year. The Energy Information Administration estimates the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility to determine the annualized volume for the current calendar year. The Energy Information Administration estimates the annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility to determine the total production for the following calendar year. This involves projecting the volume of cellulosic biofuel production for all facilities described in the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify the exact volume for cellulosic biofuel production and exclude compressed biofuel from the definition. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify the volume for cellulosic biofuel production and exclude compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and electricity from biogas in certain facilities. The Clean Air Act is amended to regulate cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways, specifically addressing existing and new biofuel pathways under the renewable fuel standard. Amendments made by subsection (c) override conflicting provisions in the final rule of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Clean Air Act is amended to regulate cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways under the renewable fuel standard. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is required to reissue a rule to conform to the amendments made. The cellulosic biofuel mandate for calendar year 2014 is removed."
