    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries affected by subsidized imports. Relief is provided through additional import duties equal to the estimated subsidy amount. Two conditions must be met for relief: the International Trade Commission must find material injury to the domestic industry, and the International Trade Administration must confirm the subsidies. Before a 2007 investigation on CFS paper from China, CVD laws were not applied to nonmarket economy countries like China. The ITA found subsidies in China for CFS paper in a 2007 investigation, despite previously considering China a nonmarket economy. This decision was specific to China and not applicable to other nonmarket economy countries. The ITA found subsidies in China for CFS paper in a 2007 investigation, despite previously considering China a nonmarket economy. This subsidy decision is specific to China and not applicable to other NME countries. The ITA designates NME countries based on various criteria such as currency convertibility, wage rates, government control of production means, and resource allocation. The ITA designates NME countries based on criteria like currency convertibility, wage rates, and government control of production means. NME countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. China, designated in 1983, is the US's second largest trading partner. China, designated as an NME country in 1983, is the United States' second largest trading partner with a significant trade deficit of $227 billion in 2009. There are concerns about the adverse impact of Chinese imports on U.S. industries and workers, leading to calls for increased use of trade remedy laws against Chinese products. Allegations of China using \"illegal\" subsidy programs to boost its industries and exports have been a longstanding issue for U.S. domestic producers. The 1984 ITA ruling limited recourse for U.S. producers impacted by China's subsidies. China faces over 80 antidumping duty orders, with higher duties for Chinese imports due to ITA methodology. Concerns persist about China's undervalued currency boosting exports and contributing to the U.S. trade deficit. The undervalued Chinese currency is believed to make Chinese exports cheaper, contributing to the U.S. trade deficit and harming U.S. production in various sectors. Allegations of Chinese currency manipulation have sparked congressional interest in countervailing actions. For more information on recent legislation regarding currency misalignment, refer to CRS Report RS21625, China's Currency: An Analysis of the Economic Issues. The ITA determined NME classification for China in 1983 and reaffirmed it in 2006. U.S. law states that a country remains NME until revoked by the ITA. Subsidies could not be found in NME countries, so no countervailing action was taken against China. The ITA determined China as a nonmarket economy country in 1983 and reaffirmed it in 2006. Subsidies were not found in NME countries, so no countervailing action was taken against China until the CFS paper investigation in 2007. China's NME designation can only be used for 15 years after its WTO accession, after which the US and other WTO members cannot use nonmarket economy methodology in CVD or AD investigations. The United States and other WTO members can no longer use nonmarket economy methodology in CVD or AD investigations after December 11, 2016. In 1983-1984, the US had two countervailing duty laws in force, requiring determination of subsidization and injury to domestic industry. The earlier countervailing duty law in the US required a finding of injury to domestic industry caused by subsidized imports. It was repealed in January 1995 and applied to products from countries not \"under the Agreement\" defined by GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code. The countervailing duty law in the US was repealed in January 1995, which required a finding of injury to domestic industry caused by subsidized imports. The law applied to products from countries not \"under the Agreement\" defined by GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 implemented provisions of the international Subsidies and Countervailing Code agreed upon in GATT meetings. It required a determination of injury to US industry caused by subsidized imports for countervailing duty assessment. The URAA repealed this law in 1995. The URAA repealed the countervailing duty law of the 1979 Act and incorporated provisions requiring injury determination in countervailing investigations of subsidized imports. Parallel investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports were initiated in 1983. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 is still in effect, with countervailing duty investigations initiated in 1983 on carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland. Allegations were made regarding public benefits received by manufacturers in both countries, including bounties, grants, multiple exchange rate systems, and tax exemptions for foreign trade earnings. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 led to countervailing duty investigations on carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland. Both countries had public benefits for manufacturers, such as bounties, grants, multiple exchange rate systems, and tax exemptions for foreign trade earnings. The investigations found similarities in the issues, with minor country-specific differences. The ITA considered both countries \"countries not under the Agreement\" and conducted the countervailing procedure without the need for determining injury. The ITA initiated countervailing duty investigations on carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland, considering them nonmarket economy countries. The ITA found that the countervailing duty law applies to nonmarket economy countries in the preliminary determinations. The CVD petition was withdrawn by the petitioners, leading to the termination of the investigation. The ITA found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from the countervailing duty law based on statutory terms and legislative history. The ITA decided not to exclude nonmarket economies without further review in each case. Government intervention in market and nonmarket economies was addressed by the ITA, which determined that nonmarket economies should not be automatically excluded from countervailing duty laws. The ITA focused on how prices are set in nonmarket economies by central planners, highlighting that prices do not reflect scarcity or abundance as in market economies. Prices in nonmarket economies only increase if mandated by central planners, rather than based on market conditions. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they would confer a subsidy in a market economy and if the conclusion would differ for a nonmarket economy. It concluded that certain programs did not constitute a bounty or grant in either type of economy. The ITA found that price equalization payments and adjustment coefficient programs did not constitute bounties or grants in market or nonmarket economies. The agency continued investigations into Czechoslovak and Polish practices, determining they did not violate the CVD law. The final phase focused on applying the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries in carbon steel wire rod cases. In the final phase of the investigations, the ITA addressed the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries. Congress had not directly tackled this issue in 1974 or 1979 when the CVD law was amended. The ITA found it significant that Congress enacted remedial provisions in the Trade Act of 1974. In 1979, the CVD law was restructured, focusing on unfair pricing legislation related to dumping by NME countries. Congress recognized the need for special remedial legislation for State-controlled-economy countries in the Trade Act of 1974. In 1979, the CVD law was restructured to address unfair pricing related to dumping by NME countries. Congress acknowledged the necessity for special legislation for State-controlled-economy countries in the Trade Act of 1974. The CVD law addresses unfair pricing related to dumping by NME countries. The law permits regulation of unfairly priced imports from NME countries under antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. It is difficult to identify and quantify subsidies in NMEs due to the lack of market reference points. The countervailing duty law requires measurement of a resource transfer from the state to the producer, which is challenging in nonmarket economies. The countervailing duty law is challenging to apply in nonmarket economies like Czechoslovakia and Poland, as it is difficult to measure subsidies due to the lack of market reference points. The ITA concluded that bounties or grants cannot be found in NMEs, making it unclear if manufacturers in these countries receive such benefits. The ITA determined that manufacturers in Czechoslovakia and Poland did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations. Subsequent investigations were initiated for potassium chloride imports from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union. The ITA rescinded potassium chloride investigations due to the determination that bounties or grants cannot be found in NMEs. A countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China was initiated based on a petition claiming China operates under market principles. The ITA initiated a countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China based on a petition claiming the Chinese fan industry operates under market principles and provides self-provided data. The ITA concluded in its final investigation that the Chinese fan industry is not an MOI due to non-market-determined input prices, leading to a final negative determination in the CVD case. The ITA concluded that the PC fans industry is not an MOI due to non-market-determined input prices, leading to a final negative determination in the CVD case. The U.S. Court of International Trade held that countervailing duty law covers countries with nonmarket economies, reversing the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanding them for consistent determinations. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them for consistent determinations, addressing the applicability of countervailing duty law to countries with nonmarket economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them for consistent determinations regarding the applicability of countervailing duty law to countries with nonmarket economies. The court criticized the ITA for incorrectly interpreting the law and creating exemptions for nonmarket economy countries. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies in the carbon steel wire rod cases, stating that the ITA had redefined the term \"subsidy\" to exempt these countries, which contradicted the CVD law. The court emphasized that the ITA should focus on detecting patterns of regularity and investigating measurement issues within its expertise. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies in the carbon steel wire rod cases, stating that the ITA had redefined the term \"subsidy\" to exempt these countries, which contradicted the CVD law. The court emphasized that the ITA should focus on detecting patterns of regularity and investigating measurement issues within its expertise, regardless of the form of the economy. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies in the carbon steel wire rod cases. The court dismissed the ITA's reliance on economic academia's views and emphasized the choice countries have between using subsidy law or antidumping law for imports from state-controlled economies. The court did not directly address the ITA's claim of broad discretion in determining subsidies but challenged it implicitly in a critique of administrative actions. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies in the carbon steel wire rod cases. The court implicitly challenged ITA's broad discretion in determining subsidies, stating that administrative actions were contrary to law and attempted to amend the countervailing law by administrative fiat. The U.S. government appealed the CIT decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the legislative history of the CVD statute and found it had remained substantially unchanged since 1897. Congress had not defined the terms 'bounty' and 'grant' as used in section 303. The appellate court criticized the ITA for creating exemptions for countries with nonmarket economies in the carbon steel wire rod cases. It stated that Congress had not defined the terms 'bounty' and 'grant' as used in section 303, and therefore could not determine if the section applies to nonmarket economies. The court had to determine if Congress would have applied the countervailing duty law to nonmarket economies when it was enacted in 1897. The appellate court had to determine if Congress would have applied the countervailing duty law to nonmarket economies when it was enacted in 1897. The court concluded that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany did not constitute bounties or grants under the applicable CVD law. The court also recognized the ITA's broad discretion in determining the existence of a 'bounty' or 'grant' under the law. The Court of Appeals recognized the ITA's discretion in determining bounties or grants under the countervailing duty law. It vacated the CIT order in the wire rod cases and remanded them for lack of jurisdiction. Additionally, it reversed the CIT order in the potash cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the CIT order in the potash cases and triggered a reaction in Congress, leading to the introduction of H.R. 3 in the 100th Congress. This bill aimed to apply countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy countries and included detailed procedural provisions. The proposed statute in H.R. 3 aimed to apply countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy countries, with detailed procedural provisions. The Senate version did not include a requirement for injury determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission, which was present in the House-passed language. Companion bills S. 770 and H.R. 1687 were introduced but not further considered. The application of countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy countries was addressed in subsequent Congresses. In subsequent Congresses, the application of countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy (NME) countries was further considered. The 103rd and 104th Congresses expanded the definition of \"countervailable subsidy\" to NME countries, prescribing the determination of its amount using a surrogate market-economy country method. Identical provisions were included in bills introduced in the 104th, 106th, 107th, and 108th Congresses, applying the countervailing duty law to NME countries for investigations of subsidies provided after a certain date. In the 106th through 108th Congresses, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy (NME) countries for investigations of subsidies provided after a certain date. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from NME countries based on petitions filed after the enactment of the legislation. The Overseas Subsidies Act of 2005 and H.R. 1216 aimed to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries based on petitions filed after the enactment of the legislation. H.R. 3306, the Fair Trade with China Act of 2005, extended this to all NME countries, including China, with no impact on their NME status. The provision aimed to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries, including China, triggered by alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation. Several bills in the 110th Congress sought to extend countervailing duty law to NME countries. Several bills in the 110th and 111th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy (NME) countries, including China, to address alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation. The \"Nonmarket Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2009\" seeks to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership or economic reforms. It would also prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in AD proceedings. The bills aim to prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in AD proceedings and provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidies. Administrative authorities would use specific methodologies to calculate benefits in China, considering the unique market conditions. The bills aim to direct authorities to use specific methodologies to calculate subsidies in China, taking into account unique market conditions and the possibility that Chinese terms may not be applicable as benchmarks. If China is deemed a non-market economy country, authorities are directed to presume special difficulties in considering and adjusting for Chinese terms, and to use terms prevailing outside of China to calculate subsidies. The bills aim to amend current law regarding China's NME status and subsidies. The Bush Administration took steps to address China's alleged subsidies, including initiating a CVD investigation and consultations in the WTO. In late 2006, the ITA initiated a CVD investigation on China's alleged subsidies of exports, including a case on CFS paper. The ITC preliminarily determined that a U.S. domestic industry was materially injured by subsidized coated paper from China. The ITA made an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy in the CVD investigation on March 30, 2007. The ITA made an affirmative preliminary determination of subsidy in the CVD investigation on coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China. Final subsidy rates ranged from 7.40% to 44.25%, with the ITA noting China's significant state role in the economy. The ITA concluded in its preliminary investigation on CFS paper that China has preserved a significant state role in its economy. Despite reaffirming China's status as an NME country, the agency noted significant differences in China's economy compared to Soviet-style economies. Central planners set prices, cover losses, control investment decisions, allocate money and credit, set wage bills, restrict access to foreign currency, and limit private ownership to consumer goods. The ITA determined that market forces determine prices for over 90% of products in China, wages are negotiated, foreign currency access is easier, and private ownership rights are recognized by the government. Despite being an NME country, China has reduced the state's role in some areas while maintaining control over the economy. The ITC announced a negative determination of injury in both countervailing and antidumping investigations on CFS paper. Factors considered include the modest increase in production capacity in China and Indonesia, lack of evidence of significant price effects from imports, and the conclusion that the domestic industry is not vulnerable. Based on the ITC's negative determination of injury in countervailing and antidumping investigations on CFS paper, it was found that material injury by reason of subject imports from China and Indonesia will not occur. The investigation was terminated, and all duties deposited or bonds posted were refunded or canceled. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, but no countervailing duties were ultimately imposed. The ITA's investigation resulted in refunds or cancellations of duties. Although no countervailing duties were imposed on Chinese products, a subsequent investigation in 2008 led to the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. China filed a lawsuit to prevent further CVD investigations, citing a court decision that the CVD law did not apply to NME countries. The Court of International Trade did not have jurisdiction to hear a case regarding the application of countervailing duty law to NME countries. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the US on CFS paper duties, but no further action has been taken. China has been actively using antidumping (AD) investigations against products from the United States since joining the WTO. In 2009, China initiated its first countervailing duty (CVD) case. As of March 2010, Chinese authorities had 3 ongoing CVD investigations on U.S. products. The U.S. Trade Representative requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies, leading to the termination of one challenged subsidy program. The U.S. Trade Representative requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies. China agreed to terminate one of the challenged subsidy programs, which allowed large exporters to benefit from discounted loans. The U.S. pointed to tax laws and measures used by China to provide tax refunds or exemptions to businesses purchasing domestically produced goods. These subsidies were said to distort trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and small and medium-sized enterprises. China agreed to terminate subsidies that distorted trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and SMEs by January 1, 2008, as requested by the U.S. Trade Representative. This included eliminating WTO-prohibited subsidies, as confirmed in the 2010 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers. China agreed to terminate subsidies that distorted trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and SMEs by January 1, 2008, as requested by the U.S. Trade Representative. A settlement agreement was reached in December 2009 in which China confirmed the elimination of challenged export-contingent benefits. Despite the ITA's identification of subsidies in China, some in Congress intended to combat unfair trade practices affecting American workers, farmers, and businesses. Congress may want to consider legislation ensuring that the CVD laws and actions specifically apply to other NME countries as well as China, such as Vietnam, another significant U.S. trading partner. Congress may want to consider legislation ensuring that CVD laws apply to other NME countries like Vietnam. Trade with other NME countries is not significant, and there are no outstanding trade disputes. Currently, there are no specific methodologies for identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies. The antidumping statute provides a methodology for determining normal value in nonmarket economy (NME) countries, allowing for the calculation of expenses using inputs from a market economy. Countervailing duties (CVD) procedures have trade-offs, with AD duties typically higher than CVD duties. AD duties on imports from NME countries are even higher due to the third-country data methodology. If China maintains its NME status and subsidies are found on targeted merchandise subject to AD duties, some AD duties may need to be adjusted to avoid double counting. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the uncertainty in calculating the total protection level for Chinese products if subsidies are targeted. This could lead to lower combined rates than expected, potentially reducing overall protection. However, targeting subsidies in China or amending legislation could unintentionally decrease the level of protection provided. Targeting subsidies in China or amending legislation may unintentionally reduce overall protection levels for Chinese products. However, this could also allow some U.S. industries that previously couldn't obtain relief through the AD statute to do so through CVD procedures."
