    "content": "During a confirmation hearing in January 2009, OMB Director-designate Peter Orszag discussed plans for oversight of the economic stimulus package. The incoming Administration favored creating a special oversight board chaired by a Chief Performance Officer. They planned to create a website with information on contracts and financial details. The Obama Administration planned to create a website, Recovery.gov, to provide information on contracts and financial details related to the stimulus legislation. The website aimed to increase transparency and oversight to prevent waste and inefficiency in government spending. The House and Senate included oversight provisions in economic stimulus legislation to root out waste and inefficiency. Concerns were raised about agencies' capacity to spend funds rapidly while improving competition and oversight. The House passed its version of the bill on January 28, 2009, and the Senate passed its version on February 10, 2009. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is tasked with overseeing the stimulus legislation passed by the House and Senate in early 2009. Challenges include balancing speed with prudence and reconciling values of transparency, accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in crisis response. Building the capacity of federal agencies and Congress for the long term is also a concern. The federal government faces challenges in balancing speed with prudence and reconciling values of transparency, accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in crisis response. Long-term issues include building the capacity of federal agencies, Congress, and the President to better respond to crises, as well as anticipating and avoiding preventable crises. The 9-11 Commission highlighted the importance of \"institutionalizing imagination\" to address these challenges. The federal government operates as a system of \"nested\" oversight, with multiple entities engaging in simultaneous oversight activities. The federal government operates as a system of \"nested\" oversight, with multiple entities engaging in simultaneous oversight activities. Congress oversees the President and agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Inspectors general and congressional support agencies like the Government Accountability Office (GAO) assist with oversight. OMB has a statutory responsibility to provide management leadership for agencies, monitoring and overseeing their activities. Agencies oversee their own activities through organizational and procedural arrangements mandated by Congress. GAO may oversee OMB's oversight of an agency's activities. In developing an oversight framework, there are multiple perspectives on objectives, including compliance with laws, faithful implementation of congressional intent, avoidance of mismanagement, and ensuring fair allocation of resources and policy execution. Tools like monitoring, analysis, and evaluation are used in oversight activities. In oversight activities, key objectives include compliance with laws, congressional intent, avoidance of mismanagement, fair allocation of resources, and policy execution. Implementation agencies, nonfederal recipients, OMB, oversight board, and IGs will play roles in oversight. Selected general oversight provisions in economic stimulus legislation are analyzed in Table 1. Table 1 summarizes key oversight provisions in the House- and Senate-passed economic stimulus legislation. References to \"the Act\" in each bill generally pertain to either Division A or Division B, not the entire bill."
