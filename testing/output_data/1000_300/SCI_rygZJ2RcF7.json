A new technique called neuron editing aims to address this issue by learning how neurons encode edits for specific transformations in a latent space. This method uses an autoencoder to decompose dataset variations into neuron activations and generate transformed data by editing these neurons. Neuron editing involves using an autoencoder to decompose dataset variations into neuron activations and generate transformed data by defining editing transformations on those neurons. This technique allows for complex transformations in a latent space with simpler distribution shifts to neuron activations. It has been applied to image domain/style transfer and biological applications such as removing batch artifacts and predicting drug synergy. In biology, experiments study treatment effects on samples like cells. Typically, only a subset of samples is used, assuming generalization without modeling interactions with context. Proposing a neural network method to learn treatment effects beyond measured samples, offering flexibility in data transformation. We propose a neural network-based method for learning a general edit function corresponding to treatment in the biological setting. This method aims to go beyond the samples measured and generalize treatment effects to other datasets. The approach involves training an autoencoder neural network with non-linear activations to learn an edit function, termed neuron editing, in the latent space. Neuron editing is a method proposed to extract differences between pre-and post-treatment data using an autoencoder neural network. This allows for the generation of post-treatment data from pre-treatment samples in a biological setting. Neuron editing involves extracting differences between pre-and post-treatment activation distributions for neurons and applying them to generate post-treatment data. This technique encodes complex edits in the ambient space using denoised features. The focus is on autoencoders for modeling distribution transformations in high-dimensional space. In this work, the focus is on leveraging the advantages of autoencoders for modeling complex distribution transformations in high-dimensional space. By working in a lower-dimensional manifold, the autoencoder can learn transformations that would otherwise be infeasible in the original ambient space. Editing the neural network internal layer allows for modeling context dependence. By editing the neural network internal layer, complex effects can be simplified into distribution shifts, making computations more efficient. Neurons in the internal layer show varying changes post-treatment, with some heavily edited for context dependence. Editing in a low-dimensional internal layer allows for modifications on a denoised version of the data, enabling more predictive treatment outcomes. Neurons in the internal layer are edited to simplify complex effects into distribution shifts, improving computational efficiency. Editing in a low-dimensional internal layer allows for modifications on a denoised version of the data, leading to more predictive treatment outcomes. The assumption is made that internal neurons have semantic consistency across the data, which is supported by the autoencoder learning a joint manifold of all given data. Neurons in the internal layer are edited to simplify complex effects into distribution shifts, improving computational efficiency. The autoencoder learns a joint manifold of all given data, showing that neurons encode the same types of features for every data manifold. Neuron editing extrapolates better than generative models, producing more complex variation by preserving existing data variation. Comparisons with generation-based approaches show the effectiveness of neuron editing. Neuron editing simplifies complex effects into distribution shifts, improving computational efficiency. Comparisons with generation-based approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of neuron editing in preserving existing data variation and producing more complex variation. In the following section, the neuron editing method is detailed, followed by a discussion on the extrapolation problem in natural image domain transfer. Two biological applications where extrapolation is crucial are correcting batch effects and predicting combinatorial drug effects. The goal is to find a transformation that aligns source and target distributions while maintaining identity on the target distribution.GANs are used to learn this transformation. The text discusses using GANs to learn a transformation that aligns source and target distributions while maintaining identity on the target distribution. Instead of learning this transformation directly, they define it on a learned space using an encoder/decoder pair to map data into an abstract neuron space. The text discusses training an encoder/decoder pair to map data into an abstract neuron space decomposed into high-level features. It then introduces a piecewise linear transformation called NeuronEdit applied to distributions of activations from different inputs. The NeuronEdit function operates on distributions of activations from network inputs, transforming them based on the difference between source and target distributions. It exhibits properties of a GAN generator and guarantees piecewise linearity. The NeuronEdit function, resembling a GAN generator, ensures consistency in neuron editing between source and extrapolation distributions. The transformation is applied by extracting and cascading neuron activations through the encoder and decoder without additional training. The nomenclature of an autoencoder becomes less relevant in this process. The transformed outputX is obtained by applying neuron editing without additional training, turning an autoencoder into a generative model. Training a GAN in this setting exclusively utilizes data in S and T. Neuron editing can model the intrinsic variation in X unsupervised, providing more information compared to GANs. The text discusses how GANs struggle with training due to issues like oscillating optimization dynamics, uninterpretable losses, and mode collapse. Mode collapse occurs when the discriminator cannot distinguish between real and fake examples, leading to the generator producing similar outputs for different inputs. This hinders the detection of differences in distributions, even without mode collapse. Neuron editing offers a solution to the limitations of GANs in generating diverse distributions by learning an unsupervised model of the data space with an autoencoder. It isolates the variation in neuron activations to differentiate between source and target distributions, similar to word2vec embeddings in natural language. Neuron editing is an extension of word2vec embeddings, allowing for transformation of entire distributions rather than single points. It is compared to generating methods like autoencoders and GANs. Neuron editing is compared to various generating methods like autoencoders and GANs. The regularized autoencoder penalized differences in distributions using maximal mean discrepancy. Different layer configurations were used for image experiments and all models used leaky ReLU activation. Training was done with minibatches and the adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. A motivational experiment was conducted on the CelebA dataset. In all cases, leaky ReLU activation was used with 0.2 leak. Training was done with minibatches of size 100, with the adam optimizer BID16, and a learning rate of 0.001. A motivational experiment on the CelebA dataset illustrated the limitations of training a generative model to map between images with different attributes like hair color. The limitations of training a generative model to map between images with different attributes like hair color are illustrated in a motivational experiment on the CelebA dataset. GAN models struggle to successfully model transformations on out-of-sample data, resulting in artifacts and inconsistencies, highlighting the benefits of stable training methods like autoencoders. The benefits of stable training methods like autoencoders are highlighted due to the artifacts in regular GAN models. Neuron editing is shown to be effective in transforming neural networks, particularly in batch correction to address technical measurement artifacts. Neuron editing's ability to learn can be applied to batch correction, addressing differences in data caused by technical artifacts. Batch effects are common in biological experimental data and can lead to incorrect conclusions. Various models, including deep learning methods, aim to tackle this issue by measuring an identical control set of cells with each sample and correcting based on the variation in the control. One method for addressing batch effects in biological data is to measure an identical control set of cells with each sample and correct based on the variation in the control. In a mass cytometry experiment measuring protein levels in cells from individuals infected with dengue virus, neuron editing is used to compare transformed samples to raw cells, removing measurement-induced variation. The dataset analyzed in this section is from a mass cytometry experiment measuring protein levels in cells from individuals infected with dengue virus. The data consists of 35 dimensions with different observations for Control1, Control2, Sample1, and Sample2. There are technical artifacts creating variation between the two samples, with one batch effect identified in Control1. The model aims to compensate for this variation without losing other true biological differences in Sample1. The model aims to compensate for the variation in the protein levels of InfG in Control1 without losing other true biological differences in Sample1. However, the GANs used in the analysis fail to capture the variation in the protein CCR6, leading to all cells being mapped to similar values. This results in the loss of important biological information, making later comparisons unreliable. The ResnetGAN fails to capture variation in protein CCR6, leading to all cells being mapped to similar values. This results in the loss of important biological information, making later comparisons unreliable. The regularized autoencoder undoes transformations to its latent space, producing unchanged data. Neuron editing decomposes variability into the separation between controls and edits the sample to include this variation. The regularized autoencoder has learned to undo transformations to its latent space and produce unchanged data. Neuron editing decomposes variability into the separation between controls and edits the sample to include this variation, removing batch effects. Neuron editing successfully transforms proteins InfG and CCR6, confirmed globally across all dimensions. In a PCA embedding, the transformation from Control1 to Control2 mirrors the transformation applied to Sample1. In a PCA embedding, the variation between controls accurately reflects the variation introduced by neuron editing into the sample. This offers additional corroboration that the transformations produced by neuron editing reasonably reflect the transformation as evidenced by the controls. Additionally, biological data from a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is considered. The dataset consists of cells from a sample batch corrected based on the difference in a repeatedly measured control. The dataset analyzed includes biological data from a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The measurements were taken under four treatments using mass cytometry. Various methods were used to correct batch effects and preserve true biological variation, with neuron editing showing promising results. Neuron editing corrects batch effects in IFNg while preserving biological variation in CCR6 under four treatments. The measurements are from mass cytometry on 41 dimensions, with distinct datasets for each treatment. Neuron editing accurately models the effects of applying Das to cells treated with Bez, showing a decrease in p4EBP1 without losing variation. The effect of applying Das is a decrease in p4EBP1 without changing pSTATS. Neuron editing accurately models this change without introducing vertical shifts. Regularized autoencoder does not alter output despite internal manipulations. GAN models fail to predict the real combination accurately, introducing vertical shifts and losing original variability. ResnetGAN struggles to mimic the target despite residual connections. Neuron editing accurately predicts the transformation across all dimensions, preserving the principle direction and magnitude. Comparing real and predicted means and variances shows its effectiveness globally. ResnetGAN struggles to mimic the target despite residual connections. Neuron editing accurately predicts transformation across all dimensions, preserving direction and magnitude. It better preserves data variation compared to GAN. The approach addresses data transformation in clinical trials or experimental settings with limited data subsets. Neuron editing is a novel approach that utilizes autoencoder latent layers to apply treatment effects to the rest of the dataset. By editing neurons in internal layers, realistic transformations of image data can be achieved, predicting synergistic effects of drug treatments in biological data. This method allows for learning complex data transformations in a hidden layer's non-linear dimensionality reduced space. The method of neuron editing utilizes autoencoder latent layers to apply treatment effects to the dataset, achieving realistic transformations of image data and predicting synergistic effects of drug treatments in biological data. Learning complex data transformations in a hidden layer's non-linear dimensionality reduced space allows for interactions between the edit and other context information during decoding. Future work could involve training parallel encoders with the same decoder or training to generate conditionally."
