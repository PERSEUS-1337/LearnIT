    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 2007\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989, ensuring a transitional increase amount is factored into their primary insurance amount calculation. The term 'applicable transitional increase amount' is defined as the excess under former law multiplied by the applicable percentage in relation to the year the individual becomes eligible for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for individuals becoming eligible for benefits in different years ranges from 60 percent in 1979 or 1980 to 10 percent in 1987 or 1988. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between the former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary amount. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between an individual's applicable former law primary insurance amount and their primary insurance amount calculated under current law. The primary insurance amount is determined under section 215(a) or computed/recomputed under subsection (d), modified as provided. In calculating the amount, certain provisions apply, including the exclusion of subsection (b)(4) and the inclusion of specific calendar years for computation base years. The primary insurance amount is calculated based on specific calendar years starting from 1950 (or 1936 if applicable) until the individual reaches age 61, with an additional 3 calendar years included for the highest wages and self-employment income. This calculation includes adjustments to ensure a higher primary insurance amount than if computed without these provisions. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 2007. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to benefits in December 2006 based on certain criteria. The Commissioner of Social Security will recompute benefits for individuals entitled to benefits in December 2006 under specific criteria outlined in the Social Security Act."
