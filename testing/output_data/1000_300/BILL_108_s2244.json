    "content": "The bill is titled the \"Freedom to Fish Act\" and includes findings related to fishing rights. Congress finds that recreational fishing is a popular outdoor sport with over 50 million participants nationwide, contributing $116 billion annually to the economy and supporting over 1.2 million jobs. Recreational anglers also play a vital role in conservation efforts. Recreational anglers contribute significantly to local economies and conservation efforts through expenditures and contributions to State fisheries programs. Federal policies support public access to lands and waters for recreational purposes while promoting sound conservation principles. The National Forest Management Act of 1976, Wilderness Act, Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 reflect sound conservation principles. Recreational fishery resources can be managed with measures like take limits, size requirements, and gear adaptations to maintain public access. A clear policy is needed to show recreational fishing can be managed without unnecessary restrictions. Comprehensive policy on marine protected areas is necessary to balance recreational fishing and conservation. A clear policy is needed to manage recreational fishing without unnecessary restrictions, while also maintaining the balance between recreational fishing and conservation in marine protected areas. The United States aims to promote conservation of fishery resources by ensuring federal regulations prioritize access for recreational anglers and involve them in decision-making. Restrictions on fishing areas for recreational anglers should only be imposed if scientifically necessary for conservation. Amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act are proposed. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to limit closures of recreational fishing areas unless there is clear evidence that recreational fishing is causing a specific conservation issue in the fishery. Alternative conservation measures must be considered before prohibiting recreational fishing, and specific criteria for assessing the benefits of the prohibition must be included in the management plan. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to require specific measurable criteria for assessing the conservation benefits of prohibiting recreational fishing in certain areas. The closure must be supported by the best available scientific information and reviewed every 3 years to determine if the prohibition is still necessary. The prohibition must be lifted once the conservation issue no longer exists. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to require specific measurable criteria for assessing the conservation benefits of prohibiting recreational fishing in certain areas. The closure must be supported by the best available scientific information and reviewed every 3 years to determine if the prohibition is still necessary. The prohibition must be lifted once the conservation issue no longer exists. Technical amendments are made to the section, including adjustments to paragraphs 13 and 14. SEC. 5. Amendment to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. Amendment to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act includes changes to fishing regulations within the exclusive economic zone, allowing Regional Fishery Management Councils to draft and revise regulations as needed, in accordance with the Magnuson Act. Regulations may also apply to fisheries within state boundaries. Regulations under the Magnuson Act may apply to fisheries within a state if approved by the Governor or determined by the Secretary after a hearing. The Secretary may regulate a fishery within a state if it will adversely affect the goals of the Act. The state can request a hearing under certain conditions. The Secretary may regulate a fishery within a state if it will adversely affect the goals of the Act. The state can request a hearing under certain conditions, and the Secretary must conduct a hearing before taking any action to regulate a fishery within the state. If the Secretary assumes responsibility for regulating a fishery, the state involved may terminate the regulation. If the Secretary assumes responsibility for regulating a fishery within a state, the state can later request reinstatement of its authority over the fishery. The Secretary must promptly terminate the regulation if the reasons for assuming regulation no longer exist."
