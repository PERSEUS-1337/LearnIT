    "content": "The 107th Congress approved legislation to amend and extend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act through FY2007. The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program, with the House recommending $526.0 million and the Senate recommending $492.5 million. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the program in FY2006, including $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program is currently operating at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program, funded through the No Child Left Behind Act, aims to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. It provides grants to state and local educational agencies for creating programs to deter youth from drug use and violence. National leadership projects are also supported to prevent drug abuse and violence. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program, funded through the No Child Left Behind Act, provides grants to state and local educational agencies for creating programs to deter youth from drug use and violence. National programs are supported through discretionary funds for various projects designed to prevent drug abuse and violence among all educational levels. For FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants, with specific allocations for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Indian youth programs, and native Hawaiians. $4.75 million is reserved for Indian youth programs, and 0.2% for native Hawaiians. The remaining funds are distributed to states, DC, and Puerto Rico based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A grants. States receive no less than 0.5% of total funds or their FY2001 amount. Unused funds may be redistributed, and there is a limit on fund usage timeframe. State grant funds from FY2006 are distributed equally among states, with the possibility of redistribution if funds are not used within two years. A 10% increase in national program funds is contingent on a 10% increase in state grant funding. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act removed the limitation provision for FY2006. In FY2007, the Administration did not propose funding for state grants. 20% of state allotments are allocated for competitive grants by the Governor. In FY2007, the Administration did not propose funding for state grants. 20% of state allotments are allocated for competitive grants by the Governor, with specific distribution requirements for drug and violence prevention programs. LEAs may use a limited percentage of funds for administrative costs. SEAs also have a percentage allocation for program administration. In FY2002, SEAs and LEAs could use a percentage of their allotments for administrative costs and implementing a uniform management information and reporting system (UMIRS) to collect data on truancy rates, violence, drug-related crimes, curricula, and drug use among minors. The SDFSC program provides funding for elementary and secondary schools to address drug use and violence among minors. SEAs can use up to 5% of funds for capacity building, technical assistance, and program improvement. The state grants component of the program was rated as \"ineffective\" in 2002 and 2006 by the PART instrument. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated as \"ineffective\" in 2002 and 2006 by the Administration due to the inability to demonstrate program effectiveness and the distribution of funds being too thin. Approximately 64% of LEAs received less than $10,000 per year, which was deemed insufficient for effective drug prevention and school safety programs. The program lacked measurable or positive outcomes, leading to the proposal to terminate it in order to fund higher-priority initiatives. The state grants program under the SDFSC was deemed ineffective due to a lack of measurable outcomes and insufficient funding distribution. The Administration proposed to terminate the program to allocate resources to higher-priority national programs that showed more promise in achieving results and expanding knowledge on drug and violence prevention methods. The national programs were believed to provide direct support to select LEAs with sufficient funding to make a difference, allowing for progress assessment, accountability, and effectiveness measurement. The Department of Education plans to use national survey data to assess the effectiveness of state grants in addressing teen drug use and violence. They will also evaluate the impact of interventions and provide support to improve data collection and reporting. The Department of Education is evaluating the impact of interventions and providing support to improve data collection and reporting for state grants addressing teen drug use and violence. National program funds allow collaboration with other agencies to administer programs aimed at preventing violence and illegal drug use among students. Up to $2 million may be reserved for evaluating the national impact of the program. In FY1999, the National Coordinator Initiative was created under national programs to recruit, hire, and train SDFSC program coordinators in middle schools. Middle school students are targeted for drug prevention and school safety programs. Funding for this initiative was terminated in FY2004. Funding for the National Coordinator Initiative, which aimed to address drug prevention and school safety in schools with notable issues, was terminated in FY2004. National program funds may be distributed as formula grants to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Competitive grants may also be awarded to LEAs for implementing programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools. Grants are available to LEAs and community-based groups for mentoring programs in middle schools and to assist localities affected by hate crimes. A School Security Technology and Resource Center is being created in partnership with national organizations for school safety initiatives. A National Center for School and Youth Safety will be established to provide emergency assistance, set up a student hotline for reporting violent behavior, offer consultation on school safety, compile best practices for violence prevention, and reach out to rural and impoverished communities. The President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants and $216.0 million for national programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the SDFSC program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the SDFSC program, including $310 million for state grants and $182.5 million for national programs. This is $276.5 million more than requested but $76.3 million less than the FY2006 appropriation. The President did not request state grant funding for FY2007 due to fiscal constraints. The Administration did not request state grant funding for FY2007 due to fiscal constraints and an ineffective PART review. The President requested $216.0 million for national programs, $6.3 million less than FY2006. For FY2008, no funding was requested for the mentoring program, as FY2007 marked the final year of a two-year phase-out. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $19 million for the mentoring program in FY2007. For FY2007, the Administration did not request state grant funding due to fiscal constraints. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $19 million for the mentoring program, meeting the Administration's objectives. Funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program was not requested by the Administration, but Congress appropriated $32.7 million for FY2005 and FY2006. The FY2005 and FY2006 appropriations for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program were $32.7 million each. In FY2006, funding was slightly reduced to $32.4 million due to a 1% rescission. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funding for the program in FY2007, but the Senate recommended $32.4 million. The Gun-Free Schools Act is part of the program, requiring LEAs to expel students bringing weapons to school. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) requires LEAs to expel students bringing weapons to school, with the provision for case-by-case modifications by the chief administering officer. States must have laws in place for this requirement and report expulsion details to the ED Secretary annually. LEAs must comply with expulsion requirements to receive GFSA funds. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) mandates LEAs to expel students for bringing weapons to school, with exceptions for certain cases. States must have laws in place and report expulsion details annually to the ED Secretary. LEAs must comply with these requirements to receive GFSA funds. Additionally, during the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, with most dying except for H.R. 3010. During the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, with most dying except for H.R. 3010. This bill, the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006, included amendments for evaluating violence prevention programs but did not become law. Other measures introduced included the Bullying and Gang Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005. During the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, with most dying except for H.R. 3010. The Bullying and Gang Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005 (H.R. 283) was introduced to amend SDFSCA to cover bullying and gang prevention, along with drug and violence prevention. Other measures included H.R. 284, H.R. 3655, H.R. 5295, S. 1974, and S. 4028 focusing on various aspects of school safety and crime reduction. H.R. 284, introduced on January 6, 2005, aimed to include bullying and harassment prevention programs in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. The bill sought to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to create accountability-based programs for enhancing school safety, including research-based bullying and gang prevention programs. The School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) and the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 5295) aimed to address bullying and harassment in schools by including prevention programs under the definition of violence. These bills were introduced in the House Education and the Workforce Committee, with the latter passing in the House in 2006. The Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006, introduced by Representative Geoff Davis, aimed to allow full-time teachers to search students on school property under reasonable suspicion to prevent threats of weapons, drugs, or dangerous materials. Non-compliant LEAs would risk losing SDFSCA funds after FY2008. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) and the Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) aimed to address drug use among high school students and reauthorize SDFSCA funding. LEAs not complying with requirements risked losing funds after FY2008. The bill aimed to increase state grants authorization to $700 million for FY2007 and allocate $400 million for national programs. It required hiring gang prevention coordinators and drug prevention coordinators in LEAs, reserved $50 million for mentoring program grants, and prioritized funding for entities serving children in high-need areas. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act) aimed to prioritize funding for entities serving children in high-need areas, particularly those in rural and high crime areas, troubled homes, or schools with violence problems. It included an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant of at least $50 million to assist schools in combating gang activity, with priority given to programs targeting teens in communities with above-average crime rates. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act) introduced in the 110th Congress aims to improve school safety by allowing students in unsafe environments to transfer to safer schools within the same district. It also includes provisions for counseling and removing offenders. The bill H.R. 354, known as the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act, allows students who are victims of violent crimes at school, on school buses, or at school functions to transfer to a safer school within the same district. It also provides the option of counseling or removing the offender. H.R. 354, the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act, allows students to transfer to a safer school within the same district if they are victims of violent crimes on school grounds, buses, or at school functions. The bill also offers counseling or removal of the offender. The Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program to create safe, drug-free, healthy, and secure school environments, focusing on areas like managing emergencies, violence and drug-use prevention, school culture, and climate. The SDFSC national programs may be consolidated into a flexible grant program focusing on emergencies, violence prevention, school culture, and improving the learning environment. Congress could also consider requiring schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies, as current data is based on surveys and studies, not actual crimes reported. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may be better suited to handle school safety and crime data collection instead of the Department of Education (ED) due to DOJ's expertise in public safety and crime analysis. Restructuring state grant programs related to school safety could be considered in response to the ineffectiveness of current programs. The PART assessment found state grant programs for school safety to be ineffective. One response could be restructuring responsibilities, such as keeping drug and alcohol prevention at ED and school safety under DOJ. Another option is allowing K-12 schools to apply for DHS funding for security against terrorist attacks. Legislation may allow K-12 schools to seek DHS funding for security and emergency preparedness against terrorist attacks. There are concerns about unintended consequences of the Unsafe School Choice provision, as definitions of persistently dangerous schools could vary between states, leading to potential legal issues. Some school officials may underreport school crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous, impacting funding for violence prevention grants. The 'persistently dangerous' component of NCLB lacks funding to help schools improve safety programs. The lack of corroborating data hinders schools from qualifying for grants. The 'persistently dangerous' aspect of NCLB lacks funding to improve school safety programs, while budgets cut funds that could prevent schools from being labeled as such."
