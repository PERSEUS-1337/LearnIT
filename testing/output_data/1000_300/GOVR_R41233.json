    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing issues for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance are key, along with block grant programs like HOME and CDBG for community development. Other specialized grants help homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. HUD receives funding from Congress for housing programs for low-income households. Programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) help serve low-income families. Specialized grants assist homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus FHA funds offset HUD's budget costs, with additional emergency funding provided for disaster recovery efforts. The HUD budget has received significant emergency supplemental funding in recent years, including over $20 billion for recovery assistance after Hurricane Katrina. Total enacted appropriations for HUD have increased by 57% in the past nine years, with a growth rate of nearly 10% in FY2009 and nearly 12% in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, the HUD budget has shown consistent year-over-year increases of 5% or more since FY2005. The rate of growth in HUD's budget has increased in recent years, with year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year since FY2005. Adjusting for inflation, the budget grew by about 17% over a nine-year period. Most of the growth has come in the last two years, with funding made up of regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. HUD's annual funding consists of regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. The programs and activities are mainly funded through regular annual appropriations, with additional emergency appropriations provided by Congress in response to disasters. Congressional appropriators are limited in the amount of new non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide each year. The cost of HUD's regular annual appropriations acts is offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts and collections, which determine HUD's total net budget authority. The total net budget authority of HUD is determined by new appropriations and offsets like rescissions, receipts, and collections. This net budget authority is the \"cost\" of the HUD budget and is not necessarily the best measure of funding for HUD's programs. Despite fluctuations in net budget authority, regular appropriations may not decrease or increase accordingly. For example, net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57% between FY2002 and FY2010. Between FY2002 and FY2010, net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57%, reaching over $46 billion. However, this increase is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations only grew by 37% during this period, while offsetting receipts and collections decreased significantly. Between FY2002 and FY2010, the net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57%, reaching over $46 billion. The growth in regular appropriations by 37% is largely due to the expansion of HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which are the largest components of the HUD budget. Appropriations for the Section 8 programs grew by over 70%, while funding for all other HUD programs only increased by 8%. Between FY2002 and FY2010, appropriations for the Section 8 programs grew by over 70%, accounting for about 57% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs also began to grow in FY2009 and FY2010. The decline in offsetting receipts is mainly due to decreases in receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs. The decline in offsetting receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs has led to a significant decrease in available funds for new HUD appropriations. The annual appropriations process starts with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. To avoid a government funding lapse, appropriations legislation must be enacted before the end of the fiscal year on September 30. If Congress fails to complete appropriations action, short-term continuing resolutions are typically enacted to maintain funding for government programs. The FY2011 appropriations process began with the President's budget release on February 1, 2010, and ended with P.L. 112-10 signed into law on April 15, 2011. Congress enacts short-term continuing resolutions to continue funding at prior year levels if appropriations are not completed by September 30. The process spanned two calendar years and two Congresses. The President's FY2011 budget requested funding for HUD. The FY2011 appropriations process for HUD began with the President's budget release on February 1, 2010. The President's budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of 1% from FY2010. However, this decrease would actually represent a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate. The President's budget proposed offsetting the increase with a substantial increase in offsetting collections and receipts from proposed changes to the FHA mortgage insurance programs. The largest funding increases were requested for the two Section 8 programs. The President's budget requested funding increases for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research needs, while decreasing funding for programs for the elderly, disabled, and public housing repairs. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House would have provided $1 billion more than requested, with a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations. The House approved a funding bill (H.R. 5850) on July 29, 2010, providing $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. It included a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The bill rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. It also rejected funding for initiatives like Choice Neighborhoods and Transforming Rental Assistance. The bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved a similar bill (S. 3644) on July 23, 2010, providing about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a funding bill (S. 3644) for HUD before the end of the 111th Congress. The bill provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President, with a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. The bill also included funding for the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. However, the bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The Senate committee bill provided funding for the President's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative but was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. Continuing resolutions were enacted to maintain funding at FY2010 levels until FY2011 appropriations legislation was passed. The CRs extended funding through December 2010 and March 2011, with the final CR expiring at the earlier of March 4, 2011, or enactment of FY2011 appropriations legislation. It also extended FHA mortgage limits through FY2011. The House approved a year-long CR, H.R. 1, which would have funded HUD programs at FY2010 levels but with cuts, resulting in about $5 billion less in appropriations. H.R. 1 proposed funding HUD programs at FY2010 levels with cuts, resulting in $5 billion less in appropriations. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment that would have increased HUD funding by nearly $6 billion without rescinding any FY2010 funding. The Senate failed to pass both H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment (S.Amdt. 149) that would have increased HUD funding by nearly $6 billion without rescinding any FY2010 funding. This would have resulted in a reduction of over $1 billion in net budget authority from FY2010, but an increase of about $900 million in aggregate appropriations compared to FY2010. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government through March 18, 2011, maintaining most accounts at FY2010 levels but reducing funding for some accounts. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government through March 18, 2011. Funding for most HUD accounts was maintained at FY2010 levels, but the Community Development Fund (CDF) account, which funds the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, was reduced by approximately $195 million. This reduction was equivalent to the amount of funding provided for congressional earmarks through Economic Development Initiatives (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiatives (NI) in FY2010. In FY2010, Congress enacted short-term CRs to fund HUD accounts, maintaining most funding levels but reducing the Community Development Fund (CDF) and eliminating funding for HUD's Brownfields Redevelopment account. A final CR in April 2011 extended funding while reducing public housing operating funds and specifying no CDF funds for EDI and NI earmarks. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 was signed into law on April 15, 2011. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011, signed into law on April 15, 2011 (P.L. 112-10), provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for the Department of Defense and other government agencies, including HUD. It funded some HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for certain programs, and increased funding for Section 8 programs. The law included an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts, resulting in a net new budget authority of $41.1 billion for HUD, an 11% decrease from FY2010. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 provided $41.1 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of about 11% from FY2010. The decrease in budget authority would only represent a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs due to an increase in offsetting collections from FHA mortgage insurance programs. FHA insures mortgage loans to make credit more widely available at a lower cost. The FHA insurance helps make mortgage credit more widely available at a lower cost. It is administered through two program accounts in the HUD budget: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund and the General Insurance Fund. The MMI Fund is the largest and includes the FHA's single-family home loans and the HECM program. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the FHA's reverse mortgage program into the MMI Fund, creating two risk categories. The MMI Fund insures single-family home loans, while the GI/SRI Fund covers riskier mortgages and special-purpose loans. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 also plays a role in these programs. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) determines the cost of federal loan insurance in a fiscal year based on the net present value of expected cash flows. Cash inflows for the MMI Fund come from insurance premiums, while outflows are payments for loan defaults. The subsidy rate, expressed as a percentage of insured loans, shows the net value of cash flows. If inflows exceed outflows, the subsidy rate is negative, indicating net income. The subsidy rate is calculated based on the difference between cash inflows and outflows. A negative subsidy rate indicates net income, while a positive rate shows a deficit. This rate is applied to the expected loan volume to determine the credit subsidy needed. Agencies must adjust initial estimates based on actual loan performance. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, generating negative credit. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, generating negative credit to offset funding needs. It has made more money in fees than paid out in claims, not requiring an appropriation from Congress to operate. The Fund is divided into Purchase and Refinance risk category and HECM risk category. The MMI Fund is divided into Purchase and Refinance risk category and HECM risk category. The Administration estimated a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, generating $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy. This increase is partly due to proposed FHA reforms by HUD. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate around $1.9 billion in negative credit subsidy, including $960 million without FHA's proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed program reforms. Despite lower projections than the Administration's, CBO still anticipated this category of the MMI Fund to be profitable in FY2011 and not require a positive credit subsidy. The CBO projected that the MMI Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate more revenue than losses in FY2011, not needing a positive credit subsidy. The estimates were revised due to an increase in FHA's annual premium in April 2011, resulting in a -3.92% subsidy rate for the remainder of FY2011. In the President's FY2012 budget request, FHA projected a -3.92% subsidy rate for the MMI Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category for FY2011, leading to increased estimates of offsetting receipts to nearly $10 billion. CBO also raised its estimate of FHA receipts by over $1 billion during the FY2011 appropriations process. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the HECM program into the MMI fund with a positive credit subsidy of 0.83%. HUD proposed changes in FY2011 to increase HECM borrowers' insurance premiums and adjust the loan size formula to reduce the need for a positive credit subsidy. HUD proposed increasing annual insurance premiums for HECM borrowers to 1.25% of the loan balance and adjusting the loan size formula to reduce the need for credit subsidies. Legislation aimed to provide less funding for credit subsidies than the Administration's estimate. The FY2012 appropriations law directed HUD to make adjustments to the HECM program to eliminate the need for credit subsidies. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing as private lending standards tighten. The Secretary of HUD is making adjustments to the HECM program to eliminate the need for credit subsidies, aiming for a zero credit subsidy. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been rising due to tightening private lending standards, with FHA insuring a higher percentage of new single-family mortgages. Despite newer mortgages having better credit quality, the default rate on past FHA-insured loans is increasing, putting strain on the MMI Fund. The MMI Fund must maintain a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% as mandated by Congress. The ratio fell below 2% in FY2009 for the first time, prompting FHA to propose changes to its mortgage insurance programs. FHA has announced proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs in response to concerns over the MMI Fund's financial stability. Changes include increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium, with statutory caps set by Congress. FHA had been charging the maximum allowed by law before implementing these changes. FHA increased annual mortgage insurance premiums to 0.9% for loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 95% or higher, and 0.85% for loans below 95%. Subsequently, premiums were raised to 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less, and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5%. The upfront premium was also raised to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010. FHA raised the upfront mortgage insurance premium to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, but later lowered it to 1% for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. FHA also proposed changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, with borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579 required to provide a 10% downpayment. Borrowers with credit scores of 580 or above would continue with existing requirements. FHA proposed changes for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010, including increasing the downpayment for borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579 to 10%, reducing seller concessions from 6% to 3%, and enhancing oversight of FHA-approved lenders. FHA intends to increase oversight of FHA-approved lenders, with some changes made administratively and steps already taken. Congress may need to grant additional authority for enforcement actions. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to give FHA more power to require lenders to indemnify for claims on non-conforming mortgages and fraud cases, as well as broader authority to terminate lender approval. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to increase oversight of FHA-approved lenders by granting FHA broader authority to terminate lender approval and require lenders to indemnify for claims on non-conforming mortgages and fraud cases. It also proposed establishing a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs within FHA, abolishing the position of FHA chief risk officer, and allowing FHA to contract with outside credit risk analysis sources. Appropriations were authorized for staff to review lender performance from FY2010 through FY2014. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance to nonprofit developers through the Section 202 and Section 811 programs to build or rehabilitate housing units for elderly residents and residents with disabilities. Supportive services are optional in Section 202 housing but mandatory in Section 811 housing. Over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and 30,000 units of Section 811 housing have been funded. In FY2011, no new units were proposed to allow for program redesign. In FY2011, the President proposed no new funding for Section 202 and Section 811 housing programs to allow for redesign. This would result in reduced funding for both programs, with Section 202 and related programs funded at $274 million compared to $825 million in FY2010, and Section 811 program funded at $90 million compared to $300 million in FY2010. In FY2011, proposed funding for Section 202 and Section 811 housing programs would have been reduced compared to FY2010. The Section 202 program would have been funded at $274 million, while the Section 811 program would have received $90 million. Both House-passed and Senate committee-passed bills did not follow the President's recommendations to redesign the programs or stop producing new units. The funding levels for Section 202 would have remained the same as FY2010 at $825 million, while for Section 811, H.R. 5850 proposed $300 million and S. 3644 proposed $200 million. The difference in funding levels was based on the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with both bills moving funding for voucher renewals to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. In FY2011, proposed funding for Section 202 and Section 811 housing programs was reduced compared to FY2010. The difference in funding levels was based on the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 moving funding for voucher renewals to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. Ultimately, Congress appropriated $400 million for Section 202 and related programs and $150 million for the Section 811 program, splitting funding to renew Section 811 vouchers between the Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts. In FY2011, $400 million was allocated for Section 202 and related programs, with $150 million for the Section 811 program. Funding for Section 811 vouchers was split between Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts. Up to $32 million was available to renew pre-2007 voucher contracts, with an additional $35 million from the Section 8 account, totaling $67 million for Section 811 voucher renewals. $89 million was provided for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program within the Section 202 funds. In FY2011, $89 million was allocated for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program within the Section 202 funds. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, the largest assistance program administered by HUD, is funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account. This account funds annual renewal for almost 2.3 million vouchers used by families and covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Funding comes from current year appropriations and advance appropriations for the following fiscal year. Since FY2004, debates over funding levels for voucher renewals in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program have been a key issue in the HUD appropriations process. Congress provided over $16 billion for voucher renewals in FY2010, aiming to allocate funding efficiently to Public Housing Authorities to serve as many families as possible while containing future costs. (For more information about the program, see CRS Report RL34002, Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program: Issues and Reform Proposals by [author name scrubbed].) In FY2010, Congress provided over $16 billion for voucher renewals in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. HUD allocated funding to Public Housing Authorities based on prior year costs and utilization. However, PHAs were not using all their vouchers in FY2009, leading to insufficient funding in FY2010 to cover all vouchers. In FY2010, PHAs faced funding challenges due to incomplete voucher utilization in FY2009. The President's FY2011 budget proposed $17 billion for voucher renewals to cover about 95% of all vouchers in use. Funding allocation would be based on prior year costs and utilization, with the Secretary having authority to adjust allocations for PHAs with unspent funds. The President's FY2011 budget proposed $17 billion for voucher renewals, aiming to cover about 95% of all vouchers. Funding allocation would be based on prior year costs and utilization, with the Secretary having authority to adjust allocations for PHAs with unspent funds and reallocate to those with lower reserves. Additionally, the budget requested Congress to lift the ban on \"over-leasing\" to facilitate increased leasing. The President's FY2011 budget proposed $17 billion for voucher renewals, aiming to cover about 95% of all vouchers. The House bill included about $150 million less for renewals than the amount requested in the President's budget, citing lower inflation estimates. The committee report indicated that the funding in H.R. 5850 would be sufficient to meet the renewal needs of the program and reiterated support for funding all vouchers in use. The committee report on H.R. 5850 stated that the funding included would meet the program's renewal needs, despite being lower than the President's budget request. The bill maintained the prohibition on over-leasing and changed the funding formula to base PHA funding on prior calendar year spending. The committee did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President, believing the program requires major authorization changes outside of the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction. The Senate bill, S. 3644, would have changed the funding formula for PHA funding to base it on prior calendar year spending, rather than fiscal year spending. It also funded renewals at less than the President's request, citing revised estimates of need. The bill did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President, citing concerns about potential rapid cost increases in the program. The committee report accompanying the bill expresses concerns about potential cost increases in the program and directs HUD to report on better monitoring of PHAs' financial management. Both H.R. 1 and the final FY2011 appropriations law did not change the funding allocation formula from FY2010. The President's budget requested Congress to fund the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account. The President's budget requested Congress to fund the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account, with a request of $114 million in FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated less than requested for Section 811 renewals, directing funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. Each Public Housing Authority (PHA) has a contract with HUD for administering authorized vouchers. In FY2011, Congress directed funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007, totaling around 2.3 million authorized vouchers across Public Housing Authorities. Additional vouchers are created by Congress, including tenant protection vouchers for displaced families and incremental vouchers for special populations. Incremental vouchers have been allocated for specific purposes, such as $15 million for families in the child welfare system and $75 million for homeless veterans in FY2010. In FY2011, Congress allocated funds for new vouchers, including $85 million for a homelessness demonstration program. The House and Senate bills also included funding for vouchers for homeless veterans and families displaced by hurricanes. Additionally, the Senate bill allocated $16 million for the Family. The Senate bill from the 111th Congress would have funded the President's homelessness demonstration, provided $75 million for VASH vouchers, $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes, and $16 million for the Family Unification Program (FUP). H.R. 1 did not include funding for new incremental vouchers, but the final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided about $50 million for VASH vouchers. The project-based rental assistance account administers and renews existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private multifamily property owners. The project-based rental assistance program administers contracts between HUD and private property owners to subsidize housing for low-income families. Contracts funded for 20- to 40-year periods require new appropriations once expired. In FY2011, over $9 billion was requested for this program. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, with $662 million needed for contract amendments. Funding has been a mix of current year and advance appropriations since FY2009. In FY2011, funding for rental assistance programs was a mix of current year and advance appropriations. The President requested $350 million for a new initiative to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for tenants. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided just under $120 million less than the President's request. The President requested $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for tenants. This funding would transfer HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility options. The President's budget proposes a new form of project-based rental assistance that allows tenants to take their subsidies with them if they move to private market housing. The initiative aims to transfer 300,000 units, targeting public housing properties, multifamily housing properties, and properties with old forms of rental assistance. The President's budget proposes a new project-based rental assistance program to transfer 300,000 units, targeting public housing, multifamily properties, and those with old rental assistance programs. HUD would select properties for participation, with most of the $300 million funding used to cover the difference in subsidy levels. Additional funds would support PHA activities, landlord outreach, tenant mobility, technical assistance, and program evaluation. The President's budget proposes a new project-based rental assistance program to transfer 300,000 units, targeting public housing, multifamily properties, and those with old rental assistance programs. HUD would select properties for participation, with most of the $300 million funding used to cover the difference in subsidy levels. An additional $10 million would be allocated for technical assistance and program evaluation. However, the proposed legislation for the initiative was not included in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. Both committees expressed concerns about the proposal's lack of development and unknown future costs. The public housing program, established in 1937, provides rental units for low-income families. Congress funds over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) that manage 1.2 million units. HUD supports PHAs through operating and capital funds for maintenance and modernization. Funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in the FY2011 appropriations law. The Public Housing program receives funding from HUD to support PHAs in maintaining and modernizing rental units for low-income families. The capital fund helps with large projects and modernization, while the HOPE VI grant program focuses on redevelopment of distressed housing. The President's FY2011 budget requested an increase in operating fund and a decrease in capital fund, citing sufficient funding for PHAs' eligibility and previous capital funding from the Recovery Act. The requested decrease for the capital fund considers previous capital funding from the Recovery Act, allowing more funds to be spent on capital needs. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request with a $500 million increase for the capital fund. The Senate bill included a $50 million set-aside for grants to PHAs for early childhood education facilities. The Senate bill proposed a $500 million increase for the capital fund, with a $50 million set-aside for grants to PHAs for early childhood education facilities. H.R. 1 suggested cutting the public housing capital fund by over $1 billion and the operating fund by almost $150 million compared to FY2010. The final FY2011 funding law funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and the operating fund at about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The President proposed a mandatory offset of PHA reserves in his FY2012 budget request. The final FY2011 funding law funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and the operating fund at about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The President's budget requested no new funding for HOPE VI, instead requesting $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new Obama Administration proposal. The Choice Neighborhood Initiative expands on the HOPE VI program by offering grants to revitalize distressed neighborhoods, not just public housing. Funding is aimed at transforming, rehabilitating, and replacing HUD housing. In FY2010, $200 million was allocated to HOPE VI, with $65 million set aside for Choice Neighborhoods. Congress had differing views on funding for FY2011, with H.R. 5850 providing $200 million for HOPE VI and S. 3644 providing no funding for either program. In FY2011, the House and Senate had differing positions on funding for HOPE VI and Choice Neighborhoods. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while S. 3644 allocated $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) provided nearly $100 million for HOPE VI and did not change the $65 million for Choice Neighborhoods. The Housing Trust Fund, established in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, aims to provide a dedicated source of funding for affordable housing. It allows HUD to grant funds to states for affordable housing activities, focusing on rental housing for extremely low-income families. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are identified as the funding source. The Housing Trust Fund, established in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, aims to provide funding for affordable housing activities, focusing on rental housing for extremely low-income families. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were suspended in 2008, leaving the fund without a funding source. Despite the possibility of other funding sources, no funds have been directed to the Housing Trust Fund yet. The President's FY2011 budget requested $1 billion in mandatory funding for the fund. Despite the establishment of the Housing Trust Fund in 2008 to provide funding for affordable housing activities, no funds have been directed to the fund yet. The President's FY2011 budget requested $1 billion in mandatory funding for the Housing Trust Fund, but Congress did not provide any funding in the FY2010 appropriations law. Subsequent legislative proposals in the 111th Congress also did not result in funding for the Housing Trust Fund. The FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) did not include funding for the Housing Trust Fund despite various legislative proposals in the 111th Congress. The Transformation Initiative, proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget, aims to strengthen HUD's research and technological capacities for research, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. Funding for the initiative includes appropriations for reducing mortgage fraud and the Secretary's authority to transfer up to 1% from most accounts. The funding request for the initiative involves appropriations for reducing mortgage fraud and the Secretary's authority to transfer up to 1% from most accounts in HUD's budget. In FY2010, Congress provided $20 million for addressing mortgage fraud and authorized a 1% transfer authority, resulting in a fund of $239 million. In FY2011, the President requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, potentially totaling $470 million for the transformation fund. In FY2011, the President requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, potentially totaling $470 million for the transformation fund. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included the $20 million for combating mortgage fraud but limited the total funding available from transfers compared to the President's request. The House and Senate bills proposed limits on the department's discretion in allocating funds for eligible activities under the Transformation Initiative.

The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives to transform the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and related programs. It proposed funding CDBG at its FY2010 level, eliminating funding for the Rural Innovation Fund and earmarked programs. New initiatives like Catalytic Competition Grants and Capacity Building Clearinghouse were requested, along with the Sustainable Communities Initiative. The budget also aimed to revamp the University Community Fund. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed reducing funding for Community Development Fund activities, defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants to reallocate funds to Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund.

The House bill, H.R. 5850, recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for CDF activities, including funding for EDI and NI projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill, S. 3644, recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities, with funding for EDI and NI projects.

The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, established by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, is a major source of federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. In 2010, CDBG funds were awarded to various communities and states to benefit low- and moderate-income individuals, address slums or blight, or tackle public health and safety threats. The FY2011 budget proposed maintaining funding at over $3.9 billion for the CDBG program. The FY2011 budget proposed freezing funding for the CDBG program at over $3.9 billion.

The CDF account was reduced by $7 million to $3.501 billion due to the mandatory cut and $35 million was transferred to the Transformation Initiative. The Administration proposed a new initiative, the Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs), with $148.5 million to support economic development projects in distressed areas. Unlike CDBG funds, CCG program funds would not be allocated by formula. The proposed Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs) aimed to support economic development projects in distressed areas by awarding funds competitively to various entities. These funds would be used for reclaiming vacant property, removing obstacles to economic recovery, supporting transit-oriented development, assisting small- and medium-sized businesses, and covering administrative costs. The Administration requested $148.5 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to fund economic activities supporting transit-oriented development, assisting small- and medium-sized businesses, and covering administrative costs. Neither H.R. 1 nor the final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated funds for this proposal. In FY2011, $100 million was requested for Regional Integrated Planning Grants under the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to support metropolitan areas in developing effective models for sustainable communities. HUD plans to award grants averaging $3 million to larger metropolitan areas and $500,000 to smaller ones for improvements in housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning activities. In FY2011, HUD proposed grants averaging $500,000 to smaller metropolitan areas with populations under 500,000 for improvements in housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning activities. Additionally, Community Challenge Grants aim to reform building codes and zoning ordinances to promote sustainable growth, with a proposed grant award limit of $2 million. Funding for Housing-Transportation Integration Research was also requested for a joint initiative with the Department of Transportation. The Administration requested funding for a joint HUD-Department of Transportation research initiative to evaluate the benefits of various efforts, with a portion allocated for evaluating Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. Congress appropriated $10 million for research efforts in FY2010. Additionally, the Administration proposed capacity building as a new component of the SCI to improve the technical capacity of regional organizations, local jurisdictions, and community-based organizations. The Administration proposed funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to improve technical capacity of various organizations. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 recommended continued funding for SCI at $148.5 million, with a set-aside of $25 million for smaller metropolitan areas. Additionally, $25 million was recommended for the Rural Innovation Fund to assist state housing finance agencies and rural nonprofit organizations. The SCI funding is proposed for metropolitan areas with populations under 500,000. Both bills recommend $25 million for the Rural Innovation Fund to assist various organizations in addressing housing and poverty-related issues. Provisions include setting aside $5 million for rural Indian tribes and granting discretionary power to transfer funds for HUD's Transformation Initiative. The Secretary has discretionary power to transfer up to 1% of CDF appropriations to the program. P.L. 112-10 appropriated $99.8 million for SCI activities, including Regional Integration Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. The FY2011 funding level is a 33% reduction from FY2010.

The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocations for qualifying activities, with a term of up to 20 years. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2011 to help finance large-scale projects. Additionally, the Administration suggested charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Administration proposed revamping the Section 108 loan guarantee program by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers, eliminating the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. Congress rejected this proposal and recommended continuing the program as currently structured. H.R. 5850 suggested a loan commitment ceiling of $427 million with a credit subsidy of $10 million, while S. 3644 recommended a ceiling of $275 million with a subsidy of $6.4 million. P.L. 112-10 maintained the program at a commitment level of $275 million with a credit subsidy of $5.988 million. The FY2011 program had a commitment level of $275 million with a credit subsidy of $5.988 million. The budget proposed a redesign of the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program, which would provide assistance and funds to local organizations through national intermediaries. The program aims to enhance the capabilities of community development corporations and housing organizations. The Administration's budget proposed increasing funding for the capacity building program by $10 million, from $50 million to $60 million. The program would support training, education, grants, loans, and financial assistance for community development organizations and affordable housing activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals. Grant funds would be competitively awarded to national and regional intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development.

Grant funds would be competitively awarded to national and regional intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development to assist CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments in developing their capacity for such activities. The proposal aimed to increase funding for capacity building activities for community development organizations and affordable housing. Grantees would need to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. The House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills did not include funding for this initiative, but recommended continuing funding for capacity building activities through existing programs. The Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) account funds capacity building through SHOP, providing grants for self-help homeownership opportunities. This account also supports the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Assistance Council. The SHOP account funds capacity building for self-help homeownership opportunities and supports the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Assistance Council. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account, as activities traditionally funded through SHOP are eligible for funds under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program block grant. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account. Instead, activities traditionally funded through SHOP are eligible for funds under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program block grant. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included $82 million for the SHOP account, with $27 million for SHOP itself, $50 million for capacity building, and $5 million for HAC, maintaining the same funding levels as in FY2010. In FY2011, funding for SHOP included $27 million for SHOP itself, $50 million for capacity building, and $5 million for HAC, maintaining the same levels as in FY2010.

The President's FY2011 budget requested $88 million for the program, and both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included similar amounts in the 111th Congress. This funding increase is in response to the sharp rise in mortgage default and foreclosure rates since 2006. The Housing Counseling Assistance Program received $88 million in funding, the same amount as requested in the President's budget. However, the final FY2011 appropriations law eliminated funding for the program, resulting in a significant decrease from previous years. Critics argue that the program's funding overlaps with the NeighborWorks National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program, but HUD's funding can be used for a wider variety of counseling services.
