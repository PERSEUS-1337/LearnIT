    "content": "The \"Violence Against Children Act of 2003\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. Congress finds that children under 18 make up a significant portion of crime victims, with high rates of sex crimes and kidnapping. Adolescents aged 12-17 are more likely to be victims of violent crime than adults. Only 28% of crimes against children are reported, leading to serious consequences such as abuse-related deaths and long-term negative effects on development and mental health. Child abuse has long-lasting negative effects on children and families, including delayed development, depression, substance abuse, and increased likelihood of experiencing or perpetrating domestic violence as an adult. Most local agencies lack resources to protect children and families adequately. Failure to pay child support is a form of neglect, leading to children living in poverty and suffering from inadequate education, healthcare, and housing.
