    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". Congress finds that a significant amount of energy in the United States is released as waste heat from power plants, industrial facilities, and buildings. This waste heat can be recovered and used for heating, cooling, or converted into electricity. Renewable energy resources in the US can be used for local thermal and electric energy needs, strengthening energy reliability and resilience. Utilizing local waste heat and renewable energy resources enhances industrial competitiveness, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and decreases air pollution and carbon emissions. District energy systems play a crucial role in tapping waste heat and renewable energy resources, expanding the implementation of combined heat and power systems. They also contribute to strengthening industrial competitiveness, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, increasing energy supply resiliency, and keeping energy dollars in local economies to create jobs. Additionally, district energy systems serve colleges and universities. District energy systems deliver thermal energy from a CHP system to end users like colleges, hospitals, and downtown areas. They help reduce peak power demand, power transmission constraints, and meet air conditioning needs through thermal storage and CHP systems. Implementing district energy systems is a complex process involving various factors. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption and enhance energy supply resiliency. Implementing district energy systems involves technical, economic, legal, and institutional challenges, often requiring technical assistance. A key barrier is the lack of low-interest, long-term capital funding for utilizing local waste heat and renewable energy resources. The Act aims to encourage the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure through technical assistance and low-cost financing. The Act aims to encourage the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It provides technical assistance and low-cost financing for the construction of local energy infrastructure. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, improve energy supply resiliency, decrease air pollution, boost industrial competitiveness, and keep energy dollars in local economies. It offers technical support and affordable financing for local energy infrastructure development. The Act promotes the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, improve energy supply resiliency, decrease air pollution, boost industrial competitiveness, and keep energy dollars in local economies. It includes definitions for combined heat and power system, district energy system, and Loan Guarantee Program. The Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program supports systems that recover or produce energy from waste or renewable sources, generate electricity using combined heat and power, distribute electricity in microgrids, store thermal energy, and distribute thermal energy for building heating and cooling. The Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program supports systems that recover or produce energy from waste or renewable sources, generate electricity using combined heat and power, distribute electricity in microgrids, store thermal energy, and distribute thermal energy for building heating and cooling. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within defined electrical boundaries that can operate independently or connect to the main grid. A renewable energy resource includes biomass. The term \"renewable energy resource\" includes biomass, gaseous or liquid fuels from biomass, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, and solar energy. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" is also defined. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" includes heating or cooling energy derived from renewable energy resources, natural sources of cooling, and other renewable thermal energy sources as determined by the Secretary. The term \"thermal energy\" refers to heating energy in the form of hot water or steam used for space heating, domestic hot water, or process heat, and cooling energy in the form of chilled water. Waste energy refers to energy contained in exhaust gases, steam, hot liquids, or waste gas from industrial processes that would otherwise be wasted. Waste energy includes gas from industrial processes, waste gas, pressure drops in gas, condenser water, and other forms of waste energy as determined by the Secretary. This energy is not being used in existing facilities or conventionally used in new facilities. The Technical Assistance Program under SEC. 4 aims to provide support for utilizing waste energy in various forms as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance to eligible entities for local energy infrastructure planning and design. Assistance may include identifying energy opportunities, assessing characteristics, utility interconnection, contract negotiation, and permitting. The program provides technical assistance for local energy infrastructure planning and design, including assessment of technical and economic characteristics, utility interconnection, negotiation of contracts, permitting, marketing, business planning, financial analysis, and engineering design. Information dissemination includes case studies and computer software for infrastructure assessment and maintenance. Eligible entities can be nonprofit or for-profit. The program offers technical assistance for local energy infrastructure planning and design, including assessment, feasibility studies, and guidance on overcoming barriers. Eligible entities can be nonprofit or for-profit. The program offers technical assistance for local energy infrastructure planning and design, including guidance on overcoming barriers such as financial, contracting, siting, and permitting issues. Eligible entities can apply for assistance through a competitive application process. The Secretary will seek applications for technical assistance on a competitive and periodic basis. Priority will be given to projects that maximize elimination of fossil fuel use, strengthen energy supply reliability, minimize environmental impact, and boost energy infrastructure resiliency. The Secretary will adopt rules and procedures for the program established under this section within 180 days of the Act's enactment. $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to carry out this section. SEC. 5. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR LOCAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. A Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program is added to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Secretary may provide loan guarantees for local energy infrastructure projects under the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013, with $4 billion reserved for this purpose. Unused funds from section 1703 may also be used for loan guarantees under this program. SEC. 6. DEFINITION OF INVESTMENT AREA: Amends the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act to include local energy infrastructure projects as defined in the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013."
