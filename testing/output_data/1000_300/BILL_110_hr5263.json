    "content": "The Forest Landscape Restoration Act may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The purpose of the Act is outlined in section 2. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by encouraging sustainability, leveraging local and national resources, reducing wildfire management costs, and demonstrating the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques and forest restoration byproducts. The use of forest restoration byproducts can offset treatment costs, benefit rural economies, and improve forest health. The Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries.\" The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program is established under the Act. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program is established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to select and fund ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes in compliance with relevant laws. Eligibility criteria for proposals include a complete landscape restoration strategy that identifies and prioritizes ecological aspects. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must have a complete landscape restoration strategy that identifies and prioritizes ecological restoration treatments for a 10-year period across a landscape of at least 50,000 acres, primarily forested Federal lands, in need of active ecosystem restoration. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must incorporate the best available science and ecological restoration strategies, including requirements for old-growth maintenance and large-tree retention. It should be accessible by wood-processing infrastructure and utilize woody biomass and small-diameter wood from ecological restoration treatments. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must incorporate the best available science and ecological restoration strategies, including requirements for old-growth maintenance and large-tree retention. It should be developed through a collaborative process involving diverse interests, transparency, and successful planning and implementation of ecological restoration. The resource advisory committee must have a successful record of ecological restoration projects on Federal lands and describe plans for fire use, habitat improvement, water quality maintenance, invasive species control, road maintenance, and biomass utilization. The resource advisory committee must have a successful record of ecological restoration projects on Federal lands, including preventing, controlling invasions of exotic species, maintaining or decommissioning roads, using woody biomass from landscape restoration projects, reporting annually on performance, and developing small business incubators for rural communities. The resource advisory committee must provide employment and training opportunities in rural communities through local entities, Youth Conservation Corps crews, small businesses, or other entities. They should consider community wildfire protection plans and analyze cost savings. The resource advisory committee must consider community wildfire protection plans, analyze cost savings, estimate annual Federal funding needed, and determine non-Federal investment leverage for ecological restoration treatments. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must be submitted to the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service Region for nomination by State Directors or Regional Foresters. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal is submitted for nomination by State Directors or Regional Foresters, who may nominate proposals for selection by the Secretaries. Documentation for each nominated proposal must include a plan to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal is submitted for nomination by State Directors or Regional Foresters to fund ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands consistent with the landscape restoration strategy. Amounts proposed to be transferred to the Secretaries from the Fund must be used for ecological restoration treatments during the first 2 years following selection. The fund allocated for ecological restoration treatments must be used within the first 2 years following selection. If the proposal includes activities on non-covered Federal land, evidence of the owner's intent to participate and provide funding is required. The Land Management or Regional Forester nominating a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must provide evidence of the owner's intent to participate and fund activities on non-covered Federal land. The Secretaries will select proposals that meet eligibility criteria and have been nominated, consulting with advisory panels. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals based on ecological case strength, collaborative process, cost reduction potential, wildfire management benefits, and landscape restoration strategy. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals based on ecological case strength, collaborative process, cost reduction potential, wildfire management benefits, landscape restoration strategy, and non-Federal investment leverage. Limitations include funding up to 10 proposals per fiscal year and 2 proposals per region. Additionally, a scientific advisory panel will be established. The Secretaries will establish a scientific advisory panel of experts in ecological forest restoration and fire ecology to evaluate proposals for landscape restoration in the National Forest System. The panel will assess the ecological case strength, proposed restoration strategies, and potential reductions in long-term wildfire management costs. The Secretaries may establish a technical advisory panel of experts in rural business development and woody biomass to evaluate proposals for reducing costs through the use of biomass and small-diameter trees. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to pay for ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands, using woody biomass and small-diameter trees. Up to 50 percent of the cost can be covered, with appropriations and interest earnings contributing to the Fund. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established to fund ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands using woody biomass and small-diameter trees. The Fund allows for up to 50% coverage of costs, with appropriations of $40,000,000 authorized annually from 2008 to 2018. The Secretaries can request transfers from the Fund for restoration treatments, and an accounting system will be established. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund allocates $40,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2018 for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands. Within 180 days of selecting a proposal, the Secretaries must create an implementation work plan and budget in collaboration with stakeholders to achieve ecological and economic benefits. The proposal must include a business plan addressing cost reductions, infrastructure needs, sustainability of woody biomass supply, and local economic benefits. It should also document non-Federal investments in the priority landscape. The proposal should include a business plan addressing cost reductions, infrastructure needs, sustainability of woody biomass supply, and local economic benefits. Amounts transferred from the Fund will be used for ecological restoration treatments consistent with the landscape restoration proposal and identified through a collaborative process. An annual report on the accomplishments of each selected collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal will be prepared by the Secretaries in collaboration with interested persons. The Secretaries, along with interested parties, will prepare an annual report on the achievements of each collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal. This report will include details on treated and restored acres, progress evaluation with performance measures, community benefits, multiparty monitoring results, and a summary of costs. The Secretaries, in collaboration with interested parties, will use a multiparty monitoring process to assess the effects of collaborative forest landscape restoration projects for at least 15 years. A report on the achievements, including treated acres, community benefits, monitoring results, and costs, will be prepared annually. The Secretaries will submit a report every 5 years to congressional committees on the progress of the forest landscape restoration program, assessing its effectiveness in meeting the goals of the Act."
