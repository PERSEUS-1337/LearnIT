The United States has been a driving proponent of NATO since its creation in 1949, evolving from a collective defense organization to a globally engaged security organization with 30 members. U.S. leadership of NATO is seen as a cornerstone of national security strategy, bringing benefits such as peace, stability in Europe, and support from 28 allies. The London meeting highlighted tensions within NATO, with some European allies questioning the Trump Administration's commitment and criticizing its unilateral foreign policy approach.

The United States has supported NATO's focus on territorial defense and deterring Russian aggression since Russia's actions in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. NATO member states have deployed about 4,500 troops as part of an Enhanced Forward Presence.

The Trump Administration continues to push for increased defense spending by European allies to uphold equitable defense responsibilities within the alliance. President Trump has been urging European allies to increase their defense spending in line with past agreements to ensure equitable distribution of responsibilities within NATO. Secretary General Stoltenberg credits Trump for spurring increases in defense spending, but critics fear his criticism could harm NATO cohesion. NATO members agreed in 2006 to allocate 2% of GDP to defense annually and 20% to procurement and research, formalized at the 2014 Wales Summit. NATO allies agreed to allocate 2% of GDP to defense annually and 20% to procurement and research at the 2014 Wales Summit. European allies and Canada have increased defense spending by $130 billion since 2014, with a projected rise to $400 billion by 2024.

President Trump continues to push for increased defense spending by European allies. NATO allies agreed to allocate 2% of GDP to defense annually and 20% to procurement and research at the 2014 Wales Summit. By 2019, 9 allies are expected to meet the 2% guideline and 16 allies are expected to meet the 20% benchmark for spending on major equipment. President Trump criticizes NATO members, like Germany, for not meeting defense-spending targets. Germany plans to increase defense spending to 1.5% of GDP by 2024. Many allies argue that contributions to ongoing NATO missions and military capabilities are as important as total defense spending levels. Allied military capabilities are crucial, not just total defense spending levels. Spending less than 2% of GDP on defense doesn't necessarily mean less effective military capabilities. Analysts emphasize focusing on defense outputs, like military capabilities and effectiveness in NATO missions. NATO aims for 20% of defense expenditure on new equipment and research.

NATO has deployed aerial surveillance aircraft to assist the global coalition fighting the Islamic State terrorist organization. Some allies believe the EU should lead Europe's response to terrorism and migration, limiting NATO's engagement in security challenges from the MENA region. France, for example, prefers strong European responses but opposes a larger role for NATO. European allies have differing views on NATO's role in responding to security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress are concerned about China's increasing investment in Europe, particularly in critical infrastructure and telecommunications systems like 5G. China is expanding its unfair trade practices in Europe, with a focus on investing in key industries, sensitive technologies, and infrastructure. U.S. officials are particularly concerned about Chinese investment in critical infrastructure and telecommunications systems, such as 5G networks. NATO allies are updating their baseline requirements for civilian telecommunications to address emerging concerns about 5G technology and assess risks associated with cyber threats and foreign ownership. The EU is working on developing common guidelines for contracting decisions on 5G networks. The allies are assessing risks to communications systems from cyber threats and foreign ownership in 5G networks. The EU is developing guidelines for contracting decisions, but individual national governments will have the final say. U.S. officials have warned against using Huawei or other Chinese equipment due to security concerns.

Some NATO members have criticized Turkey's actions in Syria and its planned deployment of a Russian air defense system, raising questions about Turkey's NATO membership. Turkey's military operations in northern Syria and planned deployment of Russian S-400 air defense system have raised concerns among NATO members, questioning Turkey's continued membership in the alliance. NATO has invested in military facilities in Turkey and provided air defense support since 2013. Secretary General Stoltenberg urged Turkey to act with restraint during a visit in October 2019.

Some lawmakers have questioned whether NATO should take action against allies like Turkey for policies that could threaten alliance security. European contributions to collective defense measures in Europe are being questioned by some Members of Congress, particularly in regards to potential threats from Russia and new security challenges in cyber and hybrid warfare domains. Key questions for NATO's future include evaluating its strategic value to the United States, leadership role, adoption of a new strategic concept, capacity to address security threats from the MENA region, and willingness to tackle challenges like terrorism and migration. NATO's current strategic concept, adopted in 2010, is being evaluated in terms of its capacity to address security threats from the MENA region, including terrorism and migration. Other key considerations include member states' defense spending targets, U.S. force posture in Europe, allies' contributions to NATO deterrence efforts, and the alliance's stance on enlargement, particularly regarding Georgia and Ukraine. Additionally, there is a focus on developing a NATO strategy towards China amidst concerns about security implications. The allies are committed to NATO's \"open door\" policy on enlargement, focusing on Georgia and Ukraine's membership aspirations. There is also a need to develop a NATO strategy towards China due to concerns about increased Chinese investment in Europe."
