The Secretary will develop a plan for purchasing and storing a supply of vaccines for children and adults, including all recommended vaccines. The Secretary will purchase and store vaccines for children and adults as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, including those designated for public health preparedness efforts. The Secretary will utilize specific authorities under the Social Security Act and section 317 for this purpose. The Secretary will submit a plan developed under subsection (a) to specific Senate and House committees within 6 months of enactment, utilizing authorities under the Social Security Act and section 317 for purchasing and storing vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The plan developed under subsection (a) will be submitted to specific Senate and House committees for review. The Secretary will implement the plan by September 30, 2008, and ensure the maintenance and administration of the vaccine supply through contracts. The Secretary must be notified at least 1 year in advance if a vaccine manufacturer plans to discontinue production or faces obstacles that may affect vaccine supply. The notification period can be shortened with a valid reason certified to the Secretary.

Proceeds from vaccine sales will be used to purchase additional vaccines. The Secretary must provide ongoing reports on the progress of implementing the plan. The Secretary must submit periodic reports to Committees detailing progress and impediments in implementing the plan. The first report should include a recommendation on extending the vaccine supply beyond 6 months, along with the reasons for the recommendation. Authorization of appropriations is also included.
