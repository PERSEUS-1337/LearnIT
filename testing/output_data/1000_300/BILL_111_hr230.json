    "content": "The Act titled \"Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2009\" allows for affordable refinancing mortgages and new mortgages. The Act mandates the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to purchase and securitize qualified refinancing mortgages and new mortgages on single-family housing. Lenders must meet requirements established by the Director to offer mortgages for purchase under this program. If the enterprise determines that the mortgage meets the criteria for a qualified mortgage, it will be purchased. The enterprise must determine if a mortgage qualifies as a qualified mortgage. If it meets the requirements, the enterprise will commit to purchasing it. Lenders can receive advance commitments for qualified mortgages. A qualified mortgage can be a refinancing mortgage or a new mortgage. Qualified mortgages are defined as either qualified refinancing mortgages or qualified new mortgages. A qualified refinancing mortgage must be for a one- to four-family dwelling, the mortgagor's principal residence, and for refinancing purposes. The mortgagor must occupy the property as their principal residence. The refinancing mortgage must be used to pay off an existing first mortgage on the same property originated before January 1, 2008. The mortgage must have a single interest rate. The mortgage must have a fixed interest rate not exceeding 4.0% annually and a term of 30-40 years from the beginning of amortization. It must meet underwriting standards set by the Director and waive prepayment penalties. The qualified new mortgage must meet underwriting standards set by the Director and waive prepayment penalties. The principal loan amount must be used to purchase the property. The qualified new mortgage must meet underwriting standards set by the Director and waive prepayment penalties. The principal loan amount must be used to purchase the property subject to the mortgage. The mortgage must be originated on or after the enactment of this Act. Enterprises can establish exceptions to underwriting standards for purchasing and securitizing qualified refinancing mortgages and new mortgages. The enterprise can purchase and securitize qualified refinancing mortgages and new mortgages under specific requirements set by the Director. Each enterprise must set aside qualified mortgages and issue securities based on them with approval from the Secretary of the Treasury. These securities can be in the form of debt obligations or trust certificates, with maturities and interest rates determined by the enterprise. Securities issued under this subsection by an enterprise must have approved maturities and interest rates. They are considered exempt securities similar to those guaranteed by the United States. Mortgages set aside for this purpose must ensure timely payments on the issued securities. The Federal Reserve System will establish a credit facility to provide credit to enterprises at interest rates comparable to securities issued by the United States. Securities issued by enterprises under this subsection must ensure timely payments on principal and interest. Securities are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt of the United States. The Federal Reserve will establish a credit facility for enterprises to access credit at interest rates similar to Treasury securities. The requirement for enterprises to purchase mortgages will not apply to mortgages offered after December 31, 2010. SEC. 3.
