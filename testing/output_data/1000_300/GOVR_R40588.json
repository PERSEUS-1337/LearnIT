    "content": "In April 2009, a novel influenza virus emerged, initially called \"swine flu\" due to its genetic makeup. The World Health Organization later named it and explained how it can emerge through reassortment of flu viruses from different species, such as swine, human, and avian. The currently circulating influenza A (H1N1) virus is a mix of swine, avian, and human genes, not previously seen in humans. The influenza A (H1N1) virus circulating since 1998 is a reassortment of swine, avian, and human genes. Its origin and when/where it occurred are unknown. The virus, also known as Influenza A(H1N1) or 2009 H1N1 flu, is now transmitted between humans. It is less lethal than H5N1 avian flu but more so than seasonal flu. Researchers are still investigating the role of swine in the virus's emergence. The H1N1 virus, less lethal than H5N1 avian flu but more so than seasonal flu, has spread enough to be classified as a pandemic. On April 21, 2009, CDC reported two children in California recovered from a unique influenza strain with gene segments from swine flu viruses. Two days later, five more H1N1 cases were reported. Mexico announced a new influenza strain affecting the country with over 1,000 suspected cases, leading to school closures and event cancellations. The H1N1 virus, less lethal than H5N1 avian flu but more so than seasonal flu, has spread enough to be classified as a pandemic. The Mexican government closed schools and canceled public gatherings due to over 1,000 suspected cases of a new influenza strain. WHO raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 5 as human cases were reported in Canada and Spain. The H1N1 virus, less lethal than H5N1 avian flu but more so than seasonal flu, has spread enough to be classified as a pandemic. WHO raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 5 as human cases were reported in Canada and Spain. On June 11, 2009, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, due to the spread of the virus into multiple countries. By June 22, 2009, more than 50,000 human cases of H1N1 had been confirmed in over 80 countries, with 231 deaths reported. As of June 22, 2009, WHO reported over 50,000 confirmed H1N1 cases in 80+ countries with 231 deaths. The virus spread globally, prompting WHO to raise the pandemic alert level. WHO emphasized that the virus's spread did not indicate increased virulence and advised against travel restrictions. The risk of contracting the virus from pork consumption was deemed low by FAO, OIE, and WHO. WHO advises against travel restrictions as it would have little effect on stopping the spread of H1N1. They recommend delaying international travel for those who are ill. Most people with H1N1 experience flu-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment. Antiviral drugs can help reduce symptoms, duration of illness, and prevent severe disease and death. The circulating strain of H1N1 is a new virus, with only a small number of cases treated with antiviral drugs. WHO has been maintaining a global stockpile of approximately 5 million adult treatment courses of oseltamivir and zanamivir for the new strain of H1N1. They have distributed 3 million treatment courses to developing countries in need, as there is no available vaccine yet. CDC and WHO are working on developing one. The current strain of H1N1 has no available vaccine, but CDC, WHO, and others are working on developing one. Seasonal influenza vaccines do not protect against H1N1. It may take 5-6 months to mass-produce a vaccine once the strain is modified. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline plan to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to poor countries. Most countries, except China, are following WHO recommendations. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline plan to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to poor countries. Most countries, except China, are following WHO recommendations. China has quarantined Mexican nationals, leading to flight bans between Mexico and China. Some countries are advising against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The European Union Health Commissioner urged Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to the United States. On April 27, 2009, the European Union Health Commissioner advised Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The CDC recommended U.S. travelers to avoid nonessential travel to Mexico. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended the decision not to close U.S. borders with Mexico, stating that closing the border would have minimal benefits while incurring high costs. The virus strain from Mexico was already present throughout the United States. Closing the U.S. border to Mexico would have minimal benefits and high costs as the virus strain is already present throughout the country. Focus should be on mitigating the virus rather than containment through border closures. Some countries are using thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers, but the effectiveness is debated. Egypt has ordered the slaughter of pigs to prevent the spread of H1N1, even though pigs have not been identified as a source of human transmission. Several countries have taken actions to prevent the spread of H1N1 among animals, including Egypt ordering the slaughter of pigs. Some countries have also banned pork imports from the United States, Canada, and Mexico. USAID has established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team to coordinate humanitarian response to H1N1 outbreaks, providing over $16 million in aid to Latin America and the Caribbean. This aid focuses on H1N1 specifically and builds on previous pandemic preparedness efforts. The US has provided over $16 million in aid to Latin America and the Caribbean to respond to H1N1 outbreaks. The aid focuses on H1N1 specifically and builds on previous pandemic preparedness efforts. USAID has donated personal protection equipment kits and biodegradable powder to Vietnam to help respond to potential new outbreaks of avian or H1N1 influenza. The CDC has donated 4,000 PPE kits and 100 boxes of biodegradable powder to Vietnam to help animal health workers respond to potential new outbreaks of avian or H1N1 influenza. The kits, valued at over $57,000, can be used in response to H5N1 bird flu or H1N1 outbreaks. CDC is actively involved in responding to H1N1 outbreaks and collaborates with WHO on influenza research and testing. The CDC sends testing kits to public health labs worldwide to identify influenza subtypes. HHS Secretary announced the distribution of treatment courses to Mexico and Latin America. CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala to assist in controlling the spread of the virus. The CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala, including experts in various fields, to assist in controlling the spread of the H1N1 virus. They work under the WHO/Pan American Health Organization Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and aim to understand illness severity and transmission patterns, as well as improve laboratory capacity. Additionally, CDC collaborates with other organizations globally and supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries. The CDC collaborates with global organizations like WHO and China CDC to support pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries. USAID has provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with a focus on advanced disease surveillance and control measures in Latin America and the Caribbean. USAID has provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with $0.9 million directed at H1N1 response efforts in Mexico, $0.2 million in Panama, and $5 million to the region. Assistance includes support to FAO for animal surveillance in Latin America and the Caribbean, distribution of PPE kits, and pre-positioning 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries for pandemic preparedness. USAID also conducted a pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia as part of its H2P Initiative. USAID pre-positioned 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries for pandemic preparedness. A pandemic preparedness exercise was held in Ethiopia as part of the H2P Initiative, bringing together stakeholders from nine East African countries to develop a pandemic response action plan and test existing ones. The simulation exercise helped identify weaknesses and improve preparedness plans for any potential influenza pandemic. USAID conducted a simulation exercise to test pandemic preparedness plans, focusing on influenza outbreaks from various sources. The exercises aimed to improve cross-border coordination and address potential issues. USAID plans to hold similar exercises in South Africa and Asia in 2009. Additionally, USAID is collaborating with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 countries in Africa and Asia to ensure preparedness for cooperation with civilian authorities. In collaboration with the Department of Defense, USAID is providing military assistance in 30 countries across Africa and Asia to ensure preparedness for pandemics. Congress has funded efforts to train health workers in foreign countries for pandemic response since FY2005. Since FY2005, Congress has funded U.S. efforts to train health workers in foreign countries for pandemic preparedness and response, including H5N1 avian flu and H1N1. The U.S. has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, making it the largest single donor. The funds have supported international efforts in over 100 nations, focusing on preparedness, surveillance, and response. The U.S. has provided $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts in over 100 nations. The assistance focused on preparedness, surveillance, and response, with funding allocated for bilateral activities, support to international organizations, regional programs, global contingency, technical assistance, humanitarian aid, and influenza research. The U.S. has allocated $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, including funding for international technical assistance, humanitarian aid, research, stockpiles of supplies, and global communications. The U.S. has allocated $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, including funding for surveillance, outbreak investigation, emergency response, and global communications. Contributions by agency include USAID: $542 million, HHS: $353 million, USDA: $37 million, DOD: $10 million, and DOS: $7 million. President Obama has requested $1.5 billion for pandemic preparedness and response activities. The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill allocated $50 million for USAID pandemic preparedness and $200 million to CDC for H1N1 activities. The bill did not specify how much of the $200 million CDC should spend on international efforts. Infectious diseases, causing over 25% of global deaths, have raised concerns about global security. Recent outbreaks like H5N1 and SARS highlight the threat of infectious diseases. Influenza A H1N1 has shown the danger posed by infectious diseases. The emergence of influenza A H1N1 has highlighted the threat of infectious diseases, with 75% originating from animals. Effective responses require a multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholders from various sectors. Investments made by the US and other international players have been crucial in preparing for pandemics and monitoring disease spread. Health experts have made significant progress in developing tests, treatments, and strategies against H1N1. Some health experts have concerns about poorer countries' capacity to monitor and respond to H1N1. It is cautioned not to become complacent as influenza transmission accelerates in winter months. Questions remain about potential gene changes in the virus, especially in countries dealing with H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. In May 2009, there was a debate about whether WHO should maintain its pandemic influenza phase system, which reflects the spread of the virus and transmission patterns, not severity. Some argued for an alert system based on severity to avoid panic and economic disruptions if the pandemic threat level is raised to Phase 6. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6, despite concerns about causing panic and economic disruptions. Director General Margaret Chan emphasized that the severity did not change, and WHO updated its pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide. The updated pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide outlines steps governments should take in planning for an epidemic. USAID announced a new five-year program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to establish a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that infect humans. USAID, in collaboration with CDC and USDA, is working on a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that infect humans like SARS, H5N1, and HIV/AIDS. The focus is on investing in establishing a network of laboratories in Africa to improve diagnosis of new emergent pathogens. Concerns exist about the limited public health and surveillance capacity in most African countries, with South Africa being the only sub-Saharan country to have confirmed cases of H1N1. Laboratory and surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa are in poor condition, with limited public health and surveillance capacity. CDC, USAID, and other international health experts are working to improve these systems by providing H1N1 testing kits to laboratories in African countries. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a debatable issue. Access to treatments and vaccines in poor countries has been a long-standing issue, with concerns raised during HIV/AIDS and H5N1 outbreaks. Lack of access to medicines is a global problem, with over 30% of the world's population lacking regular access. WHO estimates that over 90% of global influenza vaccine development capacity is concentrated in wealthier countries. Access to treatments and vaccines in poor countries is a significant issue, with concerns about lack of access to medicines globally. WHO estimates that over 90% of global influenza vaccine development capacity is in wealthier countries, leading to reliance on donor countries for access. Concerns also exist about poorer countries' ability to effectively administer mass vaccination campaigns. WHO expects national authorities to handle mass H1N1 vaccination efforts if a vaccine is developed, as some fear richer countries may hoard treatments during a pandemic. Some argue that poorer countries may struggle to administer mass vaccination campaigns effectively. WHO reported it would not conduct mass H1N1 vaccination campaigns, expecting national authorities to take on the task. Concerns exist about the severity of the H1N1 strain, especially if it coexists with H5N1 bird flu in the same area. This could complicate efforts to control both flu strains. Health experts, including the WHO, are concerned about the severity of the H1N1 strain circulating globally. There is worry that H5N1 bird flu and H1N1 could coexist in the same area, potentially leading to the creation of a new strain with the ability to cause human illness. Concerns about H5N1 causing a pandemic arose in 2004 when human cases were reported in Thailand and Viet Nam. The human cases were linked to outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry that started in 2003 and spread to eight Asian nations by 2006. The H5N1 avian influenza outbreak began in 2003, affecting eight Asian nations. By 2006, 50 countries worldwide confirmed outbreaks. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with Indonesia and Cambodia not reporting H1N1 cases. H5N1 is more virulent but less transmissible than H1N1, killing about 60% of humans who contract it. Most human deaths from H5N1 occur after direct contact with sick birds. H5N1 bird flu is more deadly than H1N1, killing about 60% of humans who contract it. Most human deaths from H5N1 occur after direct contact with sick birds, while animals have not been identified as a source of transmission for H1N1. Indonesia and Cambodia have not reported H1N1 cases."
