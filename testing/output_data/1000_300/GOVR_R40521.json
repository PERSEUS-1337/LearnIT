    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is the federal statute for educating children with disabilities, providing funding and setting principles for special education services. It requires states to offer a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to all eligible children, assess their needs, and create individual education programs (IEPs) for those receiving services. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates evaluating all children with disabilities for special education eligibility, creating individual education programs (IEPs) for services, involving parents in planning, promoting inclusion, and providing procedural safeguards. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides rights to parents, including due process hearings and appeals to federal court. It was enacted in 1975 to ensure education for children with disabilities. IDEA has undergone multiple reauthorizations, with the most recent in 2004. Congress is now considering potential issues for the next reauthorization. The act defines a child with a disability differently from the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) defines a child with a disability categorically, requiring special education and related services. Disabilities include mental retardation, hearing impairments, speech or language impairments, visual impairments, emotional disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities. In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District, the court examined whether a child with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD qualified as a child with a disability under IDEA. The court found that the child met the categories of serious emotional disturbance and other health impairments, as his educational performance was affected by these conditions. The key factor was the need for special education and related services. In L.I. v. Maine School Administrative District No. 55, the court found that a child with Asperger's Syndrome and an adjustment disorder with depressed mood was considered a child with a disability under IDEA, despite high grades and non-disruptive behavior. The court rejected the argument that IDEA is limited to children whose disabilities significantly impact education. In L.I. v. Maine School Administrative District No. 55, a child with Asperger's Syndrome and an adjustment disorder with depressed mood was considered a child with a disability under IDEA, despite high grades and non-disruptive behavior. The court rejected the argument that IDEA is limited to children whose disabilities significantly impact education. In Board of Education of Montgomery County v. S.G., the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the school's argument that a child with schizophrenia was not a child with a disability because the disability did not adversely affect her school performance. The Ninth Circuit ruled that a child with ADHD, depression, reactive attachment disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder was not eligible for IDEA services despite exhibiting violent tendencies. The Fifth Circuit also found no adverse educational effect from a child's ADHD in a separate case. In School District v. AD, the Fifth Circuit found no adverse educational effect from the child's ADHD. In Mr. and Mrs. N.C. v. Bedford Central School District, the Second Circuit examined whether a child with dysthymic disorder met the requirements for seriously emotionally disturbed under IDEA regulations. It was noted that even if the child qualified as seriously emotionally disturbed, there was insufficient evidence of adverse educational impact. IDEA requires states to have policies and procedures in place to identify, locate, and evaluate children with disabilities in need of special education, known as child find. The Ninth Circuit ruled in Compton Unified School District v. Addison that failing to evaluate a ninth grader who showed signs of needing special education violated the IDEA's child find requirement. The Supreme Court is considering the case, seeking input from the Department of Justice on whether parents can file due process complaints for negligence by school officials. The Supreme Court is seeking input from the Department of Justice on whether parents can file due process complaints for negligence by school officials regarding the provision of special education services to children with disabilities under the IDEA. The core requirement of IDEA is that states must provide children with disabilities a free appropriate public education to receive federal funding. The Supreme Court decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 clarified the requirements of FAPE under IDEA, emphasizing the need for educational benefit for children with disabilities. The Supreme Court in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley (1982) emphasized that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires access to a free appropriate public education (FAPE) that confers educational benefit. FAPE includes personalized instruction, support services, meeting state standards, aligning with the child's Individualized Education Program (IEP), and being at grade level. Mainstreaming is acceptable if it meets these criteria. The Supreme Court emphasized in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley (1982) that FAPE under IDEA requires personalized instruction, support services, and meeting state standards. The IEP must be formulated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade, but states are not required to \"maximize\" each child's potential. Progression and measurable gains are sufficient to meet the FAPE requirement. The Supreme Court emphasized in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley (1982) that FAPE under IDEA requires personalized instruction, support services, and meeting state standards. The primary responsibility for formulating the education provided was left by IDEA to state and local educational agencies. The Court did not establish a specific test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits for children with disabilities. Complying with the requirements of the Act for access to education is less challenging than meeting the standards for FAPE. The Supreme Court did not set a specific test for determining educational benefits for children with disabilities in the Rowley case. Lower courts have varied in interpreting Rowley, with some emphasizing access to education and minimal educational progress as sufficient for an adequate IEP. In Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes, the Eighth Circuit emphasized Rowley's \"access to education\" requirement and found the IEP adequate despite minimal progress. The dissenting opinion criticized the child's achievement as \"trivial\" and argued that IDEA should provide more substantial educational benefits. Some courts have differing interpretations of IDEA, with some requiring more than de minimis educational benefit in IEPs. Some courts have interpreted Rowley's \"some educational benefit\" requirement more broadly. For instance, the Third Circuit in Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16 held that an IEP must provide more than de minimis educational benefit. The Fifth Circuit in Cypress-Fairbanks Indep. School District v. Michael F. stated that the educational benefit of an IEP must be meaningful and outlined four factors to assess this. Other courts have considered academic achievement testing and grades to evaluate educational benefit. In Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District, a student received FAPE under IDEA despite missed days and limited curriculum, as his SAT scores improved and he achieved excellent grades. However, in Ringwood Board of Education v. K.H.J., the Third Circuit ruled that IDEA requires more than a negligible benefit for children with above-average intelligence. Procedural violations do not always constitute a violation of FAPE. In N.B. and C.B. v. Hellgate Elementary School District, the Ninth Circuit found that certain procedural violations may be significant enough to deny FAPE, but not all violations necessarily affect the child's substantive rights. For example, inaccessible facilities may not violate FAPE if there is general program accessibility, and a resolution session improperly convened may not violate FAPE if it does not substantially affect the child's educational opportunities. In N.B. and C.B. v. Hellgate Elementary School District, the Ninth Circuit held that certain procedural violations, such as failure to evaluate a child in all areas of suspected disability, can deny FAPE. Another instance was when the LEA unilaterally scheduled an IEP meeting without parental agreement. The application of the Supreme Court's analysis in Rowley to current controversies is complicated by changes in the interpretation of \"educational standards.\" The term \"educational standards\" has evolved to refer to specific content-based standards outlining what a child should know and be able to do in their education. The 1997 Amendments to IDEA emphasized standards-based education, leading to significant changes in IEP requirements. This included the need for measurable annual goals to help children progress in the general curriculum. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasized high expectations for children with disabilities and their access to the general curriculum. Questions have been raised about the current application of educational standards for students with disabilities. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasized high expectations for children with disabilities and their access to the general curriculum. Questions have been raised concerning the current application of Rowley in IDEA and the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA), particularly regarding changes in FAPE requirements and the relationship between IDEA and NCLBA. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA now require specially designed instruction and related services to be based on peer-reviewed research to the extent practicable. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA emphasized high expectations for children with disabilities and their access to the general curriculum. Questions have been raised concerning the current application of Rowley in IDEA and the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA), particularly regarding changes in FAPE requirements and the relationship between IDEA and NCLBA. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA now require specially designed instruction and related services to be based on peer-reviewed research to the extent practicable. Peer-reviewed research is reviewed by qualified and independent reviewers to ensure quality before publication. In a court case, it was argued that an IEP violated IDEA because it was not based on peer-reviewed research, but the court found the school's \"eclectic approach\" sufficient and emphasized the need to satisfy IDEA requirements without imposing personal views. The court emphasized that the school's \"eclectic approach\" satisfied IDEA requirements without imposing personal views. An Individualized Education Team writes an IEP for children with disabilities, including academic goals, services, and integration with non-disabled peers. The IEP must meet detailed IDEA requirements for a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). The IEP is a key component of IDEA, outlining measurable goals, services, and integration with non-disabled peers. Judicial decisions focus on whether the IEP complies with IDEA procedures and is reasonably calculated to provide educational benefits. Compliance does not require perfection, but the IEP must enable the child to receive educational benefits. In School Board of Independent School District No. 11 v. Joshua Renollett, the Eighth Circuit court found that despite some flaws in the child's IEP, it still provided educational benefits and did not violate IDEA. Similarly, the Second Circuit in Cabouli v. Chappaqua Central School District determined that the child's progress indicated the IEP was adequate and compliant with IDEA. The absence of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not automatically invalidate it, as seen in Nack v. Orange City School District. The lack of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not necessarily invalidate it, as seen in Nack v. Orange City School District. Courts have ruled that lack of progress in one school year does not always indicate an IDEA violation, as IDEA does not guarantee success but requires sufficient specialized services for educational benefit. However, an IEP that fails to provide educational benefits can violate IDEA, as shown in A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board. Courts have found that an IEP must provide educational benefits to comply with IDEA. In A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board, an IEP sending a child to an unidentified private day school was deemed inadequate. In M.L. v. Federal Way School District, not including a regular education teacher on the IEP team was considered a denial of FAPE. However, in R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District, IDEA did not mandate the child's current special education teacher's participation. Parents' input in an IEP has been a focus in recent court decisions. The participation of the child's current special education teacher is required in an IEP, with courts limiting parents' control over the content. Recent court decisions have allowed schools to conduct independent evaluations and have noted the difficulty in drawing a precise line between healthy parental input and impermissible demands. The First Circuit ruled that an IEP was not procedurally deficient due to incompleteness, acknowledging the challenge of drawing a precise line between parental input and school responsibilities. Courts have sided with parents in IEP cases, such as in County School Board of York County v. A.L., where lack of notice, failure to inform parents of due process rights, and premature placement decisions were found to violate IDEA. Additionally, scheduling an IEP meeting without considering parents' availability and denying rescheduling requests was deemed a denial of FAPE. The child's placement before the IEP meeting violated IDEA's procedural requirements. The school's scheduling of the meeting without considering parents' availability and denying rescheduling requests denied the student FAPE, which includes special education and related services like transportation, speech-language pathology, and counseling. Related services under IDEA include physical and occupational therapy, therapeutic recreation, social work, school nurse services, counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical services for diagnostic and evaluation purposes. Two Supreme Court decisions have addressed the concept of related services, particularly regarding what constitutes a medical service. In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, the Court examined the case of a child with spina bifida requiring clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, the Supreme Court ruled that schools must provide medical services under IDEA if necessary for a child with a disability to benefit from special education, and if the service can be provided by a qualified non-physician. This decision drew a clear distinction between services that require a doctor and those that can be provided by other qualified individuals. In 1999, Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F. involved a paralyzed child who required substantial services, including suction on his tracheotomy tube and manual air pumping. The school denied the parents' request for services, proposing a test based on various factors. The Court rejected the school's proposed test for related services for a paralyzed child, stating that the medical services exclusion only applied to services provided by a physician or hospital. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA addressed this issue by establishing risk pools for high-need children with disabilities, allowing states to reserve funds for this purpose. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA established risk pools for high-need children with disabilities, allowing states to reserve funds to assist LEAs serving these children. Recent IDEA cases have emphasized federal court discretion in defining required services for children with disabilities to benefit from special education. IDEA mandates that children with disabilities be educated with non-disabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate. Recent court decisions have emphasized the importance of educating children with disabilities in regular classrooms with supplementary aids and services, only resorting to separate schooling when necessary. The two-pronged approach considers if satisfactory education can be achieved in a regular classroom first, then if mainstreaming to the maximum extent appropriate has been done. Factors include the school district's efforts to accommodate the child in the regular classroom. In A.G. v. Durtan, the Third Circuit examined the impact of a child with disabilities on other students in a regular classroom, noting disruptive behaviors like loud vocalizations, removal of shoes and socks, inappropriate clapping and grinding teeth, toileting difficulties, and inappropriate touching. The disruptions were considered notable but not decisive in the court's decision. The court upheld the decision that the student could not be educated full time in a regular classroom due to disruptive behaviors like loud vocalizations, removal of shoes and socks, inappropriate clapping, grinding teeth, toileting difficulties, and inappropriate touching. P.L. 94-142, the original version of IDEA, provided grants to states for children with disabilities and required disputes between schools and parents to be resolved using due process procedures, with the child remaining in their current educational placement. The \"stay put\" provision in IDEA ensures that a child with a disability remains in their current educational placement during disputes. The concept was created to prevent discrimination against children with disabilities. In the case of Honig v. Doe, the Supreme Court debated exceptions to this rule for emotionally disturbed children involved in disruptive behaviors. The Supreme Court in the Honig v. Doe case debated exceptions to the \"stay put\" provision in IDEA for emotionally disturbed children involved in disruptive behaviors. The Court found that schools cannot unilaterally exclude disabled students, but can temporarily suspend them for up to 10 school days if they pose a threat to others. If parents refuse to change the child's placement, schools can seek court intervention. The Honig injunction allows schools to seek judicial relief for dangerous children with disabilities who pose a threat. Congress amended IDEA to give schools the authority to remove a child to an interim alternative setting if they bring a firearm, weapon, or drugs to school. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 expanded provisions to include weapons and drugs, and the 2004 reauthorization included situations of serious bodily injury at school. Courts have addressed stay put requirements during transitions from Part C to Part B of IDEA. The Third Circuit in Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit held that the stay put provision requires the child to continue to receive conductive education until the dispute over its appropriateness for inclusion in her IEP was resolved, while the Eleventh Circuit in D.P. v. School Board of Broward County disagreed, finding that children applying for initial admission to a public school program were not entitled to continue to receive services pursuant to their IFSPs. Other issues regarding the stay put provision have involved mediation, private school placement, a move from a resource room to a classroom, and the appeals process in the courts. The Eleventh Circuit in Sammons v. Polk County School Board ruled that the stay put provision does not apply to a request for mediation under IDEA regulations. In L.M. v. Capistrano Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit held that a child unilaterally placed in a private school by parents cannot use the stay put provision to continue private school placement. The stay put provision does not apply to a child unilaterally placed in a private school by parents, as ruled in E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken. In Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District, the provision applies throughout the appeals process. An attempt to apply a novel interpretation of the stay put provision failed in N.D. v. State of Hawaii due to fiscal concerns. In Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the stay put provision applies throughout the appeals process. In N.D. v. State of Hawaii, a novel interpretation of the stay put provision failed due to fiscal concerns. Hawaii's decision to furlough teachers and shut down public schools for 17 Fridays in the 2009-2010 school year led to a lawsuit alleging a violation of the stay put provision, but the Ninth Circuit found no violation. Congressional interest in the use of seclusion and restraints resulted in the passing of the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act.\" The House passed H.R. 4247, the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act,\" addressing the use of seclusion and restraints in public schools for children with and without disabilities. IDEA emphasizes positive behavioral interventions but does not prohibit the use of mechanical restraints for children with disabilities. IDEA allows for positive behavioral interventions but does not outright ban mechanical restraints for children with disabilities. State laws may dictate the use of restraints, with a focus on implementing them in line with the child's IEP and considering positive behavioral supports. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA, but in Honig v. Doe, it was determined that suspensions longer than ten days violated IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision. In Honig v. Doe, the Court examined IDEA's requirements for children with violent behavior, ruling that suspensions longer than ten days violate IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision. While IDEA does not specifically address the use of seclusion or restraints, cases have alleged violations of a child's right to education. Courts generally do not find violations if seclusion or restraint is necessary for safety or academic progress. Courts have examined whether the administrative exhaustion requirements of IDEA apply in situations involving the use of seclusion and restraint. In C.N. v. Willmar Public Schools, the child's IEP allowed for the use of seclusion and restraint when necessary, but the parents alleged improper and excessive use. They withdrew their daughter from the school and requested a due process hearing to challenge the adequacy of educational services. The parents withdrew their daughter from the school due to alleged improper and excessive procedures. They requested a due process hearing to challenge the adequacy of educational services. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the case, stating that complaints must be filed while the child is still in the school district. In another case, parents used IDEA to challenge a New York State regulation banning aversive interventions. The Second Circuit vacated the decision. The Second Circuit vacated the district court's injunction against the regulation banning aversive interventions, finding that the regulations were informed and rational. Disability harassment may result in a denial of FAPE under IDEA, with courts holding that severe harassment can deny access to educational benefits. The Department of Education has stated that disability harassment may lead to a denial of FAPE under IDEA. Courts have found that severe harassment can result in the denial of educational benefits, violating IDEA. Claims of harassment must be tied to IDEA and show that FAPE was denied. The ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act can also lead to actions alleging retaliation for advocating IDEA violations. Special education student rights protection is considered a protected activity under the Rehabilitation Act. The Rehabilitation Act protects special education student rights, including advocacy for IDEA violations. Section 615 of IDEA outlines procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, such as due process procedures and mediation. Complaints must be filed within two years of the alleged violation. Schools can also file complaints under the 2004 reauthorization. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA allows schools to file complaints within two years of the alleged violation. After an administrative decision, aggrieved parties have 90 days to file suit in district court. A resolution session is required before a due process hearing, involving parents, the IEP team, and a representative of the local educational agency. Mediation of disputes is also allowed under IDEA. The meeting involves parents, IEP team members, and a representative from the local educational agency with decision-making authority. Provisions for mediation of disputes under IDEA were added in the 1997 reauthorization and retained in current law. The 2004 reauthorization allowed for judicial enforcement of agreements from resolution sessions or mediation. Court decisions have addressed issues like confidentiality in resolution sessions and the presence of a school board attorney when a parent does not have one. The statute does not provide confidentiality for resolution session discussions, which are not considered settlement discussions. Court decisions have clarified that the presence of a school board attorney is limited to the preliminary meeting, not the writing of a settlement decision. Procedural violations in a resolution session do not violate FAPE unless they substantially affect the child's educational opportunities. Courts have ruled that judicial enforcement of settlement agreements is limited to those reached through dispute resolution or mediation. The courts have held that judicial enforcement is limited to agreements reached through dispute resolution or mediation. In Amy S. v. Danbury, the Sixth Circuit ruled that mediation agreements signed by parents precluded a claim. Similarly, in Ballard v. Philadelphia School District, a parent's argument that a settlement agreement was invalid was rejected. IDEA requires due process complaints to include a description of the problem, relevant facts, and proposed resolution. In Knight v. Washington School District, a court case involving these requirements was discussed. In Knight v. Washington School District, a district court addressed issues regarding the review of a hearing officer's determination that a due process complaint did not meet IDEA's pleading requirements. The court quoted Senate report language stating that the adequacy of the complaint notice should be determined on the face of the complaint, with no hearing or appeal allowed. The court found it troubling that it had no jurisdiction to assess the complaint notice's adequacy, which was unsatisfactory for the plaintiffs. The court found it troubling that it had no jurisdiction to assess the complaint notice's adequacy, which was unsatisfactory for the plaintiffs. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the action but modified the dismissal to be without prejudice. Several courts of appeal have addressed the issue of whether an LEA may bring an action against an SEA for its failure to comply with IDEA and found that IDEA does not allow such a private right of action. In compliance with IDEA, courts have ruled that LEAs lack statutory authority to challenge state agencies for noncompliance with IDEA's procedural safeguards. IDEA limits complaints to matters concerning child identification, evaluation, or educational placement. LEAs have no private right of action under IDEA to litigate issues beyond those raised by parents on behalf of their child. The Supreme Court in Winkelman v. Parma City School District examined whether non-attorney parents can sue under IDEA. The Supreme Court in Winkelman v. Parma City School District ruled that non-attorney parents can bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights, including their child's entitlement to a free appropriate public education. Justice Kennedy emphasized that IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues. The Supreme Court in Winkelman v. Parma City School District ruled that non-attorney parents can bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights, including their child's entitlement to a free appropriate public education. Justice Kennedy emphasized that IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues, highlighting the importance of considering the entire statutory scheme to protect the rights of children with disabilities and their parents. The Supreme Court in Winkelman v. Parma City School District emphasized that parents of children with disabilities have a personal interest in the goals of IDEA, which includes providing rights to parents as well as children. The Court found that IDEA grants parents substantive rights, not just procedural ones, and rejected arguments that increased parental rights would lead to more lawsuits and higher costs for states. Justice Kennedy stated that IDEA does not differentiate between the rights of children and parents, and that concerns about costs were not sufficient to challenge the law under the Constitution's Spending Clause. The Supreme Court in Winkelman v. Parma City School District emphasized that parents of children with disabilities have substantive rights under IDEA, including the ability to enforce FAPE. Justice Kennedy noted that concerns about costs were not enough to challenge IDEA under the Constitution's Spending Clause. Additionally, parents can be awarded attorneys' fees if they prevail in cases where the parent's actions are deemed to be for an improper purpose. Parents have personal rights to enforce FAPE and can assert their own claims, but cannot use their rights to circumvent existing consent decrees. In Woodruff v. Hamilton Township Public Schools, the Third Circuit found that parents may amend complaints to assert their own claims, but those claims must be personal to the parents to be valid. Parental rights to enforce FAPE have been extended to cases under Section 504 and the ADA, but not all courts agree with this interpretation. In D.A. and M.A. v. Pleasantville School District, it was found that parental rights cannot be used to circumvent existing consent decrees. Some courts have extended parental rights to cases under Section 504 and the ADA, but not all agree. In Blanchard v. Morton School District, the Ninth Circuit ruled that money damages are not available under IDEA for a child with a disability. The Second Circuit addressed the rights of parents in another case. The Ninth Circuit ruled in Blanchard v. Morton School District that money damages are not available under IDEA for a child with a disability. The Second Circuit addressed parental rights in Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City, emphasizing that noncustodial parents may not have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child. IDEA is detailed in its provisions for children with disabilities, but other federal statutes like Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act also address education rights. The IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA all address the education rights of individuals with disabilities. Each statute plays a significant role in ensuring non-discrimination and providing additional programs for children with disabilities. IDEA is a grants and civil rights statute, while Section 504 and the ADA are civil rights statutes that prohibit discrimination. The ADA was modeled after Section 504, but each has its own coverage and provisions. The ADA and Section 504 are civil rights statutes that protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination. While Section 504 applies to entities receiving federal funds, the ADA has broader coverage. The interaction of these statutes in education, particularly in cases of dissatisfaction with school determinations under IDEA, remains unclear. IDEA ensures the provision of FAPE through detailed due process requirements. While the ADA and Section 504 protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination, IDEA contains detailed due process requirements for ensuring FAPE. Courts have examined issues regarding the interaction of these statutes, particularly in determining the burden of proof in due process hearings. The Supreme Court's decision in Schaffer v. Weast clarified that the burden of proof rests with the party seeking relief in cases of allegedly inadequate IEPs. The burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing lies with the party seeking relief, as clarified by the Supreme Court in Schaffer v. Weast. Justice O'Connor rejected arguments that the burden should be on the school system, noting that schools are obligated to safeguard information under Congress's requirements. The Supreme Court clarified in Schaffer v. Weast that the burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing lies with the party seeking relief. Justice O'Connor emphasized that schools must share information with parents to ensure procedural rights are upheld, thus eliminating any informational advantage. Issues regarding services for children with disabilities in private schools under IDEA have been controversial. The cost of placement in a private school is covered by the LEA or SEA if done by them, but not if done unilaterally by parents unless certain findings are made. IDEA mandates some services for children in private schools, even if placed there by parents. The cost of private school placement is not covered by the LEA unless specific findings are made by a hearing officer or court. However, IDEA requires some services for children in private schools, even if they are unilaterally placed there by parents. Reimbursement for private school placement may be required if the agency did not provide a free appropriate public education in a timely manner. The cost of private school enrollment may be reimbursed if the agency did not provide a free appropriate public education in a timely manner. Recent Supreme Court cases have addressed tuition reimbursement for parents who placed their child in a private school without receiving special education from the public school. In a 2007 decision, the Court allowed an appeals court ruling on private school reimbursement to stand. In School District of the City of New York v. Tom F., the Court allowed an appeals court ruling on private school reimbursement to stand. Parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district. The issue of reimbursement for private school tuition when the child has not received public special education services remained unsettled. In Forest Grove School District v. T.A., the Supreme Court held that IDEA authorized reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private-school placement is appropriate. The Supreme Court ruled in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. that IDEA allows reimbursement for private special-education services if a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private-school placement is suitable. Recent lower court decisions have stated that as long as a child is making educational progress with an IEP from the public school, they are not entitled to private school placement reimbursement. In Central School District, the court found that parents are not entitled to tuition reimbursement for a private school placement if the child's IEP is adequate. Reimbursement for private school tuition may be denied if the private school does not meet the child's educational needs, even if it has a high percentage of children with disabilities. Parents must notify the LEA of any issues with their child's IDEA services to be eligible for reimbursement. Courts have ruled that reimbursement for private school tuition may be denied if parents do not notify the LEA of issues with their child's IDEA services. Reimbursement can also be denied if parents act unreasonably with the school or if the allegations do not result in substantive harm. However, parents may still be eligible for reimbursement if the child has not previously received special education services. If a school district fails to provide FAPE, the child may be entitled to private school reimbursement or compensatory education to make up for inadequate services. The child may be entitled to private school reimbursement or compensatory education if the public school program violates FAPE. Compensatory education is awarded to compensate for inadequate services, based on the Supreme Court's ruling in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts. This ruling allows parents to receive reimbursement for private school tuition and compensatory services. However, there is ambiguity in how compensatory education is awarded, with courts differing on the process. Courts differ on awarding compensatory education for violations of FAPE. Some courts grant education for the same time services were withheld, while others focus on equitable education under IDEA. The IEP for compensatory education may require more services than a general IEP to compensate for the denial of appropriate education. Section 1983 allows suits against state officials for deprivation of rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Section 1983 allows suits against state officials for deprivation of rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States, but the application of damages for pain and suffering to IDEA is unclear. Some courts have allowed damages while others have not. Prevailing parties under IDEA used other statutes to seek attorneys' fees before the Supreme Court clarified the remedies available. The Supreme Court in Smith v. Robinson held that prevailing parties under IDEA could only seek remedies contained in that statute, not through other statutes like section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act or section 1988 of the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Award Act. Congress responded by enacting the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986 to provide for attorneys' fees under IDEA, with further amendments in 1997. The Handicapped Children's Protection Act was enacted in response to the controversial decision in Smith v. Robinson, providing for attorneys' fees under IDEA. Subsequent amendments in 1997 and the 2004 IDEA reauthorization (P.L. 108-446) made additions to the provisions, including allowing attorneys' fees for the state or local educational agency in certain situations. The ADA also allows for the award of attorneys' fees to a prevailing party. The ADA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party. The Supreme Court rejected the \"catalyst theory\" for attorneys' fees, stating that fees are only available with a judicially sanctioned change in the parties' legal relationship. This ruling has been consistently applied to attorneys' fees provision in IDEA cases. Courts have applied Buckhannon to attorneys' fees provision in IDEA cases. Attorneys' fees have been awarded to prevailing parties in administrative and judicial proceedings, even without a finding of a denial of FAPE. However, fees have not been awarded when a child has not been determined to be disabled under IDEA. Fees may be awarded for relief obtained through a settlement agreement. Attorneys' fees are not awarded for failure to refer for assessments or failure to identify a child as disabled. Fees are only awarded for relief obtained through a judicially approved settlement agreement. Fees are not awarded for voluntary or private settlements. In Drennan v. Pulaski County Special School District, fees were not awarded for failure to perform court-ordered duties. Fees are not awarded for representation by consultants or parent-attorneys, but may be awarded to non-parent relatives. Courts have discretion in awarding attorneys' fees. Attorneys' fees may be awarded to non-parent relatives, such as grandparents, by courts with great discretion. The amount awarded can be less than requested based on the party's success. Refusal to attend a meeting without a settlement offer does not necessarily reduce the award. The Fifth Circuit has ruled that refusal to attend a meeting without a settlement offer does not automatically reduce the award. Congress imposed a fee cap on IDEA cases in the District of Columbia starting in FY1999, with subsequent acts maintaining the cap. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows courts to award attorneys' fees to prevailing parties against attorneys of parents who file frivolous complaints. In El Paso Independent School District v. Berry, the Fifth Circuit allowed attorneys' fees to be awarded to a State or local educational agency against a parent's attorney for filing a frivolous complaint. The Sixth Circuit, however, ruled that this provision did not apply to private schools. The Ninth Circuit emphasized that unsuccessful court outcomes do not automatically deem a parent's action frivolous, as it could discourage lawyers from taking on valid IDEA cases. The fee-shifting provision does not apply to private schools, as emphasized by the Ninth Circuit. Unsuccessful court outcomes do not make a parent's action frivolous, to prevent discouraging lawyers from taking on valid IDEA cases. Cases have examined whether the LEA was the prevailing party, with examples from El Paso Independent School District v. Richard R and District of Columbia v. Straus. The school district argued against reducing attorneys' fees awarded to the plaintiff, but did not prevail on educational issues, so they were not entitled to fees. In District of Columbia v. Straus, the court refused to award fees to the school district as they were not the prevailing party. The court highlighted concerns about allowing districts to ignore legal obligations until sued, comply, and then seek fees. Some lower courts have interpreted language on attorneys' fees but there is no provision for expert witness fees for prevailing parents. The parents in Arlington Central School District v. Murphy argued for expert witness fees under IDEA's statutory language allowing attorney's fees for prevailing parents. They pointed to legislative history supporting the inclusion of expert witness fees as part of costs. The Supreme Court, in a decision written by Justice Alito, held that IDEA does not authorize prevailing parents to recover fees paid to experts. The majority opinion stated that Congress enacted IDEA under the Spending Clause, requiring unambiguous conditions for funding acceptance. IDEA's statutory language lacked clear notice for expert witness fees, making legislative history insufficient. The majority opinion in the Supreme Court case concluded that IDEA's statutory language did not provide clear notice for expert witness fees. H.R. 1208 and S. 613 were introduced in Congress to amend IDEA to include expert witness fees. IDEA has two means of dispute resolution and the Department of Education monitors its implementation. The Department of Education is responsible for monitoring the implementation of IDEA, which has two means of dispute resolution. Congress established a protection and advocacy system to protect the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities, including special education students. Court cases filed by P & A's often involve systemic violations of rights. Protection and advocacy systems (P & A's) are used to advocate for individuals with developmental disabilities, including special education students. Many court cases filed by P & A's are class action lawsuits addressing systemic violations of rights, often involving access to student records."
