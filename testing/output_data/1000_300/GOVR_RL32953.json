    "content": "In 1992, the United States ratified the UNFCCC, calling for reducing greenhouse gases. Despite various actions like monitoring emissions and promoting renewable energy, carbon dioxide emissions have increased. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory emissions reductions in 2001. The U.S. climate change policy has since focused on different approaches. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory emissions reductions, focusing U.S. climate change policy on voluntary initiatives. The 2002 Climate Action Report highlighted mostly voluntary programs with only a few regulatory ones aimed at achieving energy or environmental goals, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Several congressional proposals in the 109th Congress aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through improved monitoring, market-oriented programs, and energy-related initiatives. These initiatives were seen as a \"no regrets\" policy, considering the potential climate change effects of air quality and energy policies. The curr_chunk discusses proposals in the 109th Congress to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market-oriented programs and energy-related initiatives, focusing on two specific bills introduced by Senators McCain and Lieberman in 2005. The primary goal of the proposed legislation is to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases through flexible, market-based mechanisms. In February 2005, Senators McCain and Lieberman introduced the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005 (S. 342) to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases through market-based mechanisms. A revised version, S. 1151, aimed to encourage innovation in carbon-reducing technologies but was defeated in the 109th Congress. S. 1151, a bill for mandatory economy-wide emission reductions, was defeated in a 38-60 vote during the Energy Policy Act of 2005 debate. The bill allowed participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs for reduction requirements, excluding residential and agricultural sources of greenhouse gases. Senator Bingaman proposed a draft amendment based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's recommendation for a tradeable permit program to limit greenhouse gases. The draft amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman, based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's recommendation, mandates an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of the economy. It requires a 2.4% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP between 2010 and 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually after 2019. Implementation would be through a market-oriented allowance trading program, with a cost-limiting safety valve for covered entities. The draft amendment includes a cost-limiting safety valve for covered entities, allowing them to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions at a price of $7 a ton in 2010. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity rather than placing an absolute cap on emissions, unlike S. 1151. While S. 1151 would cap emissions from covered entities, the draft amendment expects overall emissions to continue rising due to uncovered sources. The draft amendment introduces a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" for covered entities, allowing them to purchase tradeable allowances or make payments to DOE at a set price. In contrast, S. 1151 would place an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities, potentially leading to overall U.S. emissions growth if economic growth outpaces scheduled reductions in emissions intensity. The draft amendment proposes a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" for covered entities to purchase tradeable allowances or make payments to DOE at a set price. In contrast, S. 1151 does not limit the price per allowance that covered entities would pay and differs in other aspects such as covered entities, agency responsibility, and utilization of proceeds from allowance sales/auctions. Emission reduction estimates for both options involve uncertainty, particularly for the draft amendment. The draft amendment and S.1151 propose different approaches for emission reduction. The Energy Information Administration's analysis shows S.1151 would achieve a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010, while the draft amendment would result in a 2.5% reduction. Long-term reductions were not estimated due to uncertainty. The draft amendment would result in a 2.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to business-as-usual. Long-term reductions were not estimated due to uncertainty, but emissions would likely continue to increase under both options, albeit at a slower pace. In the case of the draft amendment, covered emissions would continue to grow if economic growth outstripped the reduction in carbon intensity. The draft amendment would lead to a 2.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to business-as-usual. Covered emissions could continue to grow if economic growth outstrips the reduction in carbon intensity, potentially causing emissions to rise faster than under S. 1151. The draft amendment, S.Amdt. 2028, is similar to S. 1151 and aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, uncertainties exist regarding the number of covered entities and potential emission reductions. The estimates are based on projected GDP and carbon intensity improvements, but do not consider carbon sequestration. The primary source of uncertainty for S. 1151 is the exact number of covered entities required to meet the reduction targets. Estimates for emission reductions under the draft amendment are more uncertain than under S. 1151 due to uncertainties in the number of covered entities. The draft amendment has several uncertainties with respect to emissions reductions, unlike S. 1151 which defines a historic emissions baseline for covered entities to achieve. The draft amendment has uncertainties regarding emission reductions, with future baseline calculated from projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. Economic growth projections range from 2.5% to 3.6% annually, with a reference case of 3.1% annually. The carbon intensity improvement projection is also uncertain. The draft amendment has uncertainties regarding emission reductions, with future baseline calculated from projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. The estimate could be off by 20% or more, and the carbon intensity improvement projection is uncertain. The targeted 2009 carbon intensity is in the range of 159 MMTCE/M$GDP, lower than the 2002 estimate of 183 MMTCE/M$GDP. The draft amendment raises questions about its coverage, assuming 100% coverage but potentially leaving out entities. The safety valve also adds uncertainty to emissions reductions achieved under the draft amendment. The final uncertainty affecting emissions reductions under the draft amendment is the safety valve. Analysis indicates a $7 per ton of carbon dioxide safety valve could be triggered immediately or around 2015. The degree of reductions achievable before the safety valve is triggered is disputed, adding uncertainty, especially in the longer term. The projected cost under the draft amendment is more uncertain than under S. 1151 due to uncertainties in future growth of greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. The projected cost under S. 1151 is uncertain due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. S. 1151 establishes a firm cap on emissions based on the year 2000, requiring offsets for increased emissions from economic growth. More emission reductions likely mean higher costs, while less robust economic growth would result in fewer reductions and lower costs. Cost estimates for S. 1151 are also affected by other uncertainties, with studies showing potential permit prices ranging from $9 to $15 per ton in 2010. The cost estimates for S. 1151 are uncertain and influenced by various factors such as energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon sequestration, and natural gas supply. Different studies show permit prices ranging from $9 to $15 per ton in 2010, highlighting the sensitivity and uncertainty surrounding the potential costs of the legislation. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive to factors compared to S. 1151, as it requires fewer emission reductions and incorporates economic growth into its emissions limitation target. This allows for some increase in future emissions if economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity, resulting in lower costs. The projected cost of the draft amendment is influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures such as energy efficiency improvements and carbon sequestration. The draft amendment's projected cost is influenced by cost-effective control measures like energy efficiency improvements and carbon sequestration. Unlike S. 1151, it does not include international credits in its flexible market implementation program, reducing uncertainty in costs. The safety valve limits the upside risk to $7 per ton in nominal 2010 dollars. The draft amendment's projected cost is $4.8 - $5.9 per ton in 2001 dollars, with a safety valve limiting the upside risk to $7 per ton in nominal 2010 dollars. The safety valve aims to bound costs of climate change control programs while focusing on market-based mechanisms for reducing CO2 emissions. Market-based mechanisms for reducing CO2 emissions focus on setting either acceptable emissions levels or compliance costs, allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution. For example, tradeable permit programs set allowable emissions levels while letting the market determine permit values. Similarly, carbon taxes set maximum unit costs for reducing emissions, with the marketplace determining actual reductions. The preference for a tradeable permit system or safety valve depends on views of cost uncertainty and benefits. The preference for a pure tradeable permit system or inclusion of a safety valve depends on views of cost uncertainty and benefits. If confident in achieving specific CO2 reduction levels with significant benefits, a tradeable permit program may be suitable. This allows for efficient handling of costs through permit trading, concentrating emission reduction efforts at least cost sources. However, if more concerned about potential control costs to the economy, a different approach may be needed. The inclusion of a safety valve in emission reduction efforts allows for capping the marginal cost of control, providing a contingent carbon tax. This approach addresses concerns about substantial control costs to the economy, but the precise level of CO2 reduction achieved is less certain. The safety valve on the draft amendment could be seen as a contingent carbon tax, raising a major policy question about economic costs and emission reduction levels. S. 1151 and the draft amendment propose market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions, with S. 1151 focusing on total emissions and the draft amendment leaning towards pricing mechanisms. The proposals S. 1151 and the draft amendment aim to limit greenhouse gas emissions through market-based systems. S. 1151 sets an absolute cap on emissions with trading allowed, while the draft amendment limits emissions intensity with a cost-limiting safety valve. S. 1151 is expected to achieve larger and more certain emission reductions, while the draft amendment is likely to have lower and more predictable costs. Both proposals would result in lower short-term U.S. emissions compared to business as usual, but total U.S. emissions would still increase, albeit at a slower rate."
