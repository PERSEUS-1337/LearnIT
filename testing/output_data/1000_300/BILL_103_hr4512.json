    "content": "The \"Welfare to Work Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress acknowledges the importance of the Act. The Congress recognizes the challenges faced by welfare recipients in finding permanent employment and believes that work experience in the private sector is crucial for developing valuable skills and securing long-term employment. It is emphasized that government workfare programs are not a sufficient substitute for private sector experience. The aim is to break the cycle of welfare dependency and maximize the economic value of funds currently spent on AFDC payments by promoting work opportunities. To break the cycle of welfare dependency and maximize the economic value of AFDC payments, a one-year tax credit should be given to businesses for wages paid to employees that result in the termination of AFDC eligibility. SEC. 3. REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR HIRING AFDC RECIPIENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a refundable credit for businesses hiring AFDC recipients to reduce welfare dependency. A tax credit is allowed for qualified first-year wages, with 50% for wages up to $6,000 and 25% for wages between $6,000 and $12,000. Qualified first-year wages are defined as wages for services in the first year of employment. The tax credit for qualified first-year wages is limited if the individual worked for other employers, with qualified wages defined as wages paid to qualified former AFDC recipients during the taxable year. The term \"wages\" is defined as per section 51(d) without regard to paragraph (4) thereof. The term \"wages\" for qualified former AFDC recipients is defined as per section 51(d) without regard to paragraph (4) thereof. A qualified former AFDC recipient is certified by a designated local agency as a family member receiving benefits under a State plan approved under the Social Security Act, with wages sufficient to make the family ineligible for benefits. This term excludes individuals who are part of a targeted group. The term \"wages\" for qualified former AFDC recipients is defined as per section 51(d) without regard to paragraph (4) thereof. No credit shall be allowed for wages paid to a qualified former AFDC recipient who replaces an employee terminated without cause. Certain definitions and special rules from section 51 and section 52 apply for this purpose. Technical amendments are made to section 280C of the Code. Technical amendments are made to section 280C of the Code, with specific changes outlined in subsection (a) and paragraph (2) of section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code. The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is also updated. The amendments made by this section apply to individuals who start working for the employer after the enactment of this Act."
