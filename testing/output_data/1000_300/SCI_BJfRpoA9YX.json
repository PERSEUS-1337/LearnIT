    "content": "We propose a generative model to learn image representations that separate object identity from attributes. This allows for manipulation of attributes without changing the object's identity. Our model separates object identity from attributes, enabling attribute manipulation without altering identity. Latent space generative models like GANs and VAEs learn mappings from latent encoding to data space, showing near-linear organization. Latent space learned by generative models like GANs and VAEs is organized linearly, allowing for semantic changes in images. This can be used for image synthesis, editing, and avatar generation. Research focuses on class conditional image synthesis for specific object categories. Latent space generative models allow for semantic changes in images, enabling image synthesis and editing. Research has focused on class conditional image synthesis for specific object categories. Another approach aims to manipulate image attributes by synthesizing images and changing one element or attribute of its content. In this paper, the focus is on solving the problem of image attribute manipulation by synthesizing images and changing a single element or attribute. The goal is to learn a latent space representation that separates object category from attributes, making it more challenging than fine-grain image synthesis. The proposed model learns a factored representation for faces, separating attribute information from the rest of the facial representation. The model is applied to the CelebA BID21 dataset of faces. The paper proposes a new model that learns a factored representation for faces, separating attribute information from the facial representation. It introduces a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder to factorize binary facial attributes from a continuous identity representation. The model achieves competitive classification scores and provides qualitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of the latent variable. Latent space generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) allow for synthesis of novel data samples from latent encodings. The paper discusses the distinction between conditional image synthesis and image attribute editing, showcasing competitive classification scores and successful 'Smiling' attribute editing in over 90% of test cases. The code to reproduce experiments is provided after review. Generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) enable the creation of new data samples from latent encodings. VAE consists of an encoder and decoder, trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p(x). The encoder predicts \u00b5 and \u03c3 for a given input x, with a latent sample drawn from a chosen prior distribution. KL-divergence can be calculated analytically with a multivariate Gaussian prior. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) use a multivariate Gaussian prior to calculate KL-divergence for latent samples. VAEs offer a generative model and an encoding model for image editing in the latent space. However, VAE samples are often blurred, unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) which can generate sharper images. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator model. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) offer a sharper image generation alternative to Variational Autoencoders (VAE). GANs consist of a generator and discriminator model trained in a mini-max game to synthesize samples that confuse the discriminator. The objective of GANs is to synthesize samples that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real samples. Unlike VAEs, GANs do not provide a simple way to map data samples to latent space. The approach presented in the text requires adversarial training on high dimensional distributions. Training adversarial networks on high dimensional data samples remains challenging despite proposed improvements. Instead of adding a decoder to a GAN, a latent generative model combining a VAE with a GAN is considered. The VAE learns an encoding and decoding process, with a discriminator ensuring higher quality of outputted data samples. Various suggestions exist on combining VAEs and GANs, but none are specifically designed for attribute editing. Image samples synthesized from a VAE or GAN depend on the latent variable z drawn from a random distribution, p(z). Well-trained models produce samples resembling training data. Conditional VAEs and GANs provide a solution for synthesizing class-specific data samples, allowing for category-conditional image synthesis by appending a one-hot label vector to inputs. For category-conditional image synthesis, different approaches exist. One common method is to append a one-hot label vector to the encoder and decoder inputs. Another approach involves the encoder outputting a latent vector and an attribute vector, updating the encoder to minimize a classification loss between the true label and the attribute vector. Incorporating attribute information can be beneficial for editing specific attributes in models. In category-conditional image synthesis, incorporating attribute information can be beneficial for editing specific attributes in models. However, a drawback arises when modifying the attribute vector for a fixed latent vector can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. This suggests that information about the attribute to edit is partially contained in the latent vector rather than solely in the attribute vector. This issue has similarities with problems addressed in the GAN literature, where label information is sometimes ignored during sample synthesis. In general, it is expected that the latent vector and attribute vector should be independent. The text discusses the issue of attribute information being partially contained in the latent vector rather than solely in the attribute vector in image synthesis. A proposed process called 'Adversarial Information Factorization' aims to separate information about attributes from the latent vector using a mini-max optimization involving the encoder, auxiliary network, and attribute vector. The goal is to describe a face using a latent vector capturing identity and a unit vector capturing desired attributes. The proposed method, 'Adversarial Information Factorization,' aims to separate attribute information from the latent vector in image synthesis. By training an auxiliary network to predict attributes accurately from the latent vector while updating the VAE encoder to output values that cause the auxiliary network to fail, the desired attribute information can be conveyed in the attribute vector instead. The novel approach involves training the VAE encoder to separate attribute information from the latent vector, integrating this method into a VAE-GAN model to improve image quality. An adversarial method is proposed to factorize label information out of the latent encoding, with the introduction of an auxiliary network for this purpose. The architecture includes an encoder, decoder, discriminator, and auxiliary network for separating attribute information from the latent vector. Parameters of the encoder and decoder are updated using specific loss functions for image synthesis and classification. The architecture for synthesizing images from a desired category involves updating parameters by minimizing a function with regularization coefficients. An additional network and cost function are proposed for training an encoder used for attribute manipulation, incorporating a VAE with information factorization and GAN architecture. The architecture involves a VAE with information factorization and GAN. A discriminator is placed after the encoder to classify samples. An auxiliary network is introduced to predict labels from the latent encoding, promoting attribute information separation. The architecture includes an auxiliary network, A \u03c8, trained to predict labels from the latent encoding to separate attribute information. The encoder, E \u03c6, is updated to prevent attribute information from being encoded in\u1e91. Training involves a mini-max objective where the encoder loss is determined by the confusion of the auxiliary network. This approach results in an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) model. The training procedure for cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) involves encoding an image to obtain a representation, appending a desired attribute label, and passing it through the decoder. Attribute manipulation is achieved by switching between different modes of the desired attribute. The model is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, including an ablation study and facial attribute classification using a deep convolutional GAN, DCGAN. The study involves using a deep convolutional GAN architecture for facial attribute classification, incorporating residual layers for competitive results. The model is evaluated qualitatively for image attribute editing, with a distinction made between a naive cVAE-GAN and an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN. The study uses residual networks for facial attribute classification in a cVAE-GAN model. Two types of cVAE-GAN are compared: a naive version and an Information Factorization version. Evaluation includes measuring reconstruction quality and the proportion of edited images with desired attributes. The study evaluates a cVAE-GAN model using residual networks for facial attribute classification. The model successfully edits images to have the 'Not Smiling' attribute in 81.3% of cases and the 'Smiling' attribute in all cases. The importance of the proposed L aux term in the encoder loss function is highlighted for attribute editing performance. The study demonstrates that the model can edit images to show the 'Not Smiling' attribute in 81.3% of cases and the 'Smiling' attribute in all cases. The importance of the L aux term in the encoder loss function is emphasized for successful attribute editing. Additionally, the effect of including a classification loss on reconstructed samples is explored to maximize label information for the decoder. The approach of maximizing I(x; y) by providing label information to the decoder does not contribute to attribute information factorization in the model. The IcGAN, included in the study, achieves a similar reconstruction error but performs less well in attribute editing tasks compared to the proposed model. The model aims to learn a representation for faces where identity and facial attributes are separated by minimizing mutual information between the two encodings. The model proposed aims to learn a representation for faces by separating identity and facial attributes through minimizing mutual information between the encodings. This approach encourages the model to encode label information in \u0177 rather than \u1e91, making it potentially useful for facial attribute classification. The model's ability to classify facial attributes is demonstrated by comparing its performance to a state-of-the-art classifier. The model's ability to classify facial attributes is compared to a state-of-the-art classifier, showing competitive performance. The model effectively separates identity and facial attributes, demonstrated through attribute manipulation. In this section, attribute manipulation is discussed, focusing on reconstructing input images for different attribute values. A cVAE-GAN model may fail to edit desired attributes when trained for low reconstruction error. The need for models that learn a factored latent representation while maintaining good reconstruction quality is highlighted. The cVAE-GAN model failed to edit samples for the 'Not Smiling' case, emphasizing the importance of factored latent representation for attribute manipulation. The model was trained with specific weightings on loss terms and hyperparameters, achieving good reconstruction quality. Our model, using the same setup as BID3, achieved good reconstruction quality and successfully synthesized images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute at a 98% success rate, outperforming the naive cVAE-GAN model. Our model, the IFcVAE-GAN, achieved a 98% success rate in synthesizing images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute, outperforming the naive cVAE-GAN model. Both models had comparable reconstruction errors, but only our model was able to generate images of faces without smiles. Our model, IFcVAE-GAN, successfully synthesized images of faces without smiles, outperforming the cVAE-GAN model. The appendix provides a complete ablation study for our model with residual layers. Additionally, our method was applied to manipulate other facial attributes, achieving high-quality reconstruction and attribute editing. The IFcVAE-GAN model learns to factor attributes from identity by using an auxiliary classifier to factorize the representation. This approach achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks and is compared to similar techniques used in other related approaches. Adversarial training with an auxiliary classifier is used to factor attribute label information out of the encoded latent representation. This technique is similar to other factorization methods used in related approaches. Our work minimizes mutual information between latent representations and labels through adversarial information factorization, unlike other models that predict mutual information explicitly. Our approach is most similar to the cVAE-GAN architecture, which is designed for synthesizing samples of a particular class. Our work focuses on synthesizing specific attributes in images, such as making \"Hathway smiling\" or \"Hathway not smiling\", which requires a different approach compared to synthesizing a general \"Hathway\" face. We aim to make targeted changes to attributes while preserving the overall identity in the latent space. Additionally, our model learns a classifier for input images, distinguishing it from previous works. Our model focuses on making targeted changes to attributes in images while preserving overall identity in the latent space. Unlike previous works, we simultaneously learn a classifier for input images. Our work highlights the difference between category conditional image synthesis and attribute editing in images, showing that what works for one may not work for the other. In this paper, the focus is on attribute editing in images, highlighting the importance of separating label information from latent encoding for successful editing. The approach involves small changes in latent space leading to meaningful changes in image space, different from image-to-image models. In image editing, attribute changes are made in the latent space, allowing for meaningful alterations in the image space. This approach differs from image-to-image models and utilizes a single generative model for editing attributes. Our approach involves a supervised factorization of the latent space to learn disentangled representations of images, allowing for modification of image elements. This method, demonstrated on human faces, can be applied to other objects as well. The approach involves disentangled representations of images, demonstrated on human faces but applicable to other objects. A model named Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN captures identity and attributes separately, allowing for easy attribute editing without affecting identity. Our model, Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN, learns factored representations that capture identity and attributes separately, enabling accurate attribute editing without impacting identity. It outperforms existing models for image synthesis and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in facial attribute classification. A detailed ablation study confirms the effectiveness of our approach, making a significant contribution to representation learning. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of L aux loss and the impact of regularisation on reconstruction quality. Results show that small amounts of KL regularisation are necessary for good reconstruction, while using L class loss does not provide significant benefits. Models trained without L gan achieve slightly lower reconstruction error. Results show that small amounts of KL regularisation are required for good reconstruction, with models trained without L gan achieving slightly lower reconstruction error but producing blurred images. Even without L gan or L KL loss, the model can accurately edit attributes, although the visual quality of samples is poor, indicating the attribute information is still factored from the latent representation. Several models, including variational autoencoder variants, learn disentangled representations from unlabelled data. The performance of these models can be evaluated by training a linear classifier on latent encodings. DIP-VAE is known for learning disentangled representations effectively."
