    "content": "Deep learning models use word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe to represent words as continuous vectors, enabling easier integration with neural layers. Storing and accessing embedding vectors for all words requires a lot of space and may strain systems with limited GPU memory. To address this, word2ket and word2ketXS methods inspired by quantum computing were proposed for efficient storage during training and inference. These methods achieve a significant reduction in space needed for embeddings without sacrificing accuracy in natural language processing tasks. Our approach efficiently stores word embedding matrices during training and inference, achieving a significant reduction in storage space without compromising accuracy in natural language processing tasks. Word embedding methods like word2vec and GloVe use vectors of smaller dimensionality to represent words, making it unnecessary to store the entire identity matrix in memory. Word embedding methods like word2vec and GloVe use smaller dimensional vectors to represent words, allowing for efficient storage of the embedding matrix in GPU memory during training and inference. This reduces the need to store the entire identity matrix and enables capturing semantic relationships between words in large text corpora. The embedding matrix in GPU memory is crucial for training and inference, with vocabulary sizes ranging from 10^5 to 10^6. The dimensionality of embeddings varies from 300 to 1024. In classical computing, information is stored in bits, while in quantum computing, qubits are described by complex unit-norm vectors. Quantum registers with interconnected qubits can have exponential state space dimensionality. In quantum computing, qubits in a register need to be interconnected for exponential state space dimensionality. Entanglement is a unique quantum phenomenon where qubits cannot be separated into individual states. Unlike classical bits, quantum bits can be interconnected to represent complex vectors. However, classical approximation of quantum registers can store vectors using less space but lose the ability to express all possible quantum states. In quantum computing, classical approximation methods can store vectors of size m using O(log m) space, losing the ability to represent all possible quantum states. This loss of representation power does not significantly impact NLP machine learning algorithms. Two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, efficiently store word embedding matrices during training and inference. The first method processes each word embedding independently for efficiency, while the second method processes all word embeddings jointly for even higher efficiency. The new word2ket embeddings offer high space saving rates with little impact on downstream NLP model accuracy. A tensor product space of separable Hilbert spaces V and W, denoted as V \u2297 W, is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W. The inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is defined as a product of individual inner products v \u2297 w, v \u2297 w = v, v w, w. The tensor product space V \u2297 W has properties such as inner product preservation and unit norm vectors. It consists of equivalence classes of pairs v \u2297 w and has an orthonormal basis {\u03c8 j \u2297 \u03c6 k }. The coefficients are products of corresponding coefficients in V and W, forming a basis in V \u2297 W. The tensor product space V \u2297 W has an orthonormal basis {\u03c8 j \u2297 \u03c6 k } with coefficients equal to the products of coefficients in V and W. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of dimensionalities of V and W. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of tensor product, with arbitrary bracketing. In Dirac notation, a vector u \u2208 C 2n is written as |u and called a ket. In quantum computing, a vector u \u2208 C 2n is represented as |u, known as a ket with an orthonormal basis. The tensor product space contains not only vectors of the form v \u2297 w, but also their linear combinations, some of which cannot be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. The tensor product space includes vectors of the form v \u2297 w and their linear combinations, some of which cannot be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. Tensors with rank greater than one are called entangled. The maximum rank of a tensor in a tensor product space of order higher than two is not known in general. A word embedding model involves mapping word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space to capture semantic information from a language corpus. The curr_chunk discusses the representation of word embeddings using entangled tensors in a d-token vocabulary. The mapping function f maps word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space to capture semantic information. The embeddings of individual words are represented as entangled tensors, with a tensor of rank r and order n. The resulting vector v has dimension p = qn, taking up space O(rq log q log p). The curr_chunk explains the efficient calculation of inner products between word embeddings using entangled tensors. By representing embeddings as tensors of rank r and order n, the inner product calculation takes O(rq log q log p) time and O(1) additional space. This method is beneficial for downstream computations involving word embedding vectors. The curr_chunk discusses the efficient calculation of inner products between word embeddings using entangled tensors. It explains that representing embeddings as tensors of rank r and order n takes O(rq log q log p) time and O(1) additional space. This method is useful for downstream computations involving word embedding vectors. The curr_chunk discusses representing word embeddings as a balanced tree structure to efficiently calculate inner products. This method reduces sequential processing time to O(log2n) by performing multiplications in parallel along branches of the tree. The gradient of the embedding vector v with respect to tunable parameters can lead to a high Lipschitz constant, which may affect training. To address this, each node in the balanced tensor product tree is utilized. The curr_chunk discusses the use of LayerNorm to address the high Lipschitz constant of the gradient in the embedding vector v. It also introduces linear operators A and B, and defines the mapping A \u2297 B for vectors in V \u2297 W into U \u2297 Y. The tensor product of linear operators is bilinear, and in the finite-dimensional case, A \u2297 B can be represented as an mn \u00d7 mn matrix. The curr_chunk discusses a word embedding model as a linear operator mapping one-hot vectors to word embeddings. It involves a d-token vocabulary and a p-dimensional embedding space. The word embeddings are stored in a d \u00d7 p matrix M, with M^T representing the linear operator F. The word embedding linear operator is represented by matrix M^T, with dimensions p \u00d7 d. The matrix F is compressed using tensor product-based exponential compression, resulting in space efficiency. This method avoids reconstructing the full embedding matrix for multiplication by a weight matrix in neural NLP models. The word embedding linear operator is represented by matrix M^T, with dimensions p \u00d7 d. The matrix F is compressed using tensor product-based exponential compression, resulting in space efficiency. Lazy tensors are used to efficiently reconstruct rows of the embedding matrix for downstream NLP tasks like text summarization, language translation, and question answering. In text summarization, language translation, and question answering tasks, space-efficient word embeddings were used. The experiments involved comparing the accuracy of space-efficient embeddings with regular embeddings in text summarization using a specific dataset and architecture. In text summarization tasks, word2ket and word2ketXS models were trained using a bidirectional RNN encoder and attention-based RNN decoder. Different dimensionalities were explored, with word2ket achieving a 16-fold reduction in trainable parameters. Word2ketXS was even more space-efficient, offering a 34,000 fold reduction while maintaining similar performance. In German-English machine translation, word2ketXS showed a 100-fold space reduction with only a 0.5 drop in Rouge scores. The BLEU score was used to measure performance, with a slight drop of about 1 point for 100-fold reduction in trainable parameters. In exploring embedding dimensions for machine translation, a drop in BLEU score was observed for different tensor orders and matrix dimensions. The DrQA model was used for the Stanford Question Answering Dataset, achieving a test set F1 score after training for 40 epochs. The model utilized a larger embedding matrix, allowing for increased tensor order in word2ketXS for higher space savings. The DrQA model achieved a test set F1 score using embeddings with a vocabulary size of 118,655 and dimensionality of 300. Increasing the tensor order in word2ketXS resulted in a 0.5 point drop in F1 score with significant parameter space savings. For order-4 tensor word2ketXS, there was a 10^5-fold space saving rate with a less than 3% drop in F1 score. The computational overhead for word2ketXS embeddings increased training time on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU card. The training time for 40 epochs increased from 5.8 to 7.4 hours for the word2ketXS-based model, and further to 9 hours when using tensors of order 4. Despite the increase in training time, the dynamics of model training remained largely unchanged. The experiments showed significant decreases in the memory footprint of the word embedding part of the model, particularly in the input layers of sequence-to-sequence models. During inference, embedding and other layers dominate the memory footprint of transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers, which require hundreds of millions of parameters to work. RoBERTa BASE has 30% of parameters in word embeddings. Training requires additional memory to store activations in all layers, dominating the memory footprint. During training, memory footprint is dominated by embedding and other layers in transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers. To decrease memory requirements, various approaches such as dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, bit encoding, and optimized quantization methods have been proposed. Pruning and quantization are used for compressing models for low-memory inference. Bit encoding, optimized quantization, pruning, sparsity, low numerical precision, and Fourier-based approximation methods have been proposed to reduce memory requirements in transformer models. However, none of these methods can match the space-saving rates achieved by word2ketXS. Approaches based on bit encoding are limited to a space-saving rate of at most 32 for 32-bit architectures. Other methods like parameter sharing or PCA can offer alternative solutions. The methods like Andrews (2016), Gupta et al. (2015), and May et al. (2019) are limited to a space-saving rate of 32 for 32-bit architectures. Other approaches, such as parameter sharing or PCA, can offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality. Tensor product spaces have also been used for document embeddings in related work."
