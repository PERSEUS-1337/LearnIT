The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, including fish, to inform consumers about the production process. Congress recognizes the material changes in genetically engineered food, the FDA's labeling requirements, and the right of individuals in the US to know if their food was genetically engineered for various reasons. Over 60 countries, including the UK and EU countries, already require labeling for genetically engineered foods. Over 60 countries, including the UK and EU countries, mandate labeling of genetically engineered food on food labels. The Codex Alimentarius allows governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. Mandatory identification of genetically engineered food can preserve economic value in exports and sensitive markets. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for certain types of food like those served in restaurants or medical foods. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for certain types of food like those served in restaurants or medical foods. The term 'genetic engineering' is defined as a process involving in vitro nucleic acid techniques or fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic family. The term 'genetically engineered' refers to organisms produced through intentional genetic engineering techniques, including the progeny of such organisms. Genetically engineered ingredients are materials derived from genetically engineered organisms used as ingredients in food. The term 'genetically engineered ingredient' refers to a material derived from organisms that have been genetically engineered, regardless of detectable molecular or cellular changes, and their suitability for human consumption. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act include new provisions regarding guarantees related to genetically engineered ingredients. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include provisions regarding guarantees for misbranded food violations. A person can avoid penalties if they provide a guaranty signed by a US resident from whom the food was received in good faith. The amended Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allows recipients of food to avoid penalties by providing a guaranty from the person they received the food from, stating that it is not genetically engineered. This exclusion from penalties applies regardless of how the recipient uses the food. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allows recipients of food to avoid penalties for misbranded food by obtaining a guaranty stating that the food is not genetically engineered, regardless of how the food is used. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allows recipients of food to avoid penalties for misbranded food by obtaining a guaranty stating that the food is not genetically engineered. Amendments to the Act include definitions for genetically engineered terms and provisions for unintended contamination penalties. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allows recipients of food to avoid penalties for misbranded food by obtaining a guaranty stating that the food is not genetically engineered. Amendments to the Act include provisions for unintended contamination penalties for agricultural producers whose non-genetically engineered food is contaminated with genetically engineered material. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires labeling regulations for genetically engineered material in food to prevent unintended contamination by agricultural producers. The Secretary must establish these regulations within one year of the Act's enactment."
