    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including a focus on potential bombers, lax checkpoint screening, lack of in-flight security measures, compliance with hijackers, and a failure of imagination among senior officials. The 9/11 Commission identified a failure of imagination among senior officials in recognizing the threat of suicide hijackings by al Qaeda. Despite concerns about hijackings, no specific actions were taken to defend against this threat before September 11, 2001. The likelihood of a suicide hijacking scenario was underestimated, leading to a lack of preparedness in the aviation security system. The 9/11 Commission found that before September 11, 2001, there was a lack of specific actions taken to defend against potential hijacking scenarios, particularly suicide hijackings. Congressional oversight of aviation security was focused on passenger service rather than terrorism. After 9/11, Congress quickly passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act to address security weaknesses. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) to address aviation security weaknesses. ATSA established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all transportation modes, focusing on aviation. Key measures included federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and reinforced cockpit doors. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) mandated explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and reinforced cockpit doors. It also granted TSA broad authority to assess security threats in all transportation modes, with a focus on aviation. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and authorized arming airline pilots for additional protection. Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act further enhanced aviation security measures. Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act established an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems and arming pilots. Despite these measures, vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, airport employee access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks with shoulder-fired missiles persist. The 9/11 Commission also acknowledged these vulnerabilities. Several vulnerabilities persist in air cargo operations, general aviation, airport employee access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles. The 9/11 Commission recognized these vulnerabilities and made specific recommendations for improvements in airport passenger and baggage screening, as well as air cargo security. However, the Commission did not address concerns regarding inadequate access controls in secured airport areas and general aviation operations. The 9/11 Commission identified threats in airport security but did not issue recommendations for inadequate access controls or shoulder-fired missile attacks. They recommended a multi-layered security system for the TSA to address various terrorist tactics and ensure effective coordination between security layers. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system in aviation to address various terrorist tactics and ensure effective coordination between security layers. The Commission focused on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation and made six aviation-specific recommendations, including enhancing passenger pre-screening and improving measures to detect explosives on passengers. The 9/11 Commission's final report identified six aviation-specific recommendations, including enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, deploying baggage screening systems, intensifying efforts to screen dangerous cargo, and using hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, an overarching recommendation was made to prioritize transportation security based on risk and implement cost-effective deterrents. Passenger pre-screening on September 11, 2001, involved the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS). On September 11, 2001, passenger pre-screening measures included CAPPS, security questions, and photo ID checks. Over half of the hijackers were identified through these techniques, but with little consequence. CAPPS has since been expanded to screen for possible hijackers. The CAPPS system, used by airlines to screen for potential hijackers and bombers, has evolved to include CAPPS II. This new system aims to authenticate passengers' identities and check them against terrorist watch lists, raising concerns about data protection and civil liberties. If flagged, passengers may be denied boarding or selected for additional screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended implementing a two-step process to authenticate passengers' identities and check them against terrorist watch lists. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act for FY2004 and Vision 100 directed the Department of Homeland Security to address concerns about the CAPPS II system. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act for FY2004 and Vision 100 directed the Department of Homeland Security to address concerns about the CAPPS II system. The GAO found that TSA had addressed only one of eight concerns regarding CAPPS II implementation. Airlines' reluctance to provide data for testing due to liability concerns has hindered progress. Recent reports suggest that the CAPPS II program has been scrapped over privacy concerns, but a new program may replace it. The CAPPS II program has been scrapped over privacy concerns, but a new program may replace it. Congress may intensify oversight of the Secure Flight program, with a provision in H.R. 10 requiring TSA to take over prescreening from airlines within 180 days. The 9/11 Commission highlighted al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners. The 9/11 Commission highlighted al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, citing the 1994 Philippines Airlines bombing as a precursor to larger operations. Concerns over IEDs were raised after Richard Reid's attempted shoe bombing in 2001 and media reports in 2003. Concerns over IEDs were brought to public attention in December 2001 after Richard Reid's attempted shoe bombing. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving detection of explosives on passengers, as current screening technologies have limited capabilities in this area. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing explosives screening on passengers, as current technologies have limited capabilities. New trace detection methods are being tested at various airport sites to detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals. Other methods include body scan imaging for detecting explosives. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing explosives screening on passengers at airports, including using body scan imaging and bomb-sniffing dogs. Congress may debate funding for implementing more effective screening methods. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing explosives screening on passengers at airports, including using body scan imaging and bomb-sniffing dogs. The TSA has launched initiatives to address screener performance deficiencies, such as expanding the use of threat image projection (TIP) to assess human performance. The TSA has expanded the use of threat image projection (TIP) to assess screener performance and is looking to improve recurrent training. Key human factors issues include screener selection, training, fitness for duty, and interaction with screening technologies. However, research and funding for aviation security human factors are lacking compared to other agencies. Research on aviation security human factors and funding is lacking compared to other agencies like the Department of Defense and FAA. There is a need for a comprehensive strategic plan to address human factors in aviation security. Congress may need to conduct oversight to identify areas where TSA's human factors research efforts are lacking in addressing concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. They may also consider tasking the National Academy of Sciences or another independent body to examine human factors needs in aviation security. The National Academy of Sciences has not conducted a focused study on human factors needs in the aviation security system. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance and examine next-generation screening technologies. Congress may debate the adequacy of funding for installing baggage screening systems. Vision 100 authorizes up to $500 million annually for aviation security capital fund, but only $250 million was appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005. Total cost of integrating EDS equipment is a concern. The current funding for integrating EDS equipment at passenger airports is insufficient, with only $250 million appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005 out of the authorized $500 million annually. The total cost of integration is estimated to exceed $4 billion, leading to a slow progress in implementation. Letters of intent (LOIs) issued by TSA to airports were meant to stretch obligations over several years, but the reimbursement approach could further delay the process. The TSA has implemented LOIs to reimburse airports for expenses incurred in integrating EDS systems, which could slow down progress. The aviation industry is expected to contribute to the costs of in-line EDS deployment, with airlines already paying a portion through security fees. Airports also contribute, with large and medium-sized airports paying 10% and small airports paying 5% of the costs. Defining a fair share of costs has been a point of contention. The TSA has proposed increasing the local share of costs for airport security programs, which airports oppose. The 9/11 Commission implied that the aviation industry is not paying its fair share under the current scheme. Congress may debate the equity of cost-sharing for EDS integration in response to this recommendation. The House homeland security appropriations bill included language to limit federal share for airport security projects. Legislation seeks to double the amount collected in aviation security fees for aviation security capital fund and increase TSA's flexibility for checked baggage security screening requirements. H.R. 5121 aims to enhance TSA's flexibility in meeting checked baggage security screening requirements by allowing multi-year contracts with airports or vendors for EDS imaging capabilities. Recommendations from the 9/11 Commission and ASAC led to a strategic plan for cargo security with a risk-based approach. The TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in November 2003, with a multi-layered risk-based approach and four key strategic objectives. The goals include pre-screening all cargo shipments, inspecting items considered to pose an elevated risk, deploying new technology solutions, and implementing enhanced security measures. The plan aligns with recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission recommendations support TSA's strategic plan for cargo security but suggest the need for accelerated progress. Congress may scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security, particularly regarding physical screening of cargo on passenger aircraft. Recent debates have focused on the level of screening required to mitigate risks. Air cargo security focuses on physical screening of cargo on passenger aircraft. Congress supports TSA's risk-based approach using known-shipper program. H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to enhance cargo screening and tracking. S. 2845 mandates doubling air cargo screening within a year. 9/11 Commission recommends hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft for suspicious cargo. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft to carry suspicious cargo, but the cost and opposition from passenger airlines may hinder this initiative. Opponents argue that improved identification, tracking, and screening of cargo may negate the need for hardened containers. Opponents of deploying hardened cargo containers argue that improved identification, tracking, and screening of cargo may eliminate the need for them. Proponents, however, believe that hardened containers provide an additional layer of defense, similar to hardened cockpit doors, in establishing a multi-layered security system. Despite this, using just one hardened cargo container per passenger aircraft still leaves vulnerabilities in the system related to risk assessments and suspicious cargo. TSA currently requires proper vetting and verification for all cargo from shippers to address these concerns. The TSA requires cargo from shippers not vetted through the known-shipper program to be carried in all-cargo airplanes. There are uncertainties about adapting the system to allow suspect cargo in hardened containers on passenger planes. Congress may debate the effectiveness of deploying hardened cargo containers for security against potential bombings. Congress may debate the deployment of hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft for security against potential bombings. H.R. 10 includes a provision for a pilot program to evaluate blast-resistant containers, while S. 2845 does not. The 9/11 Commission also issued aviation-specific recommendations. The legislation passed by the Senate on May 9, 2003 (S. 165) requires the DHS and FAA to evaluate blast-resistant cargo container technology. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets, with TSA selecting practical and cost-effective defense approaches. The plan should assign roles to federal, state, local authorities, and private stakeholders for implementing aviation security measures. A unified strategic plan for aviation security is needed, assigning roles to federal, state, and local authorities, as well as private stakeholders. The TSA should focus on developing a formal strategy for national aviation security policy, with a risk-based multi-layered approach likely forming the core of future security measures. The TSA is poised to develop a formal strategy for national aviation security policy, likely focusing on a risk-based multi-layered approach. This aligns with recommendations from the 9/11 Commission, urging Congress to task the TSA with creating a comprehensive national strategy addressing funding, roles of authorities, and industry involvement. Some argue that existing TSA plans suffice, while others advocate for a more formal strategic planning document. Cooperation and integration are crucial in enhancing aviation security. While some argue that existing TSA plans suffice for aviation security, others believe a more formal strategic planning document is needed. Challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state and local participation and industry involvement. Local jurisdictions handle the physical security of airport sites, while TSA maintains security oversight and enforcement, including passenger screening. Local governments and state authorities often provide law enforcement support for airport security. The role of local governments and state authorities in aviation security involves law enforcement support for airport site security and presence at screening checkpoints. Passenger air carriers and aircraft owners must also participate in security measures. The federal government oversees and enforces aviation security requirements, but there is a lack of a unified plan for assigning roles and missions to each stakeholder. The federal government's role in aviation security involves oversight and enforcement of security requirements. There is a need for a unified plan to assign roles and missions to stakeholders and integrate strategies for overall security. Recommendations include improving strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources across federal, state, local, and private sectors for aviation security. Integration with transportation security strategies for rail, maritime, and highway security is also suggested. TSA may consider integrating aviation security strategies with a broader transportation security plan. H.R. 10 mandates DHS to develop transportation security and modal plans, including aviation, to prioritize risks and allocate resources effectively. Congress has focused on implementing recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report. The 9/11 Commission report led to significant attention from Congress on aviation security. The 108th Congress passed legislation addressing aviation security, including the Vision 100 Act and the National Intelligence Reform Act. Several aviation security provisions were included in Vision 100 before the 9/11 Commission completed its report. The Vision 100 Act, enacted before the 9/11 Commission's report, established a redress process for aviation professionals and modified security requirements, including the establishment of Air Defense Identification Zones. Vision 100 established an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) around cities, requiring special communications for pilots. It also modified security training for airline crews and mandated a study on aviation security effectiveness, including air marshal programs and passenger screening. Vision 100 established the Aviation Security Capital Fund with up to $500 million per year for aviation security improvements, including grants for integrating baggage explosive detection systems at airports. Vision 100 mandated the integration of baggage explosive detection systems at airports, set federal cost-sharing guidelines, required security programs for air charter operators, and mandated a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system by the Government Accountability Office. Vision 100 mandated the integration of baggage explosive detection systems at airports, set federal cost-sharing guidelines, required security programs for air charter operators, and mandated a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system by the Government Accountability Office. The TSA has since replaced CAPPS II with \"Secure Flight\" and expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include other flight crew members. Vision 100 expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include other flight crew members and required security regulations for foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations. It also transferred background check duties for foreign pilots to the DHS. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) transferred background check duties for individuals seeking flight training to the Department of Homeland Security. The legislation requires notification and identification information for training in smaller aircraft and background checks before training in larger aircraft. Fee collections are authorized to cover the costs of these checks. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) includes provisions for aviation security, requiring the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans. It mandates the TSA to issue guidance on biometrics for airport access control and establish procedures for identifying law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the TSA to issue guidance on biometrics for airport access control and establish procedures for identifying law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft. It also authorizes funding for research and development of biometric technologies for aviation security, as well as the establishment of a center of excellence in biometric technologies. Additionally, the act requires the TSA to begin system testing of an advanced passenger prescreening system by a specified date and to assume the role of passenger prescreening within 180 days after completing testing. Redress and remedy procedures for delayed passengers are also required. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the TSA to establish redress and remedy procedures for passengers falsely identified or targeted by the prescreening system. It also requires the TSA to minimize false positives, establish oversight boards, implement safeguards for system security, and conduct prescreening of international flights. Individuals seeking FAA certificates and unescorted access to secure airport areas must be screened. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates screening for individuals involved in flights to or from the United States, including pilots, mechanics, and those accessing secure airport areas. It also requires the TSA to establish procedures for prescreening individuals using large aircraft, report on privacy impacts, and set criteria for watch lists. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates screening for individuals involved in flights to or from the United States, including pilots, mechanics, and those accessing secure airport areas. It requires the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with other agencies, to report on criteria for watch lists and directs the DHS to prioritize developing airport screening technologies for detecting weapons and explosives. The TSA is also required to initiate a pilot program for advanced airport checkpoint screening systems. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates screening for individuals involved in flights to or from the United States, including pilots, mechanics, and those accessing secure airport areas. It requires the TSA to initiate a pilot program for advanced airport checkpoint screening systems at five or more airports by March 31, 2005, with $150 million authorized per year in FY2005 and FY2006. The act also includes provisions for a human factors study to improve screener performance, protecting the anonymity of Federal air marshals, and training law enforcement officers in inflight counterterrorism procedures and identification of fraudulent documents.

The act also includes provisions for a human factors study to improve screener performance, protecting the anonymity of Federal air marshals, and training law enforcement officers in inflight counterterrorism procedures and identification of fraudulent documents. Additionally, the act authorizes the TSA to expedite the installation and use of in-line baggage screening equipment at airports, increase the authorization for the aviation security capital fund by up to $400 million per year through FY2007, and provide air marshal training to foreign law enforcement personnel. The act mandates increased funding for aviation security, including in-line baggage screening systems and pilot licenses with tamper-resistant features. It also directs the TSA to study wireless communication for cabin crew safety alerts and develop standards for screener staffing levels at airports. The act mandates increased funding for aviation security, including improved explosive detection systems and prohibiting certain carry-on items. TSA is required to develop standards for screener staffing levels and integrate screening workforce operations for efficiency. Additionally, $100 million is authorized for research and development of security measures. The act mandates improved explosive detection systems and prohibits certain carry-on items, including butane lighters. It also directs the President to pursue international treaties to limit the proliferation of shoulder-fired missiles worldwide. Additionally, the act requires diplomatic efforts for MANPADS non-proliferation and expedited certification of airworthiness for aircraft. The act mandates improved explosive detection systems, prohibits certain carry-on items, and directs diplomatic efforts for MANPADS non-proliferation. It also requires expedited certification of airworthiness for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft, assesses aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks, and establishes a pilot program for blast-resistant cargo containers. Additionally, it authorizes funding for improved air cargo and airport security measures. The act authorizes funding for improved air cargo and airport security measures, including $200 million annually for air cargo security and $100 million annually for technology development. It establishes a grant program for advanced air cargo security technology and requires the TSA to issue final regulations for cargo operations security. The DHS, in coordination with other agencies, must report on threats from international cargo shipments and assess the potential for secure facilities along aviation routes. The Department of Defense, FAA, and DHS are directed to address threats from international cargo shipments bound for the US. They must establish secure facilities along aviation routes to divert and secure aircraft posing security threats. The DHS is tasked with researching, developing, and procuring systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft. The 108th Congress enacted provisions to enhance aviation security, reflecting concerns of the 9/11 Commission. During the 108th Congress, policy concerns regarding general aviation security and air cargo security procedures were not adequately addressed through legislation. The 9/11 Commission briefly mentioned concerns over general aviation operations but did not make formal recommendations. Legislation focused on airport and airspace restrictions, aiming to alleviate unnecessary constraints on certain operations. Legislation during the 108th Congress addressed general aviation security concerns by focusing on airport and airspace restrictions. Some provisions, like allowing general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, lacked a clear timetable for implementation. However, legislation regarding general aviation security was criticized for not being as comprehensive as other aviation security measures. Renewed concerns were raised about the risks associated with general aviation operations. During the 108th Congress, legislation on general aviation security was criticized for not being as comprehensive as other aviation security measures. Concerns were raised about the risks posed by corporate jets, private planes, and helicopters, especially in response to a recent assessment by the FBI and DHS. Comprehensive measures on air cargo security and oversight were not adequately addressed, with Senate-passed measures being removed from the final National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004. During the 108th Congress, comprehensive measures on air cargo security and oversight were stripped from the final National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004. The TSA was directed to address these issues through regulatory proposals, reflecting the intent of the proposed legislation. The 109th Congress may focus on overseeing the TSA's implementation of air cargo security rules and strategic plan to ensure desired objectives are met."
