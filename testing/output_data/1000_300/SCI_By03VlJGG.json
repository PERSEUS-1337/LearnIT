In this section, two benchmarks are introduced by extending existing datasets to include additional relations like textual descriptions, numerical attributes, and images. The model effectively utilizes this information to improve link-prediction accuracy and predict object entities based on similarity. Knowledge bases contain various types of information about entities, and existing approaches focus on embedded relational modeling of linked data. The existing approaches to embedded relational modeling focus on modeling linked data using dense vectors. The goal is to train a machine learning model to score the truth value of factual statements represented as triplets. Training data consists of observed facts for the knowledge base, which includes sets of entities and relations. The link prediction problem involves learning a scoring function to predict relationships between entities. The link prediction problem involves learning a scoring function to predict relationships between entities in a knowledge base. The DistMult approach maps entities to dense vectors and relations to diagonal matrices for high accuracy. In the DistMult approach, entities are mapped to dense vectors and relations to diagonal matrices to compute scores for triples. A pairwise ranking loss is used to differentiate between existing and non-existing triples during training. Negative samples are generated by replacing entities in training triplets. DistMult learns representations that encode knowledge base information. The proposed work aims to extend existing relational models like DistMult to incorporate various types of objects in knowledge bases, such as numerical, categorical, images, and text, by learning embeddings for these types. The proposed work extends existing relational models like DistMult by learning embeddings for different types of objects in knowledge bases, such as numerical, categorical, images, and text. Domain-specific encoders are used to embed attributes like title, poster, genre, or release year of a movie. The model aims to estimate the truth value of triples by scoring the embeddings of subject entity, relation, and object value using the DistMult operation. The model extends existing relational models by learning embeddings for different types of objects in knowledge bases, using domain-specific encoders for attributes like title, poster, genre, or release year of a movie. Training the model involves replacing the object entity with a random entity from the same domain for negative sampling. The model extends relational models by learning embeddings for different types of objects in knowledge bases using domain-specific encoders. For negative sampling, the object entity is replaced with a random entity from the same domain. Different encoders are used for multimodal objects, including one-hot encoding for subject entity and relation, selu activation for categorical object entity, and feed forward layer for numerical objects. The curr_chunk discusses the use of numerical objects and text in embedding spaces. Numbers are embedded using a feed forward layer, projecting them to a higher-dimensional space. Text encoding varies based on string length, with character-based encoders used for short attributes like names. This contrasts with traditional methods that treat numbers as distinct entities. The text discusses encoding different types of information, using character-based encoders for short attributes like names and CNN for longer strings. Images can also provide useful evidence for modeling entities. The text discusses encoding different types of information, using character-based encoders for short attributes like names and CNN for longer strings. Images can also provide useful evidence for modeling entities, with various models used to represent semantic information in images for tasks like image classification and question-answering. The encoding of semantic information involves using the last hidden layer of a pretrained VGG network on Imagenet, followed by compact bilinear pooling, to obtain image embeddings. The framework can also be applied to other data types like speech/audio data using CNNs, time series data using LSTM, and geospatial coordinates using feedforward networks. Different methods like matrix and tensor multiplication, euclidean distance, and circular operators are used to score triples in knowledge base representations. In modeling knowledge bases, various scoring functions like matrix and tensor multiplication, euclidean distance, and circular correlation are used. Different types of information such as text, numerical values, and images are incorporated in the encoding component to create relational triples of information. Methods also utilize additional features for entities, such as numerical values, images, and text. The curr_chunk discusses the utilization of different types of information in a unified model for entity embeddings, including numerical values, images, and text. This approach differs from existing methods by treating these types of information as relational triples within a structured framework. Our model for entity embeddings incorporates various types of information in a unified manner, treating them as relational triples within structured knowledge. It also handles uncertainty and missing values, enabling the recovery of lost information.

It includes rich relational data about users and movies, with movie genres represented as binary vectors. Movie posters are collected from TMDB for each movie. The genre attribute for each movie is represented as a binary vector with 19 genres. Movie posters are collected from TMDB. 5-point ratings are treated as relations in KB triple format. 10% of rating samples are used for validation. Another dataset, YAGO3-10 knowledge graph, is more suitable for knowledge graph completion and link prediction with 120,000 entities and 37 relations.
