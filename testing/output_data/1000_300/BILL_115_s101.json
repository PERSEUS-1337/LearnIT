The State can convey non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land. The Federal land will be used for designating a road corridor and constructing a single-lane gravel road. The value of the exchanged lands must be equal or equalized through appraisals. Federal land can be exchanged under this section, with the value determined by appraisals conducted in accordance with nationally recognized standards. Appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land must be conducted by selected appraisers. The appraisal of Federal land for exchange must adhere to nationally recognized standards, including the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. If the appraised value of Federal land exceeds that of non-Federal land in a land exchange, additional non-Federal land can be conveyed to equalize the values. The value of Federal land and non-Federal land in a land exchange must be equalized through conveying additional non-Federal land, making a cash payment, or a combination of both methods. If the final appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, the State can adjust the acreage to equalize the values. In a land exchange, the value of Federal and non-Federal land must be equalized by adjusting acreage or making a cash payment. The Secretary can accept a payment exceeding 25% of the Federal land value. After the exchange, the Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land and include the non-Federal land. The Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land and include non-Federal land in a land exchange. The non-Federal land will be administered according to the Wilderness Act and other applicable laws. The land exchange must be completed within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. Requirements for the road construction will adhere to specified regulations. The exchange of Federal land and non-Federal land, along with the construction of a road under this Act, will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
