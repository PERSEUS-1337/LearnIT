    "content": "The National Security Agency (NSA) conducted a secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), sparking a national debate on its legality under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The program involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals believed to be associated with al Qaeda. The Bush Administration defended the program citing constitutional and statutory authority. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 as a standalone bill. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 was introduced by Senator Mitch McConnell in response to the NSA's secret Terrorist Surveillance Program. This Act was part of a series of bills addressing electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence and counterterrorism efforts in Congress. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides a framework for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information and prevent international terrorist threats. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress include H.R. 11, S. 187, and S. 139. The Bush Administration argued that FISA lacked the speed and agility to combat terrorists effectively. The Bush Administration argued that FISA lacked speed and agility to combat terrorists effectively. Attorney General Gonzales advised that orders from the FISC will now allow for faster surveillance of international communications involving al Qaeda or associated terrorist organizations. The Attorney General announced that surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now require approval from the FISC. The President has decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires. The Intelligence Committees were briefed on the FISC orders, and a classified briefing was provided to key members. The NSA program has faced legal and constitutional challenges. The NSA program faced legal challenges, with a court ruling it unconstitutional for violating various laws and amendments. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed Judge Taylor's judgment on the Terrorist Surveillance Program pending appeal. The appeal involves creating a new Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address electronic surveillance programs. The bills S. 3931 and Title II of S. 3929 aim to create a new Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address electronic surveillance programs. They would amend various provisions of FISA related to electronic surveillance without a warrant, applications for surveillance orders, emergency surveillance, liability limitations, and congressional oversight. The bills also propose repealing wartime authorities for electronic surveillance without a warrant following a congressional declaration of war. The bills S. 3931 and Title II of S. 3929 aim to create a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs. Changes would be made to FISA definitions and criminal provisions, addressing weapons of mass destruction and international movements of surveillance targets. Sec. 3 of S. 3931, Sec. 203 of S. 3929, introduces a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 introduces new provisions in FISA for electronic surveillance programs, defining them as programs for gathering foreign intelligence or combating terrorism. The flexibility to start surveillance immediately after suspect activity and the need for extended surveillance periods are emphasized. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 introduces new provisions in FISA for electronic surveillance programs, emphasizing the need for flexibility in starting surveillance immediately after suspect activity and for extended surveillance periods. The proposed legislation would allow the FISC to review, authorize, and reauthorize electronic surveillance programs for obtaining foreign intelligence information or combating international terrorism, with initial authorizations lasting up to 90 days and reauthorizations determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications seeking approval. The FISC can review, authorize, and reauthorize electronic surveillance programs under the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006. If an application is denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications seeking approval or appeal to the FIS Court of Review. If the Attorney General determines that known facts satisfy criteria for electronic surveillance under FISA, surveillance under Title VII must be discontinued unless certain conditions are met. The Attorney General must discontinue surveillance of a target under Title VII of FISA if it meets the criteria of Title I, unless certain conditions are met. Surveillance can only continue under Title VII if an application is made for an FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance. The bills also allow for the transfer of cases challenging the legality of classified communications intelligence activity related to a foreign threat. The Attorney General can authorize the transfer of cases challenging the legality of classified communications intelligence activity related to a foreign threat to the FIS Court of Review if it would harm national security. The transfer must occur when the Attorney General files an affidavit under oath. The Attorney General can authorize the transfer of cases challenging classified communications intelligence activity to the FIS Court of Review to protect national security. The language in proposed subsections of FISA creates uncertainty about the transfer process and jurisdiction for review. The FISC can determine standing and legality of programs, with decisions subject to review by the FIS Court of Review and potentially the U.S. Supreme Court. The FISC can determine standing and legality of programs, with decisions subject to review by the FIS Court of Review and potentially the U.S. Supreme Court. New subsections in FISA allow for review of FIS Court of Review decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court, with the FISC's decision binding in other courts. Litigation privileges are preserved, and new requirements for electronic surveillance program approval are outlined in a new Section 703 of FISA. The FISC can require the Attorney General to provide necessary information for determining approval of electronic surveillance programs. A new subsection 704 outlines the necessary findings and contents of an ex parte FISC order for such programs. Factors for assessing constitutionality are identified in subsection 704(b), and the contents of an approval order are detailed in subsection 704(c). Congressional oversight is addressed in new Section 705 of FISA. The Attorney General is required to submit a classified report every 180 days to congressional intelligence committees on activities under electronic surveillance programs authorized under new Title VII of FISA. Congressional oversight is addressed in new Section 705 of FISA, allowing committees to obtain necessary information for their functions and duties. Amendments are made in Sec. 8 of S. 3931, Sec. 208 of S. 3929. Sec. 8 of S. 3931, Sec. 208 of S. 3929, repeals sections of FISA allowing the President to authorize surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days following a declaration of war. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 prohibits interception of communications unless falling within specific exceptions. Current 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 prohibits the interception of communications unless falling within specific exceptions, including electronic surveillance by officers, employees, or agents of the United States in the normal course of their official duties. As amended, subsection 2511(2)(e) allows US officers to conduct electronic surveillance in the normal course of duty under the Constitution or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The \"exclusivity\" provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) ensures that US government can acquire foreign intelligence information from international communications using means other than electronic surveillance. The exclusivity provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) prohibits electronic surveillance unless conducted under the provisions of FISA, chapter 119, or chapter 121 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The exclusivity provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) prohibits electronic surveillance unless authorized under FISA, chapter 119, or chapter 121. Amendments to FISA address criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance. The amendments to FISA in Sec.8(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929 address criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance under Section 109 of FISA. The amendments to FISA in Sec. 8(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929 increase penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance, including fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Additional amendments in Sec. 9 of S. 3931 and Sec. 209 of S. 3929 modify definitions in FISA. Sec. 9 of S. 3931 and Sec. 209 of S. 3929 amend definitions in FISA, including expanding the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals expected to possess foreign intelligence information in the U.S. Penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance are increased to fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Sec. 9(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(b)(2) of S. 3929 amend the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA, replacing it with a new definition that includes intentional surveillance of a known person in the U.S. with a reasonable expectation of privacy. The new definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA includes intentional acquisition of communication contents when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in the U.S. and all parties are believed to be located within the country. This definition is more expansive than current law and includes minimization procedures to protect the privacy of unconsenting U.S. persons during foreign intelligence surveillance. The procedures prohibit dissemination of non-publicly available information regarding unconsenting U.S. persons acquired during electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. Information not related to foreign intelligence shall not be disseminated in a way that identifies any U.S. person without consent, unless necessary to understand foreign intelligence. The current section of FISA includes minimization procedures for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information, ensuring that no communication involving a U.S. person is disclosed, disseminated, or retained for longer than 72 hours without proper authorization. Proposed changes would replace and update these procedures. The proposed changes to FISA would replace current minimization procedures with new language that limits the retention of communication involving a U.S. person to 7 days unless authorized by a court order or if there is a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The proposed changes to FISA would replace current definitions of \"wire communication\" and \"contents\" with new ones, limiting retention of communication involving a U.S. person to 7 days unless authorized by a court order or in case of a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The proposed changes to FISA include expanding the application for electronic surveillance to include acquiring the contents of communications of foreign powers. The amendment to FISA expands electronic surveillance to include acquiring the contents of communications of foreign powers and removes the requirement for the Attorney General to certify no substantial likelihood of acquiring communications involving a U.S. person. Under both the current and amended versions of FISA, electronic surveillance authorized under subsection 102(a)(1) may only be conducted in accordance with the Attorney General's certification and applicable minimization procedures. The Attorney General must assess compliance with these procedures and report to the congressional intelligence committees. If surveillance is directed at an agent of a foreign power, the report must include justification for this belief. The Attorney General must provide a statement of facts to justify electronic surveillance on a foreign power agent. The FISA allows for the transmission of certification to the FISC under seal, with provisions for common carriers to assist in maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA creates new authority for the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning a person believed to be outside the US, with certification that it does not constitute electronic surveillance as defined in section 101(f). The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA allows the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning a person believed to be outside the US, with certification that it does not constitute electronic surveillance. The Attorney General's certification for acquisition of foreign intelligence information under FISA must meet specific criteria, including the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence and compliance with minimization procedures. The certification does not need to specify the exact locations of the acquisition. The Attorney General must report on compliance to congressional intelligence committees, and a copy of the certification is sent to the FISC and kept sealed unless needed for legality determination. The Attorney General's certification for acquisition of foreign intelligence information under FISA is immediately transmitted to the FISC and maintained under seal unless needed for legality determination. The Attorney General can direct a specified person to provide assistance for the acquisition while maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference. Records must be kept under approved security procedures, and the government must compensate the specified person for their aid. The Government must keep aid under approved security procedures. Failure to comply with the Attorney General's directive could result in FISC intervention. The specified person can challenge the legality of the directive through a petition to FISC judges. The specified person can challenge the legality of the directive by filing a petition with the FISC judges. The assigned judge must review the petition within 24 hours and make a determination within 72 hours. A petition to modify or set aside a directive can only be granted if it is found to be unlawful. The FISC judge must review a petition challenging a directive within 72 hours. A petition to modify or set aside a directive can only be granted if found unlawful. Review of FISC decisions can be sought within seven days, with the option to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for further review. The FIS Court of Review decision can be reviewed by petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. Judicial proceedings under Section 102 of FISA must be conducted expeditiously and maintained under security measures. Government submissions with classified information may be reviewed by the court ex parte upon request. Proposed subsection 102(h) of FISA requires all petitions to be filed under seal. Government submissions with classified information may be reviewed by the court ex parte and in camera. Subsection 102(j) precludes any cause of action against providers of communication services for assisting the Government. Information on a US person acquired under FISA can be used or disclosed without consent under subsection 102(k). Proposed subsection 102(k) of FISA allows information on a US person acquired under an Attorney General authorization to be used or disclosed by federal officers in accordance with minimization procedures. Information can only be used for lawful purposes and cannot be disclosed for law enforcement purposes without the Attorney General's authorization. Additionally, no privileged communication obtained under this section can be disclosed without proper authorization. New subsection 102(k) of FISA states that information obtained under an Attorney General authorization can only be used in a criminal proceeding with advance authorization. Privileged communication obtained under this section retains its privileged character. Proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) outline procedures for using or disclosing this information in federal, state, or local proceedings. The federal government can only introduce or use information acquired under FISA in any trial or proceeding if it complies with the requirements. The proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) of FISA outline procedures for using or disclosing information obtained under an Attorney General authorization in federal, state, or local proceedings. The government must notify the aggrieved person and the court before using or disclosing the information. In federal, state, or local proceedings, information obtained under an Attorney General authorization can only be used if the aggrieved person, court, and U.S. Attorney General are notified. The aggrieved person can move to suppress the evidence if it was unlawfully acquired or not in conformity with an authorization order. The acquisition of information in federal, state, or local proceedings may be suppressed if unlawfully obtained or not in conformity with an authorization order. The Attorney General can file an affidavit under oath to prevent disclosure if it would harm national security. The U.S. district court will determine the lawfulness of Section 102 acquisitions when a motion to suppress is filed or a request is made to discover related materials. The court may review the Attorney General's directive and other materials in camera and ex parte. The U.S. district court in the same district as the authority will review materials related to Section 102 acquisitions to determine legality. If unauthorized, evidence obtained will be suppressed. If a U.S. district court finds that a Section 102 acquisition under FISA was not lawfully authorized or conducted, the evidence obtained unlawfully will be suppressed. If the acquisition was lawful, the court will deny the aggrieved person's motion, except for necessary discovery. Court decisions on Section 102 authorizations are binding on all other courts except the U.S. Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. Federal officers can consult when acquiring foreign intelligence information under Section 102 of FISA. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers to consult with law enforcement personnel to coordinate efforts in investigating or protecting against various threats posed by foreign powers or their agents. Coordination does not exempt the certifications required under subsections 102(a) or (b). Proposed subsection 102(t) and 102(u) further elaborate on these provisions. Proposed subsection 102(t) of FISA requires retention of directives and orders for 10 years. Section 103(a) is amended to allow the Chief Justice to designate FISC judges. New subsection 103(g) provides authority for FISC orders under Title I if approved by the President. A new subsection 103(g) would be added to FISA, providing express authority for FISC orders under Title I if approved by the President. This allows FISC judges to grant orders for electronic surveillance of foreign powers for obtaining intelligence information. Amendments are made to Sec. 104 of FISA, replacing current subsections with new ones. An application for electronic surveillance court order must include a certification of meeting certain requirements. Amendments to FISA replace current subsections with new ones for electronic surveillance court orders. Certification for authorization must now be made by designated executive branch officials. The current law under FISA deals with exclusion of information in applications for electronic surveillance orders for foreign powers. The application must include details on surveillance techniques and potential information on U.S. persons. The proposed changes to FISA would involve striking current sections and redesignating subsections to expand the list of officials who can request a review of surveillance applications. The Attorney General and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency would be able to review surveillance applications under FISA, with proposed amendments to expand the list of officials who can request such reviews. The proposed amendments to FISA would allow the Attorney General and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency to review surveillance applications for foreign intelligence information. This includes redesignating subsections and updating specifications for electronic surveillance orders. The proposed amendments to FISA would delete current requirements in subsections 105(c)(1)(F) regarding electronic surveillance orders. This includes specifying the authorized coverage of devices and minimization procedures. Current subsection 105(d) deals with excluding certain information from surveillance applications for foreign powers. The proposed amendments to FISA would require each surveillance order to specify the type of electronic surveillance involved, including the need for physical entry. Extensions of an order for electronic surveillance can be granted on the same basis as the original order, with new findings required, except for surveillance targeted against a foreign-based political organization. The FISA amendments allow for extensions of surveillance orders on the same basis as the original order, with new findings required. Exceptions include extensions for surveillance targeted against certain foreign powers or agents, which may be for a maximum of one year. The FISA amendments allow for extensions of surveillance orders on the same basis as the original order, with new findings required. Extensions for surveillance targeted against foreign powers or agents may be granted for a period not longer than determined by the court or one year, whichever is less. Emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours is allowed in certain situations. Emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours is allowed under subsection 105(f), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(f). The Attorney General can authorize surveillance if an emergency situation exists for obtaining foreign intelligence information before a court order can be obtained. Surveillance must be terminated when the information is acquired, if a court order is denied, or at the end of the 72 hours. During a 72-hour window, a court order under Sec. 105 must be sought for electronic surveillance. Subsection 105(f) requires termination of surveillance when information is acquired, if a FISC order is denied, or at the end of 72 hours. The new language would grant emergency authorization authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate consent. The new language would grant emergency authorization authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate consent for electronic surveillance without a court order on an emergency basis. The Attorney General must be informed of the emergency surveillance, and a FISC judge must be informed as soon as possible after authorization. The decision has been made to employ emergency electronic surveillance under new subsections 105(f)(2)(a) and (b). An application for FISC order must be made within seven days after authorization, and surveillance terminates when information is obtained, order is denied, or after 72 hours from Attorney General approval. The emergency electronic surveillance must be approved by an executive branch officer appointed by the President within seven days. The restrictions on disclosure and use of information obtained from the surveillance remain the same as existing law. The revised language in the court order parallel existing law for emergency electronic surveillance, requiring minimization procedures to be followed. New subsection 105(f)(1)(D) of FISA also modifies limitations of liability for providers of information, facilities, or technical assistance. The revised language in the court order aligns with existing law for emergency electronic surveillance, requiring minimization procedures. New subsection 105(f)(1)(D) of FISA also adjusts limitations of liability for providers of aid in electronic surveillance or physical search. Sec. 106 of FISA limits the use of information on unconsenting U.S. persons acquired from electronic surveillance. It includes notification requirements and allows for suppression of unlawfully acquired information. Modifications to Sec. 209(g) of FISA would address the destruction of unintentionally acquired information. The proposed amendment to FISA would require the destruction of unintentionally acquired communications if both the sender and recipients are in the U.S., unless the Attorney General deems them to indicate a threat. This amendment would expand the current provisions that apply only to radio communications. The proposed second amendment to subsection 106(i) of FISA in S. 3886 and S. 2453 is unclear, specifically regarding the insertion of \"contain significant foreign intelligence information or\" after certain phrases. This language ambiguity could impact unintentional acquisition of communication contents under privacy expectations. The proposed amendment in the current text expands circumstances for the destruction of unintentionally acquired communication contents, unless deemed necessary by the Attorney General for foreign intelligence or threat prevention. The inclusion of certain phrases twice raises concerns about redundancy. The amending language in the current text suggests possible redundancy in the inclusion of certain phrases. Amendments to FISA sections reflect changes made by the proposed bill, including oversight provisions requiring a feasibility study for a secure document management system. The Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with other key agencies, is tasked with conducting a feasibility study to develop a secure document management system for FISC orders authorizing electronic surveillance under FISA. Amendments to FISA sections include oversight provisions for this system. Sec. 9(i) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(i) of S. 3929 made amendments to Title I of FISA regarding electronic surveillance. A new category, 101(b)(1)(E), would classify individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction as \"agents of a foreign power\" under FISA. Under the new definitional category in FISA, individuals engaging in the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or activities in preparation for such actions would be considered \"agents of a foreign power.\" This expands on the existing category that includes individuals involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or related activities on behalf of a foreign power. Under the proposed changes to FISA, individuals involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction for a foreign power would be classified as \"agents of a foreign power.\" The definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" would include destructive devices intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a significant number of people. The proposed changes to FISA would expand the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include devices intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a significant number of people. Amendments to FISA sections would encompass sabotage, international terrorism, and the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The proposed changes to FISA would expand the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include devices intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a significant number of people. Amendments to FISA sections would encompass sabotage, international terrorism, and the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, with new provisions for the duration and extension of FISC orders authorizing surveillance and physical searches related to international movements of targets. The proposed changes to FISA include expanding the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" and adding new provisions for surveillance orders. Amendments would cover sabotage, international terrorism, and weapons proliferation, with updates on the duration and extension of FISC orders. Additionally, changes would involve conforming amendments to the table of contents of FISA and the creation of a new Title VII."
