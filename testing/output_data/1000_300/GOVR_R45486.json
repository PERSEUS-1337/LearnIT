    "content": "The child nutrition programs, overseen by the USDA-FNS, include NSLP, SBP, Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, Special Milk Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, and Summer Food Service Program. These programs provide meals and snacks to children in schools, child care, and after-school settings. They were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The child nutrition programs, including NSLP, SBP, and Summer Food Service Program, were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Some authorities expired in 2015, but program operations continued with annual appropriations. Lawmakers in the 114th Congress began but did not complete child nutrition reauthorization. The child nutrition programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Reauthorization efforts in the 114th Congress did not pass, and there were no significant efforts in the 115th Congress. However, the 2018 farm bill included some provisions related to child nutrition programs. The final enacted bill included provisions related to child nutrition programs, raising issues for future reauthorization efforts. These issues include the nutritional quality of foods served in schools, access to meals, and stakeholder involvement such as school food authorities and advocacy organizations. Provision for free meals in certain schools involves stakeholders like school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry groups. The report gives an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, drawing examples from legislative proposals in Congress. References to more detailed information are provided. The child nutrition programs require school meals to meet specific nutritional standards to qualify for federal reimbursement. These standards were last updated under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which also established new nutrition guidelines for competitive foods. More detailed information on child nutrition programs and reauthorization proposals can be found in CRS reports. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act updated nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, with requirements for proposed regulations within specific timeframes. The law also included increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the new standards and funding for technical assistance. Various organizations and stakeholders supported the nutritional requirements, including nutrition advocacy groups, food companies, school officials, retired military leaders, and Michelle Obama. The HHFKA updated nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods with support from various organizations and stakeholders, including nutrition advocacy groups, food companies, school officials, retired military leaders, and Michelle Obama. The final rules for school meals and competitive foods were published by USDA-FNS in 2012 and 2016, respectively, based on Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Institute of Medicine recommendations. The updated standards increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while limiting calories, sodium, whole grains, proteins, and milk to low-fat options. The updated standards for school meals increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting calories, sodium, and fat. They also restricted milk to low-fat options and required senior high school students to choose a half-serving of fruits or vegetables with their meal. Competitive foods were also subject to limits on calories, sodium, and fat, with exceptions for fundraisers. The standards phased in during school years 2012-2013 and 2014-2015. The meal standards began phasing in during school year 2012-2013, with challenges reported in implementing the changes such as difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. These issues were confirmed by studies in the first two years of implementation. The School Nutrition Association advocated for changes to meal standards, while other groups argued for maintaining them for children's health. USDA and Congress made adjustments to the standards from SY2012-2013 to SY2019-2020, including removing weekly limits on grains and protein, loosening requirements on milk, whole grain, and sodium, and implementing changes indefinitely starting in SY2019-2020. USDA implemented changes to school meal standards from SY2015-2016 through SY2017-2018. In December 2018, a final rule was published indefinitely changing aspects of the standards for SY2019-2020. Changes include allowing flavored, low-fat milk, a 50% whole grain-rich requirement, and maintaining Target 1 sodium limits. Target 2 limits start in SY2024-2025, and Target 3 limits are eliminated. The nutrition standards for school meals were modified over time, with changes to milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aimed to review and revise these standards. The House-passed version of the 2018 farm bill in the 115th Congress aimed to revise nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, but this provision was not included in the enacted bill. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the 114th Congress also sought to alter the standards, with the House committee's proposal requiring USDA to review school meal standards every three years. The House committee's proposal (H.R. 5003) aimed to revise school meal standards by requiring USDA to review them every three years and allowing fundraisers to bypass competitive food standards. The Senate committee's proposal (S. 3136) sought to revise whole grain and sodium requirements within 90 days, with negotiations resulting in a reduction of the whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and a two-year delay in the Target 2 sodium requirement. Negotiations between Senate committee, White House, USDA, and School Nutrition Association led to an agreement to reduce whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delay Target 2 sodium requirement. Fresh fruit and vegetable snacks in FFVP must be in natural state without additives. Debate on including frozen, dried, and canned fruits and vegetables in program. 2014 farm bill funded pilot project with CDF fruits and vegetables in limited states. The 2014 farm bill funded a pilot project that included canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) in select states. Schools in four states faced challenges with fresh produce and incorporated CDF options, leading to increased fruit offerings but no significant impact on vegetable consumption. Student participation and fruit consumption on FFVP snack days remained unaffected. There was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption in the FFVP pilot, but fruit consumption declined on snack days. Student satisfaction with FFVP decreased slightly, while parents' responses were mixed. School administrators generally favored the changes, and legislative proposals have been considered to allow CDF and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables in the program. In the 114th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization legislation proposed allowing schools to serve \"all forms\" of fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). The Senate committee's proposal included temporary exemptions for schools with limited resources to serve canned, dried, or frozen fruits and vegetables. Schools in the National School Lunch Program must comply with federal requirements for domestically sourced foods. Schools in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) must adhere to Buy American requirements, purchasing domestically sourced products to the maximum extent feasible. This includes products processed in the US with over 51% domestically grown ingredients, as outlined in USDA guidance. The USDA guidance outlines Buy American requirements for schools in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, emphasizing the purchase of products processed in the US with over 51% domestically grown ingredients. The guidance encourages integration of Buy American into procurement processes, including monitoring the USDA catalog for suitable products and incorporating Buy American language in solicitations and contracts. The USDA guidance encourages schools in the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program to integrate Buy American requirements into their procurement processes. Schools are allowed to make exceptions to the Buy American requirements on a limited basis if certain criteria are met, and state agencies must review compliance and take corrective action when necessary. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce Buy American requirements for school food authorities, ensuring compliance and understanding of responsibilities within 180 days of enactment. Domestic products are defined as those processed in the United States and containing meats, vegetables, fruits, and other ingredients. The provision in the enacted bill clarifies the definition of domestic products for USDA's enforcement, stating that they are processed in the United States and contain meats, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural commodities produced in the U.S. Proponents argue for stricter requirements due to economic and food safety reasons, expressing concern over sourcing from China. Others advocate for schools' discretion in food procurement, citing availability and cost-effectiveness of high-quality domestic options. Some argue for domestic sourcing for safety reasons, especially concerning China. Others support schools' discretion in food procurement for availability and cost-effectiveness. Policymakers are exploring alternatives to congregate summer meals in rural areas, where onsite consumption is challenging. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act provided $85 million for demonstration projects to improve access to food for children in urban and rural areas during the summer months. One project, the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC), started in 2011 and continues to provide electronic food benefits to eligible households. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Participants receive either $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for WIC or SNAP. An evaluation from FY2011 to FY2013 showed a significant decrease in very low food security among participants. The Summer EBT program offers electronic food benefits to eligible households with children, resulting in a decrease in very low food security. The evaluation from FY2011 to FY2013 showed improved consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Congress has provided funding for Summer EBT projects, with recent funding of $28 million in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Awardees for summer 2017 and 2018 included various states and Native American nations. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $28 million for the Summer EBT demonstration. Awardees for summer 2017 and 2018 included states, Native American nations, and new grant recipients prioritized for FY2019. Proposals in previous Congresses aimed to expand Summer EBT funding. In the 114th and 115th Congresses, efforts were made to expand Summer EBT funding. The Obama Administration recommended nationwide expansion over 10 years. Freestanding bills with similar objectives were introduced. Funding from the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act was used for demonstration projects like the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) in eight states from 2010 to 2012. The eSFSP was a program that ran from 2010 to 2012 in eight states, with initiatives such as lengthening operations at meal sites, adding recreational or educational activities, meal delivery in rural areas, and providing food backpacks for children. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity levels for children in the meal delivery and backpack demonstrations. However, caution is advised in interpreting the results due to small sample sizes and lack of comparison groups. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act authorized a demonstration project exempting SFSP and SSO outdoor meal sites from congregate feeding requirements during excessive heat since 2015. Exempted sites must still serve children in congregate settings on normal days and provide meals in alternative forms on hot days. Other proposals and hearings on congregate feeding in SFSP have been discussed in recent years. The USDA offers exemptions for extreme weather conditions, including excessive heat. Recent proposals in Congress aimed to allow rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for offsite consumption, particularly in rural areas and nonrural areas with high eligibility for free or reduced-price meals. The HHFKA created the Community. The HHFKA created the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to provide free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased since its inception in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. This provision has garnered support for improving meal access and reducing stigma associated with receiving free meals. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) provides free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Roughly 22% of NSLP schools participate in CEP, with support for its benefits in improving meal access and reducing stigma. However, there have been efforts to restrict schools' eligibility for CEP in order to target resources more effectively. CEP has also created data issues for other non-nutrition federal and state programs. One secondary effect of CEP is the data issues it has created for other federal and state programs, such as the Title I-A program. These programs use free and reduced-price lunch data to determine eligibility and funding allocations, which are no longer collected under CEP's automatic eligibility process. This has led to concerns about students owing meal costs and schools' responses to such situations. In recent years, the issue of students owing and not paying their meal costs, and schools' responses to such situations, has received increased attention. Schools may charge unpaid meal costs, leading to debt collection from families, or resort to \"lunch shaming\" practices like providing alternative cold meals or barring children from school events until debts are repaid. Instances of lunch shaming have been reported in news articles from different states, with limited national data available on the prevalence of such practices. Instances of lunch shaming, where students wear a visual indicator of meal debt, have been reported in various states. School districts face financial burdens from unpaid meal costs, as federal funds and student payments are crucial for funding school food programs. Congress and USDA have taken actions since 2010 to address the issue of unpaid meal costs. The government has taken steps to address unpaid meal costs in schools since 2010. If meal funds cannot be recovered, the school must cover the costs using nonfederal funding sources. A report in 2016 did not recommend national standards for meal charges but suggested updating policy guidance on unpaid meal charges. The USDA's 2016 Report to Congress did not recommend national standards for unpaid meal charges in schools but suggested updating policy guidance and distributing best practices to support decision-making at the state and local levels. SFAs were required to establish a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, with instructions on handling situations where a child does not pay for a meal. USDA-FNS provided clarification through webinars, memoranda, and a best practice guide based on findings from a 2014 study and a Request for Information on unpaid meal charges. The USDA's 2016 Report to Congress recommended updating policy guidance and distributing best practices for unpaid meal charges in schools. Findings from a 2014 study and a Request for Information showed that meal charge policies were mainly determined at the school and district levels, with varying levels of formality and enforcement. School officials preferred local control, while national advocacy groups favored national standards. Lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs were also discussed in the 115th Congress. In the 115th Congress, there was a debate between local control and national standards for meal charge policies. Legislative proposals included the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017, aiming to establish national standards for how schools handle children unable to pay for meals. Unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming were also prominent topics at both the federal and state levels. The Shaming Act of 2017 aimed to set national standards for how schools treat children unable to pay for meals. States have also addressed unpaid meal costs, with Illinois passing legislation in 2018 requiring schools to provide regular meals to students who cannot pay. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act introduced requirements for schools to review and potentially increase the prices of paid lunches, allowing for nonfederal funding sources to meet these requirements. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required schools in the National School Lunch Program to review and potentially increase the prices of paid lunches to ensure federal funds are fully utilized. Schools could also use nonfederal funding sources to meet these requirements. This was aimed at preventing federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches from cross-subsidizing other meal programs. Some argue that raising prices may decrease participation in paid lunches. The federal reimbursements for free, reduced-price, and paid lunches are mixed into the same nonprofit school food service account. Raising prices may reduce participation in paid lunches. Schools must increase prices over time to match federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. Schools cannot raise prices by more than 10 cents annually. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required schools to gradually increase the price of paid lunches if they were not charging at least $3.00 per lunch. Revenue from competitive foods had to go to the school food service account, and it had to equal or exceed the costs of obtaining those foods. USDA provided some flexibility in implementing these requirements starting in SY2011-2012. In June 2011, USDA-FNS implemented requirements for school meal programs, offering flexibility for the first year. Exemptions were provided for SFAs in strong financial standing for SY2013-2014 through SY2017-2018. For SY2018-2019, exemptions were expanded to only apply to SFAs with a negative balance in the NSFSA as of January 31, 2018. Legislative proposals in recent Congresses aimed to address paid lunch equity requirements, with differing approaches between the House and Senate committees. In recent Congresses, proposals regarding paid lunch equity requirements were considered. The House committee's child nutrition reauthorization proposal in the 114th Congress aimed to eliminate the requirements, while the Senate committee's proposal suggested replacing them with a broader \"non-federal revenue target.\" This target could be met through household payments for full-price lunches or other state and local contributions. The curr_chunk discusses various school food programs such as NSLP, SBP, SFSP, SMP, SSO, and SEBTC administered by USDA-FNS."
