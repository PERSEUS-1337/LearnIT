Congressional pay data is sought for various reasons, such as assessing costs, setting pay levels, and comparing with other federal government systems. Aggregated congressional staff pay data is not readily available, but this report uses official Senate reports for consistent data collection. The pay data for congressional staff is based on official Senate reports, published semiannually, and collected by LegiStorm. This report provides annual data by fiscal year for 13 staff position titles used in Senate committees since FY2001. The report provides pay data for 13 staff position titles used in Senate committees since FY2001. Position titles were identified through a two-step process, with 13 positions having sufficient data available for analysis. Pay data for 13 staff positions in Senate committees since FY2001 were collected, excluding titles used by six or fewer panels. Data needed to be available from at least five committees for each position. Only up to two staff per committee with the same job title were included, and staff had to hold the position for the entire fiscal year without pay from other congressional authorities. The collected data may include overtime, bonuses, or other payments in addition to base salary. LegiStorm data tabulates staff pay for the fiscal year, including overtime, bonuses, and other payments in addition to base salary. Pay data for staff in House committee offices can be found in CRS Report R44322, while data for congressional staff in personal offices are available in CRS Report R44324 and CRS Report R44323.

Data presented here for selected positions in House Member Offices from 2001-2014 may not fully represent all Senate committee staff jobs due to the large number of positions held by one employee. Two categories of positions emerge, with the first category likely providing highly representative pay information for staff in those roles. The second category includes positions where committees may hire multiple staff members.
