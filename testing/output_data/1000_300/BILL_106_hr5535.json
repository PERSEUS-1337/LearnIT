    "content": "The Act titled \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" mandates that a minimum of 10 percent of engineering research grants from the National Science Foundation be allocated for coastal engineering and shoreline protection research starting in fiscal year 2001. Additionally, supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas are established. SEC. 3 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose artificial reef and habitat restoration projects instead of fines. SEC. 4 grants access to publicly owned shores. Amendments are made to the eligibility of shoreline protection projects and cost sharing, defining publicly owned shores with insufficient public access as privately owned shores. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to ensure public access to publicly owned shores with insufficient access, defined as privately owned shores. Exceptions may be made for environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury to receive funds from the general fund for beach nourishment projects without the need for further appropriation. The Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury receives funds for beach nourishment projects without the need for further appropriation. Funds are allocated to the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of NASA, and the Secretary of the Army for specific purposes. The Secretary of the Army must adhere to cost-sharing requirements and other regulations for beach projects. The Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury is used for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. The Secretary of the Army must follow cost-sharing requirements and report transactions to Congress. Any excess funds not needed for current withdrawals are invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury is used for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. Investments in interest-bearing obligations of the United States can be made through original issue or purchase of outstanding obligations at market price. Obligations acquired can be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly implement a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. Partnerships will be formed with local interests to collect a wide range of data on coastal oceans and inland waterways in real or near real-time, including wave heights, periods, swell direction, and water temperature. The pilot program will collect various data in real or near real-time, including wave heights, coastal currents, large mammal movement, sewage outfall movement, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion data, weather, and river mouth outflow sediment observation. The program will be carried out in cooperation with the Geological Survey. The pilot program will collect real-time data on various aspects such as wave heights, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spills, beach erosion, weather, and river mouth sediment. Federal cooperation includes the Geological Survey, Navy, and EPA. Regional test projects will be established in Southern California and another location determined by the Secretary and Administrator. Coordination with existing federal, state, and local efforts will be ensured. The pilot program will collect real-time data on various ocean conditions without replacing existing efforts, but coordinating with them. $4,000,000 from the Beach Nourishment Account will be available annually for the program, with $2,000,000 allocated for each of the 2 regional test projects."
