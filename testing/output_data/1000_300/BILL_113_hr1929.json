Section 17 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 is amended to include pilot projects aimed at increasing work effort and reducing dependency in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The projects will focus on identifying best practices for employment and training programs to help participants secure unsubsidized employment, increase earned income, and decrease reliance on public assistance. Selection criteria for the pilot projects will be based on established criteria by the Secretary. The pilot projects for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will be selected based on criteria established by the Secretary, including enhancing existing employment and training programs, participating in evaluations, collaborating with workforce boards, and ensuring replicability of project components. The pilot projects for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will be selected based on criteria established by the Secretary, including replicability of project components, targeting various populations of work registrants, and selecting from a range of existing employment and training programs. Existing employment and training programs, including section 20 workfare, skills development for work registrants with limited employment history, post-employment support services, and education leading to recognized credentials, are located in various geographic areas. The Secretary will conduct an independent evaluation of pilot projects to measure their impact on participants' ability to find and retain employment, leading to increased household income and reduced dependency. A report to Congress is due by September 30, 2017. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress by September 30, 2017, detailing the results of pilot projects, including their impact on employment, income, and public benefit receipt of work registrants, along with the costs and dissemination plans. The Secretary will allocate $10,000,000 annually from 2014 to 2016 for pilot projects aimed at improving employment and earnings of work registrants. The funds will be used for specific components of the projects and will remain available until expended. Funds allocated for pilot projects under this subsection must be used for projects that comply with the Act, project costs, data provision for evaluation, and evaluation costs. These funds cannot replace non-Federal funds for existing employment and training activities."
