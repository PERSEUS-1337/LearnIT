The Act establishes a program for biomedical and behavioral research on HIV cases in women, including prevention research. Research includes transmission of HIV to women, relationship with other sexually transmitted diseases, and clinical trials on preventing HIV through treating STDs in women. The Act establishes a program for research on HIV cases in women, including prevention research on transmission and relationship with other sexually transmitted diseases. Research includes prevention measures such as rapid diagnostic tests, single-dose therapy, and prevention methods for women. The Act includes research on HIV cases in women, focusing on prevention measures like rapid diagnostic tests, single-dose therapy, prevention methods for women, symptoms progression, treatment, and behavioral research for prevention. The Act also includes clinical trials for women infected with HIV, ensuring gynecological evaluations and appropriate follow-up. The Act mandates gynecological evaluations for women participating in HIV clinical trials to analyze the relationship between gynecological conditions and HIV infection. Additionally, it requires trials to assess the effectiveness of standard treatments for gynecological conditions arising from HIV infection.

Additionally, the Secretary conducts epidemiological research. The Secretary conducts or supports epidemiological research to determine risk factors for HIV infection in women, including the use of contraceptive methods, tampons, the relationship with other STDs, and substance abuse. The Secretary is conducting a study on the progression of HIV infection in women, known as the Women's Interagency HIV Study. The study aims to include at least 5,000 women with HIV infection and investigate the relationship between infection and substance abuse, including cocaine use, and sexual activity. The Women's Interagency HIV Study includes at least 5,000 women with HIV infection and will be conducted at multiple sites over a minimum of 8 years. The study will focus on the relationship between CD4 cells and the development of serious illnesses in women with HIV, addressing gynecological and other women-specific conditions. The study will focus on the relationship between CD4 cells and the development of serious illnesses in women with HIV, addressing gynecological and other women-specific conditions.
