    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. Vouchers cover the difference between rent and 30% of adjusted income, administered by local public housing authorities. The Section 8 voucher program provides rental subsidies for low-income families, covering the difference between rent and 30% of income. Congress has made changes to the funding distribution process, leading to uncertainty for public housing authorities. This report discusses the effects of these changes starting in FY2003. The report discusses changes in Section 8 voucher funding starting in FY2003, including renewal funding formula changes enacted by Congress. Prior to FY2003, PHAs were funded based on per-voucher costs from the previous year, adjusted for inflation. Despite receiving full funding, few PHAs leased all authorized vouchers, leading to low utilization rates, a concern for Congress. In FY2000 and FY2001, national voucher utilization rates were just over 91%, below the expected 95%. PHAs had low budget utilization due to not leasing all vouchers, leading to excess funds in their budgets. HUD would reconcile budgets at year-end and recapture excess funds from PHAs' reserves. HUD used a formula based on actual costs and inflation to request funding from Congress for Section 8 renewals. In FY2000 and FY2001, national voucher utilization rates were just over 91%, below the expected 95%. PHAs had low budget utilization due to not leasing all vouchers, leading to excess funds in their budgets. HUD would recapture excess funds from PHAs' reserves using a formula based on actual costs and inflation to request funding from Congress for Section 8 renewals. Congress changed the way PHAs were funded in FY2003 to limit excess funds. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding for PHAs to limit recaptures of unspent funds and provide more accurate funding levels based on actual voucher usage. HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on their average per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted for inflation, and the number of vouchers they could reasonably lease that year. The law directed HUD to renew section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts for PHAs based on their actual voucher usage and costs from the previous year, adjusted for inflation and the number of vouchers they could lease that year. HUD implemented a provision to base PHAs' budgets on their utilization rates and costs from their end-of-the-year statements or more recent data. Renewal calculations for voucher funding will be based on total unit months leased and actual cost data, adjusted by Annual Adjustment Factors. Funding increments will generally be renewed for three months to enable more accurate calculations. (HUD Notice PIH 2003-23, Issued September 22) Expiring voucher funding increments will be renewed for three months using the most recent leasing and cost data for accurate calculations. Congress created a Central Reserve fund for the Secretary to replenish PHA reserves in case of increased costs. The fund can be used for contract amendments due to higher per-unit costs or increased unit months under lease. The bill imposed restrictions on maximized leasing, prohibiting funds from supporting more vouchers than a PHA was authorized to lease. This caused issues for over-leased PHAs, leading to a halt in reissuing vouchers to align with authorized levels. The FY2004 appropriations law continued this trend by funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and limiting funds for maximized leasing. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the trend of funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and restricting funds for maximized leasing, with a focus on controlling costs in the voucher program. The Secretary was expected to utilize administrative tools to manage the rising costs of renewing expiring annual contributions contracts. The FY2004 appropriations law emphasized funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and controlling costs in the voucher program. The Secretary was expected to use administrative tools to manage the rising costs of renewing expiring annual contributions contracts. The language in FY2004 varied from FY2003 in terms of renewing contracts and the use of the Central Reserve fund. The FY2004 appropriations law focused on funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and controlling costs. The Central Reserve fund could only be used to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. HUD issued a notice implementing the appropriations law. HUD issued a notice on April 22, 2004 implementing the FY2004 appropriations law for PHAs' budgets based on utilization rates and costs from end-of-the-year statements. PHAs could appeal if rental costs in their areas had risen higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. Some housing advocates argued for a broader measure of inflation. Some housing advocates argued for a broader measure of inflation for PHAs' budgets, taking into account changes in rental costs, utility costs, and tenant populations. HUD granted appeals requests from 380 out of 400 agencies in 2004, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed funding based on voucher costs, utilization rates, and adjusted AAF. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed the Secretary to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. If data was unavailable, funding was based on February-April 2004 data or the most recent year-end financial statement as of March 31, 2004. If funding was insufficient, budgets were prorated. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with flexibility to adjust payment standards and portability policies as needed. Agency reserves were reduced from one month to one week. The FY2005 appropriations act made changes to how PHAs received voucher renewal funding, shifting to a calendar-year cycle. HUD provided flexibility for agencies to manage within their 2005 budgets, reducing agency reserves and prohibiting maximized leasing. HUD also implemented guidance on adjusting payment standards and portability policies. The FY2005 appropriations act changed how PHAs received voucher renewal funding to a calendar-year cycle. HUD provided flexibility for agencies to manage within their 2005 budgets, with guidance on adjusting payment standards and portability policies. HUD published guidance on the accounting change on December 8, 2004, with agencies receiving preliminary budget levels on December 17, 2004. Appeals were limited to data errors, with final calculations and a proration factor published on January 21, 2005. Agencies were funded at 4.03% less than their May-July 2004 actual cost and utilization levels, plus the 2005 AAF. Final calculations, including a proration factor, were published on January 21, 2005. Agencies were funded at 4.03% less than their actual cost and utilization levels from May-July 2004, plus the 2005 AAF. The proration factor of just under 96% was implemented due to insufficient funding from Congress. HUD analysis showed a median increase of 0.17% in PHA renewal budgets from FY2004 to FY2005, with a wide variance ranging from a 12% decrease to a 14% increase. HUD also provided administrative options for PHAs to lower costs in 2005. HUD published Notice PIH 2005-9, offering administrative options for PHAs to reduce costs in 2005, such as lowering payment standards, restricting portability, and monitoring income eligibility more strictly. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act distributed renewal funding based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation. HUD allocated renewal funds to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation and additional vouchers. The Secretary had $45 million to adjust agency budgets for low leasing or increased costs. PHAs received projected funding letters in January 2006 and had until February 3 to raise concerns. Congress's funding was insufficient to fully support PHAs. The changes enacted in FY2005 and FY2006 incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, leading to a reversal of the cost growth trend seen in 2003. Average annual per voucher costs remained flat from 2004 to 2005 and declined by about 1.5% from 2005 to September 2006. Utilization also decreased from over 98% in 2004 to around 90% by September. Average annual per voucher costs remained flat from 2004 to 2005 and decreased by about 1.5% from 2005 to September 2006. Utilization dropped from over 98% in 2004 to around 90% by September 2006, resulting in fewer households receiving assistance. PHAs had accumulated reserve funds, with unspent balances averaging 10% of their budget authority from January 2005 to September 2006. Budget utilization nationally decreased from over 98% in 2003 and 2004 to under 92% in 2006. The debate in FY2007 continued between a \"budget-based\" and \"unit-based\" funding formula for PHAs. In FY2007, the debate continued between a budget-based and unit-based funding formula for PHAs. President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula similar to FY2005 and FY2006. The budget also asked Congress to lift the prohibition on maximized leasing due to some PHAs receiving more funding than allowed. As of September 2006, 168 PHAs were at their cap on authorized vouchers, with excess funding they couldn't use. In FY2007, 168 PHAs had excess funding they couldn't use due to being at their cap on authorized vouchers. Congress rejected President Bush's proposal and adopted a formula based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors. The law allocated funding based on leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors. It included a central reserve fund for PHAs facing unexpected cost increases or funding decreases. P.L. 110-28 later amended the formula to provide exceptions for certain PHAs, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina. The act continued the prohibition on over-leasing and amended the formula to provide exceptions for certain PHAs, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina. PHAs were funded based on their costs in FY2006 under the FY2007 formula change. Under the FY2007 formula change, PHAs were funded based on their costs in FY2006 rather than the amount received. The funding provided was sufficient for all PHAs to serve at least the same number of families as before, with some able to serve more. The formula included elements of both unit-based and budget-based funding. The FY2007 formula for voucher funding was a combination of unit-based and budget-based elements. It provided funding based on PHAs' costs in FY2006, allowing them to serve the same or more families. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposed a strictly \"budget-based\" formula for funding agencies. In FY2008, President Bush requested a budget-based voucher funding formula for agencies based on their eligibility in 2007, adjusted for the AAF and costs related to FSS program deposits and tenant protection vouchers. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act adopted a similar cost and utilization-based funding formula for agencies. The FY2008 Act adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula for agencies, similar to FY2007. It funded agencies based on leasing and costs from the prior year, adjusted for various factors. A central reserve fund was provided for adjustments, with an alternative formula for specific categories of agencies. Unlike FY2007, the Act included a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level based on their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their total received in FY2007. The FY2008 Act reduced PHAs' funding levels by the amount of unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their FY2007 total. This rescinded $723 million in renewal funding to free up reserves for voucher renewals without reducing overall funding. In FY2008, Congress reduced new appropriations for voucher renewals without decreasing overall funding by using a hybrid funding formula. In FY2009, President Bush's request for a budget-based formula was rejected, and HUD continued to fund PHAs based on leased vouchers' cost in the previous year, adjusted for inflation and other factors. Funding was prorated based on PHAs' Net Restricted Assets. In FY2008, PHAs' allocations were prorated based on their Net Restricted Assets (NRA) offset, with unused NRA expected to supplement new funding. The CY2009 allocations were determined by HUD using utilization and cost data submitted by PHAs for FY2008. HUD based CY2009 allocations on PHAs' FY2008 data, but inaccurate estimates led to insufficient funding for some PHAs to cover voucher costs. Up to 15% of PHAs faced funding challenges due to changes in costs and leasing conditions between FY2008 and CY2009. Some PHAs in CY2009 found their funding insufficient to cover voucher costs, leading to potential assistance termination for families. HUD provided additional funding and guidance to address shortfalls and advised agencies to contact them before terminating assistance. In CY2009, some PHAs faced funding shortages, risking assistance termination for families. HUD allocated up to $200 million to prevent assistance termination, increasing the set-aside renewal funding from $100 million in FY2009. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request differed from the previous Bush Administration's approach to voucher funding. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget expanded voucher funding purposes to prevent assistance termination. The budget requested a funding formula based on PHAs' costs and utilization, with the authority to offset excess reserves and reallocate funding to high-performing agencies or those in need. The final FY2010 funding law adopted a similar formula based on FY2009. The FY2010 funding law adopted a funding formula based on PHAs' costs and utilization, adjusted for inflation. However, it did not provide the Secretary with the authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. Unlike previous years, the FY2010 allocation formula did not include an offset for unspent agency reserves. Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization in FY2011 and FY2012. The FY2011 law contained no offset from PHA reserves, while the FY2012 law included a rescission of $650 million to be offset from allocations to PHAs with reserves. The FY2011 and FY2012 laws allocated Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on costs and utilization. Changes in funding formulas between FY2003 and FY2006 led to PHAs serving fewer families and spending less federal funding. Low utilization of funding and vouchers continued after another formula change in FY2007. Since the change in funding formulas from FY2003 to FY2006, PHAs have seen an increase in utilization and funding allocation. By the end of 2009, PHAs were serving over 150,000 more families than in 2006, with funding utilization increasing to 95%. Reserves accumulated during the budget-based formula days of 2005 and 2006 were spent down by the end of FY2009 due to rescissions enacted in FY2008 and FY2009. By the end of FY2009, PHAs had spent down reserves accumulated during the budget-based formula days of 2005 and 2006. Per voucher costs began rising in CY2007 and were anticipated to continue increasing in CY2012. Some Members of Congress have introduced voucher reform legislation with changes to the funding formula, but Appropriations Committees have overridden the formula each year since FY2003. Prior to FY2003, the Section 8 voucher program was funded like an entitlement program, with Congress determining funding based on a formula. Concerns about inefficient funding allocations and rising costs led to funding changes starting in FY2003. The Appropriations Committees have overridden the funding formula each year since then, raising questions about their deference to authorizing committees. Congress enacted funding changes for the Section 8 voucher program in FY2003 to gain greater control over cost growth. The changes converted the funding structure to a fixed annual sum for grantees, giving Congress more budget control but making the program harder to administer for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). PHAs have limited control over costs as subsidies are set by statute, leading to challenges in areas where they do have control, such as setting payment standards. PHAs have limited control over costs as subsidies are statutorily set. Changes made by PHAs include lowering payment standards and selecting higher-income families from waiting lists to reduce subsidy costs. Some landlords accepted reduced rents, while others chose to no longer participate in the program. Many Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) tried to reduce subsidy costs by selecting higher-income families from waiting lists, despite the requirement that 75% of vouchers be targeted to low-income families. Some PHAs intentionally lowered utilization rates to save money, leading to budget constraints in the following year. Data showed that voucher costs stabilized and utilization rates decreased from 2005 to 2006. Changes in funding formulas led to fewer households receiving vouchers, with costs leveling off and utilization rates declining from 2005 to 2006. Average voucher costs decreased by 1.5% and average utilization by over 2%. Some agencies had excess funds they were not allowed to spend, despite having waiting lists for vouchers. Budget-based funding changes in FY2006 were controversial for low-income families. The FY2006 budget-based funding changes were controversial among low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups. PHAs had funds they couldn't spend, leading to a call for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based formula. The FY2007 funding bill reversed trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula based on previous year's usage rather than received funds. In FY2007, PHAs were funded based on previous year's usage rather than received funds. Funding was sufficient to serve all families and additional ones, with reductions for agencies with excess reserves. FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed FY2007, including rescissions to make unusable funding usable and reduce appropriations. In FY2010 and FY2011, agencies with excess reserves had their budgets reduced through rescissions and offsets, making unused funds usable. FY2012 saw agency reserves used to offset costs. The funding model has shifted to a cost-based approach, incentivizing PHAs to increase utilization. Rising costs and utilization may pressure policymakers to contain program costs. The rising costs and utilization of the program may put pressure on policymakers to find ways to contain costs. Past strategies have reduced costs but also decreased the number of families served and led to unspent funds. Future cost containment strategies should aim to maintain service levels while minimizing unspent funds. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform legislation focuses on maximizing families served without capping cost growth, which could be overridden by future appropriations legislation."
