    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program established within the EPA promotes water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations. The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for promoting WaterSense labeled products in the marketplace. The Administrator of the EPA promotes WaterSense labeled products to reduce water use and ensure performance. They enhance public awareness of WaterSense through outreach and establish performance standards for labeled products. The EPA promotes WaterSense labeled products for water conservation and performance. Guidelines include proper installation by certified professionals, maintaining label integrity, updating criteria every four years, and sharing production data with the public. WaterSense criteria include updating categories, collecting production data, estimating water and energy savings, and soliciting public comments before making any revisions. The WaterSense program updates categories, collects data, estimates savings, and seeks public input before making any changes or establishing new criteria. This includes providing notice, explanations for changes, and responding to comments from interested parties. Lead time is also given before new or significantly revised criteria take effect. The WaterSense program requires interested parties to provide lead time before new criteria take effect and encourages voluntary approaches to improve water efficiency in various sectors. The WaterSense program aims to promote water efficiency through encouraging reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies in different sectors. Funding of $7,500,000 for 2016, $10,000,000 for 2017, $20,000,000 for 2018, and $50,000,000 for 2019 onwards is authorized for this purpose. Federal procurement of water efficient products is mandated under Section 3. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agency,\" \"WaterSense product or service,\" \"WaterSense program,\" \"FEMP designated product,\" and \"product and service.\" These definitions are important for understanding the requirements for federal procurement of water efficient products. The Energy Management Program of the Department of Energy is recognized for efficiency. The terms \"product\" and \"service\" exclude water consuming products for combat missions and those already covered by Federal procurement regulations. Agencies must procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products for water efficiency. The head of an agency must procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products for water efficiency, with exceptions if justified in writing. Installation and maintenance should be done by certified professionals for optimal performance. The head of an agency is not required to procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products if they are not cost-effective or if no suitable products are available. Agency procurement specifications must include water-efficient products and systems. The head of an agency must include criteria for WaterSense and FEMP designated products in procurement specifications for water consuming products and systems. Additional measures for reducing water consumption should also be considered, such as water reuse, leak detection, and use of waterless products. The head of an agency must include criteria for WaterSense and FEMP designated products in procurement specifications for water consuming products and systems. Additionally, measures for reducing agency water consumption, such as water reuse, leak detection, and use of waterless products, should be implemented. WaterSense products and FEMP designated products must be prominently displayed in federal catalogs, with only these products supplied for relevant categories unless specified otherwise in writing. The Environmental Protection Agency must issue regulations within 180 days to implement the procurement of WaterSense and FEMP designated products for federal agencies, unless specified otherwise in writing. SEC. 4. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The section defines key terms like Administrator, eligible entity, incentive program, and residential water efficient products. Eligible entities include government bodies, utilities, and nonprofits meeting specific requirements. An incentive program offers financial incentives for residential water efficient products and services. The term \"residential water efficient product or service\" refers to products or services for single-family or multifamily residences that are rated for water efficiency and performance by the WaterSense program or an approved incentive program. Categories of such products and services may include faucets, irrigation technologies, water treatment devices, toilets, and showerheads. The term \"residential water efficient product or service\" includes faucets, irrigation technologies, water treatment devices, toilets, and showerheads. Products must be tested and certified by an accredited third-party certifying body in accordance with the WaterSense program to be considered water efficient. The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States. The \"WaterSense program\" is defined as a specific program. Eligible entities can receive allocations if they offer incentives for purchasing water-efficient products or services. The Administrator establishes an incentive program for residential water-efficient products. Entities must apply for allocations and assure funds will supplement existing programs. Allocations are determined based on the population served by the entity. The Administrator determines allocations for eligible entities based on population served, targeted population, program effectiveness, and prior year's unused allocation. Entities allocated funds can use up to 50% to establish and run incentive programs for water-efficient products. They are encouraged to implement fixture recycling programs. Financial incentives can be given to consumers who meet program requirements, with the option to delegate administration to other organizations. Entities allocated funds can use up to 50% to establish and run incentive programs for water-efficient products. Financial incentives can be given to consumers who meet program requirements, with the option to delegate administration to other organizations. The amount of the incentive is determined based on various factors including allocation to the entity, available tax incentives, consumer behavior change, and consumer expenditures. The authorization of appropriations for the purchase of residential water-efficient products and services is as follows: $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2019, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2020. SEC. 139F. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. SEC. 139F. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The gross income of an individual does not include amounts received under an incentive program. No double benefit allowed for any expenditure covered by the incentive program. Adjusted basis of property reduced by the excluded amount. Conforming amendment made to the tax code.
