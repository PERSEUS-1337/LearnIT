It amends Title V of the Public Health Service Act to include services provided through religious organizations for the prevention and treatment of substance abuse. This new section, Part G, specifies the applicability to designated programs. This part of the Act applies to programs providing federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. It does not apply to awards for other purposes. A designated award recipient is a public or private entity receiving an award under a designated program. The Act applies to programs providing federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. A designated award recipient is a public or private entity that has received an award under a designated program, either directly from the Federal Government or through a non-Federal entity. The Act applies to programs providing federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment through designated programs. Financial assistance includes grants, agreements, contracts, or vouchers. Program beneficiaries are individuals receiving services, and program participants are defined in section 582(a)(2). Program services include substance abuse treatment or preventive services. The term 'program services' refers to substance abuse treatment or preventive services provided under a designated program. 'Religious organization' is defined as a nonprofit religious organization. 'Voucherized assistance' is a system where beneficiaries are given a document to pay for services and choose the organization according to specified rules. The beneficiary can choose the organization for program services and be reimbursed by the designated award recipient. Alternatively, the beneficiary can allocate program funds by selecting a service provider from alternatives. SEC. 582. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. Religious organizations have the authority to be designated award recipients, make subawards to other entities, provide program services through voucherized assistance, and be service providers under designated programs. The term 'program participant' refers to entities that have received a direct award. The purpose of this section is to allow religious organizations to participate in designated programs on an equal basis as other nonprofit providers, ensuring their religious character and the freedom of program beneficiaries. Religious organizations can participate in programs without discrimination and without compromising their religious character or freedom of expression. They are eligible on the same basis as other nonprofit organizations. Religious organizations can participate in programs without discrimination based on their religious character. They are eligible on the same basis as other nonprofit organizations and can maintain independence in defining and practicing their religious beliefs.

They are eligible on the same basis as other nonprofit organizations and can maintain independence in defining and practicing their religious beliefs. Additional safeguards prohibit the Federal Government or a State from requiring a religious organization to alter its internal governance or remove religious symbols to be a program participant. Nondiscrimination in employment is maintained, with exceptions for religious organizations. Religious organizations participating in programs can require employees to adhere to their religious beliefs and practices, as well as rules on drug and alcohol use. Program beneficiaries can object to a religious organization's participation based on religious grounds. Individuals objecting to a religious organization as a program participant can receive services through an alternative entity or program participant based on the type of award received by the organization. Individuals objecting to a religious organization can receive services through an alternative entity or program participant, ensuring the monetary value of the services is not less than what would have been received from the religious organization. Nondiscrimination is required, except as provided.

Religious organizations receiving federal financial assistance must be accountable for fund usage according to auditing principles. Religious organizations receiving federal financial assistance must comply with auditing principles to account for fund usage. If a religious organization separates federal funds from non-federal funds, only the federal funds are subject to audit. Judicial review of agency action can be sought by a religious organization for compliance with these regulations. SEC. 583 prohibits the use of funds for sectarian worship or instruction, except when the beneficiary can choose where the assistance is used. SEC. 584 addresses the administration of programs and fund treatment. Federal financial assistance under a designated program is aid to the beneficiary, not the organization providing services. State laws cannot prohibit the use of Federal funds in religious facilities or by religious organizations participating in the program. If State laws restrict the use of public funds in such facilities, Federal funds must be segregated for the program. SEC. 585. EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PERSONNEL IN DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS. The Congress finds that formal educational qualifications for counselors in drug treatment programs may hinder the effectiveness and provision of services. States must recognize the importance of religious education and training for personnel in program services. State or local government must recognize the critical role of religious education and training for personnel in program services. They should give credit for religious education equivalent to secular coursework for personnel in organizations providing program services. The State or local government may establish educational qualifications for personnel in organizations providing program services to reduce drug use among beneficiaries. The Secretary can waive educational qualifications for a religious organization with a successful drug treatment record. The Secretary can waive educational qualifications for a religious organization with a successful drug treatment record if the organization applies for a waiver and the State or local government fails to prove the necessity of the qualifications for a drug treatment program."
