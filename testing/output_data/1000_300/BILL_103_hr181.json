    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 1993\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a new provision for calculating the primary insurance amount for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B). This provision includes a transitional increase amount based on former law and the applicable percentage in relation to the year. The term 'applicable transitional increase amount' is defined as the product of the excess under former law and the applicable percentage in relation to the year an individual becomes eligible for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for old-age insurance benefits eligibility years is as follows: 60% in 1979, 35% in 1980, 30% in 1981, 25% in 1982, and 10% in 1983. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between the former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary amount. The term 'excess under former law' for an individual is the difference between the applicable former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under current law. The primary insurance amount is determined under section 215(a) or computed/recomputed under subsection (d), modified as provided. In calculating the amount, certain provisions apply, including the exclusion of subsection (b)(4) and the inclusion of specific calendar years for wage and income calculations. The primary insurance amount is calculated based on specific calendar years of wages and self-employment income, with adjustments made for certain provisions. This calculation includes provisions for individuals aged 61 and older, ensuring a higher primary insurance amount than if computed without these adjustments. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 1994. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for December 1987. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for December 1987, taking into account the amendments made by the Act."
