    "content": "The Act titled \"Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2013\" aims to enhance cost savings. The \"Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2013\" amends Section 4512 of title 5, United States Code to include the identification of surplus funds or unnecessary budget authority. The Inspector General or designated agency employee must refer any identified surplus funds or unnecessary budget authority to the Chief Financial Officer of the agency along with recommendations. The Chief Financial Officer of an agency must be informed of any potential surplus funds or unnecessary budget authority identified by an employee, along with recommendations from the Inspector General or other agency employee. If the Chief Financial Officer determines that rescission of these funds would not hinder agency effectiveness, the head of the agency must transfer the amount to the general fund of the Treasury for deficit reduction. Transfers under this provision are not subject to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 does not apply to transfers of surplus funds for deficit reduction. The head of an agency can retain up to 10% of transferred amounts for cash awards to employees who identified the surplus funds. Annual reports on fraud, waste, or abuse disclosures must be submitted to the Office of Personnel Management. The head of each agency must report annually to the Office of Personnel Management on fraud, waste, or mismanagement disclosures by employees, savings achieved, and cash awards given. This information must also be included in each budget request submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management ensures agency compliance with reporting requirements on fraud, waste, and mismanagement disclosures, savings, and cash awards. An annual report on Federal cost savings and awards is submitted to Congress and the Government Accountability Office. The Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2013 requires agencies to comply with cash award programs and submit annual certifications to Congress. The Comptroller General must report on the program's operation every three years, with potential legislative recommendations. Officers eligible for cash awards are defined, with prohibitions outlined for certain officers. Sec. 4509 prohibits cash awards for certain officers, including those at level I of the Executive Schedule, agency heads, and members of independent establishments. Prohibition of cash awards for certain officers."
