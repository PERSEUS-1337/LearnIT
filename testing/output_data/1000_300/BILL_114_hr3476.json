    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The \"Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015\" was enacted due to the failure of negotiations following the Budget Control Act of 2011, leading to sequestration in fiscal year 2013. Lawmakers were unable to reach an agreement, resulting in mandatory spending cuts. The initial sequester in fiscal year 2013 was a result of unsuccessful negotiations. Lawmakers later reached a two-year agreement to increase defense and non-defense discretionary spending for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. A similar agreement is needed to avoid deep budget cuts in the upcoming fiscal year. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry criticized the defense spending cuts under sequestration. The Chairs of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees have criticized defense spending cuts under sequestration, stating that it undermines the armed forces' capabilities, readiness, and modernization. The impact of the cuts on non-defense discretionary spending is also concerning, affecting economic recovery and public health preparedness. Organizations are concerned about self-imposed cuts affecting economic recovery, business growth, public health, education, oversight, fraud recovery, scientific discovery, infrastructure, and emergency response. House Committee on Appropriations bills for fiscal year 2016 propose cuts to the Department of Education, housing vouchers, and funding for various departments. The House Committee on Appropriations bills propose significant cuts to various departments, including the Department of Education and housing vouchers. Eliminating the sequester would boost economic growth and employment, providing relief for Congress to act on appropriations legislation. The elimination of the sequester in 2017 would increase employment by 500,000 next year and 300,000 in 2017. It would also allow Congress to pass appropriations legislation before the fiscal year starts, preventing a government shutdown. The 2013 shutdown cost the economy 120,000 private-sector jobs, reduced GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%, and caused various disruptions including delayed tax refunds and food safety inspections. To prevent another government shutdown and fund vital services for fiscal year 2016, immediate negotiations on a budget agreement are necessary. This should include raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester. It is preferred that the cost of sequester relief be offset by closing special interest tax loopholes. To prevent a government shutdown and fund services for fiscal year 2016, negotiations on a budget agreement are crucial. This should involve raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester. It is preferable to offset the cost of sequester relief by closing special interest tax loopholes, but relief must occur regardless of this agreement. SEC. 2. BIPARTISAN, BICAMERAL AGREEMENT ON SEQUESTER RELIEF.
