FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that free trade agreements improve income and prosperity by increasing competition, reducing costs, and promoting economic growth. APEC member economies aim for free and open trade by 2020 for developing countries and 2010 for developed countries, leading to new trade opportunities and stability by reducing tariffs and nontariff barriers. Continued economic growth in the Pacific Rim region is crucial for the United States due to the reduction of trade barriers. The financial crisis in Asia has disrupted US export growth, highlighting the importance of free trade agreements amidst global economic pressures. During the years 1989-1997, free trade agreement negotiations were crucial for the United States amidst global economic pressures. Countries like New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore, long-time allies of the US, worked together to increase economic growth through trade liberalization. Building closer ties with friendly countries will benefit trade negotiations for liberalization in the next century. The United States must continue promoting its interests in the Asia-Pacific region through aggressive trade negotiations. Bilateral trade agreements can positively influence multilateral and regional trade talks by expanding common areas of agreement on trade disciplines. Trade and investment disputes between the United States and its allies can be resolved through these negotiations. Free trade agreements between the United States and Pacific Rim countries can effectively resolve trade disputes and enhance cooperation, ensuring mutually beneficial economic and political relations.
