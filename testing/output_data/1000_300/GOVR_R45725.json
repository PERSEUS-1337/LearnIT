It protects U.S. shipyards and sailors but is debated for increasing costs and limiting ship availability. Recent issues include Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the El Faro ship sinking, and domestic oil transportation debates. The Jones Act of 1920, requiring U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport, has been under scrutiny for its impact on Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the El Faro ship sinking, and domestic oil transportation debates. Discussions also focus on national security goals and strategies to enhance U.S. shipbuilding capability. The Jones Act of 1920, a law requiring U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport, was a restatement of long-standing restrictions dating back to the First Congress in 1789. This law has been scrutinized for its impact on Puerto Rico's economy, the El Faro ship sinking, and domestic oil transportation debates. Discussions also focus on national security goals and strategies to enhance U.S. shipbuilding capability. In 1817, Congress enacted a precursor to the Jones Act by disallowing foreign-owned vessels from transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports. The early United States had a shipbuilding advantage due to ample timber supplies, but lost it as wooden ships were replaced by iron steamships. Congress debated how to address the decline in U.S. vessels' share of foreign trade. In response to the decline in U.S. vessels' share of foreign trade, Congress debated the \"free ship\" movement allowing foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag. Despite concerns about higher costs, a measure was enacted in 1912 to allow foreign-built vessels for international service. Since then, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels on domestic voyages. In 1912, Congress enacted a measure allowing foreign-built vessels for international service, tightening the language concerning coastwise transport in response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels. Despite previous considerations in the late 1800s, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels on domestic voyages since then. In response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels, foreign-built ships were allowed for international service in 1912. Shippers used foreign-flag ships to transport goods between different countries, bypassing coastwise laws. Congress amended the coastwise law in 1893 and 1898 to prevent cargo from being routed through foreign ports to avoid domestic shipping regulations. Despite these changes, U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. In the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, Senator Wesley Jones sought to stop the use of foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by requiring cargo to move through the Port of Seattle. The debate over the Jones Act also involved the cost difference between building ships in the United States and foreign countries. Congress had previously requested annual reports on this subject in the Shipping Act of 1916. The Jones Act, passed in 1920, aimed to promote American merchant marine by banning foreign-built ships. The minority report expressed concerns about the higher cost of domestically built ships and advocated for removing restrictions on American merchants acquiring ships at the lowest price to compete globally. The Jones Act of 1920 aimed to boost the American merchant marine by prohibiting foreign-built ships. A 1922 report highlighted that U.S.-built ships cost 20% more than foreign ones, potentially hindering competitiveness. The minority report suggested allowing American merchants to purchase ships globally at lower prices to enhance their ability to compete internationally. The cost of U.S.-built ships compared to foreign yards has increased significantly over the years. In the 1920s, U.S. ships cost 20% more, which grew to 50% in the 1930s, doubled in the 1950s, and tripled by the 1990s. Currently, U.S.-built tankers are four times more expensive than global prices, while container ships are five times pricier. This cost difference is a concern for the Department of Defense, leading them to opt for buying more used foreign-built cargo ships instead of building sealift ships domestically. The Department of Defense officials are facing an issue with military sealift ships. Due to high costs, they have decided to buy more used foreign-built cargo ships instead of building domestically. U.S. shipyards do not compete on price or vessel characteristics with foreign shipyards. Operating costs for U.S.-flag ships are estimated to be over $6 million higher per year compared to foreign-flag ships, primarily due to higher crewing costs. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 focused on selling surplus government cargo ships from World War I and establishing maritime policy goals for the U.S. It emphasized the need for a well-equipped merchant marine to support national defense and commerce. Operating costs for U.S.-flag ships are significantly higher than foreign-flag ships, with crewing being the primary cost element. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the need for a well-equipped merchant marine to support national defense and commerce. The act reflected the United States' emerging power status and the shortage of ships during World War I. The Jones Act, enacted in 1920, aimed to ensure the United States had its own merchant marine to avoid reliance on foreign vessels. It applies to domestic waterborne shipments, requiring U.S. citizen crewing and ownership for Jones Act ships. Certain U.S. territories are exempt from the act. The Jones Act requires U.S. citizen crewing and ownership for ships. U.S. territories like the Virgin Islands are exempt. The Coast Guard enforces U.S.-build, ownership, and crewing requirements for vessels. Operators need a \"coastwise endorsement\" to be Jones Act qualified. The Jones Act requires U.S. citizen crewing and ownership for ships, enforced by the Coast Guard. Customs and Border Protection determines maritime activity under the act. A key element is the use of \"U.S.-built\" vessels, with the definition left to the Coast Guard. The Jones Act requires the use of \"U.S.-built\" vessels, with the definition determined by the Coast Guard. A vessel is considered U.S.-built if its hull and superstructure are fabricated in the United States and assembled in the country. Propulsion machinery and other components do not affect this determination, allowing U.S. shipyards to import engines from foreign manufacturers for oceangoing ships. For oceangoing ships, U.S. shipyards can import engines from foreign manufacturers as long as they are deemed components attached to the hull, not integral parts of the structure. Components that are self-supporting and do not compromise the vessel's integrity can be manufactured abroad but must be attached in a U.S. shipyard. The Coast Guard allows up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components to be manufactured abroad. The Coast Guard's test for \"major components\" of the hull or superstructure is based on weight; up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components can be manufactured abroad. The propeller, stern bulb, bulbous bow, some rudders, and watertight closures used in U.S.-built vessels are often imported, as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Shipyards seek confirmation from the Coast Guard that incorporating certain foreign-built components in vessel construction will not disqualify the vessel from the Jones Act trade. In the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, Congress directed the Coast Guard to publish determination letters detailing the permissibility of foreign components in vessel construction. Shipyard unions, referring to ships built with foreign components as \"kit ships,\" sued the Coast Guard in 2007 over the interpretation of the statute, but the U.S. District Court sided with the Coast Guard, citing consistency with the Treasury Department's interpretation dating back to the late 1800s. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sided with the Coast Guard in a lawsuit brought by shipyard unions over the interpretation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The lawsuit was prompted by a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder to build Jones Act tankers and container ships using foreign designs and procurement services. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego also partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea for vessel designs and engineering since 2006. Since 2006, General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego has partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea to procure vessel designs and materials for Jones Act commercial ships. The use of foreign components in shipbuilding has raised concerns about undermining the Jones Act policy objective of domestic shipbuilding independence. The court case highlighted arguments that restricting foreign components could increase ship costs, reduce orders, and harm the domestic fleet. Additionally, the United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships due to exemptions from Jones Act compliance for cruise ships serving U.S. ports. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships due to exemptions from Jones Act compliance for cruise ships serving U.S. ports. CBP has determined that a cruise ship serving a U.S. port does not have to be Jones Act-compliant as long as it has visited a distant foreign port. This regulatory interpretation allows for the prevalence of foreign cruise ships at U.S. ports. The U.S. Customs Service's 1985 rulemaking allows foreign cruise ships to visit U.S. ports if they also visit a nearby foreign port. Passengers must stay on the cruise until it returns to the same dock. The Jones Act is not violated if the main purpose of the voyage is not domestic transportation. The Jones Act is not violated if the main purpose of the voyage is not domestic transportation of passengers. \"Voyages to nowhere\" involve visits to no other ports, staying within 3-mile zone of U.S. territorial waters makes vessels Jones Act-compliant. If vessels journey beyond 3 miles into international waters, they do not need to be Jones Act-compliant. CBP has determined that vessels do not need to be Jones Act-compliant if they journey beyond 3 miles into international waters. However, charter fishing boats must still comply with the Jones Act even in international waters. CBP's interpretation of the Jones Act includes defining a passenger as anyone aboard a vessel who is not a crew member. The Jones Act defines a passenger as anyone aboard a vessel who is not a crew member. This includes owners entertaining guests, construction workers being transported, and vessels involved in lightering within 3 nautical miles of shore. Compliance with the Jones Act is required in these situations. The Jones Act requires compliance for vessels involved in lightering within 3 nautical miles of shore and for offshore supply vessels servicing oil rigs in U.S. waters extending 200 miles offshore. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 extends U.S. waters 200 miles offshore for offshore natural resource activities. Only oil rigs attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points,\" allowing foreign-flagged vessels to service mobile offshore drilling units not attached to the seabed. However, Congress mandated in 2008 that U.S.-owned and -crewed vessels must service these units, aligning with requirements for U.S.-flag vessels on international voyages. In 2008, Congress mandated that U.S.-owned and -crewed vessels must service mobile offshore drilling units not attached to the seabed. Foreign-flagged vessels were previously allowed, but now must be U.S.-owned and -crewed. Jones Act compliance for OSVs depends on whether they are transporting supplies/workers or installing equipment for rig operation. Vessels laying cable/pipeline in U.S. waters do not need to be Jones Act-compliant. In 2008, Congress mandated that U.S.-owned and -crewed vessels must service mobile offshore drilling units not attached to the seabed. Foreign-flagged vessels were previously allowed but now must be U.S.-owned and -crewed. Jones Act compliance for OSVs depends on whether they are transporting supplies/workers or installing equipment for rig operation. Vessels laying cable/pipeline in U.S. waters do not need to be Jones Act-compliant. The distinction can be unclear, with some questioning the application of the Jones Act to offshore wind farms located beyond 3 miles from shore. Currently, wind farm developers are guided by CBP's interpretations of the Jones Act with respect to OSVs and oil rigs. The Jones Act applies to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore, with CBP guiding wind farm developers on Jones Act compliance. The nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) hinders offshore wind farm development, leading U.S. developers to transport equipment from foreign countries or use Jones Act-compliant vessels alongside non-compliant TIVs. A third CBP interpretation of the Jones Act has shaped coastal maritime activity significantly. The Jones Act applies to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore, with CBP guiding wind farm developers on compliance. Nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels hinders offshore wind farm development, leading U.S. developers to transport equipment from foreign countries or use compliant vessels alongside non-compliant ones. CBP's interpretation allows for foreign-flag tankers to transport transformed products between U.S. and foreign ports without Jones Act compliance. Since 1920, Congress has enacted provisions tightening Jones Act requirements and exempting certain maritime activities. Foreign-flag tankers are allowed to ship transformed products between U.S. and foreign ports without Jones Act compliance, based on a 1964 Customs Service ruling involving California rice processed in the U.S. Virgin Islands before being shipped to Puerto Rico. In 1935, Congress prohibited Jones Act-qualified vessels from being sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign-flag, ensuring they could not be used in U.S. domestic trade again. This protection from competition for Jones Act carriers is crucial in case coastal shipping demand increases, as it takes two years to construct a new ship. Additionally, in 1940, Congress expanded the Jones Act to cover towing vessels and salvage vessels operating in U.S. waters. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires use of a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act, waiving restrictions when no qualified operator is available. For instance, passenger travel between Puerto Rico and any U.S. port is exempt if no Jones Act-qualified operator can provide service. In 1984, Congress exempted passenger travel between Puerto Rico and any other U.S. port if no Jones Act-qualified operator could provide comparable service. This exemption allows foreign-flag cruise ships to carry passengers between the U.S. mainland and the island. Congress has also permitted certain foreign-flagged LNG tankers to provide domestic service in 1996 and 2011 due to a lack of Jones Act fleet. Additionally, exemptions have been enacted to address sudden spikes in demand for Jones Act-qualified vessels, such as during the 1940s for iron ore transport on the Great Lakes. In response to vessel shortages, Congress enacted exemptions for iron ore transport on the Great Lakes during the 1940s and for a bumper grain harvest in 1951. In 1996, an exemption was made for vessels involved in oil spill cleanup operations when there weren't enough Jones Act-qualified vessels available. Congress also granted waivers for innovative vessel designs used in foreign trade with domestic legs that would fall under the Jones Act, such as the Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) technology. In 1971, Congress exempted river barges designed for international voyages from the Jones Act. This exemption is no longer relevant as the technology is no longer in use. In 1965, Congress exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports from the Jones Act, allowing foreign-flagged container carriers to reposition their empty equipment along U.S. coastlines. Jones Act-compliant ships are necessary for transshipment of loaded international containers, impacting the development of marine highways or short sea shipping routes. Transshipment of international containerized cargo by feeder ships is prevalent abroad, but not in the United States due to the Jones Act requirements for U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships. Lack of transshipment services increases demand for rail and road connections to ports, as smaller feeder container ships do not distribute cargo among U.S. ports. Congress has authorized exemptions to the Jones Act for specific vessels identified by name and registration number. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers for at least 133 specific vessels in 16 separate legislative acts. These waivers are typically found in maritime-related legislation and are not for commercially significant vessels, such as large cargo or passenger ships. The Jones Act waivers granted by Congress since 1989 have been for vessels that are not commercially significant, with specific conditions placed on their use. Waivers are often needed due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements, such as missing U.S.-citizen ownership records. Domestic shipping restrictions were waived during World War I and World War II, with specific legislation passed for each instance. The Jones Act waivers have been granted for vessels with specific conditions since 1989. Waivers were issued during World War I, World War II, and the Korean War, with provisions for national defense. Recent waivers were granted for oil shipments during the Persian Gulf War and a conflict in Libya, as well as for fuel resupply after natural disasters. The executive branch has the authority to issue waivers in the interest of national defense. The executive branch has waived the Jones Act for fuel resupply after natural disasters and military conflicts like the Persian Gulf War and conflict in Libya. Recent waivers were granted for hurricanes from Katrina in 2005 to Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. MARAD checks vessel availability before granting waivers, and waivers have been given for lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet. In 2005 and 2006, waivers were granted for foreign-flag heavy-lift vessels to transport radar systems and an oil rig. Customs denied a waiver request in 1992 for transporting replicas of Christopher Columbus's vessels. Despite safety concerns, CBP has denied Jones Act waivers for heavy-lift vessels used in offshore oil rig construction. The \"national defense\" justification is considered a high standard for granting waivers. CBP has denied Jones Act waivers for heavy-lift vessels used in offshore oil rig construction, despite safety concerns. The \"national defense\" justification is a high standard for granting waivers, and waivers have not been issued for economic reasons such as commercial practicality or expediency. In 1976, some Members of Congress sought to extend the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands due to concerns about the vulnerability of offshore supply lines. In 2014, northeast refineries considered seeking a Jones Act waiver to ship crude oil from Texas, as they import much of their crude oil. In 2018, the United States exported between 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers, imported about 150 million barrels per month from overseas on foreign-flag tankers, and shipped about 15 million barrels per month domestically on Jones Act tankers. The United States has also begun exporting substantial quantities of liquefied natural gas by ship. The Jones Act covers various types of vessels, including oceangoing ships and offshore supply vessels. There are no LNG tankers in the Jones Act fleet, leading to challenges in domestic LNG shipping. Puerto Rico is seeking a waiver to receive bulk LNG shipments from the U.S. mainland. Recent controversies have focused on the limitations of the Jones Act ship fleet. Controversies over the Jones Act have focused on the limitations of the oceangoing ship and offshore supply vessel sectors. The Jones Act fleet consists of 99 oceangoing ships, with the largest category being tankers. Of the 57 tankers, 11 carry Alaskan crude oil to the West Coast, 44 carry refined products along the Atlantic Coast, and 2 are chemical or asphalt tankers. The dry cargo fleet includes 24 container ships and 7 roll on/roll off vessels. The Jones Act fleet consists of 99 oceangoing ships, including tankers and dry cargo vessels. The fleet has shrunk significantly since 1950, with a drop in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The fleet includes various types of vessels, such as container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, and general-cargo vessels supplying subsistence harbors along Alaska's coast. The U.S. merchant marine fleet's carrying capacity is still less than in 1950, with a significant drop in size in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration called for the repeal of the Jones Act, stating that the fleet was too small, old, and unproductive. Despite economic advantages, domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines. The U.S. merchant marine fleet carries fewer tons of freight today than in the 1950s. Despite economic advantages, domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines. The Jones Act fleet operates in markets where shippers have little alternative, but it has not succeeded in sustaining a growing maritime industry. The Jones Act fleet, serving Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, operates in markets with limited alternatives. Despite amendments to policy goals in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, the fleet does not meet the objectives of providing essential shipping services and having the best-equipped vessels. The fleet does not appear to achieve these goals, raising questions about its effectiveness. The Jones Act fleet does not meet the policy objective of having the best-equipped and most suitable types of vessels. Certain ship designs, like \"project cargo\" or \"heavy-lift\" vessels, are not represented in the fleet. The Department of Defense has used waivers to move specialized cargo on foreign-flag vessels due to the lack of suitable vessels in the Jones Act fleet. The Jones Act fleet lacks specialized vessels like \"project cargo\" or \"heavy-lift\" vessels. The Department of Defense has used waivers to move radar systems and newly built vessels on foreign-flag vessels due to the higher cost structure of Jones Act operators. The oceangoing Jones Act fleet has two inactive dry bulk ships that are nearly 40 years old, and a chemical tanker built in 1968. There are no LNG tankers in the Jones Act fleet despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom. The Jones Act fleet lacks specialized vessels like \"project cargo\" or \"heavy-lift\" vessels. The fleet has two inactive dry bulk ships that are nearly 40 years old and a chemical tanker built in 1968. Despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom, there are no LNG tankers in the Jones Act fleet. The high cost of U.S.-built and U.S.-crewed ships has led to the development of articulated tug barges (ATBs) as a unique vessel design. MARAD estimates that over 150 ATBs are operating in the Jones Act trades, but they are less reliable and efficient over longer voyages compared to tanker ships. Articulated tug barges (ATBs) are less capable than ships in handling heavy sea states due to their slower speed and smaller size. The notch between the barge and tug creates more resistance through the water. ATBs carry more cargo, predominantly oil, on coastal voyages. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship that sank in 2015, had open lifeboats due to its age. ATB crews are not qualified to sail sealift ships. The general cargo ship El Faro sank in a hurricane in 2015. Due to its age, it had open lifeboats instead of closed lifeboats with auto launchers. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet, noting that many ships are in substandard condition and are significantly older than the average fleet worldwide. The Jones Act fleet is significantly older than the average fleet worldwide, with some ships almost three times older. The Coast Guard is concerned about their condition, citing a recent incident where a 46 year-old containership found a crack in the hull. New ships were built to comply with emissions requirements, but one-third of the fleet is still 21 years old or older. The Jones Act oceangoing fleet is aging, with one-third of the fleet being 21 years old or older. The Great Lakes fleet, consisting of dry bulk ships and barges, is even older, with the largest ships built between 1972 and 1981. Some vessels in the 700-foot class were originally built in the 1940s or 1950s. The Great Lakes fleet of ships, around 700 feet in length, is older, with some vessels originally built in the 1940s or 1950s. Ships operating in freshwater can have longer lives than oceangoing vessels. Domestic tonnage on the Great Lakes has declined steadily since the 1950s. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet was of similar age as the Jones Act fleet, with the youngest ship built in 1985 before Canada imposed a 25% tariff on newly constructed imported ships. Canada's fleet, similar in age to the Jones Act fleet, had its youngest ship built in 1985 before a 25% tariff was imposed on imported ships. This tariff halted new ship additions until its repeal in 2010. Since then, over 35 new dry bulk ships have been constructed for the Great Lakes, unable to transport cargo between U.S. points. The nation's inland rivers see thousands of tugs and barges moving dry and liquid bulk commodities, dominated by corn, soybeans, and coal. Overall tonnage has been stagnant or slightly decreasing since 1990. Since 1990, overall tonnage on the U.S. inland river system has been flat or slightly declining. A leading barge manufacturer ceased operation in 2018 due to decreased demand for coal deliveries. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. Congress amended the Jones Act in 1988 to include valueless material as \"merchandise,\" requiring dredge spoil to be transported in Jones Act-qualified vessels. The Jones Act was amended in 1988 to include valueless material as \"merchandise,\" requiring dredge spoil to be transported in U.S.-built vessels. This change has raised the cost of dredging U.S. harbors significantly. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a larger volume of material dredged due to factors such as limited supply of dredging vessels, cost increases in fuel, steel, and labor, and more stringent environmental requirements. The U.S. privately owned fleet for dredging harbors is older and smaller compared to leading European firms. European firms have larger and newer hopper dredges, while U.S. firms face cost increases due to factors like fuel, steel, and labor. When the Army Corps bids for harbor work requiring a hopper dredge, a U.S. firm is often the sole bidder. The U.S. privately owned hopper dredge fleet is older than the European fleet, with over 20 years of age. One of the four U.S. firms is the sole bidder for Army Corps harbor work bids over a third of the time. Mobilization and demobilization costs in the U.S. market can amount to more than one-third of total project costs. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels to transport their dredge fleets, which are not available in the Jones Act fleet. The offshore supply vessel fleet size can change significantly with oil market fluctuations. The offshore supply vessel fleet in the Gulf of Mexico consisted of about 1,800 vessels in 2017. Foreign-built vessels with dynamic positioning systems are used for construction in deeper waters, lacking in the Jones Act fleet for wind tower installations. Shortcomings exist in the domestic fleet's ability to serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war. The Jones Act fleet lacks vessels for installing wind towers in deeper waters and may struggle to serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war. Congress has enacted programs to designate other fleets for sealift support, but the shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises concerns about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. In 2014, Congress directed the Department of Transportation and Defense to develop a national sealift strategy, which has yet to be issued. The crews of Jones Act oceangoing ships are crucial for potential mobilization. In 2014, Congress directed the Department of Transportation and Defense to develop a national sealift strategy, which has not been issued yet. Jones Act mariners, comprising about 29% of the total mariner pool, could crew a reserve fleet for military sealift purposes. The remaining mariners would come from the U.S.-flag privately owned international fleet. MARAD estimates a pool of 11,678 mariners would be needed to crew the government-owned reserve fleet, with additional mariners from the U.S.-flag privately owned international fleet and the Military Sealift Command fleet. While there is enough commercial mariners for a surge lasting up to 180 days, a longer sealift effort would face a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners. This shortage has been a consistent issue for decades. MARAD estimates a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners for crew rotations in longer sealift efforts. This shortage has been a consistent issue for decades, even when the mariner pool was larger in previous years. The Jones Act's maritime policy aimed for a commercial fleet capable of providing sealift in times of war, but additional fleets have since been established. The Jones Act aimed for a commercial fleet capable of providing sealift in times of war, but additional fleets like the RRF, MSC, and MSP have been established for military sealift purposes. The RRF consists of 46 ships with a skeleton crew of 600 mariners, needing an additional 1,200 mariners when activated. MSC ships are controlled by TRANSCOM and mostly crewed by civilian mariners, while MSP ships are part of a separate fleet. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) fleet, controlled by TRANSCOM, consists of about 50 ships carrying military cargoes. These ships are crewed by civilian mariners who are federal employees. The Maritime Security Program (MSP) fleet, established in 1996, receives a subsidy of $5 million per vessel per year and relies on government cargoes. The military is required to utilize MSP ships before MSC ships, despite the latter being mostly composed of more economical foreign-built ships. The military sealift fleet, controlled by the Department of Defense, prioritizes using MSP ships over MSC ships. Jones Act operators must buy expensive U.S.-built ships, while the sealift fleet mainly consists of cheaper foreign-built ships. Instead of relying on commercial fleets, domestically built sealift ships could be required, sharing the higher cost nationally. This would increase competition with other transportation methods, expand the mariner pool, and boost repair work for U.S. shipyards. The military sealift fleet could be more price-competitive with other transportation methods, increasing repair work for U.S. shipyards. The ships should be designed to military specifications for versatility in carrying various cargo types and sizes. The fleet consists of product tankers, Ro/Ro ships, and container ships for moving ammunition and supplies. The military's preference for versatile ships conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger vessels driven by cost considerations. General cargo and break-bulk ships with onboard cranes have been replaced by container ships without cranes, leading to potential challenges for commercial mariners in foreign ports. The largest container ships require deeper water than many ports can provide, and Ro/Ro ships have been replaced by \"pure car\" carriers. The military's ideal vessel designs conflict with commercial trends towards specialized, larger ships driven by cost considerations. Container ships lack onboard cranes, requiring deeper water in ports. Ro/Ro ships are being replaced by \"pure car\" carriers. Commercial carriers prioritize fuel-efficient engines, hindering military sealift ships' desired higher speeds. Stringent sulfur emission regulations have led to the adoption of LNG-fueled engines or scrubbers, impacting cargo space and crew licensing. The military's ideal vessel designs conflict with commercial trends towards specialized, larger ships driven by cost considerations. Container ships lack onboard cranes, requiring deeper water in ports. Ro/Ro ships are being replaced by \"pure car\" carriers. Commercial carriers prioritize fuel-efficient engines, hindering military sealift ships' desired higher speeds. Operators face challenges in converting to LNG-fueled engines or installing scrubbers, impacting cargo space and crew licensing. The licensing of engine crews is specific to engine type, leading to a growing disparity in crew skill sets. U.S. shipyards struggle to achieve economies of scale, building only a few oceangoing ships per year with no exports, resulting in gaps between orders for container ships. U.S. shipyards struggle to achieve economies of scale, building only a few oceangoing ships per year with no exports. There may be gaps between orders for container ships, and smaller vessels like tour boats and ferries are rarely built for export. The government-owned sealift fleet, including boats, ferries, tugs, barges, and offshore supply vessels, is aging and in need of repair. There is a lack of large dry docks to service the fleet, leading to delays in readiness to sail. Some ships in the reserve fleet have failed safety inspections and are not seaworthy, with plans to recapitalize by building new vessels in domestic shipyards. The Navy's plan to recapitalize the reserve fleet includes building new vessels in domestic shipyards, repairing ships in the current fleet to extend their service life, and purchasing used, foreign-built ships. Repairing the vessels has been more expensive and time-consuming than projected, leading to consideration of accelerating the purchase of foreign-built ships. The Tariff Act of 1930 supports U.S. shipyards by imposing a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards. The Tariff Act of 1930 imposes a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards, which is still cost-effective for U.S.-flag international trading ships in 2018."
