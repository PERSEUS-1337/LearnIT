    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for regulatory activities. Congress has authorized fee collection since 1954 to partially cover costs, with additional annual appropriations funding the majority of expenses. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework to partially cover EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. It modified provisions from 1988 to accelerate EPA's review of pesticide registrations and defray costs for new registrations and tolerances. PRIA 1 authorized the collection of registration service fees to cover EPA's costs for reviewing pesticide applications. PRIA 2 expanded the fee framework, added new application categories, revised decision timeframes, and adjusted fee amounts. The pesticide fee framework was expanded and amended by PRIA 2 and PRIA 3, with changes to application categories, decision timeframes, and fee amounts. PRIA 3 reauthorized and further amended the framework, setting annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant and establishing a cap on the aggregate amount of maintenance fees that EPA may collect annually. The authority to collect pesticide maintenance fees expires on September 30, 2018, as per the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. FIFRA Section 4, amended by PRIA 3, sets annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant based on registrations held. EPA can cancel registrations if fees are not paid. \"Small businesses\" get fee reductions, and certain public health pesticides are exempt from fees. Collected fees go to the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" for EPA costs. The U.S. Treasury provides receipts to EPA for offsetting costs related to evaluating inert ingredients, expedited processing of applications, and reevaluating pesticides. EPA is required to use funds to enhance information systems capabilities. EPA's authority to collect registration service fees will phase out starting at the end of FY2018, with a potential 70% reduction in fees for FY2019 if not extended or reauthorized. The authority to collect registration service fees will phase out starting at the end of FY2018. If not extended, EPA may see a 70% reduction in fees for FY2019, leading to the expiration of the authority at the end of FY2019. FIFRA Section 33, amended by PRIA 3, sets fee amounts for various actions requested by applicants, with specified timeframes for completion. Small business fee reductions and exemptions for \"minor uses\" are also provided. EPA may adjust the fee schedule and timeframes as needed. Section 33 of FIFRA provides fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for \"minor uses\" of pesticides. EPA is prohibited from assessing fees if appropriations for certain functions are below a specified amount. The authority to collect registration service fees will phase out by the end of FY2018. For FY2013 through FY2018, EPA can assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. Collected fees are deposited in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" and subject to annual appropriations. Fee receipts can be used by EPA without fiscal year limitation once appropriated by Congress. The \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" allows EPA to use fee receipts for various purposes without fiscal year limitation, including application review, worker protection activities, partnership grants, and pesticide safety education. The fund is subject to annual appropriations and requires annual audits by the Inspector General. The Inspector General of EPA audits the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund and Pesticide Registration Fund annually. FIFRA requires EPA to report on pesticide program activities. Congress appropriated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018. The exact amount for the EPA Office of Pesticide Programs is not specified in the appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorizes EPA to assess registration service fees for pesticide programs. Collected fees provide a significant portion of the total appropriation for EPA's pesticide program activities. Congress initiated efforts to reauthorize fee collection in 2017 but did not enact legislation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorizes EPA to assess registration service fees for pesticide programs, providing a significant portion of the total appropriation. Congress initiated efforts to reauthorize fee collection in 2017, with separate versions of reauthorization legislation passed by the House and Senate awaiting resolution of differences. Both versions of the legislation would reauthorize fee collection through FY2023 and FY2025. The Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1029, the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018, reauthorizing fee collection through FY2023 and FY2025. Changes include increasing maintenance fees cap and directing EPA to allocate funds for expedited rulemaking and compliance monitoring. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 requires EPA to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021, related to agricultural worker protection standards. EPA must allocate funds for enhancing compliance monitoring and revise registration service fees for different actions. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 requires EPA to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021, related to agricultural worker protection standards. One rule amended elements of the existing standard, while the other revised standards for certified pesticide applicators to protect applicators, the public, and the environment from risks associated with restricted use pesticides. Additionally, the amendment directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report on the use of designated representatives by October 1, 2021. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 requires EPA to implement final rules related to agricultural worker protection standards by October 1, 2021. It also directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report on the use of designated representatives and their impact on pesticide application information and worker safety. The House requested a conference with the Senate to resolve differences in the versions of H.R. 2. The House requested a conference with the Senate on July 18, 2018, to resolve differences in the versions of H.R. 2, the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018. The PRIA reauthorization has not been finalized due to disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of certain FIFRA regulations."
