Every State spends money on common activities like health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. Some States are more effective than others in utilizing Federal taxpayer dollars. Taxpayers, legislators, and agencies should be able to objectively compare performance measurements to identify government activities and costs. Activity-based total accountability will show which States are most effective with taxpayer dollars, leading to competition. States demonstrating efficiency with lower activity costs will serve as models for accountability in spending tax dollars. The purpose of this Act is to improve government accountability at the State level by requiring annual accountings in a format that includes unit-cost data. States demonstrating efficiency with lower activity costs will serve as models for accountability in spending tax dollars.
