    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\". The purpose of the Act is to provide findings and guidelines for the implementation of nanotechnology in schools. Congress makes findings regarding the benefits of nanotechnology, emphasizing its potential impact on society, security, economy, and health of Americans. The United States must maintain leadership in nanotechnology to maximize its benefits. Foreign students on temporary visas play a significant role in the field. According to the National Science Foundation, foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the United States in 2003. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the US must invest in educating its own students for research and development in the field. The purpose of this Act is to strengthen the capacity of US secondary schools and higher education institutions to prepare students for careers in nanotechnology by providing grants for necessary tools and training. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, an \"eligible institution\" refers to a public or charter secondary school offering advanced placement or international baccalaureate science courses, a community college, or a 4-year institution of higher education. The terms \"institution of higher education\", \"secondary school\", and \"Secretary\" have specific meanings. The term \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" refers to equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the United States with at least 50% domestic materials. The program authorized under Section 4 focuses on qualified nanotechnology equipment for teaching purposes, with specific requirements for domestic manufacturing. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to enhance teaching capacity. Grants up to $150,000 will be awarded to eligible institutions for acquiring equipment and software, and providing educational services for students and faculty. The nanotechnology in schools program aims to enhance teaching capacity by providing educational services, faculty development, and teacher education in nanotechnology. Not more than 1/4 of the grant funds can be used for software and certification. The nanotechnology in schools program limits the use of grant funds for software, educational services, and teacher education. Grants to community colleges or higher education institutions are restricted to undergraduate programs. Eligible institutions must submit applications for grants to the Director within specified guidelines. Eligible institutions must submit grant applications to the Director within specified guidelines. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting applications within 180 days of the Act's enactment and will prioritize geographically diverse locations and historically Black entities. The Director will prioritize geographically diverse locations, historically Black colleges and universities, minority institutions, and institutions in EPSCoR states when selecting eligible entities for grants. The EPSCoR program requires eligible institutions to provide non-Federal contributions amounting to 1/4 of the grant awarded, either directly or through donations. The Director has the authority to waive this matching requirement in certain cases. The EPSCoR program mandates eligible institutions to match 1/4 of the grant amount. The Director can waive this requirement for institutions with low endowments. Branches receiving grants over $100,000 cannot apply for another grant for 2 years. If an eligible institution other than a branch receives a grant exceeding $100,000 under this Act, they cannot apply for another grant until 2 years after receiving the initial grant. Annual report and evaluation required. Each institution receiving a grant must submit a report on grant fund usage within 1 year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year. The evaluation will assess the impact of the grants on students, faculty, and staff. A report to Congress must be made within 6 months after evaluation. The Director will assess the impact of grants on students, faculty, and staff of institutions. A report to Congress with recommendations must be submitted within 6 months after evaluation. Authorization of appropriations for the Director to carry out the Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
