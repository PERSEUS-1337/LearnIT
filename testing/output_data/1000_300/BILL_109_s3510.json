    "content": "The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to authorize $9,839,262,000 for fiscal year 2007, with $50,000,000 allocated for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes funding for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences (PALS) to enhance access to laboratory science. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes grants for high-need local educational agencies to establish partnerships for access to laboratory science, improving laboratories and providing instrumentation to enhance math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants are awarded on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes grants for high-need local educational agencies to establish partnerships with institutions of higher education, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal share of the cost of activities should not exceed 33 percent. The Federal share of the cost of activities under the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 grants for high-need local educational agencies should not exceed 33 percent. Eligible agencies can receive grants for 3 fiscal years by submitting a plan developed with experts in science education. The program under this section requires a plan developed with experts in science education to describe how laboratory improvements align with academic standards and enhance STEM instruction. The curr_chunk describes the requirements for mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction in laboratory experiences, including clear learning outcomes, integration with classroom instruction, student reflection, and teacher training. It also includes assurances of safety compliance with State or local ordinances. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for teacher training, safety compliance, maintenance of laboratory facilities, and assessment methods for expanding research literature on the impact of laboratory science on student understanding and achievement. Grants awarded under this section are to supplement, not supplant existing funds. The curr_chunk discusses the use of funds for grants awarded under this section to improve secondary science education by enhancing laboratories and providing instrumentation. The activities should align with State academic standards for mathematics and science. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing secondary science education through laboratory improvement, equipment acquisition, facility maintenance, teacher training, and professional development in alignment with State academic standards for mathematics and science. The curr_chunk focuses on funding for scientific educational materials, laboratory facilities maintenance and improvement, teacher training, curriculum development, safety training, and hands-on laboratory experiences to engage students in science and engineering. The curr_chunk focuses on hands-on laboratory experiences to engage individuals in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology, as well as developing tools to evaluate funded activities. The Director may determine additional activities to achieve the goals of the subsection. Grants cannot be used for new facility construction. High-need educational agencies must submit an application detailing partnerships and implementation roles. The application for grants must include a description of the partnership, roles of each member, the plan, and activities aligned with academic standards and research. The application for grants must include a description of activities in mathematics and science based on research, aimed at improving student performance and strengthening instruction quality. Activities should also target individuals in underrepresented groups in STEM fields to prepare them for future opportunities. The application for grants must include a description of activities in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to prepare individuals for postsecondary studies in these fields. It should also outline how changes in student achievement will be assessed, how the partnership will assess success, and how programmatic assessments will be shared with the research community. The Director will evaluate applications based on these criteria. The Director will review applications for grants based on the partnership's ability to effectively carry out proposed programs, use relevant research and best practices to increase student achievement, align activities with State academic standards, and demonstrate widely implementable activities. The Director will evaluate the program based on its alignment with State academic standards, potential for widespread implementation, and encouragement of interest in STEM fields among underrepresented individuals. The Director will evaluate the program based on alignment with State academic standards, potential for widespread implementation, and encouragement of interest in STEM fields among underrepresented individuals. The evaluation will use benchmarks and assessment tools to identify best practices and materials developed by partnerships, comparing their effectiveness with other agencies. The results will be disseminated by the Director. The Director will disseminate evaluation results to the public and relevant committees, as well as make effective program materials widely available. The Director will disseminate effective program materials developed under the program to the public. Additionally, the Director will provide technical assistance to high-need local educational agencies in meeting program requirements, including guidance on grant applications and activities. An annual meeting will be convened by the Director in collaboration with the Secretary of Education. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, will convene an annual meeting of high-need local educational agencies receiving grants under this section to promote national collaboration. Additionally, an annual report will be provided to relevant congressional committees detailing the coordination of the program authorized in this section. The annual report will describe how the program authorized under this section is coordinated with the program authorized under part B of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Definitions include a high-need local educational agency eligible for grants under the Rural and Low-Income School Program. The term 'high-need local educational agency' refers to an agency eligible for grants under the Rural and Low-Income School Program. The term 'National Laboratory' is defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005."
