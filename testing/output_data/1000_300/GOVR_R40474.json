    "content": "This report examines recent laws and congressional proposals regarding gun regulation in the District of Columbia. Key statutes and bills include federal provisions like the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act. Congressional proposals often coincide with discussions on voting rights for the District. The report analyzes congressional proposals to amend the District of Columbia's gun laws, focusing on Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress. It discusses the differences between the bills and their potential impact on the District's firearms laws, tracing the proposals section by section. Much of the congressional activity on DC firearms laws followed the Supreme Court's rulings. The report examines congressional proposals to amend DC's gun laws, focusing on S. 160 and H.R. 645. It discusses the impact of the proposals following the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which affirmed an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense. The District's Firearms Control Regulation Act had three provisions: (1) barring the registration of handguns, effectively prohibiting their possession; (2) prohibiting carrying a pistol without a license, hindering movement within one's home; and (3) requiring all lawfully owned firearms to be kept unloaded or secured. The Supreme Court's decision did not address the license to carry requirement, leaving room for enforcement if not arbitrary. The DC Council enacted emergency legislation to comply with the Court's ruling. After the Supreme Court's decision in Heller, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to amend the city's gun laws temporarily. This attempt was met with criticism for not fully complying with the Heller decision. In response, H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in Congress to potentially loosen provisions of the District's existing gun laws. H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, aimed to amend DC's gun laws but did not become law. Its content was included in H.R. 6842, which passed in the House but not the Senate. In the 111th Congress, Senator John Ensign introduced an amendment using the language of H.R. 6842, which was approved and became Title II of S. 160. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 (FCAA) and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 (IPAA) were passed by the DC Council and transmitted to Congress for approval. They amended firearms provisions of the DC Code and became effective in March and May 2009. The FCAA and IPAA amended firearms provisions in the DC Code, with new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership. These amendments were challenged but upheld in court. Congressional legislation like H.R. 645 also aims to change DC's gun provisions, taking into account the FCAA and IPAA. H.R. 645 seeks to amend firearms provisions in the DC Code, limiting the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repealing the registration scheme. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards in the US, with states and territories able to supplement them with their own regulations. Federal firearms laws in the United States establish minimum standards for regulations. States, territories, and the District of Columbia can supplement federal statutes with their own laws, as long as they do not contradict the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The District has authority to create its own laws under the Home Rule Act, including regulations on firearms. The Home Rule Act authorizes the DC Council to regulate firearms, allowing them to amend laws passed by Congress. Congress retains the ability to legislate for the District and impose limits on the DC government's authority. The Home Rule Act grants the DC Council the authority to regulate firearms and amend laws passed by Congress. Congress can still legislate for the District and set limits on the DC government's authority, including the right to enact legislation on any subject within or outside the scope of the Council's powers. The Home Rule Act grants the DC Council the authority to regulate firearms, but Congress can set limits on the DC government's authority in this area. Section 3 of H.R. 645 and Title II-S. 160 explicitly limit the District of Columbia's ability to enact laws that restrict private ownership or use of firearms. The District of Columbia is restricted from enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms. The proposed language in H.R. 645 emphasizes that the DC Council cannot create laws related to firearms regulation. It is unclear what would constitute a prohibition or burden on acquiring firearms. The proposed language in H.R. 645 restricts the DC Council from creating laws related to firearms regulation, limiting their ability to impose stricter provisions beyond federal laws. It is unclear what would constitute a prohibition or burden on acquiring firearms. District firearms laws in the District of Columbia would mirror federal firearms laws, limiting the District's ability to impose stricter regulations. It is unclear what would violate the prohibition against discouraging private firearm ownership. The proposed language also limits the District's authority to enforce sanctions for criminal firearm misuse. Additionally, the District could regulate the carrying of firearms, except at a person's dwelling place, place of business, or on their own land. The District of Columbia could regulate the carrying of firearms, but may not have the authority to prohibit individuals from carrying firearms altogether, except at specific locations. The language in H.R. 645 differs from Title II- S. 160 in terms of the scope of regulation allowed. The District of Columbia may regulate the carrying of firearms but may not have the authority to ban individuals from carrying firearms altogether, except at specific locations. Prior to Heller, the DC Code's definition of \"machine gun\" included any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading, leading to restrictions on registering pistols. The District of Columbia amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with the federal definition, which includes any weapon capable of shooting more than one shot automatically without manual reloading. This change allows for the registration of semiautomatic firearms. The District of Columbia amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with the federal definition, allowing for the registration of semiautomatic firearms. If H.R. 645 is enacted, the definition of \"machine gun\" would revert to its pre-Heller state, continuing to conform with federal law. The District of Columbia amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with federal law, allowing for the registration of semiautomatic firearms. H.R. 645 would continue this alignment by conforming the definition of \"machine gun\" to the federal definition. The pre-Heller provisions in DC prohibited registration of certain firearms, including machine guns and pistols post-1976. However, the FCAA now allows for the registration of pistols for self-defense, including semiautomatic handguns, as long as the applicant meets other requirements. Additionally, there is an exemption from the registration requirement for those temporarily possessing a firearm registered to another person while in the home of the registrant. The FCAA allows for the registration of semiautomatic handguns in DC, with exemptions for temporary possession in the home for self-defense. Certain qualifications and restrictions apply, such as prohibiting registration for those with recent criminal offenses or DUI violations. Applicants for firearm registration in DC must meet certain qualifications and restrictions, including a prohibition for those with a history of violent behavior or protective orders against them. Additionally, applicants must complete a firearms training course and have their registered pistol undergo a ballistics identification procedure. The proposed H.R. 645 in DC would expand the firearms competency test and eliminate the registration requirement for firearms. The Chief of Police must conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols and limit registrations to one per person every 30 days, except for new residents with legally owned pistols from another jurisdiction. This change would remove the need for firearm registration in DC. H.R. 645 in DC would repeal the registration requirement for firearms, allowing residents to purchase firearms without the need for a registration certificate or licensing. The Chief of Police would no longer be required to conduct ballistics testing on pistols or limit registrations to one per month. This change would eliminate all registration language and restrictions on handgun purchases. H.R. 645 in DC would amend DC Code to allow the purchase of handguns without registration or licensing. It would also remove restrictions on ammunition sales, allowing transfers to any person, including DC residents, and eliminating the need for dealers to track ammunition inventory. H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 propose amendments for interstate purchase of firearms. Title II- S. 160 would allow federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to DC residents. H.R. 645 would amend the DC Code to facilitate interstate firearms transfers. H.R. 645 proposes amending the DC Code to allow federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to DC residents, bypassing federal law restrictions. This would require compliance with both DC and jurisdictional laws for the sale and delivery of handguns. The GCA requires licensed dealers to sell handguns with secure storage or safety devices, but there is no federal requirement on how firearms should be stored. The District's trigger lock requirement was declared unconstitutional and amended under the FCAA to allow firearms in lawful possession to be stored securely. Under the FCAA, any firearm in lawful possession must be unloaded, disassembled, or secured by a trigger lock. It is prohibited to store a loaded firearm where a minor could access it without permission, unless it is securely locked or carried on the person. Violation of firearm storage laws is addressed in the FCAA. Title II- S. 160 of the FCAA would repeal firearm storage responsibilities, while Section 7 of H.R. 645 would create penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury. The legislation imposes penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury, with exceptions for securely stored firearms or those secured with trigger locks. Penalties include a fine up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment up to one year. The legislation imposes penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury, with exceptions for securely stored firearms or those secured with trigger locks. Penalties include a fine up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment up to one year. Exceptions include situations where the firearm is secured by a trigger lock, stored on the person's body, accessed unlawfully, used in self-defense, used for hunting or target shooting under supervision, or in possession of a law enforcement officer on duty. If the victim is the child of the violator, prosecution is limited unless gross negligence is involved. The legislation imposes penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury, with exceptions for securely stored firearms or those secured with trigger locks. Penalties include fines and imprisonment. A person convicted a second time for unregistered possession of a firearm in certain areas faces increased penalties. H.R. 645 would amend the DC Code to remove criminal penalties for intentional sale. H.R. 645 would remove criminal penalties for intentional sale of firearms to minors under 18, harmonizing definitions between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. Section 9 of H.R. 645 harmonizes definitions between Titles 7 and 22 for terms like \"firearm\" and \"shotgun.\" It allows DC to restrict firearm possession on its property and permits property owners to do the same, except for law enforcement. Section 10 addresses property owners' rights to restrict firearms on their premises. Section 10 of H.R. 645 allows private property owners in DC to prohibit or restrict firearms on their premises. This includes landlords of businesses or residential properties. The District also has the authority to restrict firearms on public property, such as buildings under its control with security measures in place. The District of Columbia may prohibit or restrict firearms in buildings or structures under its control with security measures, but it is unclear if this applies to all property under its control. The proposed language is narrower than current law, which allows regulation over all property under its control. The proposed language in the District of Columbia may limit the regulation of firearms to buildings and structures under its control, raising questions about its authority over other property. It is unclear if the District can regulate firearms in buildings without security measures. The District of Columbia is considering limiting firearm regulation to buildings under its control, raising questions about its authority over other property. H.R. 645 would repeal the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses, allowing for discretion in issuing them. The bill also maintains the prohibition on carrying rifles or shotguns in the District, except as permitted by law. H.R. 645 would repeal the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses, allowing for discretion in issuing them. The District currently permits carrying firearms within specific locations for lawful purposes, with states also having the ability to impose their own laws on carrying firearms. H.R. 645 would modify the provision for carrying firearms without a license in specific circumstances, such as within one's home or place of business, for lawful recreational purposes, or while being transported in accordance with the law. H.R. 645 would allow individuals to carry firearms without a license in specific circumstances, including in their dwelling house, place of business, on land owned by them, or while engaged in lawful recreational activities. The bill would also permit the lawful transportation of firearms as authorized by District or federal law. H.R. 645 allows individuals to transport firearms for lawful purposes, following specific guidelines. Firearms must be unloaded and secured during transportation, whether by vehicle or not. The bill aligns with existing provisions for the lawful transportation of firearms. H.R. 645 allows for the transportation of firearms for lawful purposes, requiring them to be unloaded, locked, and separate from ammunition. The bill also includes toy and antique pistols in the types of firearms prohibited from being used in violent crimes. Additionally, it grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases related to firearms dealer licenses. The Office of Administrative Hearings was granted jurisdiction over firearm registration certificate denials or revocations, but this may no longer be necessary due to the repeal of the registration scheme under H.R. 645. Provisions in the DC Code related to dealer licenses and firearm transfers would be affected by the repeal of the FCAA and IPAA. The DC Code's provisions for dealer licenses and firearm transfers depend on obtaining a registration certificate. Repealing the registration scheme under H.R. 645 would allow anyone not prohibited from possessing a firearm to apply for a dealer's license or transfer firearms. Federal prohibitions are discussed separately. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime, fugitives, drug users, mentally defective individuals, illegal immigrants, and dishonorably discharged persons. Reporting duties for dealers regarding lost or stolen firearms would be eliminated under H.R. 645. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime, fugitives, drug users, mentally defective individuals, illegal immigrants, and dishonorably discharged persons. It is unlawful for both licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell or transfer a firearm to individuals falling within specific categories, such as those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence or who have renounced U.S. citizenship. Under the federal GCA, certain individuals are prohibited from possessing firearms. It is illegal for licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell or transfer firearms to those falling within specific categories. Non-licensed individuals in D.C. can only sell or transfer firearms to licensed dealers. H.R. 645 maintains the prohibition on licensed dealers transferring firearms to those ineligible to possess them. Under H.R. 645, private firearm sales between non-licensed individuals in D.C. must go through a licensed dealer. The bill removes registration requirements from the DC Code, making only federal disqualifications applicable for transfers. Additionally, the assault weapons ban under the FCAA would be impacted by H.R. 645, redefining \"assault weapon\" to include specific firearms and characteristics. The definition of \"assault weapon\" under the FCAA includes specific rifles, shotguns, and pistols with military-type characteristics. The Chief can designate any firearm as an assault weapon if it poses a similar threat. Antique firearms and certain Olympic target pistols are excluded from this definition. The new definition applies to the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990. The FCAA defines assault weapons as specific firearms with military characteristics, excluding antique firearms and Olympic target pistols. Manufacturers, importers, or dealers of assault weapons can be held liable for damages in DC. The FCAA also prohibits possession, sale, or transfer of large capacity ammunition feeding devices. The FCAA in DC prohibits possession, sale, or transfer of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, defined as devices capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This provision would be repealed by Section 14 of H.R. 645. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers must conduct background checks before transferring firearms to non-licensed individuals. The dealer can proceed with the transfer if approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) or after three business days if no response is received. Non-licensed individuals are not required to perform background checks. The DC Code imposes a 48-hour waiting period for pistol or handgun transfers, but under the IPAA, the waiting period for all firearms is now 10 days. The IPAA broadens the definition of firearm to include all weapons that expel projectiles by explosive action. Title II- S. 160 would not have changed the waiting period. The IPAA extends the waiting period for all firearms to 10 days, not just pistols. If repealed, the waiting period for handguns would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA introduces new provisions for microstamping on semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011. The FCAA introduces new provisions for microstamping on semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011, requiring licensees not to sell pistols that are not microstamp-ready as of that date. It also establishes requirements for determining microstamp-readiness and prohibits the sale of pistols not on the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale. New Section 504 prohibits the sale, transfer, or possession of pistols not on the California Roster in DC after January 1, 2009. Residents can only sell or transfer such pistols through licensed firearms dealers. The Chief must review the roster annually for updates. The FCAA requires the Chief to review the California Roster annually for changes and allows for revisions to the roster of handguns deemed not unsafe. The IPAA prohibits firearm discharge without a special permit from the Chief, except for self-defense. It also allows the District to restrict firearms possession on its property and private property within the District, except for law enforcement. These provisions would be repealed if H.R. 645 became law."
