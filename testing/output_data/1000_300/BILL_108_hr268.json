The United States Weather Research Program, established under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, improving weather forecasts, quick progress in impactful areas, and setting goals through collaborative efforts. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on setting goals through collaborative efforts and making research grants to universities and research institutions. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on setting goals through collaborative efforts and making research grants to universities and research institutions. SEC. 3. PROGRAM RESEARCH PRIORITIES. The United States Weather Research Program's research priorities include improving hurricane forecasts for landfall location and strength, enhancing predictions for heavy precipitation events like winter storms and rain storms, improving flood forecasting by integrating precipitation forecasts with hydrologic prediction, and enhancing short to medium range numerical weather predictions for high-impact weather events. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on improving hurricane forecasts, enhancing predictions for heavy precipitation events, integrating precipitation forecasts with hydrologic prediction for flood forecasting, and improving short to medium range numerical weather predictions for high-impact weather events. Additionally, they also study societal and economic impacts of adverse weather and ways to improve weather communications. The United States Weather Research Program aims to improve weather communications, assess social and economic impacts of adverse weather, evaluate useful weather information for decision makers, and conduct research to connect weather research with human condition improvement. They also test research concepts at test bed centers to facilitate technology transfer to operational meteorologists. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the US Weather Research Program and collaborates with other federal agencies and entities to develop a five-year plan for weather research, including partnerships with universities, identifying needs for weather information, dissemination methods, and transferring research results to forecasting operations. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide annual reports to the House Committee on Science and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The reports should include the latest five-year plan, funding details, any plan changes, and an assessment of plan objectives.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2004-2006, with a minimum of 50% allocated for grants to higher education institutions. For fiscal year 2006, $16,000,000 is allocated for grants to higher education institutions, with at least 50% designated for competitive, merit-reviewed grants."
