    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations, affects approximately 1,500,000 individuals in the United States. This blood vessel disease is characterized by vascular lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which may go undetected until serious symptoms such as neurological deficits, seizures, stroke, or sudden death occur. Detection of these lesions requires costly medical imaging techniques. Limited research exists on cavernous angioma. Individuals diagnosed with cavernous angioma may experience neurological deficits, seizure, stroke, or sudden death. Limited research exists on cavernous angioma, leading to a lack of treatment options other than brain and spinal surgery. Some patients are not eligible for surgery, and there is a shortage of physicians familiar with the condition, making timely diagnosis and appropriate care challenging. The \"common Hispanic mutation\" has been identified as a specific disease-causing mutation in some affected individuals. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world due to a specific disease-causing mutation. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, highlights the critical need for increased research, awareness, and education on cerebral cavernous malformations. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, emphasizes the importance of increasing research, awareness, and education on cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research through extramural centers of excellence to translate scientific discoveries into clinical applications. There is a need for a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care and Advocacy to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma in New Mexico and the United States. To address the public health threat of cavernous angioma, a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is needed at the University of New Mexico to develop a cure and enhance medical care nationwide. SEC. 409K. CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE. The Director of NIH will establish a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico to conduct research and provide support for individuals with cavernous angioma. The center will consist of researchers, clinicians, and medical staff, including a medical director with expertise in cavernous angioma research and clinical care. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence shall consist of a team including a medical director, headache or pain specialist, epilepsy specialist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, dermatologist, nurse practitioner, nurse coordinator, research coordinator, clinical nurse, and radiology specialist. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence team includes a research coordinator, clinical nurse, radiology specialist, clinical vascular fellow, basic science postdoctoral fellow, and genetic counselor. The center must be affiliated with a university medical center providing education and training in neurological disease, and maintain a program for postdoctoral fellows in cavernous angioma research. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence offers education and training in diagnosis and treatment, research training for postdoctoral fellows, recruitment of new researchers and clinicians, continuing medical education for clinicians, and patient advocacy programs including public awareness campaigns and education materials distribution. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence focuses on patient outreach and education through various initiatives such as launching public awareness campaigns, distributing education materials, providing training for school nurses, organizing educational conferences, and developing electronic health tools. They also aim to establish communication with other major cavernous angioma research centers. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center aims to establish communication with other research institutions, facilitate translational projects, and establish an advisory board composed of individuals with relevant expertise. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center is led by a Director with expertise in patient care and research. The Director ensures high-quality medical and surgical care for individuals with cavernous angioma. The advisory board includes representatives from patient advocacy groups, physicians, scientists, and affiliated institutions. The Director of the CARE Center ensures community-, family-, and patient-centered care for individuals with cavernous angioma, encourages participation in research studies, and develops the center as a model for other facilities in the United States. Reporting is required within 2 years. The advisory board of the CARE Center must submit biannual reports to the Secretary, detailing progress, expenditures, and outcomes of the center's activities. The CARE Center advisory board must submit biannual reports to the Secretary, including progress, expenditures, and outcomes. Authorization of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2011 is allocated for the center's establishment and operation."
