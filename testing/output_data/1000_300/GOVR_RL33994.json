President Jose Ramos-Horta requested the UN to stay for five more years in May 2008 due to ongoing security concerns. In 2008-2009, many displaced civilians returned home after civil disturbances. A failed assassination attempt on President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao in 2008 was orchestrated by mutineer Alfredo Reinado, who led a group of former soldiers. Reinado was killed, and his successor surrendered in April 2008. The security situation in Timor-Leste has improved, but concerns remain about implementing security reforms following the 2006 mutiny by security forces.

A joint Indonesian-East Timorese Truth Commission blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999, with President Yudhoyono expressing regret. President Ramos-Horta urged Timor to address the underlying causes of the mutiny. In 2006, a joint Indonesian-East Timorese Truth Commission blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999. President Yudhoyono expressed regret over human rights violations. President Ramos-Horta urged Timor to move on from the past. Concerns arose over government plans to withdraw funds from Timor's Petroleum Fund in 2009. Timor seeks economic benefit from gas reserves in the Timor Sea, but faces challenges due to political instability and geography. China's involvement in Timor-Leste increased in 2009, offering assistance with construction and selling power plants and patrol boats. In 2009, China increased its involvement in Timor-Leste by providing assistance with construction and offering to sell power plants and patrol boats. The government of East Timor created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007 to address housing, community trust-building, security, social protection, and local socio-economic development. By June 2009, the last of the IDP camps was being closed, with support needed to complete decommissioning and provide for returning persons. The Portuguese asserted control over East Timor in the 1640s, lasting until 1975 when Fretilin declared independence. Indonesia invaded in 1975, leading to a period of occupation. A referendum in 1999 saw 78% of voters opting for independence. Support is needed through 2009 to complete decommissioning of IDP camps. In August 1999, a referendum in East Timor, supervised by the United Nations, resulted in 78% of voters choosing independence from Indonesia. This led to violent retaliation by pro-integration militias, causing over 1,300 deaths and displacing hundreds of thousands. International Force East Timor (INTERFET) was deployed to restore order. In 1999, militias destroyed most schools and medical facilities in East Timor. To restore order, the U.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission INTERFET was deployed under Australian command. Australia has played a leading role in U.N. operations and bilateral relations with East Timor since then. Jose Ramos-Horta, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, became president after Mari Alkatiri's resignation in 2006. Former President Xanana Gusmao, a key figure in Timor-Leste's history, was a civil servant under Portuguese rule before leading the resistance against Indonesian occupation. Captured in 1992, he was released in 1999 and became Timor-Leste's first president in 2002. Gusmao currently serves as the Prime Minister. Former President Xanana Gusmao of Timor-Leste was captured by Indonesian forces in 1992 and sentenced to life in prison. He was released in 1999 and became the country's first president in 2002. Gusmao later stepped down from the presidency to become the prime minister in 2007 after forming a coalition with smaller parties. He survived an assassination attempt in 2008 by Reinado forces, a group that caused insecurity in 2006. Mari Alkatiri, a former prime minister, resigned in 2006 amid unrest but remains Secretary General of Fretilin with significant support. Alkatiri, like Ramos-Horta, fled abroad during the Indonesian invasion in 1975 and is one of the few Muslims in Timor-Leste. Former Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri of Timor-Leste, a Muslim minority, has a hostile relationship with Xanana Gusmao. Fretilin, led by Alkatiri, opposes Gusmao's use of petroleum reserves to cover budget deficits. The country has a unicameral parliament elected in 2007, following independence in 2002 under UN administration. In 2001, a constitution was drafted for East Timor under UN administration, becoming independent in 2002. The constitution established a parliamentary government with a symbolic President. The 2007 election led to a coalition government led by Xanana Gusmao of the Alliance of the Parliamentary Majority. The coalition government in East Timor, led by Xanana Gusmao since August 6, 2007, faces challenges with inexperienced members, limited education, and language barriers. The main opposition party is Fretilin. Parliamentary committees struggle to oversee the executive branch due to lack of staff and resources. The business of parliament in East Timor is hindered by Members using legal languages Tetum and Portuguese. Committees try to oversee the executive branch but lack staff and resources. Presidential and parliamentary elections were held in 2007, leading to the election of Ramos-Horta as president and Gusmao as prime minister. Fretilin party won the most seats but did not have a majority, causing protests. Prior to the 2007 elections, East Timor held an election in 2001 to draft a new Constitution. In 2006, events led to the deterioration of East Timor's internal security, prompting the deployment of foreign peacekeepers. Gusmao won the 2002 Presidential election with high voter turnout. The 2001 election aimed to draft a new Constitution for the country. In 2006, foreign peacekeepers were reintroduced to East Timor from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia at the invitation of the East Timorese government. The Australian military contingent was the largest with 1,100 troops. UN Security Council Resolution 1704 established the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) with a civilian component, up to 1,608 police personnel, and up to 34 military officers to support stability, democratic governance, and national reconciliation. The source of the 2006 strife can be traced to divisions within the Fretilin party. The 2006 strife in East Timor stemmed from divisions within the dominant Fretilin party, dating back to their struggle against the Indonesians. This led to splits within the military and police forces, with many military recruits being Xanana Gusmao loyalists. The allegiance to Gusmao also contributed to the creation of paramilitary units within the police force. The recruitment process in East Timor led to tensions between the military and police, with many recruits being Xanana loyalists. The dismissal of 591 military members by former Prime Minister Alkatiri in 2006 triggered political turmoil due to protests over conditions and discrimination. Personal and institutional tensions, politicization of the police, and a lack of regulatory framework exacerbated the situation. The dismissal of 591 military members by former Prime Minister Alkatiri in 2006 triggered political turmoil in East Timor, leading to rioting, looting, and a mass exodus of eastern East Timorese from the capital. Alkatiri stepped down in June as a result of the unrest. The protesting troops in East Timor led to rioting, looting, deaths, and a mass exodus of East Timorese from the capital in April 2006. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri stepped down in June. He was accused of forming \"hit squads,\" which he denied. Interior Minister Lobato was sentenced to seven years for authorizing weapons transfer. Major Alfredo Reinado was a leader in the violent protests of March 2006. Major Alfredo Reinado, a leader in the violent protests of March 2006 in East Timor, escaped from prison in August 2006. Despite Australian forces failing to capture him on March 11, 2007, the East Timor government ordered an operation to apprehend him after he persuaded a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles on February 25, 2007. Reinado had attracted support among young men resentful of the foreign military presence in East Timor. Reinado, a key figure in the violent protests of March 2006 in East Timor, escaped from prison and attracted support among young men resentful of foreign military presence. Gang violence, fueled by high unemployment rates, swept through Dili, leading to deaths, displacement of residents, and property destruction. The instability in East Timor escalated after police and military clashes in May 2006. The displacement of Dili residents, widespread property destruction, and positive view of Reinado by gangs. UN reports instability in East Timor since April 2006, affecting livelihoods. 100,000 remain displaced by February 2007, facing water access and disease risks. Access to potable water and disease risks due to poor sanitation were significant issues for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps and beyond, with many camps also facing the threat of flooding. These challenges were exacerbated by the overall context in East Timor, where over 40% of the population lived below the poverty line, leading to high child mortality rates from lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition. Rice shortages, food price increases, deteriorating social structures, and limited access to healthcare and education further strained the community's ability to respond to natural disasters like floods and landslides. Distribution of essential supplies and projects focused on IDPs, but the needs were widespread throughout the country. During natural disasters in East Timor, distribution of essentials and projects focused on IDPs were significant. Transitioning from humanitarian programs to development activities remains a challenge due to extreme poverty levels. Funding increased during times of insecurity and displacement, with the UN providing emergency assistance. Security incidents in 2007 led to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement. In 2006, the UNOCHA generated a Flash Appeal that received nearly $40 million in contributions. Security incidents in early 2007 led to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement, impacting access and safety for displaced individuals and aid organizations. Concerns about displacement due to civil unrest prompted contingency planning by the NDMO and MTRC. The international humanitarian aid community, including the UN, NGOs, and donor governments, was involved in providing assistance. In April 2008, IDPs willing to return received recovery and reintegration packages, with the government decommissioning some IDP camps. The Ministry of Social Solidarity oversaw the returns process with help from international organizations like the International Organization for Migration. By November 2008, around 10,400 families had returned and 21 camps had closed. Social Solidarity (MSS) and international organizations like the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have been managing the returns process. By November 2008, around 10,400 families had received recovery packages and returned, leading to the closure of approximately 21 camps. However, returning IDPs still face challenges such as limited access to food, water, and basic services, along with increasing food prices and shortages. Land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence in home villages also hinder the sustainability of returns and reintegration efforts for IDPs. The sustainability of returns for IDPs in East Timor has been impacted by land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence in home villages. Despite no major incidents of violence during recent returns, challenges remain in reintegration efforts. The U.N. Representative on Human Rights for IDPs emphasized the need for sustainable returns and durable solutions in December 2008. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ended its formal mission in the same month. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) ended its formal mission in East Timor. A new U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) was established by the U.N. Security Council to assist with security, political, and humanitarian issues, including support for electoral processes. Cooperation with the International Security Force (ISF) was highlighted in the Secretary General's report. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate of UNMIT in East Timor multiple times, with temporary police reinforcement approved for national elections. Challenges remain in reintegration of IDPs, poverty, underdevelopment, and high unemployment in a fragile political and judicial environment. East Timor, under Resolution 1867 (2009), has shown relative stability since 2006, but challenges persist such as reintegration of IDPs, poverty, underdevelopment, and high unemployment. The Secretary General's report highlighted the need for long-term commitment from the international community to achieve stability, development, and democratic governance. Key areas of focus include political developments, support for dialogue and reconciliation, and follow-up on the electoral process. The Secretary General's report outlined three main areas of focus: Political Developments Since August 2006, Restoration and Maintenance of Public Security, and Support for the 'Compact'. Key activities included support for dialogue and reconciliation, electoral process, promotion of human rights, and administration of justice. The report also emphasized the need for increasing dialogue and reconciliation, improving democratic governance, maintaining public security, and strengthening security institutions.

The Security Council authorized the establishment of INTERFET, a multinational force, in September 1999 to assist East Timor's transition to independence. UNTAET was established in October 1999 to provide peacekeeping operations and aid in governance and reconstruction efforts. In February 2000, military operations in INTERFET were integrated with UNTAET, which aimed to assist East Timor in recovering from violence, establishing a government, and aiding refugees in West Timor. U.N. humanitarian workers were killed in September 2000, leading to a temporary suspension of activities. UNMISET succeeded UNTAET in May 2002, with subsequent extensions until May 2005. UNOTIL was established in April 2005. The United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) was established in April 2005 as a special political mission to support state institutions, strengthen democratic governance, and develop a national police force.

Security Council in January 2006, Sukehiro Hasegawa, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, outlined the progress made by UNOTIL in building state institutions, training national judges, developing finance expertise, and promoting democratic governance and human rights. Concerns about progress were also raised. Hasegawa raised concerns about weaknesses in capacity building in justice and finance sectors, pending civil and criminal cases, human rights activities needing supervision, and additional training required for the Border Patrol Unit. Despite progress, challenges remain. Issues over accountability for crimes in East Timor in 1999, additional training needed for the Border Patrol Unit to minimize incidents. Mr. Hasegawa described the situation as \"fragile\" and emphasized the importance of stability for the 2007 elections. UNOTIL's mandate was extended multiple times due to escalating violence in 2006.

Australia has 650 soldiers operating alongside 150 troops from New Zealand as part of the International Stabilization Force (ISF). Australian troops have been actively involved in Timor for many years. Australia has strategic interests in Timor, providing security through the ISF and having economic interests in hydrocarbon resources. They recognized Indonesian control of Timor through the Timor Gap Treaty in 1989. The Timor Sea Treaty between Australia and Timor-Leste in 2003 allowed joint development of hydrocarbon resources despite sovereignty disagreements. Timor-Leste prefers a processing facility in Timor, while Australia supports one in Darwin due to commercial concerns. The greater Sunrise project involves key Australian participants. The commercial concerns favor the use of facilities in Darwin for the greater Sunrise project in the Timor Sea. Key participants include Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Osaka Gas. Timor-Leste has a historical relationship with Portugal and receives foreign assistance from them. Portugal has also provided language teachers and established a cultural center in Dili. Portugal is one of the official languages of Timor-Leste, with approximately 13% of the populace speaking Portuguese. Portugal provides foreign assistance to Timor, including language teachers and a cultural center in Dili. Indonesia invaded Timor-Leste after the Portuguese departed in 1975, leading to a guerilla movement and significant loss of life. Indonesian military-backed militias destroyed Timor's infrastructure and killed additional Timorese after a 1999 referendum for independence. This was seen as a message to other Indonesian provinces with secessionist movements. In 1999, Timorese voted for independence after Indonesian military-backed militias committed atrocities. The Indonesian government has since sought better relations with Timor-Leste. President Ramos-Horta urged acceptance of the past to move forward. A truth commission found Indonesian army involvement in arming militias responsible for crimes. Former General Wiranto, linked to human rights abuses, ran for vice president. China has been increasing its investment in Timor-Leste since 2005 to balance U.S. influence, access hydrocarbon resources, and prevent alignment with Taiwan. This rise in Chinese influence may concern Australian strategic planners. China's increasing influence in Timor-Leste, including high-profile projects and arms sales, raises concerns for Australian strategic planners. Timor supports a One-China policy and seeks to strengthen bilateral relations with China. Plans to purchase power stations from China for $381 million are also in progress. In June 2009, Timor expressed support for a One-China policy and China's support for its ASEAN membership. Criticism arose over plans to purchase oil burning power stations from China for $381 million, as they are deemed unnecessary and polluting. Fretilin opposes the proposal and is preparing a legal challenge. Timor became a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum in July 2005 and is interested in full ASEAN membership. Timor's offshore energy resources could provide financial resources for development and welfare. Timor is interested in joining ASEAN and has extensive offshore energy resources that can help develop the country.

Greater Sunrise holds 300 million barrels of light oil and 2.53 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. Industry prefers Darwin for processing centers due to seabed configuration and infrastructure issues. ConocoPhillips built a new LNG plant near Darwin, while Timor-Leste prefers a plant on its southern coast. The government of Timor-Leste favors locating a liquid natural gas plant on its southern coast as an alternative to facilities in Darwin. The Bayu-Udan field is expected to be depleted by 2023. East Timor has earned between $3.2 billion and $5 billion in energy revenues since 2005, with most placed in a Petroleum Fund. The fund aims to save oil and gas revenues for future generations.
