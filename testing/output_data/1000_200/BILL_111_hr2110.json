    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act\" and limits state withholding and taxation of employee income. The \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act\" limits state income tax to the employee's residence state and the state where they work for more than 30 days in a calendar year. Wages are only subject to state income tax withholding if the employee meets the criteria outlined in the Act. The Act allows employers to rely on an employee's estimate of time spent working in different states for tax purposes, as long as there is no fraud or collusion. Employer records of employee locations for other business purposes do not override the employee's estimate. The Act allows employers to use an employee's estimate of time worked in different states for tax purposes, unless there is fraud or collusion. If an employer has a time and attendance system tracking where duties are performed, that data will be used instead of the employee's estimate. Definitions and special rules apply, such as considering an employee present in a state if the majority of duties are performed there for the day. The Act allows employers to use an employee's estimate of time worked in different states for tax purposes, unless there is fraud or collusion. If an employee performs material employment duties in a resident state and one nonresident state during one day, they will be considered to have performed the preponderance of their employment duties in the nonresident state for that day. The term \"employee\" is defined by the State in which the duties are performed, excluding professional athletes, entertainers, and certain public figures. Transit time does not apply in determining the location of an employee's performance of employment duties. The term \"employee\" is defined by the State where duties are performed, excluding professional athletes, entertainers, and certain public figures. Professional athlete refers to someone paid for services in a professional athletic event, while professional entertainer is paid for services in the performing arts. Certain public figures are also excluded from the definition of \"employee.\" The term \"employer\" is defined as per section 3401(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or by the State where duties are performed. The term \"State\" refers to each of the several States of the United States. The term \"time and attendance system\" is also defined. The term \"State\" refers to each of the several States of the United States. A \"time and attendance system\" requires employees to record work location for days worked outside their primary state, used by employers to allocate wages across taxing jurisdictions. \"Wages or other remuneration\" is defined by the state where employment duties are performed. The Act will be effective on January 1, 2011."
