The Corps maintains infrastructure like navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams through dredging and water management. Maintenance and construction costs are funded by the Corps and the commercial user industry. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages inland waterways in 38 states, handling half of all inland waterway freight. Costs for maintenance and construction are funded by the Corps and the commercial user industry. Congress is considering future financing for inland waterway system investments, as the current revenue source is insufficient to cover nonfederal costs, leading to federal taxpayers covering more than half of major capital expenditures. The ongoing shortfall in funding for inland waterways is limiting new construction projects, with federal taxpayers covering over half of the costs. Proposals to change the financing system, such as increasing fuel taxes or lock usage fees, have been considered but not implemented. The commercial use of inland waterways dates back to before the nation's founding, serving as a primary transportation method before rail and highway systems. Inland waterways have been used for commercial transport since before the nation's founding. Initially overseen by states, federal government took control in 1824 to support interstate commerce. Despite decreased reliance due to rail and highway improvements, they still handle 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage annually. Inland waterways account for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped, serving as an important transportation route for specific commodities like grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, and chemicals. Despite projections of increased traffic, actual inland waterway traffic has remained relatively flat over the last 20 years in terms of tonnage and ton-miles. Despite projections of increased traffic, actual traffic on inland waterways has remained somewhat flat over the last 20 years in terms of tonnage and ton-miles. Overall freight tonnage for all modes of domestic shipping increased at an average annual rate of 1.2% from 1997 to 2007 and is expected to double over the next 25 years. Inland waterway traffic is projected to increase at a rate significantly less than rail and highway shipping. The system of fuel-taxed inland and intracoastal waterways is displayed in Figure 1, with almost all tonnage coming through the Mississippi and Ohio River System. The federal government invests in inland waterways, with the majority of tonnage transported through the Mississippi and Ohio River System via bulk shipping on barges. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s changed the funding system, creating user cost-sharing requirements. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 transformed inland waterway financing. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established a fuel tax on commercial barges, cost-share requirements for inland waterway projects, and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to fund investments in construction. This shifted financial and decision-making responsibility to commercial operators on the inland waterway system. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 established a fuel tax on commercial barge traffic, creating the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The tax started at $0.04 per gallon in FY1980, increasing to $0.10 per gallon in FY1986, and eventually reaching $0.20 per gallon in 1994. WRDA 1986 further increased the fuel tax and implemented a cost-sharing process for inland waterway construction projects. Inland waterway expenditures: Construction projects funded on a 50/50 basis between IWTF and Treasury's GR fund. O&M costs remain 100% federal responsibility. Projects funded by IWTF must be authorized by Congress and funded annually. Additional projects authorized by subsequent WRDA acts. Congress makes appropriations for projects in annual bills. Projects funded by Congress in annual appropriations bills, with 100% federal funding for inland waterway costs excluding construction and major maintenance. WRDA 1986 also established the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) as a federal advisory committee. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established as a federal advisory committee under WRDA 1986. It consists of 11 members representing shipping interests in key geographical areas served by inland waterways. The board meets three times a year to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress on IWTF projects. The IWTF balance fluctuated between 1986 and 2011, peaking at $413 million in 2002. The executive branch proposed fee increases on the user industry to fund operations and maintenance. Since 1996, proposals to increase fees on the user industry and have the IWTF fund operations and maintenance were not enacted by Congress. From FY2005, appropriations for IWTF-funded projects increased significantly, surpassing fuel tax collections and interest on the balance. Some projects exceeded cost estimates, causing balances to sharply decline from 2005 to 2010. Congress implemented \"stopgap\" measures to prevent unsustainable balance levels. Congress has implemented various measures to prevent the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) balance from falling to unsustainable levels. These measures include exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements, providing construction funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and prohibiting the Corps from entering into new contracts requiring IWTF funding since FY2009. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) balance has stabilized due to Congress implementing measures to prevent it from falling to unsustainable levels. However, without changes to IWTF financing, funding for new projects is expected to be extremely limited in the future, with most funding going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River. Concerns have also been raised about the IWTF financing system and fuel tax payers. Concerns have been raised about the IWTF financing system, with fuel tax payers expressing complaints about inefficiencies in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments. Reforms were implemented in FY2006 to address some of these issues, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for projects with a high risk of cost overruns. However, many still advocate for additional structural reforms to the planning process. The IWUB recognizes improvements in the planning process but advocates for further reforms due to cost overruns, highlighted by the Olmsted Locks and Dam project. The project's estimated cost increased from $775 million to $2.9 billion in FY2014, with completion at 49% in 2013. Lock components are finished, while dam and demolition components are still in progress. The project, as of January 1, 2013, was 49% complete with lock components finished. The dam and demolition components are expected to be completed in 2020 and 2024. Recent proposals aim to address concerns about the solvency of the IWTF and financing for fuel-taxed inland waterways. The Administration and IWUB have differing proposals, with the user industry suggesting an increase in fuel tax and federal share for certain investments. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax for inland waterways, aiming to generate additional revenue for the IWTF. The fee would have phased in charges for commercial barges based on lock chamber size, with the goal of tying IWTF balances to this user fee after 2012. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax for inland waterways, aiming to generate additional revenue for the IWTF. The fee would have phased in charges for commercial barges based on lock chamber size, with the goal of tying IWTF balances to this user fee after 2012. The House and Senate appropriations committees rejected this approach, citing concerns about the burden it would place on lock users. Congress provided temporary relief through stopgap measures and requested a reevaluation of the approach by the executive branch. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees for inland waterways in its budget requests to Congress, aiming to increase efficiency and revenues. Congress generally rejected these proposals, opting for appropriations based on current-year expected fuel tax revenues. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees for inland waterways to increase revenues, but Congress has generally rejected these proposals. Instead, appropriations are based on current-year fuel tax revenues. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees for inland waterways to increase revenues, with a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers. The proposed legislation did not specify the fee amount but set revenue targets to achieve approximately $1 billion in additional revenues over 10 years. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees for inland waterways to increase revenues by $1 billion over 10 years. The proposal included adding 39 new segments to the existing inland waterway system, but faced opposition from the user industry and was not enacted. In response, the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) submitted its own proposal to Congress. The IWUB report, not formally endorsed by the Corps or the Administration, recommended a new financing system and other changes for inland waterways. Its primary recommendations include increasing user fees. The IWUB report recommends increasing user fees, shifting to a larger federal share of costs, increasing overall spending on inland waterways, and involving IWUB in project planning. The IWUB report proposes increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, potentially generating $112 million annually. Most of the new revenue would be saved for future use, allowing the IWTF to replenish its balances. The proposed tax increase would not be indexed for inflation. The IWUB report proposes increasing the fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon to generate $112 million annually for future use. The proposed tax increase would not be indexed for inflation and aims to shift more project costs to the federal government. It also suggests exempting certain dam-related and lock rehabilitation expenses from cost-sharing requirements and establishing a cap on IWTF fund usage to prevent construction cost overruns. The IWUB report proposes changes to cost-sharing requirements and establishing a cap on IWTF fund usage to prevent construction cost overruns. These changes would increase the federal share for new projects to approximately 70% over the next 25 years. Additionally, the report suggests increasing funding for inland waterways from both the IWTF and General Revenue fund. The IWUB report proposes an increase in funding for inland waterways, with annual expenditures averaging $380 million, a significant increase over historical averages. Most of the increase would come from the General Revenue fund in the immediate future to meet the proposed funding requirements. The IWUB report proposes increased federal funding for inland waterways, with $1.33 billion needed over the first five years. Federal funding would exceed 50% of required investments, gradually increasing from 2020. The report suggests reforms to improve cost-effectiveness of IWTF projects overseen by the Corps, with increased involvement of the IWUB in project delivery. The IWUB report recommends increased involvement in Corps project delivery for IWTF investments, appointing representatives to project design teams, obtaining sign-off on project plans, and providing status updates. Concerns about conflicts of interest and federal control of planning process are raised. Specific projects are listed for funding. The IWUB report outlines specific projects for funding once changes to the IWTF financing system are implemented. Projects were prioritized based on asset condition, performance impact, and system improvement. Final funding decisions would still be made by Congress or the Corps. The report aims to increase project selection likelihood by recommending Corps involvement in project delivery. The proposal suggests criteria for selecting inland waterway projects to increase likelihood of project selection. Some advocate for shifting costs from the federal government to users due to inequalities in spending. Congressional Budget Office found the current tax system fails to cover operational costs. The Congressional Budget Office found that a uniform tax system for the inland waterway system does not cover fixed operational costs, leading to distorted maintenance costs. A user fee structure that recovers true costs would increase economic efficiency, but would result in higher costs for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios. Various entities have proposed significant increases in inland waterway fees to save federal government costs, including a recommendation from a coalition of organizations in the 2011 \"Green Scissors\" report. In its 2011 \"Green Scissors\" report, taxpayer watchdog and environmental NGOs recommended increasing user contributions for inland waterway expenditures, estimating savings of $1 billion over five years. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform proposed making inland waterways \"self-funding,\" with projected savings of $500 million over five years. The CBO suggested increasing user fees to cover construction, operations, and maintenance costs, potentially saving $4 billion over a 10-year period. These proposals aim to significantly raise the user share of inland waterways financing. The proposals for increasing user contributions for inland waterway expenditures aim to raise significant funds, potentially saving billions over a 10-year period. Specific recommendations for new revenue sources include annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees. These proposals seek to fundamentally alter the current financing system for inland waterways, presenting important issues for Congress to consider. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 proposed changes to inland waterways financing, including new investment levels and revenue sources. Congress must decide on the level of investment needed and whether to adjust fuel taxes or cost-share arrangements for projects. The federal government increased the General Revenue fund's coverage of rehabilitation costs to less than $20 million and reduced the cost-sharing requirement for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. Efforts were authorized to study revenue collection efficiency, potential financing options, and convene a stakeholder roundtable for inland waterways policy. The House and Senate have made changes related to inland waterways in recent appropriations. The House and Senate have made changes related to inland waterways in recent appropriations, including funding the Olmsted Project at a reduced cost-sharing requirement. Observers believe that the changes enacted may not be enough to finance all needed waterway upgrades in the long-term, leading to support for user proposals to address the IWTF's long-term solvency. Stand-alone legislation has been proposed in the 113th Congress for this purpose. Stand-alone legislation in the 113th Congress, such as H.R. 1149 (WAVE4 Act) and S. 407 (RIVER Act), aims to address the long-term solvency of the IWTF by authorizing recommendations from the IWUB proposal, including fuel tax increases and alterations to cost-sharing for dam construction. The bill, similar to H.R. 1149, proposes a $0.09 per gallon fuel tax increase and federal responsibility for dam construction costs under $50 million. Congress faces issues regarding infrastructure investments on federal waterways, with commercial users advocating for increased investment due to aging infrastructure and environmental benefits. Despite disagreements, most entities agree that the current system of financing inland waterways is inadequate to address future needs. The Corps is expected to have appropriations for just one ongoing lock replacement project through at least FY2016 under its current baseline for IWTF revenues. Additional funding or federal appropriations are needed to address the funding drawdown. The Corps of Engineers is facing a funding shortfall for ongoing lock replacement projects, which may be put on hold without new revenue sources or federal appropriations. Aging infrastructure and declining efficiency of inland waterway assets have led to increased lock unavailability. User industries are advocating for new lock construction and expanded capacity over maintenance. The user industry favors new lock construction and expanded capacity over ongoing maintenance for inland waterways. Environmental groups argue against new investments, stating that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks at a lower cost. They believe that small-scale improvements can overcome issues with aging infrastructure. Improved small-scale and nonstructural improvements can address challenges in waterways infrastructure. The Corps relies on traffic forecasts for new navigation alternatives, which are difficult to predict due to various factors. Total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by 70% by 2020, with waterway traffic projected to increase by 2% annually between 2010 and 2035. The increase in freight traffic is expected to be mainly on freight rail and highway, with annual waterway traffic projected to grow by 2% per year between 2010 and 2035. Efforts to improve the efficiency of inland waterways could reduce pressure on highway and rail shipments. Future lock upgrades or new construction may boost demand for inland waterways, but this could be influenced by external factors. Some groups question the need for new lock construction based on flat or decreasing traffic at certain locks on the inland waterway system. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways due to their efficiency and environmental benefits compared to other modes of transportation. Studies show that barge shipping is more fuel-efficient than railroads, with lower greenhouse gas emissions. Critics question the Corps' traffic projections and the need for new lock construction on the inland waterway system. Studies have found that railroads are less fuel-efficient than inland waterways, with the latter contributing fewer greenhouse gas emissions per mile. Other benefits of inland waterways include reduced highway congestion and noise. Critics question industry fuel-efficiency calculations and suggest using a conversion factor to account for technical factors like river flow direction. Environmental groups caution that inland waterway projects can harm riparian habitat and species by altering natural flows through structural changes like locks, dams, and levees. Waterway traffic can also contribute to bank erosion. Congress must consider the environmental impacts of expanding inland waterways alongside decisions on additional investment and changes to financing systems. Congress may need to consider changes to the system that finances investments in waterways, including proposals such as an increase to the fuel tax or new annual fees. The IWUB argues that increasing the fuel tax would rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new investments, but some groups raise concerns about the associated environmental impacts. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. These fees would include fuel taxes and new fees for non-lock users, with lock users paying even higher fees. Some groups argue that the associated increases in federal cost share responsibilities are unacceptable. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. The Administration also suggests adding new waterway segments to the fuel-taxed list, with lock users facing higher fees. The IWUB and Congress have opposed the new proposal, arguing that it unfairly burdens a subset of waterway users and goes against the idea of the inland waterways as a interconnected system. Major fee increases could significantly impact shippers within the system. The user industry opposes new fee proposals that delegate fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army, arguing it will significantly impact shippers within the inland waterway system. Various revenue-raising options have been considered, including lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and lock charges for congested areas. Some revenue-raising options for inland waterways include combining fees with fuel tax, implementing capital recovery concept to adjust user fees based on government investments, and tying user fees to trust fund balance to prevent future shortfalls. This concept may limit projects to essential authorizations and is reflected in the Obama Administration proposal. The Obama Administration proposal suggests tying user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022 to prioritize essential projects. Users have concerns about the unpredictability of capital recovery and potential cost increases. Congress could explore options like automatic inflation adjustments to enhance revenue reliability for inland waterways. Some argue that automatic adjustments to IWTF funds could lead to hidden tax increases in the future. Without a long-term solution, Congress may need to take measures to ensure trust fund solvency, such as capping withdrawals or halting new contracts. Options like exempting IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements have been considered in the past. The IWUB proposal would exempt investments from WRDA 1986 cost-sharing requirements, potentially increasing costs to taxpayers. Congress is considering if the current cost-share arrangement for inland waterway projects is balanced, as WRDA 1992 modified cost-sharing for major rehabilitation projects. The IWUB proposal suggests significant changes to cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, including shifting funding for dams and minor rehabilitation to 100% federal funding. They also propose a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects, replacing the previous $8 million threshold. The IWUB proposes to increase the threshold for federally funded projects to $100 million, shifting more costs to the federal government. Cost overruns for IWTF construction projects would become 100% federal responsibility, potentially increasing hidden costs. This would change the cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects from 50/50 to approximately 68%. The IWUB report proposes a shift in cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects from 50/50 to 68% federal, 32% non-federal. This change could lead to federal costs for inland waterways rising to over 90% of total expenses, with significant federal support already in place for investigations and operations. The CRS calculates that federal costs for inland waterways could increase to over 90% under the proposal, compared to the current 80%-85% annual responsibility. The Obama Administration's proposals suggest changes to user fees but maintain a 50/50 cost-share structure between federal and nonfederal expenditures. Some advocate for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance of inland waterways. Some groups argue for increased user responsibility in funding construction, operations, and maintenance of inland waterways, proposing that users pay for 50% of costs. Congress has previously rejected these proposals but may reconsider due to government cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB also seeks reforms to Corps IWTF planning processes to improve project prioritization and reduce cost overruns. The IWUB seeks reforms to Corps IWTF planning processes to improve project prioritization and reduce cost overruns. Industry users argue that these reforms will decrease the likelihood of cost overruns, which have been a problem for IWTF projects in the past. The degree of involvement by a non-federal entity in the planning process could raise concerns related to conflicts of interest. Congressional attention may also focus on the Corps' method for prioritization of all inland waterway projects. The IWUB proposes a priority ranking system to improve project selection for IWTF funds, potentially limiting Congress's role in project decisions. This system, detailed in the IWUB report, could be implemented as a regulation, changing how projects are funded and authorized. The Corps may use specific criteria to select projects for funding, potentially reducing Congress's role to providing authorizations and funding levels. This shift aligns with how other agencies allocate project funds, like the EPA's state revolving fund programs."
