However, a 2009 report showed a significant 8.0% increase in foreign-born students for the 2008-2009 academic year, with a notable rise in students from China. New foreign student enrollment also increased by 16.0%, attributed to recruitment efforts and improved visa processing. The increase in international student enrollment for the 2008-2009 academic year is attributed to recruitment efforts and improved visa processing. The top countries of origin for foreign students were India, China, South Korea, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Mexico, Turkey, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia. The top fields of study for foreign students were business and management, engineering, physical and life sciences, social sciences, mathematics and computer sciences, health professions, and fine and applied arts. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in various fields, including sciences and engineering. The participation rates for foreign students in earning doctorates in sciences and engineering were higher compared to permanent resident status students. Trend data from 1996-2005 also show a consistent pattern of non-U.S. citizens earning degrees in science and engineering. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in various fields of science and engineering, with higher participation rates compared to permanent resident status students. Foreign students were awarded 47.9% of doctorates in physical sciences, 55.3% in mathematics, and 61.3% in computer sciences. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in various fields of science and engineering, with higher participation rates compared to permanent resident status students. The earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences, agricultural and biological sciences, and social sciences awarded a significant portion of degrees to foreign-born students. The NSF provides specific data on the country of origin of foreign-born science and engineering doctorate awards, with China, India, and Taiwan being the top countries of origin. Foreign graduate students in the U.S. face restrictions on employment and financial support, but can work as research or teaching assistants on federally funded projects. They receive support from various sources such as personal funds, universities, foreign governments, employers, and others. Foreign graduate students in the U.S. receive support from various sources such as personal funds, universities, foreign governments, and employers. The university usually provides support in the form of research or teaching assistantships for continuing years of study. Federal aid is not available for temporary resident foreign students, but they can receive support through federally funded research grants awarded to their home institution. Higher education provides significant support to foreign students through teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Non-U.S. citizen doctoral recipients receive more financial assistance than U.S. doctoral recipients. Data by race/ethnicity shows varying levels of self-financing for graduate studies. In the physical sciences and engineering, universities are the primary source of support for temporary resident students. In sciences and engineering, universities provide primary financial support for a high percentage of temporary resident students, permanent residents, and U.S. citizens. Foreign doctoral students in education and social sciences also receive more financial assistance from universities compared to U.S. students. Some argue that U.S. universities benefit from a large foreign student enrollment by helping to meet the needs of the university and the nation's economy. Foreign students generate measurable costs and benefits, with 13 percent remaining in the U.S. permanently increasing the skilled workforce. Foreign students in graduate programs contribute to the workforce at universities, especially in research institutions. They assist in teaching, research, and lab work, while also providing tuition revenue. However, their significant presence has raised concerns among minority groups who feel there is unequal access to graduate education and scholarships for U.S. minorities in comparison to foreign students. The university science community is criticized for unequal access for U.S. minorities in graduate education, scholarships, research funds, and collaborations. Former professor Frank L. Morris accused colleges of favoring foreign students over American minorities, stating that foreign doctoral students receive better support than African American doctoral students. Some criticisms include unequal support for foreign doctoral students compared to American minorities, impacting the economic well-being of the African American community. Language barriers with foreign teaching assistants affect communication and learning processes in graduate schools. Some states have set English-language standards for foreign teaching assistants, while some view scientific migration as beneficial for the U.S. economy. International graduate students and scholars play a crucial role in research and teaching activities, with their presence being vital for advancements in science and technology. The number of immigrant scientists and engineers entering the United States increased significantly in the 1990s due to changes in immigration laws. The presence of international graduate students and scholars is crucial for research and teaching activities in academia and industry. The number of foreign-born scientists and engineers in the U.S. labor force increased significantly in the 1990s due to the Chinese Students Protection Act of 1992. Administrative changes, immigration legislation, and the impact of September 11th have affected the issuance of permanent visas. The H-1B program has seen an increase in the annual quota for foreign-born workers to obtain visas for up to six years, with a focus on technology workers but also hiring other skilled workers. The H-1B program allows foreign-born workers to obtain visas for up to six years, used for technology workers and other skilled workers. Some argue that hiring immigrant scientists and engineers on H-1B visas has led to decreased job opportunities and wages for U.S. scientific personnel. Despite downsizing in high-tech companies, the federal government continues to issue thousands of H-1B visas to foreign workers, leading to concerns about over-reliance on these workers in high-tech positions. The H-1B program allows foreign-born workers to obtain visas for up to six years, used for technology workers and other skilled workers. Some argue that hiring immigrant scientists and engineers on H-1B visas has led to decreased job opportunities and wages for U.S. scientific personnel. Despite downsizing in high-tech companies, the federal government continues to issue thousands of H-1B visas to foreign workers. Critics believe that an over-reliance on H-1B visa workers weakens opportunities for the U.S. workforce, while supporters argue that foreign workers are necessary to fill needed positions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found limitations in Labor's review of H-1B applications, leading to increased complaints and violations from fiscal year 2000 to 2005. USCIS lacks a formal mechanism to report information to Labor, hindering investigations by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The Department of Labor does not have a formal mechanism to report information to Labor, hindering investigations by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The maturing of the computer industry has brought problems regarding the employment of foreign scientists and engineers, with concerns about lower salaries for foreign-born professionals and the impact on the status of U.S. workers. The Department of Labor has sought to enforce policies on the temporary employment of nonimmigrant foreign workers under H-1B visas. The Department of Labor (DOL) is enforcing policies on temporary employment of nonimmigrant foreign workers under H-1B visas to penalize violators. The scientific community believes that bringing in skilled foreign talent is necessary for the US to compete in the global economy. There is a call for stricter monitoring of foreign talent entering US colleges and universities. Some argue that the concern is not too many foreign-born students but not enough native-born students in science and engineering programs. The presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs is essential for the US STEM enterprise, but there is a need to develop domestic talent as well. The debate on foreign student presence intensified after the September terrorist attacks. The debate on foreign students in US graduate science and engineering programs intensified after the September 11 attacks. Concerns have been raised about the inhospitable environment for foreign students in the US, with reports indicating a decline in the country's status as the preferred destination for international students. Discussions also focus on the access of foreign scientists and engineers to research on chemical and biological weapons, as well as increased scrutiny on students from certain countries. The academic community is concerned about the impact of more stringent requirements for foreign students on enrollments in colleges and universities. There are debates on how a possible reduction in immigration of foreign scientists may affect the competitiveness of U.S. industry and international cooperative agreements. Tracking foreign students attending U.S. institutions has generated particular debate following the September 11th terrorist attacks. Prior to September 11th, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act authorized the SEVP/CIPRIS program to track foreign students and researchers. However, the system was never fully implemented due to cost concerns and described as an unnecessary burden on colleges and universities. The USA Patriot Act and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act enhanced the process for monitoring foreign students and researchers in U.S. institutions. The INS developed SEVIS, a web-based system, to maintain current information on foreign students and exchange visitors to ensure they comply with visa requirements. Congress mandated the tracking system to be operational by February 15, 2003. The deadline for implementing SEVIS was extended to February 15, 2003, but it faced delays due to technical issues and increased visa applicant screening. A proposal for SEVIS II aims to address these problems and enhance the tracking system. A hearing in 2005 focused on correcting visa process vulnerabilities. The International Relations hearing addressed gaps in the visa process, focusing on strengthening security measures while facilitating legitimate travel. Witnesses highlighted increased consular workloads, lack of resources and training, and the need for clear procedures to ensure consistent visa adjudication worldwide. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has released reports on visa processing improvements and recommended changes in visa operations to address delays and enhance national security. Recommendations include clarifying visa policies, providing necessary tools for consular officers, and ensuring consistent visa adjudication worldwide. Comprehensive immigration reform legislation, including H.R. 4321, has been introduced in the 111th Congress. The bill aims to exempt certain U.S.-educated immigrants from employment-based immigration limits and make changes to H-1B visa employer application requirements. Additionally, other bills related to immigration have also been introduced in the same Congress. Several bills introduced in the 111th Congress aim to address issues related to H-1B visas and foreign students in scientific and technical disciplines. H.R. 1736 focuses on international science and technology cooperation, while S. 887 seeks to reform H-1B employer requirements. H.R. 1791 aims to limit the departure of trained Ph.D.s from the American economy. H.R. 1791, the STAPLE Act, aims to limit the departure of trained Ph.D.s from the American economy by imposing numerical limitations on immigrants with doctorate degrees in scientific disciplines from U.S. institutions. It also sets restrictions on H-1B visas for immigrants with doctorates in scientific disciplines."
