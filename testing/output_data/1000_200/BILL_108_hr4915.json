It introduces an exclusion for gains from stock of small, publicly traded companies in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Small Investment Tax Relief Act of 2004\" introduces an exclusion for gains from the sale or exchange of section 1203 stock held for more than 1 year. The exclusion is limited to $100,000 ($50,000 for married individuals filing separately) and applies to stock in a qualified small business acquired after the enactment of the Act. The exclusion for gains from the sale or exchange of section 1203 stock held for more than 1 year applies to publicly traded stock in a qualified small business. The term 'qualified small business' refers to a domestic C corporation with a market capitalization not exceeding $150,000,000 at the time of stock acquisition. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the closing stock price by the number of outstanding shares. The reporting period for determining the number of outstanding shares of stock in a corporation is based on the most recent annual or quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires periodic information filings under section 15(d). Aggregation rules apply, and additional rules similar to section 1202 are enforced with modifications. Conforming amendments are made to section 642(c)(4) of the Code. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the Code, including 642(c)(4), 643(a)(3), 691(c)(4), 871(a)(2), and 1044(d), to include references to sections 1202 and 1203. Amendments are made to section 1202(b) of the Code regarding section 1203 stock. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part 1 of subchapter P of chapter 1. Sec. 1203 excludes gains from stock of small, publicly traded companies. The amendments apply to securities acquired after the enactment of this Act."
