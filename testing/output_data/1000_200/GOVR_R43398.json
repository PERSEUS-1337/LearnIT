    "content": "The federal government has supported educational statistics for over 150 years, with the creation of the National Institute of Education and the National Center for Education Statistics in the 1970s. The Institute of Education Sciences now oversees federal educational research and statistics efforts. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) replaced OERI in 2002 through the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA). ESRA established IES as an independent research institute within the Department of Education, headed by a Director appointed by the President. A technical panel, the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES), advises the Director on policies, research priorities, and conducts assessments. Three National Education Centers were established to focus on research in different areas. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute within the Department of Education. It created three National Education Centers: the National Center for Education Research (NCER), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE). P.L. 108-446 added a fourth center, the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER). Additionally, P.L. 107-279 enacted the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA) to support technical assistance activities and assessments. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute within the Department of Education. It created three National Education Centers and added a fourth center later. P.L. 107-279 enacted the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA) to support technical assistance activities and assessments. ESRA led to the creation of an independent research institute and specified \"scientifically-based\" or \"scientifically-valid\" standards for research. IES operates independently with more freedom from the Department of Education. ESRA established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute within the Department of Education, providing more freedom from ED. It also introduced greater oversight through a technical panel (NBES) and specified standards for educational research. Funding for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA programs continued post FY2008. The House and Senate passed bills to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA, amending provisions related to IES research standards, evaluation, privacy protection, and accountability. Funding for these programs has continued through annual appropriations legislation. The report provides a concise description of programs and authorities established by ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA as amended under P.L. 107-279. It discusses recent legislative action and Title I of P.L. 107-279, which is the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) that establishes IES as a research institute within ED. The aim of IES is to provide information on education progress and practices that improve academic achievement. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) provides information on education progress, academic achievement, and federal education programs. The IES Director is appointed by the President and carries out duties such as proposing research priorities and ensuring activities are objective and free of political influence. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) authorizes the National Board for Education Sciences (NBES) to advise the IES Director on research priorities, funding decisions, and the improvement of IES. ESRA specifies requirements for Board members' composition and qualifications. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) outlines requirements for the Board of IES, including composition, qualifications, compensation, and travel expenses. IES consists of four research centers, each with specific duties as outlined in ESRA. Three centers are headed by a Commissioner appointed by the Director, while the fourth center's Commissioner is appointed by the President. The National Center for Education Research (NCER) is one of the four research centers under the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA). NCER's mission is to sponsor research that ensures all children have access to quality education, improves academic achievement, closes achievement gaps, and promotes postsecondary education opportunities.

They develop guidelines for reporting results and standards for comparisons. Funding for these activities has been ongoing through annual appropriations legislation. Funding for education research has been ongoing through annual appropriations legislation. In the 113th and 114th Congress, bills were passed to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA, with proposed changes to IES independence, research standards, evaluation, and accountability. Both bills aimed to give the Director of IES more authority and responsibilities. Both bills proposed giving the Director of IES more authority by allowing them to appoint the Commissioner of NCES and amending provisions for the appointment and term limits of the IES Director. They also aimed to make NBES independent of the Director and required at least two board members to be practitioners knowledgeable about US education needs. The bills proposed giving the Director of IES more authority, including the ability to appoint the Commissioner of NCES and serve for an additional year if a successor is not appointed. They also required the involvement of the Director or designee in procurement processes and established a peer review system for grants and contracts exceeding $100,000. The bills proposed changes to the award process for IES grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements, requiring them to be awarded through a peer review process. They also aimed to redefine \"scientifically based research standards\" as \"principles of scientific research\" and specified criteria for research designs to support strong claims of causal relationships. Additionally, the bills adjusted the specified topical research priorities for IES. The bills proposed changes to the award process for IES grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements, requiring a peer review process. They aimed to redefine \"scientifically based research standards\" as \"principles of scientific research\" and specified criteria for research designs to support strong claims of causal relationships. The bills were more explicit in specifying that designs would not be limited to random assignment experiments and adjusted the specified topical research priorities for IES. Some narrowly targeted priorities under current law would no longer be specified, and the requirement for a specific number of national research and development centers supported by NCER would be eliminated. The bills proposed changes to the mission and structure of RELs, limiting their number to not more than 10 and focusing on conducting applied research, development, evaluation, and dissemination activities. The Evaluation and Regional Assistance Commissioner would have the authority to determine the appropriate number of RELs and reorganize them based on needs. The bills proposed changes to the mission and structure of RELs, limiting their number to not more than 10. The Evaluation and Regional Assistance Commissioner would have the authority to determine the appropriate number of RELs and reorganize them based on needs. H.R. 4366 and S. 227 would assign technical assistance responsibility to ED-administered Comprehensive Centers, with a limit of 17 awards in H.R. 4366 and a set number of 17 in S. 227. The Secretary would have the authority to determine the number of centers in consultation with advisory boards.

The Secretary would have the authority to determine the number of centers in consultation with advisory boards, with a limit of 17 awards. Both bills aimed to ensure rigor and independence in research and evaluations of federal education programs. The bills proposed changes to the evaluation of programs authorized under ESEA, including reserving funds for evaluations and requiring a biennial evaluation plan to be submitted to Congress. Additionally, the role of the National Assessment Governing Board would be amended to \"oversee and set policies\" for the NAEP. The bills proposed changes to the evaluation of programs authorized under ESEA, including reserving funds for evaluations and requiring a biennial evaluation plan to be submitted to Congress. The National Assessment Governing Board's role would be amended to \"oversee and set policies\" for the NAEP. Both bills aimed to improve activities and fund utilization through measurable performance indicators and triennial or five-year evaluations of National Education Centers. Both bills proposed changes to the evaluation of programs authorized under ESEA, including tying renewal of grants to progress on measurable indicators. The Director would have authority to renew support for research centers and Statistics Commissioner for up to two years. Recipients of renewal awards would need to demonstrate progress in meeting performance management system requirements. The awards show progress in meeting ESRA's performance management system requirements. The bills authorize renewal of support without competition for up to two years. Recipients must demonstrate progress in meeting performance management system requirements. The Director must report grant information to the public within 120 days. Regulatory requirements on data access by federal agencies and interested parties would be codified. Appropriations for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA would be authorized at specific levels for FY2015 through FY2020. Both bills would authorize specific levels of appropriations for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA for FY2015 through FY2020, rather than the current practice of authorizing funds for the first fiscal year and subsequent years as needed. Additionally, the bills would reserve 16.13% of ESRA funds for the RELs, instead of the current fixed amount of $100,000 for FY2003 and subsequent years."
