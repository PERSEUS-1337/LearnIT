    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 for a new base closure round in 2005. The closures and realignments from previous BRAC commissions have resulted in significant savings. The 1995 round of base closures resulted in net savings of $16.7 billion and annual recurring savings of $6.6 billion. In 1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two more rounds of closures due to the continuing downward trend in defense spending and force structure. Since the first base closure round, force structure has decreased by 33% and will reach a total decline of 36% after the reductions under the QDR. Since the first base closure round, force structure has decreased by 33% and will reach a total decline of 36% after the reductions under the QDR. Closing more bases is necessary to achieve a balance between infrastructure and force structure, as well as to secure significant savings for future readiness and weapons acquisition programs. Without these savings, DOD would struggle to fulfill its missions and responsibilities in the future. Secretary of Defense Cohen's plan to start new closure rounds within the next five years faced resistance on Capitol Hill due to concerns about economic and political repercussions in their districts. Resistance on Capitol Hill to Secretary of Defense Cohen's plan for new base closure rounds within the next five years was evident. Many Members expressed concerns about economic and political fallout in their districts. Despite efforts by Senators to push for more base closings to free up funds for new weapons, the full Senate ultimately voted against the initiative. The full Senate voted against the McCain-Levin initiative for new base closings, opting for a substitute amendment that required the DOD to develop accounting techniques to measure costs and savings. The House National Security Committee also opposed new closure rounds. Representative Joel Hefley and other opponents questioned the DOD's estimate of savings from new base closure rounds, citing upfront costs and lack of confirmation by the Congressional Budget Office. They objected to rushing into closures without understanding the military implications and validity of the DOD's premise on reduction in end-strength correlating with base closings. The DOD faced opposition regarding the correlation between reduction in end-strength and base closings. Despite lack of support, senior officials pushed for new base closures to fund weapons programs. The Defense Reform Initiative proposed two rounds of closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming for $2.8 billion in total savings. The Defense Reform Initiative proposed two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming for $2.8 billion in total savings. Support for the closures came from a 1997 report urging Congress and the Defense Department to move quickly on the process. The Defense Reform Initiative proposed two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005 for $2.8 billion in savings. Secretary of Defense Cohen endorsed the panel's findings, emphasizing the importance of additional BRAC rounds for military transformation. President Clinton's actions on the 1995 base closure commission's recommendations for Air Force depots were contentious. President Clinton opposed closing McClellan and Kelly depots despite low capacity, suggesting privatization-in-place to save jobs in California and Texas. Legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the privatization plan. Legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the privatization plan for depot maintenance work at McClellan and Kelly air force bases, fearing job loss and vulnerability to closure in future base reduction rounds. Resentment over President Clinton's intervention in 1995 persisted among some Members until the end of his second term, influencing their opposition to new base closure rounds. The House military readiness subcommittee approved an amendment to the FY1998 defense authorization bill prohibiting privatization at McClellan and Kelly air force bases unless other depots were operating at 80% capacity. The full House National Security Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee approved similar depot language, but the provisions were removed due to a threatened filibuster. Representative Terry Everett led an effort to delete the depot-related restrictions in the House FY1998 defense authorization bill. In June 1997, Representative Terry Everett's attempt to remove depot-related restrictions in the House defense bill was defeated. Senator Inhofe later withdrew an amendment to restore the restrictions in the Senate bill. The depot language became a major obstacle in reaching a final agreement on the defense bill, with neither side willing to yield. The Senate and House conferees reached a resolution on the depot competition issue at McClellan and Kelly air force bases, increasing the limit on depot work by private contractors to 50%. The House passed the conference report, but the Senate did not move to a final vote. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison attempted to postpone the vote on the FY1998 defense bill. In the FY1998 defense authorization act, Congress included language prohibiting DOD from planning new base closures until a report on costs and savings from previous closures was submitted. The report had detailed requirements outlined in the Dorgan Amendment, with a deadline set for delivery before the President's inauguration. The Dorgan Amendment outlined ten \"Elements\" and eight \"Methods of Presenting Information\" for a report on base closures. The Department of Defense submitted the report to Congress ahead of the deadline. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for new base closure legislation, citing excess base structure and the need for savings to fund modernization and readiness. He highlighted the imbalance between force and base structures. The defense budget was down 40% and force structure 36%, while base structure had only declined 21%. The imbalance between force and base structures was highlighted, with examples such as the significant reduction in Navy ships and Army soldiers compared to classroom space. The base closure report claimed that costs were lower than originally estimated, with expected savings of about $14 billion through 2001. The base closure report from BRAC's 1988-1995 rounds exceeded initial savings estimates, with DOD expecting $14 billion in net savings through 2001 and $5.6 billion annually thereafter. The Pentagon anticipated an additional $3 billion in savings per year from the 2001 and 2005 closure rounds. The report recommended applying previous closure commission models and highlighted successful economic recovery in impacted communities. The controversy over base closures escalated with a memo citing White House involvement in encouraging Lockheed Martin to pursue depot maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base. Members opposed keeping the work at McClellan AFB and Kelly AFB, accusing the Administration of meddling in the closure process. Capitol Hill reacted strongly to the report's call for new base closures. Capitol Hill reacted strongly to the report's call for new base closures, with widespread resistance from the House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senate committee narrowly defeated a proposed new round of base closures in 2001. Senators John McCain and Carl Levin were prepared to seek support for passage of a floor amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill. The Senate committee narrowly defeated a proposed new round of base closures in 2001. Senators John McCain and Carl Levin were prepared to seek support for passage of a floor amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill. However, the Senators abandoned their initiative as the majority sentiment was against them. The Senate voted 48-45 in support of an amendment that would have made it more difficult for the Pentagon to close bases, sponsored by Senator James Inhofe. The Inhofe amendment in the FY1999 defense authorization bill aimed to prevent the Pentagon from closing bases with over 750 civilian personnel and delaying any closures for four years after a realignment. It also opposed new rounds of closures until previous actions were completed. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report, finding it mostly but not entirely satisfactory. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's base realignment and closure report on July 1, 1998, finding that DOD's estimates of savings were consistent with its own estimates. CBO explained that firm measures of BRAC savings requested by Congress do not exist because they are avoided costs, not actual expenditures. DOD can only estimate savings rather than measure them due to the nature of these costs. The Congressional Budget Office reviewed DOD's report on base closure rounds, noting a clear summary of potential savings but lacking analysis on data and potential closures. CBO also highlighted challenges in analyzing the impact on local communities and the need for accurate estimates including environmental and caretaker costs. The General Accounting Office submitted a longer review on November 13, 1998. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's report on base closure rounds, affirming substantial net savings from previous BRAC closures. However, it noted that DOD's report provides a rough approximation of costs and savings, lacking precise accounting. GAO also found that DOD's data systems do not capture all savings associated with BRAC actions and highlighted that operational and readiness indicators show no long-term problems related to BRAC actions. DOD's analysis of operational and readiness indicators shows no long-term problems related to BRAC actions. The report suggests that proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 would be similar to prior rounds. DOD's legislative proposal for two additional BRAC rounds could serve as a basis for future legislation. Congress faced the decision of authorizing new base closings at the start of the 106th Congress. At the start of the 106th Congress, the decision to authorize new base closings was a key issue. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin sponsored a bill for two new rounds in 2001 and 2003, citing DOD's claim of 23% excess capacity in infrastructure. They proposed changes to the BRAC selection process to expedite the process. The BRAC selection process for new base closings in 2001 and 2003 was proposed to start later, allowing a new President to nominate commission members. Privatization-in-place would not be allowed unless recommended by the commission. Secretary of Defense emphasized the need for base closures to improve efficiency and save money, stating that wasteful spending on unneeded facilities was affecting military readiness. The vast sums of money wasted on unneeded facilities are robbing our military of essential resources. Despite appeals for new closure rounds to save money, there is opposition in Congress due to fears among constituents. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted against authorizing new rounds of closings in the FY2000 defense authorization bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted against authorizing new base closures in the FY2000 defense authorization bill, with the full Senate later rejecting a last-ditch effort to revive the initiative. Despite DOD's attempts, opposition in Congress remained strong, effectively halting the base closure initiative for the foreseeable future. The Administration's FY2000 DOD budget proposal sought authority to close more military bases in 2003 and 2005. The proposal sought authority to close more military bases in 2003 and 2005. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre emphasized the opportune time for Congress to take action due to the strong national economy. Secretary of Defense Cohen highlighted the need to improve the base closing process and avoid bureaucratic obstacles. Failure to close more bases could cost the Pentagon $20 billion that could be used for upgrading weapon systems and enhancing U.S. fighting forces. Despite efforts, Congress did not authorize new rounds of closures in 2000. In 2000, Congress did not authorize new rounds of military base closures despite efforts by Senators McCain and Levin. In 2001, Senators Levin and McCain introduced a bill for two new rounds of closures in 2003 and 2005, supported by the Taxpayers for Common Sense. The Taxpayers for Common Sense supported new rounds of military base closures in 2003 and 2005, estimating potential savings of up to $21 billion by 2015. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison expressed concerns about closing domestic military bases prematurely, citing restrictions on U.S. military training abroad. The Department of Defense urged Congress to approve another round of base closures in 2001 due to excess capacity. The proposal called for a new round of base closings and consolidations starting in 2003 under the \"Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001.\" The Department of Defense proposed a new round of base closures in 2001 under the \"Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001.\" The plan included transferring property from Brooks Air Force Base to the local community as a demonstration project. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003. The Senate approved a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003 by a margin of 53 to 47, marking their first success in five years of effort. General Henry H. Shelton and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the need to convert excess capacity into war-fighting ability. Opponents argued that the current war on terrorism and uncertain economy made it the worst time to start closing bases. Supporters of the base closure proposal emphasized the importance of providing the military with necessary resources to combat terrorism, while opponents argued that the timing, amidst the war on terrorism and economic uncertainty, was not ideal. Minority Leader Trent Lott expressed concerns about closing bases during a time when reserves were being called up to support the military. Senator John McCain urged trust in military leadership. The House of Representatives did not include base-closing language in the FY2002 defense authorization bill. The House of Representatives opposed the Senate's provision on base closures in the FY2002 defense authorization bill. After weeks of stalemate, a compromise was reached on December 10, 2001, and the President signed the defense authorization bill (P.L. 107-107) on December 28, 2001. The conference report retained most of the former 1990 BRAC Act language with some modifications. The conference report in 2001 made changes to the 1990 BRAC Act, extending the authority for a new round in 2005. The Secretary of Defense was required to submit force structure plans and review all types of installations for potential closure and realignment. The BRAC Act of 2001 made changes to the 1990 Act, extending authority for a new round in 2005. The process involves certifying the need for closure and realignment, ensuring military value is the primary consideration, and increasing the commission members to 9. The Secretary of Defense can testify on commission-proposed base additions, and privatization-in-place of closed bases is prohibited unless recommended by the commission. The BRAC Act of 2001 extended authority for a new round in 2005, prohibiting privatization-in-place of closed bases unless recommended by the commission. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld succeeded in winning approval for a new round in 2005, causing concern for communities near military bases. Various defensive and offensive strategies have been developed in response. Many communities near military bases are concerned about the survival of their installations due to range encroachment and other factors. Community leaders are working to keep their military units at home and are open to acquiring units from other parts of the country to ensure the base's survival. Range encroachment near military bases can de-value installations, making them potential candidates for closure in 2005. The 2005 BRAC timeline outlines the process for closure, including criteria publication, nomination deadlines, presidential approval, and congressional review."
