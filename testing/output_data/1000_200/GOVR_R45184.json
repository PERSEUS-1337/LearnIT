Factors such as reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives have likely contributed to this decrease. Congress remains interested in the issue due to its high social and economic costs. The teen birth rate has been declining in the US since the 1950s, reaching a record low in 2018. Congress is concerned about the high social and economic costs of teen birth. Disparities exist among racial and ethnic groups and states. The report discusses Congress's support for prevention programs to reduce teen pregnancies. Teen birth rate refers to live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, while teen pregnancy rate includes pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, including live births, abortions, and fetal losses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports birth data annually, including teen pregnancy rates. In 2018, there were approximately 3.8 million births in the US, with 4.7% to teenagers aged 15-19. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers. The teen birth rate has been declining since the 1950s, reaching a record low in 2018. The U.S. teen birth rate has been declining since the 1950s, with a significant drop from 1991 to 2018. In 2018, the rate reached a historical low of 17.4, showing a 72% decrease compared to 1991. The greatest decline occurred in recent years, with a 58% drop from 2007 to 2018. The CDC began tracking teen birth rates in 1960, with the highest rates for teens aged 15-17 and 18-19. In 2018, the teen birth rates for 15- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 19-year-olds were the lowest on record, with a significant decline in repeat teen births. Hispanic youth had the highest prevalence of repeat teen births, followed by non-Hispanic black and white youth. Teen mothers have also been less likely to be married. In 2018, there was a significant decline in repeat teen births, with the largest decreases seen among black, Hispanic, and white teens. The birth rate for unmarried teens aged 15 to 19 was 16.0 per 1,000, down from 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010. Despite an overall decline in teen birth rates, certain racial and ethnic groups still have high rates, with Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens having more than double the rate of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. The teen birth rate by race and Hispanic origin decreased from 1991 to 2018, with varying declines among different groups. In 2018, birth rates fell by 55% for non-Hispanic white teens, 40% for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens, 58% for non-Hispanic black teens, 73% for non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander teens, and 65% for Hispanic teens. Despite declines, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic teens still had higher birth rates than white teens in 2018. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate (7.2) and Arkansas the highest (30.4). Eighteen states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19, while ten states had rates of 25 or higher. Rates for territories ranged from 19.3 in Puerto Rico. Despite declines, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic teens still had higher birth rates than white teens. Teen birth rates in 2018 varied by state, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate (7.2) and Arkansas the highest (30.4). Rates in territories ranged from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. From 2007 to 2018, teen birth rates decreased by 19% to 67% in each state or territory. Despite declines, rural areas still have higher teen birth rates compared to urban areas. The U.S. teen birth rate remains higher than that of most other industrialized countries, with economic conditions and income inequality potentially playing a role. The research literature suggests that economic conditions and income inequality may influence the teen birth rate in the United States compared to other industrial countries. Research indicates that improved contraceptive use, including the use of condoms and multiple methods, has contributed to a decrease in teen pregnancy risk from the 1990s to 2007. Additionally, there has been a decline in foregoing contraception, particularly among younger teens aged 15 to 17. The risk of teen pregnancy has decreased due to increased contraceptive use among sexually active teens, including the use of various methods such as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and the withdrawal method. Factors like expanded educational opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology have influenced behavioral changes among teens. Behavioral changes in teen birth rates may be influenced by factors like expanded educational opportunities for women, improvements in contraceptive technology, and the impact of social media and internet use on teens' knowledge about sex and birth control. Some attribute the long-term decline in teen birth rates to the recession that began in 2007, suggesting that economic downturns make teenagers more cautious. However, the teen birth rate continued to decrease even after the recession, indicating other contributing factors. The MTV show 16 and Pregnant influenced teens to increase contraceptive use, leading to rapid declines in teen childbearing rates. Teen pregnancy prevention programs may also play a role in the declining birth rate. Teenage parents face challenges such as lower education levels and higher poverty rates. Teen parents often have lower education levels and higher poverty rates, leading to reduced economic opportunities. These factors also contribute to the increased likelihood of teens becoming pregnant. Teen mothers often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, with parents who receive public welfare benefits and have lower education levels. Teen sexual activity can increase the risk of STIs, leading to long-term health issues. Adolescents aged 15 to 19 have high rates of STIs. Children of teenage mothers have poorer outcomes, including chronic medical conditions, lower school readiness, and higher likelihood of giving birth during their teen years. Teen childbearing has societal impacts, including consequences for teens and their families. A study estimated cost savings to public programs from avoiding unintended pregnancies during the teen years, with a total savings of $4.4 billion from 1991 to 2015. This analysis considered cost savings to Medicaid for labor and delivery, postpartum care, infant care, and receipt of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental. Research on decreased or delayed teenage pregnancy and childbearing could provide insights into the impacts on teen parents, their children, and society."
