    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in existence since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for service in specific professions or occupations. Currently, there are over 50 federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs available. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been created by the federal government to forgive, cancel, or discharge student loan debt in exchange for service in certain professions. Over 50 programs are authorized, with approximately 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. Benefits are often tied to public service or specific occupations, but are increasingly offered as part of income-driven repayment plans. Loan forgiveness benefits are now offered in income-driven student loan repayment plans to incentivize public service or specific professions. These programs aim to provide debt relief to borrowers who have not fully repaid their student loans after an extended period of time. Loan forgiveness benefits and loan repayment benefits provide debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who enter public service or specific professions, or repay their loans through an income-driven repayment plan. Other forms of debt relief include discharge for disability, death, school closure, false certification, unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, successful defense to repayment, and bankruptcy discharge. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite launch in 1957, provided loan forgiveness to borrowers as a national security measure to improve education programs. The NDSL program was established to enhance national security by developing the skills of young men and women through low-interest loans for college students. It included a student loan forgiveness component aimed at increasing the number and quality of teachers in U.S. schools, with benefits targeted at those teaching in schools with low-income students or students with disabilities. Loan forgiveness was also available to individuals serving in Head Start programs. The NDSL program, aimed at enhancing national security through skills development, included a student loan forgiveness component for teachers in schools with low-income or disabled students. Loan forgiveness benefits were expanded to include individuals in Head Start programs and those serving in hostile areas in the Armed Forces. Borrowers could have a portion of their loans canceled based on years of public service. The program was later incorporated into the Higher Education Act of 1965 and renamed the Federal Perkins Loan Program. Other federal student loan forgiveness programs were established for professions in high-need areas. Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs were established to target borrowers in high-need areas. The Health Professions Student Loan Program (HPSLP) incorporated a loan forgiveness component for medical practitioners in areas with health workforce shortages. Over 50 such programs currently exist, authorized by federal law, providing policymakers with general information on their purpose and implementation. Currently, there are over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized under federal law. These programs aim to provide relief to borrowers through various means such as specified service, employment in certain professions, serving in specific locations, or repaying loans based on income-driven plans. The program descriptions are brief and not comprehensive, with citations provided for further details. Several federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs are authorized under federal law, each with unique characteristics such as borrower eligibility criteria, benefit amounts, means of providing benefits, and funding sources. This overview identifies parameters to broadly characterize these programs, facilitating the description and comparison of similarities and differences. The report uses a consistent set of parameters to address inconsistencies in terminology used across programs. In federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, borrowers must meet specific criteria to qualify for benefits. This includes working in certain roles or locations for a set period or repaying according to an income-driven plan. After the specified term, a portion of the student loan debt is forgiven or repaid. The key distinction lies in whether the benefits are part of the loan terms. Loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs differ in how benefits are provided to borrowers. Loan forgiveness benefits are considered entitlements to qualified borrowers, while loan repayment benefits are discretionary and subject to fund availability. Borrowers must meet eligibility criteria outlined in their loan documents to qualify for loan forgiveness. Loan forgiveness benefits are entitlements for qualified borrowers based on eligibility criteria outlined in loan documents. There are two categories: forgiveness for public service employment and income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs offer debt relief for specific service, profession, or location, with benefits subject to fund availability. Loan repayment programs provide debt relief for specific service, profession, or location by directly repaying some or all of the borrower's student loan debt or funding a separate entity to do so. These programs are separate from federal student loan programs and aim to address employment needs or shortages, recruit and retain qualified employees, and serve as additional compensation. Loan repayment benefits are often used as additional compensation for targeted employees who are difficult to recruit or retain. These benefits are discretionary and subject to fund availability. One key difference between debt relief programs is the tax liability incurred by the individual. Employment-focused loan forgiveness programs typically exclude forgiven debt from federal income tax, while income-driven repayment or public service forgiveness may result in a tax liability. The text discusses the tax implications of different debt relief programs. Loan forgiveness for public service employment may not incur tax liability, while forgiveness following income-driven repayment may result in a tax obligation. Federal student loans are eligible for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Federal student loans made through programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA) and administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), as well as student loans made through programs authorized by Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), are eligible for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Private education loans may also be eligible for some programs. Federal student loans are made through the Direct Loan program authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Previously, loans were also made through the Federal Family Education Loan program and the Federal Perkins Loan program. Loans in the Direct Loan program are made by the government with federal capital, administered by the U.S. Department of Education. In the Direct Loan program, loans are made by the government with federal capital, administered by the U.S. Department of Education. Activities such as loan origination, servicing, and collection are performed by federal contractors. Nonprofit guaranty agencies administer federal loan insurance and process loan forgiveness benefits. Loan types in the FFEL and Direct Loan programs had similar borrower terms and conditions, but differed in availability of loan forgiveness benefits. In the Perkins Loan program, loans were made by institutions of higher education with a combination of federal and institutional capital. The institution served as the lender and was responsible for loan origination, servicing, and processing loan cancelation benefits. Direct Subsidized Loans in the Direct Loan program are available only to undergraduate students with financial need. In the Direct Loan program, Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need. The federal government subsidizes these loans by not charging interest while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time, during a grace period before repayment, and during deferment. Borrowing limits apply, and in FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans totaling $21.5 billion were made. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to students without financial need. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. Borrowers are responsible for paying all accrued interest, with the option to defer payments until the loan enters repayment status. Borrowing limits apply, with 8.1 million loans totaling $49.8 billion made in FY2017. Direct PLUS Loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students and graduate/professional students. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans totaling $12.5 billion were made to parents of undergraduate students and $9.9 billion to graduate and professional students. There are no explicit limits to the amount an individual may borrow in PLUS Loans, with borrowing limits based on the cost of attendance and estimated financial assistance. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan, including loans from various programs such as Direct Loan, FFEL, HPSL, LDS, NSL, and HEAL. Borrowers can extend their repayment period through Consolidation Loans. Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine different loan types, including LDS, NSL, and HEAL, into a single fixed-rate loan. The interest rate is based on the weighted average of the loans being consolidated. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made. Perkins Loans were available to undergraduate and graduate students, with IHEs required to make them reasonably available to all eligible students. In FY2017, approximately 253,000 Perkins Loans totaling $782,230 million were made. Interest on Perkins Loans is fixed at 5% per year, and borrowers engaged in public service may have a portion of their loans cancelled. HRSA makes student loans to health professions students through five loan programs, totaling approximately $162.8 million in academic year 2016-2017. In academic year 2016-2017, HRSA made 20,849 loans totaling $162.8 million through five programs. These programs offer low interest rate loans to full-time students pursuing degrees in various healthcare fields. For example, one program provides 5% fixed interest rate loans to medical students. Participants must be U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents and demonstrate financial need. The HRSA program offers need-based, low-interest loans to students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in healthcare fields. Participants must be U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents, complete a residency in primary care, and practice in a primary care field for 10 years. Loan recipients failing to meet service requirements must repay loans at a higher interest rate. In 2016-2017, HRSA provided 252 loans totaling $17.8 million. The HRSA program offers low-interest loans to students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing healthcare degrees in various fields. Participants must be U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. In 2016-2017, HRSA provided loans totaling $21.7 million for allopathic or osteopathic medicine, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, or veterinary medicine, and $31.8 million for nursing degrees. The HRSA program provides low-interest loans to financially needy U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 10,138 loans totaling $31.8 million for nursing school faculty candidates. Nursing schools administer the program for eligible advanced nursing programs. Additionally, the HEAL program no longer issues new loans but continues to manage existing ones. The HEAL program, administered by the PHSA, no longer issues new loans but continues to manage outstanding loans for various healthcare-related degrees. Borrowers are still responsible for repayment. In addition to federal student loan programs, student loans are also offered by private financial institutions, state-supported programs, and other nonfederal entities. Private education loans, including student loans from private financial institutions, state-supported programs, and IHEs, have specific terms and conditions set by the lender. While not part of federal loan programs, some federal repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to provide debt relief based on eligibility criteria, each with unique features. The report outlines categories of debt relief programs, qualifying criteria for borrowers, and program components like qualifying service types and debt relief amounts. For program-specific details, refer to Appendix A. The section presents primary categories of debt relief programs in order of availability to borrowers, starting with loan forgiveness entitlement programs, followed by programs for public service and income-driven repayment plans. Programs for broad public service or employment needs are then discussed, followed by programs for public service in government employment. Loan forgiveness for public service employment provides debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations or public service. These benefits are entitlements written into federal student loan terms. Table 1 summarizes the various programs offered, including forgiveness for single specified employers. Loan forgiveness for public service employment programs are highlighted in Table 1, showing benefits available based on employer, occupation, and economic circumstances during repayment. Programs are ranked by the scale of benefits offered. Table 1 ranks loan forgiveness programs by the scale of benefits offered to borrowers based on specific eligibility criteria, including service type and occupation. Programs are available to teachers, public service workers, law enforcement personnel, public defenders, and individuals working in federal, state, local, tribal government agencies, and certain nonprofit organizations. Loan forgiveness programs are available to a broad array of individuals employed in public service, including federal, state, local, or tribal government agencies, and certain nonprofit organizations. Borrowers must serve for a minimum period of time, with service commitments lasting between 1 to 10 years. These programs provide debt relief to borrowers who repay federal student loans based on their income for an extended period but have not fully repaid their debt. The benefits are entitlements written into the terms of widely available federal student loans. Loan forgiveness programs are available to individuals in public service, with service commitments lasting 1 to 10 years. These programs provide debt relief to borrowers who repay federal student loans based on their income for an extended period but have not fully repaid their debt. Table 2 summarizes various loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment, organized by eligibility date. Unlike Table 1, these programs are not grouped by availability or financial resources, as factors and borrower characteristics affect program participation. The various loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment do not have specific employer, occupational, or service requirements. Borrowers must make monthly payments towards their federal student loans for 20 to 25 years, based on factors like debt amount, family size, and income. Monthly payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income. Loan repayment for public service employment is based on factors like student loan debt, family size, and income. Monthly payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income. At the end of the repayment period, the remaining balance is forgiven. These programs benefit borrowers in specific occupations or public service roles, providing debt relief and helping agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. Loan repayment programs for public service employment and addressing broad employment needs are available to qualified borrowers, subject to program funds. These programs serve as additional compensation and help agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. They are not entitlements and are smaller in scale compared to loan forgiveness programs. Loan repayment programs for public service employment and addressing broad employment needs are available to qualified borrowers, subject to program funds. The table highlights eligibility criteria such as repayment benefits for borrowers employed with specified employers or occupations, and based on economic circumstances. Programs are organized by operational status and administering department or agency. Unlike loan forgiveness programs, these programs are not grouped by availability scope or financial resources. Table 3 shows 19 loan repayment programs targeting various employment needs, with a focus on health-related occupations. Programs also cater to legal occupations and large animal veterinarians providing emergency services. Borrowers are not required to fulfill service obligations with a single employer. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees are narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs. Service commitments generally last between one and five years. Borrowers may work for multiple employers within the broader class of employers, with some programs requiring service in underserved rural or disadvantaged areas. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees are tailored to meet agency-specific recruitment and retention needs. Information on the scale of these programs is often not readily available, but the Office of Personnel Management reports annually on the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program. Table 4 summarizes various loan repayment programs offered by individual federal agencies for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. Repayment benefits may be available to borrowers employed by a single government agency or federal government employers, and may be limited to specific employment criteria. Table 4 summarizes loan repayment programs operated by federal agencies, detailing eligibility criteria such as specific occupations, economic circumstances, and administering departments. Unlike Table 1, these programs are not grouped by availability or financial resources due to inconsistent data. Table 4 summarizes 25 federal loan repayment programs, including 8 for Armed Forces recruitment. Programs vary in eligibility, some open to all agency employees while others target specific occupations. Loan repayment programs are designed to meet employment needs or shortages, with service commitments typically lasting between one and five years. Eligibility for benefits can be based on economic circumstances at the time of borrowing or during the repayment period. Loan repayment programs can provide benefits based on economic circumstances at the time of borrowing or during the repayment period. Eligibility for benefits may consider factors like disadvantaged backgrounds or high monthly loan payments. Programs vary in the amount of loan forgiveness or repayment benefits offered and the schedule for providing them. Several programs offer to forgive the entire amount of an individual's outstanding student loans by requiring a certain number of payments towards the balance, with the remaining balance forgiven after a specified period. Another method is through employers providing repayment benefits in the form of a flat dollar amount, either as a lump sum or regular payments. Some programs may offer varying flat rates for individuals. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer varying flat rates or a percentage of outstanding loans as benefits, with restrictions on eligibility for borrowers in default or receiving benefits from other programs for the same service. Some federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions that prevent borrowers from receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same qualifying service, with penalties for not completing the service. For example, the Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program does not allow benefits for the same service used for other programs like PSLF or AmeriCorps Education Awards. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions on receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service, with penalties for non-completion. Certain programs require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs under the Higher Education Act have restrictions based on citizenship and immigration status. Availability of benefits is limited to U.S. citizens, nationals, legal permanent residents, and eligible noncitizens. Defaulted loans may restrict access to forgiveness and repayment benefits, depending on the program. In loan forgiveness programs, defaulted loans may impact eligibility for benefits. For example, in the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, borrowers may be eligible for forgiveness if they have made satisfactory repayment arrangements. In the Perkins Loan Cancellation program, borrowers with defaulted loans may qualify for forgiveness under certain conditions. Clawback provisions may require recipients to repay benefits if they fail to fulfill service obligations. Clawback provisions in federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs may require participants to repay the unearned portion of benefits received, plus interest and punitive fees. Some programs exempt borrowers from repayment if they become disabled or pass away. Forgiveness or repayment of student loan debt is considered taxable income by the IRS. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income for federal income taxation purposes under certain instances. Some programs specify that forgiven loans are not included in gross income, such as the Federal Perkins Loan program. Other programs may still qualify for exclusion under certain conditions outlined in the Internal Revenue Code. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income for federal income taxation purposes under certain instances. Loans that are repaid or forgiven must have been borrowed to assist an individual in attending a qualified educational institution and must meet specific conditions outlined in IRC Section 108(f). Exclusions are also provided for certain programs like the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program and state programs eligible under the Public Health Service Act. If the requirements are not met, individuals are responsible for paying any income tax liability. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income for federal income taxation purposes under certain instances. Individuals are responsible for paying any income tax liability associated with the loan forgiveness or repayment benefits if specific requirements are not met. Some programs provide supplemental funds to offset tax liability. However, there is debate on the effectiveness of providing these benefits to encourage borrowers. Researchers debate the effectiveness of loan repayment or forgiveness benefits in encouraging borrowers to enter specific fields or government service. Three main issues are explored: whether individuals would enter or remain in these fields without loan forgiveness, if student loan debt is the main barrier, and if debt relief encourages students to take out more loans for education. The analysis discusses the effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in influencing individuals' career choices and the costs incurred by the federal government. It considers whether recipients would have pursued qualifying service without the programs and compares their career paths to assess the impact. The effectiveness of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs in influencing career choices is discussed. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) examined the career trajectories of loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) to compare with similar individuals who did not receive loan repayment. The purpose of the IRP's loan repayment component is to encourage individuals to complete medical research at the NIH and to retain qualified health professionals in medical research. The NIH's loan repayment program aims to encourage individuals to pursue medical research and retain qualified health professionals in the field. A study found that recipients were more likely to continue medical research at the NIH and in their careers overall. While the program may be effective, other factors also influence individuals' career choices. The NIH's loan repayment program aims to retain qualified health professionals in medical research. Some individuals may have entered certain fields or taken positions even without loan repayments, making the program potentially unnecessary and ineffective in some cases. Loan repayment incentives may be more effective when job opportunities are abundant, such as for recent graduates weighing multiple employment options. Some healthcare providers in rural areas would have taken their jobs even without loan repayment benefits. However, the NIH found that recipients of loan repayment awards were more likely to accept positions with competing job offers, especially physicians who were attracted by the unique benefit of loan repayment. This led to increased retention in research roles at the NIH. Loan repayment programs can be crucial for recruitment in certain cases. Loan repayment benefits are effective at retaining staff in research roles at the NIH and other federal agencies. However, uncertainties in funding and award amounts may undermine the effectiveness of these programs as recruitment incentives. Loan repayment programs may not provide sufficient incentive for individuals to enter and remain in certain professions. Researchers suggest that financial benefits should offset a share of education costs to be successful. Some programs, like GESLRP, require participants to pay federal income taxes on loan repayment benefits, making them less attractive. Employee Student Loan Repayment Program (GESLRP) participants are responsible for the tax liability, which can account for 39% of the loan repayment amount. The short-term nature of these programs may lead to turnover, as individuals may change jobs once they have received the full benefit. This could result in a less stable workforce for employers. Some researchers have found that individuals with service obligations have shorter tenures in a position. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are based on the assumption that student loan debt influences career choices, but research shows that debt may not always be a significant factor. Other deterrents, such as geographic location or lack of interest in a specific field, can also impact employment decisions. For example, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program offers benefits to physicians who practice in certain areas. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program (NHSCLRP) provides loan repayment benefits to physicians and other health professionals in specific geographic areas. Lower compensation levels are a deterrent for physicians entering primary care, but other factors like specialty preference and administrative duties also play a role. Debt levels may influence career decisions for certain racial and ethnic groups, leading to the availability of loan forgiveness and repayment programs for those not affected by debt. Despite criticisms, these programs offer financial assistance. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may not fully compensate for the lower lifetime earnings gap between primary care and specialty physicians. High levels of debt can influence job choice, as seen in the influence of law school debt on legal practice. In a literature review, high levels of law school debt lead recent graduates to work at large law firms for higher earnings. Undergraduates with higher debt levels tend to choose higher salary jobs over education-related or nonprofit fields. Law school debt may play a secondary role in career choices, with demographic characteristics being a more dominant factor. The impact of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs on career choices of law school graduates is uncertain. Demographic characteristics may play a more significant role in decision-making than debt. There is a question of whether these programs lead students to take on more debt for education expenses. Income-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) offer student loan debt relief by capping monthly payments at a percentage of discretionary income for a set period, leading to potential forgiveness of the remaining balance. Critics argue that tying payments to income rather than debt may encourage over-borrowing and reduce sensitivity to education costs. Some argue that student loan forgiveness programs may lead to over-borrowing and reduce sensitivity to education costs. The costs to the government for providing loan forgiveness and repayment benefits depend on the program structure and can include loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. Loan forgiveness programs are part of federal student loan programs, which include federal direct loans and federal loan guarantees. The costs for these programs are funded through mandatory appropriations and are measured based on their estimated long-term costs to the government. The federal budget reflects the costs of providing loan subsidies and administrative expenses for federal direct loans and loan guarantees. Loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, discounted to the time of loan disbursement. A positive subsidy cost indicates a cost to the government. Loan subsidy costs can be positive or negative, indicating either a cost or a return to the government. Loan forgiveness benefits increase subsidy costs by altering expected cash flows. For example, Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers discharges a portion of borrowers' loan balances, relieving them of responsibility. Under loan forgiveness programs like the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program and income-based repayment plans, a portion of borrowers' loan balances is discharged by the government, reducing cash flows and increasing loan subsidy costs. This cost is accounted for in the fiscal year the loan was made. The income-based repayment (IBR) and income-contingent repayment (ICR) plans have a maximum repayment period. Borrower benefits in loan repayment programs are funded through appropriations for the fiscal year. Funding for these programs may be discretionary or mandatory, and benefits are available based on the availability of funds. Insufficient funding may limit benefits to eligible borrowers. Funding for loan repayment programs can be discretionary or mandatory, with benefits based on availability of funds. Examples include GESLR, JRJ, and NHSCLRP. Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits are unique, specified in loan terms, and granted by the institution. The Perkins Loan program offers loan forgiveness benefits, but it is not a federal credit program like most others. Institutions have been canceling Perkins Loans for eligible borrowers without federal funding since FY2009. The costs of loan cancellation have been absorbed by institutions without reimbursement from the government. The costs of loan cancellation without reimbursement from the federal government are tracked by ED. Loan forgiveness and repayment program costs are funded separately, with administrative costs accounted for separately and funded through annual appropriations. Loan repayment programs are administered by various agencies with different funding mechanisms for administrative costs. Loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs are funded through annual appropriations, with varying administrative cost funding mechanisms. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government, with estimates provided for future loan forgiveness program costs. Loan repayment programs often have data available on benefits provided or the number of borrowers receiving benefits in a fiscal year. The text discusses cost estimates for loan forgiveness programs, including the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, with an estimated cost of $1.5 billion over a five-year period. Data on debt relief provided and recipients are presented in a program-by-program basis in the appendix. The Department of Education (ED) estimated costs for loan forgiveness programs, including REPAYE and PAYE plans. For REPAYE, approximately 6 million borrowers from 1994 to 2025 are eligible, costing $15.4 billion. For PAYE, the estimated cost over FY2012-FY2021 is $2.1 billion for 1.67 million borrowers. In a 2012 NPRM, the Department of Education estimated a cost of $2.1 billion over 10 years for the PAYE plan, with approximately 1.67 million borrowers participating. About 400,000 borrowers were expected to receive loan forgiveness through public service loan forgiveness or after 20 years of repayment, with an average forgiven amount of $41,000 per borrower. The Department of Education estimated that approximately 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts would repay their loans under the IBR plan, with no estimations on forgiveness benefits. For pre-July 1, 2014 borrowers, it was estimated that 126,000 borrowers from the FY2009 cohort would repay under IBR, with 44,000 having some debt forgiven after 25 years. For the FY2012 cohort, 146,000 borrowers were estimated to repay under IBR, with 52,000 having debt forgiven after 25 years. Loan forgiveness benefits are new and contingent on borrower repayment behavior and labor market experiences. Loan forgiveness benefits are relatively new and contingent on borrower repayment behavior and labor market experiences. Congress may need to assess the availability and structure of federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs to determine if changes are necessary. Issues such as the availability of multiple programs for similar activities and the potential for financial windfalls for borrowers should be examined. The availability and structure of federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs need assessment to avoid overlapping benefits and unnecessary administrative costs. Borrowers may qualify for multiple programs, leading to potential financial windfalls. Individuals may qualify for benefits under multiple federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Some programs have restrictions on receiving benefits from multiple sources, while others do not. For example, an individual working in a federal agency could receive up to $10,000 per year in loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP and qualify for forgiveness of the remaining student loan debt after 10 years of service under the PSLF program. After 10 years of service with a federal agency, individuals may receive benefits under multiple student loan forgiveness programs. Overlapping programs may result in receiving benefits for the same service from different programs. For example, the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) both offer repayment benefits to nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. The Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) is available to nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The program grants money to nursing schools to establish their own loan repayment programs. This may create an administrative burden on the HRSA as both the NELRP and NFLRP are available to the same group of individuals. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing these programs to avoid double benefits. Many loan forgiveness and repayment programs are intended to encourage individuals to enter specified jobs or public service. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing programs that provide double benefits or serve the same purpose. Loan forgiveness plans may offer windfalls to individuals regardless of benefit availability. Some loan forgiveness programs have no limits on forgiven amounts, potentially leading to individuals borrowing more than they would otherwise, knowing their loans could be forgiven. Congress may need to consider setting limits on forgiveness amounts to address this issue. Some research suggests that loan forgiveness programs may not influence individuals' career choices if they are already seeking employment in certain fields. However, these programs may be somewhat effective in retaining skilled employees for future careers. Congress may need to tailor loan repayment programs to specific needs. Loan repayment programs can impact an individual's job choice and career retention. Congress should consider more specific funding controls to tailor these programs effectively. Insufficient data hinders the assessment of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs' effectiveness in achieving objectives. Limited programmatic data is available for some loan forgiveness programs, such as the PSLF program, due to the lengthy qualification period and lack of awarded benefits. Borrowers must work in public service for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments before becoming eligible for forgiveness. As forgiveness benefits were only first available in October 2017, little is known about actual borrower experiences. Future participation projections are challenging as borrowers are not required to document their public service employment. Loan forgiveness is available for borrowers who work in public service jobs and repay according to income-driven repayment plans. However, data on program participants beyond what is necessary for administration is limited, making it difficult to track beneficiaries' employment status after the qualifying period ends. The availability of loan forgiveness for public service workers is limited by data collection on program participants, making it challenging to track employment status post-qualification. Improved data collection is necessary to assess program effects and potential design changes for effectiveness. Loan relief varies by program, with some offering relief for specific loan types or amounts, while others cover multiple loan types. The availability of loan forgiveness and repayment programs varies, with some programs offering relief for specific loan types or amounts, while others have fewer limitations. Concerns have been raised about the potential for students to over-borrow due to the availability of these programs. Consideration should be given to imposing additional limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for forgiveness and repayment. Repayment or forgiveness programs may incentivize students to over-borrow federal student loans. Should borrowing for expenses covered by expected family contribution be allowed if later discharged through loan forgiveness? Selection criteria for loan repayment programs vary among agencies, leading to unpredictability. In 2016, 34 federal agencies provided loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP. Participants must sign a service agreement to serve for at least three years and reimburse benefits if they do not complete their service. Participants cannot be in the excepted service, but agencies can determine who receives benefits. The Department of Defense uses the program to recruit employees in nursing, engineering, and contracting. The GESLRP is utilized by various federal agencies to recruit employees in specific fields. Each agency can customize their loan repayment program, leading to varying eligibility requirements that may be confusing for participants. This could limit the program's ability to attract qualified individuals to work in different agencies. The appendix provides program-specific details for each program in the analysis, including statutory citations, administering agency, program purpose, eligible loans, service requirements, benefit limits, eligibility restrictions, tax treatment, budget classification, and annual appropriations. The curr_chunk provides detailed information on program participants, federal income tax treatment of benefits, budgetary classification, annual appropriations, loans discharged or repaid, program beneficiaries, and relevant CRS reports. The information is sourced from authoritative sources and is relevant to the overall analysis of the report. For complete details on a specific program, readers are directed to legal citations, federal agencies, or CRS reports. Abbreviations are used throughout the text. The curr_chunk provides information on various loan forgiveness programs for public service employment, categorized by specific occupations, employers, or public service roles. Programs for income-driven repayment and addressing employment needs are also included, with a focus on federal government service. Abbreviations such as FFEL and PHSA are used throughout the appendix. The loan forgiveness programs in this section offer debt relief to qualified borrowers in specific occupations or public service roles. These benefits are entitlements for federal student loans and include the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student loan balances for borrowers who have made 120 full, scheduled payments after October 1, 2007. Student loan forgiveness is available for borrowers who have made 120 full, scheduled monthly payments on Direct Loan program loans while employed full-time in public service. Eligible loan types include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, Graduate PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Qualifying service includes employment in public service organizations, AmeriCorps, or the Peace Corps. Public service organizations can be government agencies, tribal colleges, public service agencies, tax-exempt nonprofit organizations, or private nonprofit organizations. Student loan forgiveness is available for borrowers who have made 120 full, scheduled monthly payments on Direct Loan program loans while employed full-time in public service.
