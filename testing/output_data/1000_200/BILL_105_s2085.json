    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the Truth in Employment Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that an atmosphere of trust and civility in labor-management relationships is crucial for a productive workplace and a healthy economy. The tactic of \"salting\" with union organizers infiltrating workplaces has become a form of aggressive harassment, threatening the balance of rights in collective bargaining. Union organizers are increasingly seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm to put nonunion competitors out of business. Employers should not discriminate against employees based on their views on collective bargaining, but they should expect job applicants to be focused on using their skills to further the employer's business goals. SEC. 102. PURPOSES.\n\nThe purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and prevent pressure on employers to hire disruptive individuals.\n\nSEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS. SEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS.\n\nAmendment to Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act clarifies that employers are not required to hire individuals seeking employment to further another employment or agency status. This does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants to self-organization, join labor organizations, bargain collectively, or engage in concerted activities for collective bargaining or mutual aid. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress finds that bargaining unit determinations require case-by-case adjudication for accuracy. The National Labor Relations Board has a history of holding hearings to decide on single location bargaining units. A blanket rule limiting factors for unit appropriateness goes against the goal of labor relations stability.\n\nSEC. 202. PURPOSE. The purpose of this title is to ensure that the National Labor Relations Board conducts a hearing process and specific analysis of whether a single location bargaining unit is appropriate. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include provisions for determining the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of a single employer. Factors such as functional integration, centralized control, common skills, and bargaining history will be considered in making this determination. TITLE III--ATTORNEYS FEES\n\nSEC. 301. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations lack expertise and resources when facing actions by the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively leveled the playing field for these entities. Due to the Board's greater resources, certain small entities should be awarded fees and costs when prevailing against the Board. The purpose of this title is to address this imbalance. The purpose of this title is to ensure that small businesses and labor organizations are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions by the National Labor Relations Board due to expenses. It aims to reduce the disparity in resources and expertise between these entities and the Board, making the Board more accountable by awarding fees and costs to small entities when they prevail against the Board. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section on awards of attorneys' fees and costs. Sec. 20 of the National Labor Relations Act allows for the awarding of fees and expenses to employers or labor organizations who are prevailing parties in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board, under certain conditions. The National Labor Relations Act allows for the awarding of fees and expenses to employers or labor organizations who prevail in civil actions against the Board, under specific criteria. The National Labor Relations Act allows for the awarding of fees and expenses to employers or labor organizations who prevail in civil actions against the Board, under specific criteria. Any appeal of a determination of fees shall be determined without regard to whether the position of the United States was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act specifies that the provisions regarding agency and court proceedings apply to cases initiated after the enactment of the Act."
