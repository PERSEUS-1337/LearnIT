    "content": "The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 aims to make research funded by the Federal Government accessible to the public. Congress recognizes the importance of sharing research findings to advance science and benefit society. The Act defines a \"Federal agency\" as an Executive agency under title 5, United States Code. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 requires Federal agencies with research expenditures over $100,000,000 to develop a public access policy for research papers. This policy includes submitting the final manuscript of research papers to the agency, incorporating peer review changes, and replacing the final manuscript with the published version if necessary. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 mandates Federal agencies to provide free online public access to final peer-reviewed manuscripts or published versions within 6 months of publication. It also requires the creation of an online bibliography linking to full-text papers and the long-term preservation of research findings in a digital repository. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 requires Federal agencies to store research findings in a digital repository with free public access, interoperability, and long-term preservation. The policy applies to researchers employed or funded by the Federal agency, ensuring public domain works are marked as such and made immediately available. The Federal research public access policy requires marking public domain material as such and making it immediately available. Exclusions include laboratory notes, preliminary data analyses, and classified research. The Federal research public access policy requires agencies to report on their policies annually to Congress, ensuring public access to research findings. Each report under this subsection shall include a statement on the effectiveness of the Federal research public access policy, a list of papers published in peer-reviewed journals funded by the Federal agency, a corresponding list of papers made available by the agency, and a summary of the time between public availability of each paper. The Federal agency must provide a summary of the time between public availability of each paper in a journal and in the online repository, and make this information available to the public on its website."
