Lawmakers negotiated a two-year agreement to set higher levels of defense and non-defense discretionary spending for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 to avoid deep budget cuts in the new fiscal year starting on October 1, 2015. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry criticized the defense spending cuts under sequestration for undermining the armed forces' capabilities, readiness, morale, and modernization. The impact of defense spending cuts at sequestration levels is hindering various sectors such as economic recovery, business growth, public health, education, oversight, scientific research, infrastructure, and emergency response. NDD United, representing over 2,500 organizations, argues that these cuts are detrimental to the nation's overall well-being. The sequester's impact includes hindering scientific discovery, eroding infrastructure, and threatening emergency response. House bills for fiscal year 2016 propose cuts to education and housing, risking harm to vulnerable Americans and weakening economic recovery. Eliminating the sequester would boost Gross National Product. Eliminating the sequester would increase GDP by 0.4% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2017, with a rise in employment by 500,000 next year and 300,000 in 2017. Relief from the sequester would allow Congress to pass appropriations legislation before the fiscal year starts, preventing a government shutdown. The 2013 government shutdown cost 120,000 private-sector jobs, shrunk GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%, and resulted in 6.6 million days of lost work through furloughs. To prevent another government shutdown and fund vital services for fiscal year 2016, immediate negotiations on a budget agreement are necessary. This should include raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester by the same amount. Congress should agree to offset the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction. It is important for Congress to agree on sequester relief, regardless of reaching an agreement on offsetting deficit reduction through closing tax loopholes. Bipartisan, bicameral agreement reached on sequester relief. A bipartisan measure will be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. Members appointed by the Speaker of the House will be responsible for negotiating the measure. The measure described in subsection (a) will be negotiated by a total number of individuals appointed by the Speaker, Minority Leader of the House, Majority Leader of the Senate, and Minority Leader of the Senate. Approval of the measure will require a majority of the individuals appointed, and if approved, it will be considered under specific procedures outlined in the Budget Control Act of 2011. In subsection (a), a measure will be negotiated by individuals appointed by key leaders, and approval will require a majority vote. The measure will be considered under procedures outlined in the Budget Control Act of 2011, with specific date substitutions. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 AND 2017. If the measure described under section 2(a) is not enacted into law before October 1, 2015, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to adjust the discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to adjust discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Adjustments made before the enactment of the Act have no effect if it is not passed before October 1, 2015."
