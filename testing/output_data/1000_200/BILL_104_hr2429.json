    "content": "The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The purpose and findings of the Act are outlined in section 2. The \"Farms for the Future Act Amendments of 1995\" aims to provide financially competitive options for maintaining prime, unique, and strategic farmland in agricultural production, as agricultural producers lack incentives to retain such lands. Federal assistance is necessary to incentivize landowners to preserve prime, unique, and strategic farmland in agricultural production. Federal assistance is needed to encourage landowners to protect valuable farmland through the acquisition of easements. The term 'qualifying farmland' refers to land crucial for agricultural production and at risk of being converted to incompatible uses. A 'farmland protection easement' restricts land use to support continued agricultural production. The text discusses the requirements for farmland protection easements, which restrict land use to support agricultural production and bind future landowners. Eligible states with approved programs can acquire these easements, and the Secretary may provide cost-sharing through a matching grant program. Matching grants are provided to eligible States and local governments for acquiring farmland protection easements to safeguard agricultural land from incompatible uses. The grants are typically on a 50-50 matching basis but can be up to 90 percent for States actively protecting farmland. States are limited to receiving 10 percent of the total grant amount available for a fiscal year. The Secretary ensures that funds are used to protect farmland, with priority given to lands important to the State's agriculture industry. The purchase price of easements acquired should not exceed fair market value. Authorization of necessary appropriations is provided for each fiscal year."
