    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teachers in the Classroom Act\". It includes findings related to teachers. Congress finds that enrollment in elementary and secondary schools is at record levels, with an expected increase of over a million students in 1998. The increase in student enrollment will continue for the next decade, particularly affecting high poverty urban and rural areas and states with rapid population growth. Schools will need to expand to accommodate the growing number of students. To keep up with the growing student population, schools will need to hire 150,000 additional teachers in the next decade. Research shows that students in smaller classes learn more in the early grades and maintain an academic edge even after returning to normal-sized classrooms. Adequate education and preparation are crucial. It is important to adequately educate and prepare America's children for the competitive global economy by improving the learning environment for each student. Congress should fund positions for teachers without increasing the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or debt, and provide resources to keep pace with growing enrollment and reduce classroom sizes if possible. The grant program is established to improve the learning environment for students without increasing bureaucracy or debt. The Secretary of Education can award grants to Governors for hiring teachers to reduce overcrowded classes. Governors must apply to receive the grant, and local educational agencies must establish a trust fund for the funds received. The agency must establish a trust fund for payments received under the Act and ensure funds are used to hire new teachers within 2 years. They must follow accounting practices set by the Governor, allow state access to records, and increase the number of teachers in classrooms. Personnel hired under the Act must be reviewed annually for performance. The agency must review annually the performance of personnel hired under the Act, obligate them for a one-year period, repay any unspent funds to the State within 27 months, use funds to supplement non-Federal sources for student education, and apply for funding annually from the Governor.
