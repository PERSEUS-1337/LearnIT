The Congress finds that the Federal Government sends billions of dollars to States annually for various purposes such as health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. States receive this funding through different means like grants, loans, and direct appropriations. Some States are more effective than others in utilizing these taxpayer dollars. States vary in effectiveness when spending Federal taxpayer dollars on various issues like health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. Activity-based total accountability can help identify the most efficient States, leading to competition and better accountability in how tax dollars are spent. Lower activity costs can serve as models for other States to ensure taxpayers get the best value for their dollar. The purpose of this Act is to improve government accountability at the State level by requiring annual accountings in a format that uses total accountability measures, including unit-cost data, to ensure taxpayers get the best value for their dollar. State governments receiving Federal financial assistance must submit a State fiscal accounting report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 15 days before the end of the Federal fiscal year. The report should include a one-page summary of total funding and expenditures for each budget entity, along with a unit-cost summary for each entity. The Director is required to publish these reports on their website within 30 days of receiving them. SEC. 4. STANDARDIZATION OF STATE FISCAL ACCOUNTING REPORTS. The Director will standardize State fiscal accounting reports for comparison. States must submit program descriptions within 180 days. A classification system will be based on submitted descriptions and relevant data. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying agency activities, identify conduct for each activity unit, and define performance measures for each agency activity. SEC. 5. UNIT-COST SUMMARY. Each unit-cost summary for a budget entity of a State government shall be one page long and include funds available, agency activities, and expenditure reconciliation. SEC. 6. STATEMENT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE. A statement of funds available shall identify each source of funds for expenditure by the budget entity and the sum of all amounts. Sources include State appropriations, Federal financial assistance, and other sources determined appropriate. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. The agency activity line item listing must identify the activity, total funds expended, number of activity units, and unit cost. It should also describe the conduct, purposes, and intended beneficiaries of the activity. Each agency activity must be identified with its purpose and intended beneficiaries. Expenditures for activities without measurable accomplishments must be allocated to similar activities with measurable outcomes. Total expenditures should include payments to contractors or subordinate entities. The total amount of funds expended by a budget entity should include payments to contractors or subordinate entities. The unit-cost of an agency activity is determined using a specific formula. The formula for determining the unit-cost of an agency activity includes UC, m, and q as defined terms. SEC. 8. RECONCILIATION OF FUNDS AVAILABLE WITH ADJUSTED EXPENDITURES. This section outlines the process for reconciling funds available with adjusted expenditures, including identifying adjusted expenditures and explaining any differences. Adjusted expenditures are determined by the formula AE = EXP + PT + REV. The formula AE = EXP + PT + REV is used to calculate adjusted expenditures. EXP represents all expenditures by the budget entity for agency activities, PT is the sum of pass-throughs, and REV is the sum of reversions. Budget entities can identify pass-throughs and reversions based on criteria set by the Director. Noncompliance is addressed in Section 9. SEC. 9. NONCOMPLIANCE.\n\nIf the Director finds a State government failed to submit a timely fiscal report, 10% of federal financial assistance will be withheld for the following year.\n\nSEC. 10. RULES.\n\nThe Director can create necessary rules for implementing this Act.\n\nSEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. The Director is authorized to make rules for implementing the Act. Definitions include \"State government,\" \"budget entity,\" \"agency activity,\" and \"Federal financial assistance.\""
