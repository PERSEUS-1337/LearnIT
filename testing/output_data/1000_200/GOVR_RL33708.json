Monopoly and monopolist terms are used descriptively, without implying legality. Monopolization is prohibited by the Sherman and Clayton Acts, and unfair acts in commerce are prohibited by the Federal Trade Commission Act. Monopoly and monopolization are terms used descriptively in antitrust law. The concept of \"no fault\" monopolization does not exist in US antitrust law. The Rule of Reason balances anticompetitive actions with procompetitive effects. To determine if monopolization has occurred, it must be established if an entity is a monopolist and if they have unlawfully monopolized the relevant market. The legal obligation of a monopolist to deal with competitors is not clearly defined, especially in cases of monopolist ownership of an \"essential facility.\" The Supreme Court has not recognized a doctrine requiring such dealings. Antitrust prosecutions have raised questions about this issue. The Supreme Court has not recognized a doctrine requiring monopolists to deal with competitors, especially in cases of owning an \"essential facility.\" Recent antitrust prosecutions by the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission illustrate the difference between monopoly and monopolization in antitrust law. Monopoly is defined as the power to control prices or exclude competition, with the focus on the impact on consumers and competition. The antitrust laws focus on protecting competition, not individual competitors. Courts have varied on what market share constitutes a \"monopolist\" since the Sherman Act in 1890. Without proof of guilty behavior, there can be no automatic finding of \"monopolization.\" The antitrust laws focus on protecting competition, not individual competitors. Without proof of guilty behavior, a finding of \"monopoly power\" does not automatically equate to monopolization prohibited by antitrust laws. Size or monopoly alone does not constitute unlawful monopolization. Antitrust analysis focuses on specific competitive harms associated with a merger, not just its size. The antitrust laws focus on protecting competition, not individual competitors. Antitrust analysis focuses on specific competitive harms associated with a merger, not just its size. The key for review is whether the merger will harm consumers, not the sheer size of the corporate entities involved. Both the Sherman and Clayton Acts prohibit monopolization and attempted monopolization. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers that may lessen competition or create a monopoly, but the Rule of Reason doctrine allows for flexibility in certain circumstances. It balances the anti-competitive effects with any pro-competitive benefits. The focus is on protecting competition, not individual competitors, and the key is whether a merger will harm consumers. Both the Sherman and Clayton Acts prohibit monopolization and attempted monopolization. The definition of a market entity as a monopolist or facing charges of monopolization depends on how the market is defined. A broader definition of the product and geographic market can impact the determination of monopolization. The more expansive the market definition, the less likely a defendant will be seen as a monopolist or engaging in monopolization. The determination of a market participant as a monopolist or engaging in monopolization depends on the market definition. A broader market definition makes it less likely for a defendant to be seen as a monopolist. The courts use a subjective test rather than a specific market share percentage to determine monopoly status. The determination of a market participant as a monopolist or engaging in monopolization depends on the market definition. A monopolist must possess the power to control prices or exclude competition. Simply having monopoly power is not enough to support a monopolization charge. A monopolist must have the power to control prices or exclude competition. However, simply having monopoly power is not sufficient to support a charge of monopolization. Courts must evaluate business conduct to distinguish between lawful actions with a legitimate purpose and unlawful predatory behavior that harms competition. The antitrust laws aim to protect competition, not competitors. In antitrust analysis, courts must consider the consumer protection purpose of the laws, focusing on protecting competition, not individual competitors. To prove attempted monopolization, predatory or anticompetitive behavior must be shown, along with specific intent to achieve monopoly status and a \"dangerous probability\" of success. Determining the relevant market is crucial in assessing the likelihood of monopolization. The Spectrum Sports Court emphasized the importance of determining the relevant market in antitrust analysis. Courts must consider the defendant's ability to lessen competition in that market to assess the likelihood of monopolization. The Supreme Court's 1919 ruling in United States v. Colgate & Co. established that entities, even monopolists, have the right to choose who they deal with unless it constitutes anticompetitive behavior or an attempt to expand their monopoly. The Sherman Act does not restrict a trader or manufacturer's discretion in conducting private business unless there is a purpose to create or maintain a monopoly. The Sherman Act allows traders and manufacturers to freely choose who they deal with in their private business, unless it leads to anticompetitive behavior. The legality of a monopolist's actions affecting competition in a different market depends on their position relative to competitors. The Colgate precept of seller choice remains unchanged by patent or copyright laws, unless fraud is involved. The monopolist's position in an adjacent market affects competition, and whether they must deal advantageously with entities in that market depends on their actions to extend their lawful monopoly. Courts have reached opposite conclusions on this issue in cases like Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc. and In re Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation. In Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc. and In re Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation, the issue of extending lawful monopoly into the service/repair market was raised. Kodak tied the sale of repair parts to its service, eliminating competition from ISOs. Xerox Corporation was accused of antitrust violations for refusing to sell patented repair parts or service manuals to ISOs. The Supreme Court emphasized the need to determine if Kodak had sufficient market power in the parts market. In Image Technical Services v. Kodak, the Supreme Court ruled that lower courts must assess Kodak's market power in the photocopier parts market to determine if it unlawfully tied service to the purchase of repair parts. The court found Kodak had monopoly power and misused it, leading to an injunction. In the Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation, the Federal Circuit upheld summary judgment for Xerox, noting the importance of patent holder rights. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Court's grant of summary judgment to Xerox, emphasizing the patent holder's right to exclude others from patent property. The court stated that a patent may confer the right to exclude competition in more than one antitrust market, without illegal tying. In the absence of exceptional circumstances, a patent may confer the right to exclude competition in multiple antitrust markets. Without illegal tying, fraud, or sham litigation, the patent holder can enforce the right to exclude others from using the claimed invention without antitrust liability. An earlier case involving an \"adjacent market\" situation rebuked the FTC for ruling against a publisher for listing commuter airlines less advantageously than major airlines, violating Section 5 of the FTC Act. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rebuked the FTC for ruling against a publisher for violating Section 5 of the FTC Act. The Commission's decision was criticized for potentially giving the FTC too much power to interfere with a monopolist's business judgment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit criticized the FTC for potentially granting too much power to interfere with a monopolist's business judgment. The court emphasized the relevance of the Colgate doctrine and the Official Airline Guides case in assessing a monopolist's duty to deal advantageously with non-competitor entities in an adjacent market. The concept of the \"essential facilities\" doctrine has been developing since the enactment of the Sherman Act in 1890. The concept of the \"essential facilities\" doctrine has been developing, with courts consistently holding that a monopolist must make crucial facilities available to potential competitors. This was seen in cases like United States v. Terminal Railroad Association and a skiing mountains case in 1985. The essential facilities doctrine requires monopolists to provide access to crucial facilities to potential competitors, as seen in the skiing mountains case where the owner of the fourth mountain was required to allow joint marketing access to all four mountains. This refusal to deal may be unlawful as it can extend monopoly power from one stage of production to another and into different markets. The antitrust laws require firms with monopoly power to provide access to essential facilities to potential competitors. Curtis Trinko challenged Verizon for not sharing its network facilities as required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, alleging resistance to competitive entry by other carriers. The complaint alleged that Verizon resists competitive entry by carriers, causing harm to competitors. The Court rejected Trinko's arguments, discussing the regulatory scheme and antitrust standards. The Court analyzed the established antitrust standards, including monopoly status, monopolization, and attempted monopolization. It distinguished previous cases involving the \"essential facilities\" doctrine, noting that access had been withdrawn in the present case. Terminal Railroad and Associated Press v. United States were also distinguished. The Court distinguished previous cases involving the \"essential facilities\" doctrine, noting that access had been withdrawn. Terminal Railroad and Associated Press v. United States were also distinguished, with the majority stressing that Verizon had violated a duty imposed by the act but not any obligation under antitrust laws. The 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines highlight the \"monopoly\"/\"monopolization\" dichotomy as a key concept in enforcement. These guidelines inform the business community of the agencies' governing philosophy and analytical framework for reviewing proposed mergers. The antitrust enforcement agencies differentiate between mergers that create market power and those that are competitively beneficial or neutral. Recent cases involving Microsoft and Intel illustrate this distinction, focusing on competitive harm rather than size in merger decisions. The Department of Justice and the FTC have taken legal action against Microsoft and Intel for monopolistic practices. The Antitrust Division accused Microsoft of using its monopoly power in the market for operating systems to engage in anticompetitive activities. This includes tying other software products to Windows, exclusionary agreements, and restricting competitors. The FTC charged Intel Corporation for violating the Federal Trade Commission Act by restricting competitors and impeding innovation with its monopoly power. Intel's actions were deemed illegal as it used its dominance to stifle competition. Intel Corporation used its monopoly power to impede innovation and stifle competition by denying necessary technical information to certain customers. Monopoly status indicates sufficient market power to control prices or exclude competition, but does not automatically create an obligation to deal fairly with others. This obligation may only be created by a further finding of violation of antitrust laws. A monopolist's violation of antitrust laws is based on \"guilty behavior\" such as unlawfully exploiting a monopoly position, not just the status as a monopolist. The duty to deal with competitors is governed by the Colgate doctrine for lawful monopolists, but may be limited by the \"essential facilities\" doctrine. The \"essential facilities\" doctrine, which requires a monopolist to provide necessary components to competitors, was questioned in the Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Trinko case. The Supreme Court suggested that a violation of a regulatory statute does not automatically constitute an antitrust violation without evidence of anticompetitive behavior."
