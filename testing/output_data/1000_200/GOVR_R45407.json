    "content": "The quality of instruction is crucial for student learning, and federal policy emphasizes the importance of good pre-service preparation for teachers. Title II, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 provides financial support and accountability measures to improve teacher preparation programs. This includes a competitive grant program for reforms in select programs and reporting requirements for all teacher preparation programs at the state level. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA) which includes provisions related to teacher preparation programs. Two comprehensive reauthorization bills, H.R. 4508 and H.R. 6543, are being discussed. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been funded through various legislation and continuing resolutions. Title II-A authorities have been funded through various legislation and continuing resolutions, most recently under P.L. 115-245 for FY2019 appropriations. Congressional action for reauthorization of the HEA is ongoing, with a focus on teacher preparation programs. The report discusses current programs and issues surrounding the reauthorization debate, emphasizing the historical support for traditional teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education. The federal effort in supporting teacher preparation has historically focused on traditional programs at institutions of higher education. Alternative approaches to teacher preparation programs have posed challenges to federal policy, especially regarding program quality accountability. Most teachers in U.S. schools have been trained at programs operated by IHEs since the early 20th century. The growth of teacher preparation programs and schools of education at IHEs coincided with the professionalization of teaching. The growth of teacher preparation programs at institutions of higher education coincided with the professionalization of teaching. There has been a formalized split between the study of pedagogy and subject-matter disciplines, with a focus on the importance of courses in pedagogy for teacher educators. Alternative routes to teacher certification have widened the gap between training in teaching practice and subject-matter expertise. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report, mandated by HEA Section 205(d), provides data on teacher preparation programs in the U.S. for the 2012-2013 academic year. Online data for 2015-2016 shows 2,106 providers offering 26,459 programs, enrolling 441,439 candidates, and producing 159,598 completers. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 2,171 teacher preparation providers offered 26,589 programs across the U.S., enrolling 499,800 candidates and producing 192,459 completers. Among these providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. 70% of the programs were traditional teacher preparation programs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, 70% of teacher preparation programs were traditional, 20% were alternative route programs at IHEs, and 10% were alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Among the 499,800 teacher candidates, over 89% were enrolled in traditional programs, while 5% were in alternative route programs at IHEs, and nearly 6% were in alternative route programs not based at IHEs. Five states prepared 35% of the 192,849 teacher program completers, with Texas leading at 11%. In the 2012-2013 academic year, Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois were the top states for teacher preparation program completion. New York led in traditional program completion, while Texas led in alternative route completions. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlighted differences in training requirements between traditional and alternative route programs. The largest traditional teacher preparation programs, Grand Canyon University and the University of Phoenix, enroll over 30,000 prospective teachers, which is 10 times more than the next 10 largest programs combined. The majority of enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic, with African-American enrollees making up a smaller percentage. The most common subject area of program completion in traditional programs is elementary education. The national average scaled score for program completion in education is 74.4%, with over 95% of candidates passing state assessments. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program and reporting provisions for teacher preparation. The Teacher Quality Partnership program is authorized under Title II-A. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program under Title II-A of the HEA aims to improve teacher preparation by funding partnerships for prospective and new teachers. It supports traditional teacher preparation programs and residency programs, with additional funding for school leadership activities. The program receives about $42 million in annual appropriations, supporting grants to around two dozen partnerships, with 30% focused on pre-baccalaureate/fifth year programs. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million, supporting grants to around two dozen partnerships. TQP projects include pre-baccalaureate/fifth year programs (30%), residency programs (48%), and a combination of both (23%). Eligibility for a TQP award requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency, an institution of higher education, a school of education within the institution, and a school of arts and sciences within the institution. Grantees must match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program requires grantees to match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds and coordinate activities with other federally funded programs. Grants support reforms in teacher preparation programs and early childhood educator programs, including curriculum changes, research-based instructional practices, and pre-service clinical education programs. The Teacher Quality Partnership program supports reforms in teacher preparation programs by implementing research-based instructional practices, developing high-quality pre-service clinical education programs, creating induction programs for new teachers, increasing compensation for early childhood educators with degrees, providing professional development for teachers in high-need areas, recruiting qualified individuals into the teaching profession, and strengthening literacy instruction skills for new teachers. Grants are also provided for teacher residency programs in high-need schools. The Teacher Quality Partnership program supports teacher residency programs in high-need schools to prepare teachers for success. Programs include rigorous coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and placement in targeted schools for collaboration. Cohort members receive a living stipend and must teach full time for at least three years in a high-need school. Grants are provided to develop effective school leadership programs. Grants are provided to develop and implement effective school leadership programs to prepare individuals for careers as superintendents, principals, early childhood education program directors, or other school leaders. Programs must promote strong leadership skills, understand teaching and assessment skills, use data to evaluate instruction, manage resources, engage parents and community, and understand student learning to increase academic achievement. Grant funds must also be used to develop a yearlong clinical education program and mentoring. The Title II (Section 205) of the HEA authorizes the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program to improve academic achievement by developing effective school leaders and holding teacher preparation programs accountable. States and institutions operating these programs must report performance data to receive HEA funds, issue report cards to the state and public, and ED uses this information to assess teacher qualifications annually. States must issue report cards to ED and the public as required by the HEA. Information for the annual report on teacher qualifications is derived from state-reported data. Section 207 of the HEA mandates states to evaluate teacher preparation programs and identify low-performing ones. Common criteria for program evaluation include teaching skill indicators and pass rates on state credentialing assessments. Less common criteria include improving student academic achievement and raising entry standards. In 2014, 12 states and Puerto Rico reported low-performing or at-risk teacher preparation programs. A total of 45 programs were classified as low-performing or at-risk, representing less than 3% of the total number of programs. 30 states and jurisdictions have never identified any programs as low-performing or at-risk. In 2014, less than 3% of teacher preparation programs were identified as low-performing or at-risk. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce approved H.R. 4508, which would amend the Higher Education Act by repealing Title II provisions. The Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543) was introduced as a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill, retaining and amending current Title II provisions, including changes to the TQP program and expansion of accountability measures for institutions. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has discussed HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill amending Title II. President signed a resolution of congressional disapproval (P.L. 115-14) regarding accountability provisions for institutions and states receiving federal funds. The President signed a resolution nullifying regulations for HEA reauthorization, including clearer guidance on provider versus program, post-program completion measures, and penalties for poor performance. Congress may consider legislation reauthorizing HEA, addressing federal support for teacher preparation programs and TQP activities. Some argue for expanding the federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, while others believe it should remain a state and local responsibility. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities in the TQP program. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities supported under the TQP program. Traditional teaching routes advocate for enhancements like supervised clinical practice and assessments for teacher certification. Alternative routes seek fewer restrictions on TQP partners and more emphasis on in-service supports like induction and mentoring for teachers. Some argue for expanding federal policy on program quality and accountability in teacher preparation programs. Some argue for expanding federal policy on program quality and accountability in teacher preparation programs, citing the need for greater accountability measures tied to student performance outcomes. Others believe current reporting requirements already burden state and local administrators unnecessarily. Less than 3% of programs have been identified as low-performing, with three-fifths of states never identifying a program in this manner."
