    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Travel Regional Investment Partnership Act\". The importance of travel and tourism is highlighted by Congress, with millions of jobs and billions of dollars in expenditures involved. Despite some setbacks in job losses and output decline, public-private partnerships are seen as crucial for promoting domestic tourism growth. The Domestic Regional Tourism Grant Program is established under Section 3. The Secretary will establish a grant program through the Office of Travel and Tourism Industries to promote domestic regional tourism growth. Grants will range from $100,000 to $1,000,000 and can be awarded to State tourism offices, local destination marketing organizations, and partnerships between government and tourism entities. Priority may be given to regions with low contributions to tourism marketing. The Secretary may prioritize regions with low tourism marketing contributions, maintain regional diversity of grant recipients, and benefit rural and less-marketed destinations. Grants can be used to promote domestic regional tourism growth and create new domestic tourism markets. Eligible entities must submit an application with required information to the Secretary. Each application for a grant to fund tourist promotion activities must include a description of the activities and, if applicable, details of partnerships with local tourism entities. The grant application must include details of the partnership agreement, how it will boost regional tourism, and the expected impact on job creation. Recipients must provide non-Federal matching funds equal to the grant amount, either in cash or in-kind. The grant recipients must provide non-Federal matching funds equal to the grant amount, either in cash or in-kind. A maximum of 25 percent of the matching funds can be in-kind contributions. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing travel-generated expenditures, tax receipts, and employment. Definitions include \"local tourist entity\" as businesses engaged in tourism and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary in this section. The term \"entity\" refers to businesses involved in tourism activities, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce. $10,000,000 is authorized for grants over the first 5 fiscal years after the Act's enactment."
