    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\". Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are crucial for youth development, promoting leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Participation in these activities is linked to academic success and social growth. Nonprofit organizations prioritize the well-being of young athletes, acknowledging the risks of injuries inherent in sports but emphasizing the overall benefits of amateur athletics. Participation in school sports and amateur competition benefits young people by reducing obesity levels and promoting fitness. Rules in sports are necessary to ensure age-appropriate competition and safety, despite the inherent risks involved in intense physical activity. Rules makers in amateur sports face an increasing number of lawsuits for negligence in adopting or failing to adopt specific rules. Allowing lawsuits based on rule development is deemed unfair and could deter talented individuals from serving on rules committees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"economic loss\" refers to pecuniary loss from harm, including loss of earnings, medical expenses, and loss of business opportunities. \"Harm\" includes physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses. \"Noneconomic loss\" encompasses physical and emotional pain, suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. The curr_chunk defines \"nonprofit organization\" as an entity exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and \"nonprofit athletic organization\" as a nonprofit organization primarily focused on adopting rules for athletics. The term \"athletic organization\" refers to a nonprofit organization that establishes rules for athletic competitions. It includes employees, agents, and volunteers acting within their duties. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR NONPROFIT ATHLETIC ORGANIZATIONS. Liability Protection for Nonprofit Athletic Organizations: A nonprofit athletic organization is not liable for harm caused by its actions in adopting rules for sanctioned athletic events if acting within its duties, properly licensed, and harm was not due to willful misconduct or negligence. Nonprofit athletic organizations are protected from liability if harm was not caused by willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless misconduct. Employees, agents, and volunteers are not exempt from civil action. State laws requiring risk management procedures do not conflict with this protection. The organization must follow risk management procedures, including training employees, agents, or volunteers. State laws may hold nonprofit athletic organizations liable for the acts of their employees, agents, and volunteers. The limitation of liability does not apply to certain claims under federal, state, or local laws. SEC. 5. PREEMPTION.\n\nThis Act preempts State laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations' rule-making activities.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by nonprofit athletic organizations filed after the effective date, only if the harm or conduct occurred after that date."
