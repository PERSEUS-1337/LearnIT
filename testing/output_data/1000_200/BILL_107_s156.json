    "content": "The \"After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students, reduce juvenile crime, and provide productive activities during after school hours to prevent youth from becoming victims of crime. Congress finds that today's youth face increased social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are most at risk of violence during after school hours. Academic failure consequences are more severe in 2001, and after school programs have been effective in addressing youth social problems. Many governors support increasing after school programs through a Federal/State partnership. Many governors and law enforcement officials advocate for expanding after school programs to provide recreation, academic support, and community service for school-age children and teens in the United States. It is crucial to invest in safe and positive learning environments during after school hours for our children. The goals of the Act include increasing academic success, promoting safe after school environments, providing alternatives to negative activities, and reducing juvenile crime. The Act also amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to increase program authorization. Section 10904 of the Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to require recipients to provide a minimum of 35% of the annual project cost from sources other than federal funds. The Century Community Learning Centers Act now requires recipients to provide at least 35% of the annual project cost from non-federal sources. Recipients must also ensure that not more than 25% of the annual cost is funded by the Secretary under other federal programs. Additionally, recipients must maintain their fiscal effort from non-federal sources each year for the activities funded under this part. SEC. 7. USES OF FUNDS. Section 10905 of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to allow grants for establishing or expanding community learning centers. The centers may offer activities including job skills preparation, mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training in after school programs. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act allows grants for establishing or expanding community learning centers that offer activities such as job skills preparation, mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, technology training, drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and expanded opportunities for children or youth. At least 2/3 of the appropriated amount must be used for after school programs. SEC. 8. ADMINISTRATION. Section 10905 of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to include provisions for local educational agencies, schools, or consortia to involve volunteers from various communities, engage youth in designing activities, conduct outreach creatively, request donations, and collaborate with park and recreation departments. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act now allows for involvement of volunteers, engaging youth in activity design, creative outreach, requesting donations, and collaborating with park and recreation agencies to avoid duplication of activities. SEC. 9. Amends the definition of Community Learning Center to include law enforcement organizations like the Police Athletic League. SEC. 10. Increases authorization of appropriations for the Act. SEC. 11. Effective date of the Act and its amendments is October 1, 2001."
