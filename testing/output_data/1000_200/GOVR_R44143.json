    "content": "Under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, both state and federal governments are prohibited from denying equal protection of the laws. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny to government actions that classify people, with higher scrutiny for more suspect classifications. This increases the likelihood of a court finding the action unconstitutional. Increased scrutiny, such as strict scrutiny, is applied to governmental classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. Suspect classifications are based on race, national origin, and alienage. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review. When applying strict scrutiny to governmental action, reviewing courts consider if the action is narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must prove the constitutional validity of its action under strict scrutiny and show that it cannot achieve its goals through less discriminatory means. Intermediate scrutiny is less stringent than strict scrutiny but more rigorous than rational basis review, applying to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications like gender or illegitimacy. Courts determine if the action is substantially related to achieving an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny. Intermediate scrutiny is applied to governmental actions to determine if they are substantially related to achieving an important government interest. The government bears the burden of proving the constitutional validity of its actions under this level of scrutiny. Rational basis review, the least searching form of judicial scrutiny, applies to classifications not subject to heightened scrutiny, requiring the action to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action, not just the actual purposes. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are contained within the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, stating that the government cannot deprive a person of \"life, liberty, or property\" without due process of law. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, requiring only a reasonable way of achieving a legitimate government purpose to survive scrutiny. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution protect individuals from government deprivation of \"life, liberty, or property\" without due process. The Fourteenth Amendment applies to state action, while the Fifth Amendment applies to federal action. Due process includes procedural requirements and substantive guarantees against undue government infringement on fundamental rights. The Supreme Court determines fundamental rights based on historical recognition and their importance to liberty and justice. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental actions that infringe upon fundamental rights, requiring them to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must demonstrate a substantial need for its action to further this interest without encumbering fundamental rights more than necessary. If alternative actions could have been less burdensome on rights while achieving the same goal, the government's action is not considered narrowly tailored. The Supreme Court, in Obergefell v. Hodges, ruled that state same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional, requiring states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages formed in other states. This decision was based on the Constitution's due process and equal protection principles. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges required states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages from other states. The Court based its ruling on the fundamental right to marry, stating that this right applies equally to same-sex couples due to reasons like individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and marriage's importance in society. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, acknowledging a departure from precedent. The Court emphasized that rights should not be limited by historical practices to prevent new groups from exercising fundamental rights. The Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing that rights should not be limited by historical practices. The Court found that rights come from a better understanding of constitutional imperatives, not just ancient sources. The Court did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, departing from precedent. States argued for bans based on two primary interests. The Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing that rights should not be limited by historical practices. The Court did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, departing from precedent. States argued for bans based on two primary interests, but the Court found these justifications invalid and ruled that states cannot deny the right to marry to same-sex couples. The Supreme Court extended the right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing that historical practices should not limit rights. Dissenting Justices in Obergefell believed the Court overstepped by removing the issue from the democratic process. They also expressed concern about the majority establishing a new fundamental right contrary to precedent. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell expressed concern about the majority establishing a new fundamental right contrary to precedent, emphasizing the importance of rights being rooted in tradition and history to prevent the Court from making policy decisions. The decision raised questions about its impact on the rights of gay individuals, the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, implications for laws prohibiting plural marriages, the Court's approach to recognizing fundamental rights, and the proper level of judicial scrutiny moving forward. The Obergefell decision raised questions about its impact on the rights of gay individuals outside of the marriage context. The Court's holding was based on same-sex marriage bans infringing upon the fundamental right to marry, without addressing the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Court did not mention whether classifications based on sexual orientation are suspect or quasi-suspect, and thus warrant any form of heightened scrutiny. Prior to Obergefell, federal appeals courts were split regarding the proper level of judicial scrutiny applicable to governmental action that classifies based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny, though it did not clarify whether this heightened scrutiny was intermediate or strict scrutiny. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has similarly found. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has held that governmental action classifying based on sexual orientation is subject only to rational basis review, creating a circuit split with the Second and Ninth Circuits. The Court's decision in Obergefell, focused on the fundamental right to marry, does not resolve the issue of the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. Other lower courts will need to address this unresolved issue. The circuit split between the Second, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation could lead to different outcomes in future cases. Some courts may apply heightened scrutiny, increasing the likelihood of laws being found unconstitutional. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the fundamental right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting it could lead to the legalization of plural marriages. However, the majority opinion seems limited to same-sex marriage to prevent extending this right to plural marriages. Some commentators believe that the rationale behind extending the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples in Obergefell may not apply to plural marriages. However, others argue that certain aspects of the Court's opinion could potentially pave the way for constitutional protections for plural marriages. The majority in Obergefell departed from precedent in determining rights. The majority in Obergefell departed from precedent in determining fundamental rights, potentially expanding the scope of rights protected under substantive due process. Uncertainty remains regarding the level of judicial review applied to state same-sex marriage bans. The majority in Obergefell departed from precedent by applying strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, recognizing interference with fundamental rights. This raises questions about the level of judicial scrutiny for government actions infringing on such rights, potentially creating ambiguity on permissible government interference."
