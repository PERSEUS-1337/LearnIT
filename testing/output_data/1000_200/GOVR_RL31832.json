    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. Several pieces of legislation in the 110th Congress addressed penalties, enforcement, diversion of goods, and integration of export control data. The EAA controls sensitive dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications, including those that can contribute to the proliferation of weapons. The EAA has been periodically reauthorized since its original expiration in 1989, with the last extension expiring in August 2001. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) controls dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications. It establishes regulations for exports administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the Department of Commerce. The EAA focuses on regulating exports of civilian goods and technology with military applications, based on strategic relationships and threats to national security. The Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) regulates dual-use items with civilian and military applications. There is a debate on whether to liberalize or tighten export controls to balance international competition and national security threats. The act's evolution, major features, and controls authorized are discussed in this report. The report discusses the Export Administration Act's evolution in the 20th century, major features, types of controls, Commerce Control List, and export licensing procedures. It also addresses issues related to maintaining export controls under IEEPA and highlights controlled commodities. Additionally, it explores competing perspectives on contentious themes in the export control debate, such as technology controllability, multilateral control regimes, organization of the export control system, and the impact on the U.S. economy and business. Export controls have been a part of U.S. policy for almost a century, with a shift towards extensive peacetime efforts after WWII. The Export Control Act of 1949 was enacted in response to the new security threat posed by the Soviet-Bloc countries during the Cold War. It identified three reasons for imposing export controls: short-supply controls to prevent the export of scarce goods, foreign policy controls to promote U.S. foreign policy, and controls related to regional stability, human rights, anti-terrorism, missile technology, and chemical and biological warfare. The Export Control Act of 1949 established national security controls to restrict the export of goods and technology that could enhance the military capability of countries threatening the United States. A multilateral control regime involving NATO allies was also established, leading to the creation of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) in 1949. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 to regulate exports among NATO allies. The Export Control Act was renewed multiple times with high restrictions until the 1960s when pressure for liberalization led to the passing of the Export Administration Act of 1969. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the restrictive Export Control Act of 1949, with further revisions in 1974, 1977, and 1979. Amendments in 1985 led to some liberalization. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 marked a shift in U.S. export control policy. Despite streamlining, the basic structure of the law remains intact, with calls for revamping to enhance exports. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the Export Control Act of 1949, with revisions in subsequent years. Despite streamlining, calls for revamping persist to enhance exports and address national security threats. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and the establishment of the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 significantly changed the export control landscape. Congress has struggled to agree on reforms since the 101st Congress. The Export Administration Act has faced challenges in Congress for reform since the 101st Congress. Temporary extensions and Executive Orders have been used to continue export controls. Legislation in 2000 extended the EAA of 1979 until August 20, 2001. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act of 1979 until August 20, 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate the export control system under IEEPA powers. Export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions pursuant to Executive Order 13222. Legislation to rewrite the Export Administration Act has been introduced in recent Congresses. In the 106th and 107th Congresses, export control legislation was introduced but faced challenges in the Senate due to concerns about national security impact. Senator Enzi introduced bills in both Congresses, with hearings held and favorable reports, but no further action was taken. In the 107th Congress, the Export Administration Act (EAA) was introduced and debated in the Senate and House committees. The Senate passed the bill with amendments, while the House version, H.R. 2581, included provisions related to oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea. In the 107th Congress, H.R. 2581, related to oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea, was passed by the House International Relations Committee with 35 amendments. The House Armed Services Committee further amended and reported the legislation, but it received no further consideration in the 107th Congress. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55), identical to S. 149, but no action was taken on it. The National Defense Authorization Act has also been used to attempt to amend the export control regime. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been used to attempt to amend the export control regime. In 2004, the House version of NDAA 2005 (H.R. 4200) contained provisions related to dual-use export controls, requiring licenses for certain technologies and items. The House NDAA report expressed concern about potential military embargoes on China and the transfer of U.S. goods or technology. A bill to revise the Export Administration Act was introduced in the 109th Congress but was not comprehensive. The Export Administration Act revision bill introduced in the 109th Congress addressed penalties, enforcement, and U.S. relations with multilateral control regimes. It aimed to extend the expired EAA for two years and provide authorization for export control activities. However, the bill did not receive consideration in the 109th Congress, and no comprehensive legislation was introduced in the 110th Congress. Legislation introduced in Congress aimed to amend enforcement and penalties under the Export Administration Act, integrate export control information into electronic filing, and target countries of diversion concern. Only one bill, S. 3445/H.R. 7112, was acted upon in the 110th Congress, with H.R. 7112 passing in the House. H.R. 7112 was introduced and passed in the House under suspension of the rules on September 26, 2008. Representative Sherman introduced the Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) on July 31, 2009, which includes provisions on export controls enforcement, integration of export control data in the AES, and diversion control. The legislation grants additional enforcement authority for the Export Administration Regulations during the lapse of the EAA under the IEEPA. The draft legislation grants investigative authority to departments and agencies under the EAR for conducting investigations in the US and abroad. It allows for search, detention, and seizure of goods by Commerce within the US and at ports of entry or exit. The bill also directs the Secretary of Commerce to publish guidelines for export control compliance programs and includes provisions for undercover investigations and audits. The bill includes new language governing the use of funds for undercover investigations and operations, establishing audit and reporting requirements. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 integrates licensing requirements, embargoes, and data collection rules into the Automated Export System to prevent improper shipments. The issue of evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs remains a concern for Congress. The 111th Congress is concerned about evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs, particularly in the United Arab Emirates. In 2006, computer circuits were diverted to Iran for bomb detonators from the UAE. The Bureau of Industry and Security proposed creating a 'Country Category C' for countries of diversion concern, but no country was designated as such. H.R. 3515 would legislate the 'Category C' concept with regards to diversion to Iran, requiring the President to identify countries of concern within 180 days. Countries could be designated as possible diversion concerns or diversion concerns, with measures in place to strengthen export control systems and address non-compliance. The legislation would require the Administration to designate countries as Destinations of Diversion Concern if improvements are not seen within 12 months. Countries directly involved in transhipments, reexportations, or diversions would be listed as countries of diversion concern, facing additional licensing requirements and increased end-user checks. An annual report on transfers of dual-use U.S. technology to concerning countries and entities would also be mandated. President Obama initiated a review of the U.S. export control system in 2009. The U.S. export control system is under review by the National Security Council and the National Economic Council. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates proposed a 4-pronged approach to reform the system, including creating a single licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, implementing an integrated information technology system, and establishing a single enforcement coordination agency. These changes would be implemented in three phases. The administration's blueprint for reforming the U.S. export control system includes creating a single enforcement coordination agency and harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List in three phases. The first phase involves preparatory work to establish a tiered control structure, standardized licensing processes, and an \"Enforcement Fusion Center.\" Phase II would implement a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured tiered control lists, aiming to reduce license requirements significantly. The White House fact sheet outlines plans to harmonize and tier control lists, leading to a significant reduction in license requirements. The proposal includes moving items from the munitions list to the dual-use list, examining unilateral controls, and consulting with multilateral partners. Phase III will see the debut of a new export control system with a single licensing agency, merged control lists, a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency, and a unified IT system for licensing and enforcement. The 3-phase plan for a new export control system includes harmonizing control lists, reducing license requirements, and creating a single licensing agency. Secretary Gates predicts the plan will unfold over the next year, but many questions remain unanswered about legislative actions needed for changes to control lists and agency structure. The proposed changes in export control legislation include creating a new licensing agency, with the placement within existing departments or as an independent entity still undecided. The controls authorized under the Export Administration Act (EAA) have been based on national security, foreign policy, and domestic economic impact since 1949. Since 1949, U.S. dual-use export controls have restricted items based on national security, foreign policy, and domestic economic impact. The Commerce Control List (CCL) and Export Administration Regulations control items for national security and foreign policy reasons. The 1979 Act restricted exports that could enhance military capabilities of other countries, with National Security control items falling under the EAR's licensing requirement. \"Country Group D-1\" serves as the current list for control. The national security control items are regulated under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and fall under the National Security licensing requirement. Licenses for these items are reviewed case-by-case to ensure they are not contributing significantly to the military potential of the destination country. The Secretary of Defense and other agencies identify goods and technology for national security control, with periodic reviews and revisions conducted. The Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) is maintained by the Secretary of Defense for this purpose. The Secretary of Defense maintains the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) for national security control items, consistent with the Wassenaar Arrangement. U.S. national security controls do not cover items under nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation regimes, or to countries under anti-terrorism controls. Items controlled for national security purposes are subject to a foreign availability determination to ensure effectiveness. The 1979 Act charges the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, to determine if items subject to export control for national security reasons are available abroad. A foreign availability determination can be requested by a license applicant or initiated by the Secretary. If an item is deemed available abroad, it must be decontrolled, unless the President determines it would harm national security. In that case, negotiations with control partners are required. An Office of Foreign Availability was created to assist in making these determinations and report to Congress. The bill created an Office of Foreign Availability to assist in determining the availability of items subject to export control for national security reasons. This office no longer exists, but the Office of Technology Evaluation now conducts foreign availability determinations. The Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee was established to involve university experts in deciding which technologies should be on the control list. BIS conducted a review of the Commerce Control List (CCL) in 2007-8 and plans to review 1/3 of it. BIS conducted a systemic review of the Commerce Control List (CCL) in 2007-8 and plans to review 1/3 of it each year. On May 22, 2009, BIS issued a final rule lifting certain licensing requirements on uncooled thermal imaging cameras to 36 U.S. allied countries. The rule decontrolled low to mid-market night vision cameras not incorporated into military commodities. Tighter export controls were placed on higher-end thermal imaging cameras. Exporters must report transactions to BIS semi-annually. The report transactions to BIS semi-annually, supporting mechanisms for foreign availability concerns. Concerns remain about the time taken to resolve issues, with industry sources noting delays in BIS engagement. Mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation but not currently provided for in regulations. The EAA legislation introduced criteria for determining mass market status for items sold in large volume or to multiple buyers. This feature was controversial and cited as a stumbling block in negotiations. The EAA authorizes the President to control exports for foreign policy objectives, anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, embargoes, and non-proliferation. The EAA legislation imposes foreign policy controls for anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, embargoes, and non-proliferation objectives. It requires annual renewal, clear objectives reported to Congress, negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items, compliance with international obligations, and licensing for exports to countries supporting terrorism. The EAA legislation imposes foreign policy controls for various objectives, requiring licenses for exports to countries supporting terrorism and certain items. Controls are not authorized for sales of essential items like medicine, food, and water resources to meet basic human needs. Catch-all controls require a license for export or reexport of any item, introduced under the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative of 1991. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) include catch-all controls introduced under the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative (EPCI) of 1991. These controls require a license for the export or reexport of any item if it will be used for nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list of entities subject to EPCI licenses. Certain entities in Russia, China, Pakistan, India, Israel, and designated foreign terrorist organizations face a presumption of denial for licenses. The 1979 Export Administration Act (EAA) authorized restrictions on exports to protect domestic industry from shortages and inflationary impacts. Short-supply controls remain for crude oil, petroleum derivatives, and unprocessed western red. The Bureau of Industry and Security administers the license application process, reviewing applications with a total value of $72.1 billion in FY2008. Short-supply controls include restrictions on exports of crude oil, petroleum derivatives, unprocessed western red cedar, and horses by sea. Dual-use technology licenses accounted for $21.9 billion, representing 1.7% of total U.S. exports in FY2008. Most license applications are referred to other government agencies for evaluation, prolonging the review process. In FY2008, the Bureau of Industry and Security reviewed license applications totaling $72.1 billion. Most applications are referred to other agencies, extending the review process. China received the most approved licenses for controlled goods, totaling $2.7 billion. Chemical manufacturing facilities had the highest number of approved applications, with 2,212 valued at $294 million. The Commerce Control List includes items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply reasons. The Commerce Control List (CCL) is a list of specific goods, technology, and software controlled by the Export Administration Regulations for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. It consists of ten categories, each further divided into functional groups, covering items such as nuclear materials, electronics, telecommunications, and propulsion systems. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items into equipment, assemblies, components, test equipment, materials, software, and technology. Each item is assigned an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) with a description and reason for control. There are approximately 500 ECCN listings, and most U.S.-origin commodities are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). This means products may be restricted based on end-use or end-user, with items on the CCL eligible for license exceptions. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items with Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCN) for license exceptions. A commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or a munition, with CJs decided by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Exporters may request a BIS commodity classification for more lenient controls. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) allows exporters to request a commodity classification for items not listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL). However, there have been criticisms for the low number of classifications referred to State and Defense, with only 10 out of 5,370 requests in 2005 being referred. In 2005, out of 5,370 commodity classification requests processed, only 10 were referred to State and Defense. The lack of coordination between the two departments has led to jurisdictional disputes and exporters determining restrictions without government oversight. The EAA and EAR establish review policies for license applications. The EAA and EAR establish policies for the review of license applications, giving the Secretary of Commerce the power to determine license disposition. State, Defense, and Energy departments can review licenses, with the Secretary able to refer applications as needed. Agencies may waive their review rights for certain commodities or destinations. Within nine days of application registration, the Secretary must seek additional information, assure correct security classification, and either return the application if unnecessary or grant the license. The Secretary must seek additional information, refer the application to other agencies, assure correct security classification, return the application if a license is not required, grant the application, or notify the applicant of denial. Reviewing agencies must request any additional information within 10 days. Within 30 days, agencies must recommend approval or denial of the application, providing justification for a denial. Failure to provide a recommendation within 30 days is deemed as no objection to the Secretary's decision. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) is a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism created by the 1995 Order. It consists of the Secretary, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, with non-voting members like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is under the EARB and consists of the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration and relevant assistant Secretaries. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) is a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism created by the 1995 Order. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is under the EARB and consists of the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration, relevant assistant Secretaries, and appropriate officials from represented agencies. The Operating Committee (OC) of ACEP is made up of representatives from the departments involved. The dispute resolution process starts with the OC, where the Chair reviews recommendations and informs them of his decision within 14 days. Any reviewing department can appeal to the ACEP within five days, and a majority decision is made within 11 days. The interagency appeal process under the Export Administration Review Board (EARB) must be completed within 90 days of the application registration. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by statutory and regulatory basis, with an explicit appeal procedure specified in the EAR. In FY2008, BIS reported that 422 cases were escalated to the OC, and a further 20 were examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations by executive order when the 1979 EAA expired in 1990, citing national security threats. President Clinton imposed IEEPA-based controls after the expiration of the EAA extensions in 1993 and 1994. A restructuring of export control regulations was published in 1996. President Clinton extended the authority of the 1979 Act in 2000, and President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls in 2001. Deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority have been noted. Several deficiencies have been noted in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority: Enforcement agents must obtain Special Deputy U.S. Marshal status, limiting resources for enforcement. IEEPA lacks provisions for limiting court jurisdiction, confidentiality, and discouraging compliance with foreign boycotts. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not explicitly authorize the executive to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts against friendly countries. Critics argue that the lack of appropriate legislation sends the wrong message to other countries. However, the International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties to $1 million and civil penalties for violations. Bush on October 16, 2007, increased criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for individuals, and civil penalties to $250,000. The act also imposed penalties for violations involving national security controls, including telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, aerospace technology, and specialized manufacturing equipment. In recent years, congressional focus has been on technologically advanced computers known as High Performance Computers (HPCs), which can perform complex digital operations quickly. HPCs include a range of technologies such as supercomputers, workstations, mainframes, and advanced microprocessors. The performance of HPCs is measured in millions of theoretical operations per second (MTOPS), with actual performance varying based on the operations being performed. The Wassenaar Arrangement approved a new standard for calculating computing power in December 2005, called adjusted peak performance (APP), measured by weighted teraflops (WT). The control level is set at 0.75 WT, replacing the 190,000 MTOPS benchmark level of January 2002. This standard applies to high-end proprietary HPCs used for advanced research and simulation. The level for computer software and technology is set at 0.04 WT and for computer development and production technology at 0.1 WT. Export restrictions on HPCs have been debated due to rapid advancements in computing capabilities and foreign availability of comparable models. The threshold for HPC exports to Tier 3 countries was raised to 190,000 MTOPS in January 2002. The Bush Administration raised the threshold for HPC exports to Tier 3 countries to 190,000 MTOPS in January 2002, impacting BIS regulations. Despite the switch to the WT metric, changes in control levels still require notification under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. It also imposed post-shipment verification requirements and the need to notify Congress of any adjustments in the MTOPS threshold levels. Encryption is crucial for e-commerce security and cryptography, but it also has implications for military code-breaking. Encryption technology has become increasingly important for e-commerce security and cryptography, as well as military code-breaking capabilities. Executive Order 13026 transferred control authority of certain encryption technology from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996. This led to the decontrol of retail encryption technology, allowing for export to western countries and non-governmental end-users with a license exemption. Licenses are still required for countries covered by anti-terrorism regulations. Stealth technology, used to protect systems against electronic detection, falls into two categories: materials that deflect radar signals and materials that absorb them. Export control concerns arise due to the dual-use nature of stealth-related commodities, making it challenging to control dissemination and maintain U.S. leadership in this technology. In the 1990s, concerns over export control led to reclassifying certain stealth-related technology as munitions. Congress debated the effectiveness of monitoring foreign launch operations to prevent disclosures of missile secrets. The Cox Committee found that U.S. satellite manufacturers transferred missile design information to China improperly. The authority to license exports of commercial communications satellites was returned to the Department of State in 1999. In 1999, the authority to license exports of commercial communications satellites was transferred from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce. The satellite industry has lobbied to reverse this transfer due to licensing delays and lost sales. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 included a provision to grant the President flexibility to transfer commercial satellite technology back to the Commerce Control List with congressional approval. The President may transfer commercial satellite technology from the USML to the CCL with congressional approval. This includes manufacturing technology like lathes used for missile and aircraft parts. The industry claims lack of controls hampers competitiveness, especially with China. BIS recommended decontrol of certain products to China and Taiwan. The technology used in the development and production of jet aircraft, known as \"hot section\" technology, is controlled by different U.S. government agencies depending on its military or commercial application. There were concerns raised in Congress about decontrolling this technology, particularly in relation to China and Taiwan. The civilian aviation industry has expressed worries about the potential decontrol of sensitive technologies like hot section technology. The civilian aviation industry is concerned about the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls asserting jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts. The Export Administration Act states that FAA-certified standard equipment in civil aircraft exported to non-controlled countries should be exclusively controlled under this act. Commercial suppliers have complained about DDTC's jurisdiction over non-FAA components. DDTC asserted jurisdiction over non-FAA components of a commercial standby instrument system (CSIS), causing complaints from commercial suppliers. Representative Manzullo introduced legislation (H.R. 3633) to clarify that civil aircraft equipment eligible for export airworthiness approval under FAA regulations should be subject only to controls under the EAA. After negotiations, DDTC released a new rule clarifying the interpretation of Section 17(c) of the EAA, stating that Commerce will have jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment covered by a civil aircraft type certificate issued by the FAA. The Export Administration Regulations regulate the transfer of technology to foreign nationals in the US, requiring a license for such transfers. Deemed exports occur when technology is released to a foreign national within the US. This rule applies to parts and components of civil aircraft covered by an FAA type certificate. Deemed exports involve technology transfer to foreign nationals in the US, requiring a license. BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses in FY2007, with a majority for Chinese nationals. BIS established new rules in response to an IG report, recommending changes in the standard for foreign nationals subject to export controls. The IG recommended using country of birth as the standard for export controls for foreign nationals, but the Under Secretary of Commerce decided to continue using country of citizenship or permanent residency. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission suggested creating a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to qualify for deemed export regulations. The Commission recommended a \"trusted entity\" program for academia and industrial entities to streamline deemed export applications. They proposed evaluating an applicant's loyalties based on various factors and suggested simplifying terminology in regulations. Additionally, they recommended an annual review of technologies on the Commerce Control List by an outside panel of experts. Industry representatives and the research community criticized the DEAC recommendations as unmanageable for the government. The DEAC recommendations for deemed export controls were criticized as unmanageable by industry representatives and the research community. BIS sought feedback on the scope of technologies subject to controls and criteria for assessing country affiliation. The tension between commercial and national security concerns is a key theme in export administration debates. Many stakeholders support reform of export control systems to benefit U.S. businesses in global competition, while others prioritize national security concerns, focusing on controlling exports to potential threats like terrorists and proliferators of weapons of mass destruction. Controversies arise over technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing processes, and impacts. Controversies surround the controllability of technology, effectiveness of multilateral regimes, bureaucratic licensing processes, and the impact of export controls on the U.S. economy. Industry groups support foreign availability and mass market provisions in EAA legislation, arguing that technology flow cannot be controlled effectively, and U.S. dominance in cutting-edge technology is no longer guaranteed. They believe unilateral controls will not prevent other countries from accessing advanced technology. According to industry groups, unilateral controls on technology are ineffective as other countries can obtain it from different sources. They argue that current multilateral controls are not working and only harm American businesses, while foreign businesses benefit by gaining new markets. The export control system is becoming unworkable due to globalization, as component parts are manufactured globally and considered commodities. The export control system is facing challenges due to globalization, with component parts being manufactured globally. Purchasing managers at Daimler Chrysler Aerospace are reducing dependence on American components for defense and space technology products. Critics are concerned that the mass market standard could nullify the U.S. control regime by decontrolling items used for proliferation purposes. The mass market standard could potentially allow virtually any product, including dual-use items for proliferation, to qualify. Industry argues that selling current technology enhances national security by generating funds, as defense procurement now relies more on commercial applications. Industry argues that selling current technology to generate funds for future development is crucial for national security. They believe that hindering American firms with export controls could allow foreign firms to gain market share, surpassing our technological lead and potentially impacting national security. Critics argue that selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states does not promote national security, as it could be used against the United States or its allies. Selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states could jeopardize national security, as seen in the case of Iraq using U.S. weaponry against Kuwait. Some argue that relying on the civilian sector for R&D is a result of declining defense budgets. They suggest funding defense-related R&D within the Defense Department to maintain control over technology exports. The rapid rise in computing power highlights the challenges of the export control system. The rapid rise in computing power challenges the export control system, with some experts arguing that controlling computing power is not feasible or effective. Advances in computing speeds and networking have blurred the line between super-computers and commodity computers, allowing for the creation of parallel processing systems with capabilities similar to super-computers. This poses a threat to national security as it can bypass export regulations. The Defense Science Board highlighted the challenge of controlling access to high-performance computing due to the ability to cluster commodity computers for increased power. Some believe the US can limit access by restricting exports, as American-made computers are seen as superior. Control advocates argue that qualitative differences matter, especially in networking parallel processing systems. One policy to monitor and verify the end-use of controlled goods is the post-shipment verification requirement (PSV) on the export of high-performance computers (HPCs) to tier III destinations like China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and other nations in areas of regional instability. Lawmakers are particularly concerned about HPC exports to China, where access to U.S. HPC exports is restricted. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has made limited efforts to monitor or verify these exports. The GAO reported that China restricts access to facilities with U.S. HPC exports. BIS has made limited efforts to monitor compliance with export license terms. Difficulty in monitoring HPC exports to China is due to ties with the military. The U.S. participates in the Wassenaar Arrangement on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions, a multilateral export control regime. The United States participates in multiple proliferation-related control regimes, including the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These groups have a common control list and require member nations to control exports under their own national laws. Unlike CoCom, these organizations do not conduct a review before granting national export licenses, but they do pledge disclosure of licensing decisions and consultation on sensitive exports. Some groups also adhere to a \"no undercut\" provision. The regime's members pledge disclosure of export licensing decisions and consultation on sensitive export licenses. Some groups follow a \"no undercut\" provision, but operate by consensus and are limited by institutional structures. Critics argue that the Wassenaar Arrangement is ineffective due to reliance on consensus, resulting in minimal reporting requirements and preventing effective pre-export consultation among member states. Industry representatives emphasize the need for effective multilateral controls, stating that export controls are only effective if all capable states adhere to them. The machine tool industry criticizes unilateral export policies, especially towards China, due to lack of consensus among Wassenaar Arrangement countries. Industry spokesmen argue that stringent domestic controls and minimal multilateral constraints harm American companies. Proponents of tighter export restrictions highlight America's historical leadership in export controls and non-proliferation efforts. Proponents of tighter export restrictions emphasize America's historical leadership in export controls and non-proliferation efforts, arguing that the US must lead to convince allies to follow suit. They believe that adopting controls first and persuading other countries to do the same is more effective than relying on consensus-based policies. Both industry representatives and advocates agree that multilateral controls are necessary for national security. The debate over strengthening multilateral export controls revolves around the challenge of reaching consensus on which goods and countries pose a threat. While there is agreement to restrict dual-use items to certain 'countries of concern,' disagreement arises, particularly regarding China. This dilemma raises the question of whether the US should impose controls unilaterally, weighing non-proliferation goals against potential economic costs and national security risks. The dilemma of U.S. export control policy towards China involves balancing economic benefits with national security risks. Some argue that current controls are too stringent, hindering technology transfers to China and causing Chinese companies to avoid working with U.S. companies due to licensing delays. Some argue that U.S. export controls are hindering technology transfers to China and causing Chinese companies to avoid working with U.S. firms due to licensing delays. Concerns have been raised about China's acquisition of dual-use technology and its involvement in nuclear, missile, and chemical proliferation activities. The need for tightened controls and greater enforcement against China has been emphasized. The final rule published by BIS on June 19, 2007, imposes new export controls on China, including a licensing requirement for certain military end-use products, a validated end-user program, and the need for an end-user statement for specific licensed products. The concern is that exporting commercial technology to certain end-users in China undermines the arms embargo. Industry and others have questioned the effectiveness of these new controls. The new licensing policy by BIS imposes controls on China for military end-use products, including 20 product categories. A license is required for items intended for military end-uses in the PRC, expanding beyond anti-terrorism reasons. The final rule by BIS imposes controls on items intended for military end-uses in China, with a presumption of denial for items contributing to China's military capabilities in key weapons systems. The rule also increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce of China. The final rule by BIS imposes controls on items intended for military end-uses in China, with a presumption of denial for items contributing to China's military capabilities in key weapons systems. It increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce of China. The rule also includes the Exporter, Ultimate Consignee, and Purchaser Certification Statement. The VEU program allows end-users to be nominated for eligibility without a license. The approval process includes evaluating the entity's engagement in civilian end-use activities, compliance with U.S. export controls, capability to comply with recordkeeping requirements, agreement to on-site reviews, and relationship with U.S. and foreign companies. China's MoFCom requires authorization for companies seeking VEU status. Not all items on the CCL are eligible for export under this program, especially those controlled for crime control or missile technology. The VEU program allows end-users to be nominated for eligibility without a license, with approval based on various criteria. Items controlled for crime control or missile technology by the EAR do not qualify for export under this program. The approved VEU application will include a list of items that can be exported to the end-user, which can be adjusted by the ERC. The program aims to streamline licensing for certain companies and free up resources for more complex license applications. The VEU can import approved items from any exporter, not just the nominee. The VEU program was expanded to India in 2007, with General Electric India being the first eligible company. Five VEU companies were announced in 2007, importing goods worth $54.3 million in 2006. In 2008, concerns were raised about AVIC I and HHNEC's ties to Chinese military and U.S. proliferation sanctions. The Wisconsin Project raised concerns about entities doing business with the Chinese military, citing violations of U.S. sanctions and export control laws. BIS Undersecretary Mario Mancuso defended the companies, stating they have a history of using U.S. technology. Controversy over the VEU program with China continues, with a GAO study recommending its suspension due to lack of inspection agreements and selection criteria for on-site reviews. The VEU program with China lacks inspection agreements and selection criteria for on-site reviews, according to a GAO study. BIS announced full implementation of the VEU to China with procedures to ensure secure and efficient operation. Representative Markey cited concerns from the Wisconsin Project about VEU approved entities. At a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, Representative Markey raised concerns about Aviza Technology China, an entity approved under the VEU program, sharing an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) regulates dual-use exports, consulting with other agencies like the Department of Defense and Department of Energy for input on license applications. The Department of Energy reviews dual-use license applications for nuclear uses, while the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for weapons and military technology exports. Industry leaders have identified issues with the licensing system, including overlapping jurisdiction between Commerce and State Departments, lengthy approval times, and outdated processes. The licensing system for export controls in the U.S. is criticized for compromising reliability, hindering planning, and lacking updates to reflect technological advancements and economic impacts. There is no opportunity for judicial review of licensing decisions, and officials claim thorough and fair reviews are conducted, requiring time to check items against controlled lists and coordinate with government agencies. Government agencies must \"stop the clock\" to investigate and prevent sensitive technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Some question if the Department of Commerce, which houses the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), is biased towards granting export licenses over national security goals. However, others argue that the involvement of agencies like the Department of Defense ensures a balanced process."
