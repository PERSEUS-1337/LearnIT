    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section of the Act is also included. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times. This serves the dual purposes of providing authors with economic incentives to create new works and promoting society's interest in the free flow of ideas, information, and commerce. \"The copyright term is limited to prevent permanent deprivation of the public from an artist's work. Both commercial and noncommercial creators benefit from a healthy public domain, with book publishers offering titles at reduced prices and others using public domain works for new productions.\" The public domain is utilized by schools, museums, and libraries for educational and cultural purposes. Media sources like the World Wide Web also benefit from public domain content. Despite copyright protection for works published as early as 1923, the majority of older works are no longer commercially available. Only 2 percent of works between 55 and 75 years old retain commercial value. The existing copyright system prevents abandoned works from entering the public domain for many years, hindering their use by commercial and noncommercial entities. This goes against the intent of the Framers of the Constitution and Congress in enacting the Copyright Act. The Copyright Act aims to prevent the public from being deprived of works without commercial or copyright purpose. A mechanism is needed for abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE FEE FOR PUBLISHED UNITED STATES WORKS. The definition of \"United States work\" in section 101 of title 17, United States Code, is amended for sections 306 and 411. Section 302 of title 17 is amended for works created on or after January 1, 1978, and section 303(a) is amended for works created but not published before that date. Section 303(a) of title 17, United States Code, is amended for works created but not published before January 1, 1978. It includes changes related to copyright and section 306. Section 304 of title 17 is also amended for subsisting copyrights. Section 303(a) of title 17, United States Code, is amended for works created but not published before January 1, 1978. Changes related to copyright and section 306 are included. In subparagraph (B), \"In\" is replaced with \"Subject to section 306, in\", and in subparagraph (C) as well. In paragraph (2), subparagraph (A) has an insertion after \"(1)(B) of this subsection,\" and subparagraph (B) has an insertion after \"(1)(C) of this subsection,\" both related to copyrights expiring under section 306. Section 306 introduces a maintenance fee of $1 for maintaining the copyright of published United States works. The fee is due 50 years after first publication or on December 31, 2004, and every 10 years thereafter until the end of the copyright term. The maintenance fee must be paid to maintain the copyright of a work, with a grace period of 6 months. Ancillary or promotional works connected to the main work are also covered. The fee must be accompanied by a prescribed form and deposit. The registration provisions of sections 408 and 409 require a deposit, fee, and additional identifying material as per regulations. Section 708(a) of title 17, United States Code, is amended to include a maintenance fee for published United States works. Additionally, the duties of the Register are outlined in the following section. The Register of Copyrights must establish procedures to simplify the submission of forms under section 306(c) of title 17, US Code, and make the information easily accessible to the public within 12 months of this Act's enactment."
