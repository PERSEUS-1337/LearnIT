    "content": "Both chambers of Congress passed legislation to reauthorize FDA programs and expand its authority for medical product safety. The bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, are the most comprehensive FDA legislation since 1997. The primary focus is renewing FDA's authority for key user fee programs set to expire in FY2007. FDA urged Congress to complete reauthorization efforts before August 1, 2007. The FDA urged Congress to reauthorize key user fee programs before August 1, 2007 to avoid layoffs and funding uncertainty. The bills also address pediatric pharmaceutical authorities and other FDA concerns. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. Products must be reviewed and approved by the FDA before they can be sold, with postmarket surveillance conducted. FDA may inspect production facilities and enforce good manufacturing practices. The FDA has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from commerce, and media coverage has brought attention to the agency's performance and funding. The 110th Congress is focused on balancing the need for the FDA to speed safe products to market while ensuring they are effective and safe. Key issues include premarket approval for some products and FDA's ability to assure product safety for others. The FDA has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from the market and ensure product safety. Congress has authorized FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers to speed up product approval. Efforts to reauthorize user fee authorities are underway, with PDUFA and MDUFMA providing a significant portion of FDA's budget. The FDA collects user fees from manufacturers to speed up product approval, with PDUFA and MDUFMA generating the largest proportion of revenue. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, authorizes the FDA to collect fees from companies producing certain drugs and biological products for new product application reviews. The FDA collects user fees from manufacturers for product approval, with PDUFA and MDUFMA being the main revenue sources. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, established user fees for medical device applications and included performance goals for premarket device reviews. MDUFMA also allowed third-party inspections and added regulations for reprocessed single-use devices. The expiring authorities in MDUFMA are related to user fees and performance goals. In 1997, Congress passed BPCA to encourage pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating a drug's effect on children. FDA's attempts to require assessments of new drugs on pediatric populations were initially stopped by the courts until Congress codified the requirement in PREA in 2003. BPCA and PREA provide incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of both on- and off-patent drugs. Developing medical devices for children is reported to be less profitable and more problematic than for adults. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 reauthorization bills address the critical need for pediatric medical devices due to the challenges in developing them compared to adult devices. The bills offer incentives to manufacturers and give FDA authority to require postmarket studies for approved pediatric devices to ensure safety and efficacy. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 focus on strengthening the FDA's system for monitoring adverse effects of medical products on the market. They aim to collect data, identify situations requiring FDA action, and give FDA new authorities to enforce manufacturer actions. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to strengthen the FDA's monitoring of medical product adverse effects by collecting data, identifying situations requiring FDA action, and providing new authorities for FDA to enforce manufacturer actions. Public access to negative trial results gained traction in 2004, leading to provisions in both bills for public registration of clinical trials and posting of results. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include provisions for public registration of clinical trials and posting results. FDA advisory committees provide independent advice on drugs, devices, and food, but conflicts of interest may undermine credibility. Media reports in 2006 and 2007 highlighted bias towards drug approval and conflicts of interest among committee members. The FDA advisory committees are biased in favor of drug approval and many members have conflicts of interest. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to revise FDA's approach to conflicts of interest. In 2004, FDA investigated the decline in innovative medical products submitted for approval, calling for modernization of scientific tools and bioinformation utilization. The creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation is proposed to support the FDA in evaluating and predicting the safety, effectiveness, and manufacturability of medical products. Lawmakers are exploring ways to allow access to lower-priced medications while maintaining FDA-regulated safety standards for drug importation. The law prohibits drug importation, but some lawmakers are trying to allow access to lower-priced medications from foreign sources while ensuring safety. S. 1082 includes language for drug importation, but an amendment requiring certification from the Secretary of HHS nullifies it. The FDA has regulated food safety since 1906, evolving its authority to address food safety issues. Several recent foodborne illness outbreaks have affected many individuals. The recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have raised concerns about food safety, leading to congressional attention. S. 1082 addresses some key issues in food safety reform, along with FDA reauthorization and reform bills. The bills cover various FDA programs, such as prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, drug safety, and importation of food products. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) gives FDA a revenue source through fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to expedite the review process for new products. The authority to collect user fees will expire on October 1, 2007, unless Congress reauthorizes the program. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) established a mechanism for agency-industry collaboration to set performance goals for new product review. PDUFA II and PDUFA III allowed FDA to use fees for postmarket drug safety activities. Discussions for PDUFA IV reauthorization in 2007 focused on increasing postmarket drug safety. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007. The 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization focuses on postmarket drug safety, with both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 including the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007. These bills reauthorize the assessment, collection, and use of application, establishment, and product fees for prescription and nonprescription drugs. They expand postmarket safety activities, including adverse event data collection systems and improved analytical tools. Both bills increase requirements for adverse event reporting to the HHS Secretary and the public, aiming to generate $393 million in fee revenues annually. The Senate and House bills for the 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization focus on adverse event reporting and fee revenues. They aim to generate $393 million annually through adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent costs. The House bill exempts orphan drugs marketed by smaller companies from certain fees. A new section would authorize fees for advisory review of drug advertisements, with voluntary manufacturer requests and FDA advisory responses. The Senate bill for the 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization would codify core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, including annual reports to Congress and consultations for future reauthorizations. Manufacturers requesting pre-release review of advertisements would be assessed new fees, including an advisory review fee and an operating reserve fee. The 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization bill would require public hearings and review of recommendations, along with transparency in negotiations between the FDA, industry, and advocacy groups. User fees were also introduced in the medical device review process. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA) introduced user fees for premarket reviews of devices and new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority to collect user fees will expire on October 1, 2007, unless reauthorized by Congress in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA) through FY2012, with provisions to lower fee amounts for FY2008, increase by 8.5% annually through FY2012, and introduce new types of fees. Both bills would exempt government entities from establishment fees, with H.R. 2900 extending this waiver to Indian tribes. The Secretary could increase the fee amount by up to an additional 8.5% in FY2010 if fewer than 12,250 establishments paid the fee in FY2009. Both bills would extend the requirement for a certain amount of medical device-related direct appropriations from FY2007 to FY2012 for the Secretary to assess fees. They would also amend a provision regarding the collection and subtraction of fees, with fees collected between FY2008 and FY2011 considered in aggregate. H.R. 2900 would authorize the appropriation of specific sums from FY2009 to FY2012 for postmarket safety information review on medical devices. It would also make reductions in fees in the final year if the amount collected in the four-year period exceeded the authorized amount. The bill would maintain a reference to the provision enabling the Secretary to adjust premarket notification fees annually but would remove the provision itself. Additionally, both bills would reduce fees for small businesses, remove the consideration of assets of partners and parent firms in small business qualification, and allow foreign firms to qualify as small businesses. Both bills aim to reduce fees for small businesses, eliminate the requirement to consider assets of partners and parent firms for small business qualification, and allow foreign firms to qualify as small businesses. They also introduce a new refund policy for modular applications withdrawn before final FDA action, with the Secretary having sole authority over refund decisions. Annual reports through FY2012 are mandated, with H.R. 2900 requiring information on postmarket safety activities and S. 1082 requiring details on previous cohorts of medical device applications to be made public. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 require FDA consultation with various groups, public comment periods, and public meetings for performance goal recommendations. S. 1082 specifies revisions based on public comments, transmittal to Congress, and consultation requirements in the FFDCA. Effective dates differ, with H.R. 2900 upon enactment and S. 1082 on October 1, 2007, with a savings clause for fee collection continuity. Other amendments related to medical device regulation are included in both bills. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to amend medical device regulations, including extending the authority for third-party review of premarket notifications and revising inspection requirements. H.R. 2900 also calls for a study on nosocomial infections related to medical devices. Additionally, both bills require FDA consultation, public comment periods, and public meetings for performance goal recommendations. The bills aim to amend medical device regulations, including third-party review for conformance with international quality standards. They would restrict registration period to October 1 - December 31, require electronic filing, and reduce device list submission to once per year. FDA approval for adult use is also mentioned. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides incentives for drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies due to concerns about off-label prescribing of adult-approved drugs for children, which can lead to ineffective treatment or inappropriate dosing. Children may experience unique side effects and variations in drug metabolism compared to adults. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies by extending market exclusivity for products with FDA-requested pediatric studies. It also lists off-patent products needing pediatric studies for safety and effectiveness assessment, authorizes NIH funding for these studies, and refers on-patent drugs with declined pediatric study requests to the Foundation for the NIH. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) reauthorized exclusivity provisions for five years, set to expire on October 1, 2007. In 1998, FDA mandated pediatric testing data submission with the Pediatric Rule. A federal court invalidated the rule in 2002, leading to the enactment of the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) by Congress, granting FDA authority for pediatric assessments. PREA remains in effect as long as BPCA is authorized. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) for another five years, through FY2012. They also propose changes to encourage research on off-patent products, strengthen labeling requirements based on pediatric studies, and enhance reporting of adverse events. A key difference between the Senate and House bills is the period of exclusivity, with S. 1082 proposing a reduction to three months for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. sales. Additionally, both bills seek to expand FDA's authority under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. H.R. 2900 (Title IV) and S. 1082 aim to reauthorize BPCA and PREA, with H.R. 2900 eliminating the tie between PREA's authorities and BPCA authorization. Both bills also include provisions to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products through the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007. The legislation modifies the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) to allow manufacturers to market medical devices for small patient populations without proving effectiveness, aiming to assist patients with rare diseases. The bills extend the exemption through 2012 and include inspection authorities, guidance, and reporting requirements. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to extend the humanitarian device exemption for medical devices through 2012 and 2013 respectively. They also require the NIH Director to designate a contact point for pediatric medical device funding and the FDA Commissioner to submit a plan for expanding pediatric device research. Additionally, both bills mandate the Secretary to establish a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. Grant funds will be used to connect innovators with manufacturers, manage device development, connect innovators to federal resources, and provide business assistance. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 focus on connecting innovators with manufacturers, managing device development, and providing business assistance. They both require coordination with NIH and FDA, annual reporting of effectiveness, and demonstration grants of $6 million for FY2008 through FY2012. Both bills expand the focus of pediatric medical devices under BPCA and require postmarket surveillance measures under the FFDCA. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand pediatric medical device research and development by amending the FFDCA to include postmarket surveillance measures. The bills would grant the Secretary authority to require postmarket studies for pediatric medical devices with safety controls, potentially exceeding the standard 36-month limit to assess impact on pediatric populations' growth and development. H.R. 2900 also includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers. Since the 1938 passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, manufacturers of new drugs must demonstrate safety and effectiveness to the FDA for approval. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 focused on premarket review, but FDA acknowledges that no drug is completely safe due to rare adverse effects or unrecognized drug associations. The agency evaluates if a drug is safe enough for specific individuals and conditions. The FDA evaluates the safety of drugs based on available information and their use for specific individuals and conditions. Recent concerns have arisen regarding the safety of some widely used drugs, leading to questions about industry transparency and FDA's ability to address postmarket safety concerns. In response, the FDA requested the Institute of Medicine to examine its drug safety practices, resulting in a 2006 report addressing organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. The FDA requested the Institute of Medicine to evaluate its drug safety practices in 2006. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to enhance FDA's ability to identify and address postmarket drug safety issues through new authorities and partnerships. The Senate and House bills propose a strengthened authority and set of procedures to support FDA's postmarket safety activities, including the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to require postmarket studies for drugs and biologics. The bills differ on the criteria for REMS submission. The House and Senate bills propose different criteria for the Secretary to use in determining the need for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for drugs. The House bill focuses on pre-approval to ensure benefits outweigh risks, while the Senate bill requires a REMS based on a serious risk signal. Both bills require certain core elements in all REMS. Both the Senate and House bills propose criteria for REMS for drugs, including core elements like timeframes, instructions, and distribution restrictions. They also allow waivers for certain medical emergencies and off-label use for serious conditions. The bills add structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement to the current FDA practice for REMS. The Senate and House bills propose criteria for REMS for drugs, including core elements and waivers for emergencies and off-label use. They add structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement to current FDA practices. The bills establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board and require evaluations by the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. The Secretary may require postapproval studies or trials. Both the Senate and House bills propose criteria for REMS for drugs, including postapproval studies or clinical trials. The Senate bill focuses on assessing serious risks with drug use, while the House bill authorizes studies based on scientific information to assess known or unexpected risks. Both bills require communication between the sponsor and the Secretary regarding new safety information for drug labeling. The Senate and House bills propose criteria for REMS for drugs, focusing on assessing serious risks and authorizing studies based on scientific information. Both bills require communication between the sponsor and the Secretary regarding new safety information for drug labeling, with defined time limits and dispute resolution procedures in place. The bills also authorize the Secretary to order labeling changes based on new safety information. Both the Senate and House bills propose criteria for REMS for drugs, requiring communication between the sponsor and Secretary for new safety information on drug labeling. The bills also allow the Secretary to order labeling changes and impose civil monetary penalties for violations, including fines of up to $250,000 per violation. The House and Senate bills propose civil penalties for violations of REMS criteria, with fines of up to $250,000 per violation. The House bill includes additional penalties for ongoing violations, with fines of up to $10 million per violation and $50 million for all violations in a single proceeding. The Secretary could also fine sponsors up to $1 million per day for violations posing a substantial threat to public health. Both bills allow the Secretary to deem non-compliant drugs as misbranded and prohibit marketing of products not in compliance with REMS. Additionally, separate civil penalty authority is established for false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads for prescription drugs. Both Senate and House bills propose civil penalties for false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads for prescription drugs. The House bill suggests fines of up to $250,000 for a first violation and up to $500,000 for subsequent violations, while the Senate bill recommends lower fines of up to $150,000 for a first violation and up to $300,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills also authorize increased appropriations for drug safety provisions, with the Senate bill allocating an additional $225 million over FYs 2008 through 2012 for drug safety activities. The House bill authorizes $125 million over five years for drug safety activities and requires guidance for clinical trials of antibiotic drugs. It also allocates $30 million annually for orphan drug development. The Senate bill designates antibiotics as orphan products and authorizes $35 million annually for them, with provisions for extended marketing exclusivity for certain antibiotics. The Senate bill proposes incentives for antibiotic development, including extended marketing exclusivity. It also mandates standardized packaging with counterfeit-resistant technologies for prescription drugs. The House bill focuses on securing the distribution system against counterfeit drugs and requires DTC ads to include information on reporting adverse effects to the FDA. Additionally, both bills include provisions for drug safety reporting and studies. The Senate bill includes provisions for drug safety reporting, establishing an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication, and requiring state-legalized medical marijuana to adhere to FDA regulations. It also introduces incentives for neglected or tropical disease products, such as priority review vouchers. The Senate bill includes provisions for drug safety reporting, establishing an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication, and requiring state-legalized medical marijuana to adhere to FDA regulations. It also introduces incentives for neglected or tropical disease products, such as priority review vouchers. Additionally, the bill would require the FDA Commissioner to create a list of authorized generic drugs and set up a procedure to prevent certain citizen petitions from delaying agency decisions without review by the Secretary. Federal registration requirements for clinical trials were established by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, currently required for clinical trials of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. The proposed legislation (S. 1082 and H.R. 2900) aims to expand the types of clinical trials required to be registered, including drugs, devices, and biologics for various conditions, not just life-threatening ones. It also includes provisions for the publication of trial results and international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 delays the release of medical device information until FDA approval, while S. 1082 exempts pediatric postmarket surveillance. The proposed legislation (S. 1082 and H.R. 2900) aims to expand clinical trial registration requirements for drugs, devices, and biologics. Both bills link certain requirements to trial completion dates and require the responsible party to comply with provisions. H.R. 2900 specifies that a principal investigator must have control over data and the right to publish trial results to serve as the responsible party. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements for drugs, devices, and biologics. H.R. 2900 specifies that a principal investigator must have control over data and the right to publish trial results to serve as the responsible party. Both bills would require expanded information to be included in the registry, be searchable in specific ways, and ensure submitted information is accurate. H.R. 2900 includes additional requirements such as disclosing agreements restricting non-employees from discussing trial results and submitting updates every six months until trial results are submitted to the database. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements for drugs, devices, and biologics. S. 1082 specifies criteria for the registry to be searchable, including the age group studied in the trial. It also outlines a timeline for making registry information public and linking to public clinical trial results. H.R. 2900 provides specific instructions for creating a results database, while S. 1082 requires the Secretary to create a database based on NIH Director recommendations through rulemaking. H.R. 2900 requires specific instructions for a results database, including timing of submissions and public posting. A requirement for non-promotional summaries was replaced with a study by the Comptroller General. Results of pre-approval studies must be made public within 30 days of certain events, such as an NSE letter from the Secretary. The Secretary issued a not substantially equivalent (NSE) letter for a medical device, which may not mark the end of an FDA application. Timing provisions could lead to public disclosure of clinical trial information for pending FDA actions. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 include compliance and enforcement provisions, with H.R. 2900 also covering registry and results database requirements. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 both include provisions for registry and results database requirements. H.R. 2900 also addresses enforcement and coordination between registry and results database, prohibiting noncompliant trials. S. 1082 requires FDA applications to certify registry requirement compliance. One dropped provision from H.R. 2900 would have allowed causes of action for damages under state law. Penalties and enforcement mechanisms for registry requirements are not specified in current law. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 include penalties for noncompliance with FDA requirements. H.R. 2900 allows penalties of $10,000 per day, capping at $15,000, while S. 1082 allows $10,000 for first violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills address conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees. The FDA's approach to conflicts of interest in advisory committees allows for exceptions under specific circumstances. The law governing this is primarily found in the Federal Advisory Committee Act, FDA advisory committee policy, and laws governing special government employees. Proposed bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to change the process of recruiting committee members and granting conflict-of-interest waivers. The proposed bills aim to change the process of recruiting advisory committee members and granting conflict-of-interest waivers. The new provisions would expand requirements to all advisory committees, defining financial interest and activities that must be disclosed. The proposed bills aim to change the recruitment process for advisory committee members and conflict-of-interest waivers. They would require disclosure of a broad range of activities, including grants and contracts, for drug and biologics committees. The bills focus on recruiting experts from academia, medical research institutions, and public interest groups, with provisions to discourage financial conflicts. Additionally, they allow non-voting guest experts with financial interests if they have required expertise. Full financial disclosure would be required for advisory committee members. The proposed bills aim to change the recruitment process for advisory committee members and conflict-of-interest waivers. They would require full financial disclosure for members and preclude voting by those with conflicts of interest unless exempted. Waivers for essential expertise would be allowed, with public disclosures and annual reports on conflict-of-interest determinations. The bills also mandate the review and update of FDA conflict-of-interest guidance every five years. The proposed bills would establish a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission, with a board including representatives from various organizations. The Foundation would set goals, coordinate with federal programs, and award grants to advance those goals. The bills also mandate the review and update of FDA conflict-of-interest guidance every five years. The House and Senate bills propose transferring funds to a Foundation to advance FDA's mission. They also require the establishment of an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA. S. 1082 allows importation of prescription drugs and includes provisions not present in H.R. 2900. The Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2007 would allow importation of drugs for commercial and personal use, with provisions for safety, cost savings, and program administration. The Senate added a second-degree amendment requiring certification from the HHS Secretary for implementation, which has not been provided, effectively nullifying the title. Title VI of S. 1082 addresses food safety by establishing regulations for pet food processing and ingredient standards, nutrient information on labels, and an early warning system for adulteration and disease outbreaks. The Secretary would be required to manage recalls and alert the public during food recalls. H.R. 2900 does not include any food provisions. Title VI of S. 1082 focuses on food safety measures, including the establishment of a registry for adulterated food and the coordination of recall alerts to the public. The Secretary would be responsible for managing recalls, verifying information for the registry, and taking necessary actions to protect public health. The bill focuses on food safety measures, including establishing a registry for adulterated food and issuing alerts to the public for repeated outbreaks or adulteration. The responsible party must maintain records and report to the FDA once adulteration is determined. The Secretary must also establish standards for reporting suspected adulteration and notify the Department of Homeland Security in case of deliberate adulteration. Additionally, an annual report to Congress on food imports, inspectors, violations, and enforcement actions is required. The bill requires an annual report to Congress on food imports, inspectors, violations, and enforcement actions. Certain provisions in Title V would also require reports on various food issues such as pesticide residue monitoring, health hazards of substances used in meat preservation, and environmental risks of genetically engineered seafood products. The bill includes provisions on performance and financial status, environmental risks of genetically engineered seafood products, marketing of crustaceans, risk detection, and authorization of appropriations for aquaculture inspection. It also prohibits importing from foreign food facilities that deny access to U.S. inspectors and enhances FDA inspection for aquaculture through partnerships. Additionally, it allows for the sale of pet turtles with specific requirements and mandates an Institute of Medicine report on genetic test safety. The bill includes provisions on genetic test safety, FDA report on indoor tanning device labeling, and flexibility in regulation of follow-on biologics. It also addresses intellectual property violations and price manipulation concerns. The House bill includes a provision for public-private partnerships with educational or tax-exempt organizations to implement the FDA Critical Path Initiative, with funding allocated for FY2008 and subsequent years."
