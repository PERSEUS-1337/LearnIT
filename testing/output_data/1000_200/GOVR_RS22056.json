    "content": "Congress has been grappling with reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for over five years. The Act authorizes various Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. Despite the expiration of authorizations of appropriations for IHCIA programs in FY2001, Congress continues to fund these programs. Appropriations for IHCIA programs expired in FY2001, but Congress continues to fund the programs. Major changes to IHCIA have been proposed, leading to a series of reauthorization bills from the 106th-109th Congresses. Bills such as S. 1057 and H.R. 5312 have been introduced and reported, with ongoing negotiations and amendments to Indian health provisions in Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP. The Finance Committee bill, S. 3524, amends the Social Security Act regarding Indian health provisions in Medicaid, Medicare, and SCHIP. The bill was reported by the Committee on July 12 (S.Rept. 109-278). Congress is facing a multi-billion-dollar problem related to Indian trust funds, with claims against the United States by Indian individuals and tribes amounting to as much as $176 billion. This issue has also led to the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) within the Department of the Interior. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) manage funds, lands, and assets held in trust for Indian tribes and individuals. Trust lands total about 56 million acres, with funds totaling $3.3 billion in tribal and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The BIA has faced criticism for its management of trust lands and funds, with past investigations revealing issues in documenting asset values and linking lands to owners. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 was enacted to address issues with the management of Indian trust funds and assets. This led to the creation of the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) to oversee trust management reforms. Subsequently, a class action suit was filed by IIM account holders demanding an accounting of their funds and correction of fund mismanagement. Additionally, tribal suits have been filed, resulting in the reorganization of the BIA and OST, and congressional consideration of settling IIM and tribal claims. The Cobell case involves breaches of trust duties by the DOI and Treasury regarding document retention, data gathering, and staffing for trust management. The court ordered them to bring trust management up to current standards, with the final stage determining the amount owed to IIM plaintiffs. DOI proposed reconciling trust account transactions above a certain value in 2003. The DOI proposed using a historical accounting method to determine the amount owed to the plaintiffs in the Cobell case. The plaintiffs suggested using production and mapping databases to estimate losses, which they claim to be over $100 billion. The district court has twice ordered the DOI to perform a historical accounting of all trust account transactions since 1887 without using statistical sampling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the orders. Compliance with the accounting is estimated to cost $12-13 billion. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court's order for historical accounting in the Cobell case. Congress has not introduced any bills to amend the 1994 Act regarding historical accounting obligations. Concerns remain about the costs of the lawsuit jeopardizing DOI trust reform. Congress is looking to amend the 1994 Act to clarify historical accounting obligations, with concerns about the costs of the Cobell lawsuit impacting DOI trust reform and other Indian programs. Current and potential future costs include ongoing litigation expenses, a $12-$13 billion court-ordered historical accounting, a possible Cobell settlement, and estimates exceeding $100 billion for IIM account payments. Funding sources may include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund,\" though some question its sufficiency for a large settlement. Congress is considering options for addressing the costs of the Cobell lawsuit, including establishing a settlement fund and creating a commission to review Indian trust asset management. Two settlement bills have been introduced in Congress, aiming to distribute payments to IIM claimants and address historical accounting obligations. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee is considering legislation to address Indian trust asset management, including increased payments for individual Indian trust interests and creating a tribal trust management project. Hearings have been held on the bills, with a settlement amount of $8 billion proposed but withdrawn for further negotiations. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee is considering legislation to address Indian trust asset management, including increased payments for individual Indian trust interests and creating a tribal trust management project. The $8-billion settlement proposal was withdrawn at the Administration's request for further negotiations over including IIM land mismanagement claims and IIM accounting and funds mismanagement claims. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made administrative and organizational changes since the 1994 Act, including transferring trust fund management from BIA to OST in 1996. In April 2003, a reorganization split BIA trust management operations from other services and created OST field operations to oversee trust management and provide information to Indian trust beneficiaries. The DOI reorganized trust management operations in 2003, creating OST to oversee trust management and provide information to Indian trust beneficiaries. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing lack of consultation and undefined OST duties. Legislation proposing changes in DOI and BIA trust management has not advanced in Congress. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 aim to address Indian trust asset management. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose reorganizing DOI management of Indian trust assets. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act regulates gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands, allowing exceptions for specific circumstances. The bills S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to curb exceptions in acquiring trust lands for tribes, criticized for enabling \"reservation shopping\" and undermining on-reservation economic development. These bills remove the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allow applications filed before specific dates to proceed, with H.R. 4893 adding a geographic limitation. The bills S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to restrict exceptions in acquiring trust lands for tribes, removing the need for secretarial and gubernatorial agreements. Applications filed before specific dates can proceed, with H.R. 4893 adding a geographic limitation. H.R. 4893 introduces new restrictions for newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes, which opponents argue are unfair.

Native Hawaiians, not considered Indians under federal law, lack a recognized political entity but benefit from federal programs. Supporters of recognition are concerned about the absence of a recognized Native Hawaiian political entity, which puts federal and state Native Hawaiian programs at risk. Three bills in the 109th Congress aim to establish a process for federal recognition of a Native Hawaiian political entity, but questions about governmental powers and lands remain unresolved. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity due to its constitutional authority over indigenous native peoples in the United States. They also point to the special political and legal relationship Congress has with the Native Hawaiian people, citing established programs like the Hawaiian homelands program. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs was established in 1921 under Hawaii state control, reserving certain public lands for lease only to Native Hawaiians. Proponents argue that Native Hawaiians have not given up their claims to sovereignty, citing the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Opponents dispute Congress's authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity. Opponents argue that Congress lacks constitutional authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity, as it extends only to Indian tribes. They also claim the US does not have a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians and that recognition would be based on race alone, setting a precedent for other non-Indian groups. The US Civil Rights Commission opposes the recognition, citing concerns of racial discrimination. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission issued a report opposing the passage of S. 147 due to racial discrimination concerns. Some opponents dispute claims about Native Hawaiian sovereignty, arguing that sovereignty ended before 1893. Bills similar to S. 147 have been considered in previous Congresses, with S. 147 failing to proceed in the Senate on June 8, 2006. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on a motion to consider S. 147 and S. 3064, effectively ending Senate consideration of the bills. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee and has not been reported. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on constitutional issues raised by H.R. 309."
