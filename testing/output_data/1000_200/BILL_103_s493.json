    "content": "The \"Hospital Cooperative Agreement Act\" aims to promote collaboration among hospitals to reduce costs and enhance efficiency in healthcare delivery by avoiding unnecessary duplication of expensive medical services. Additionally, a Hospital Technology and Services Sharing Demonstration Program is introduced to facilitate this cooperation. The Secretary will establish a demonstration program awarding grants to up to 10 eligible hospitals to collaborate on expensive medical technology or resource-intensive services. The program aims to reduce costs, increase access to care, and improve quality of care. Eligible applicants must be hospitals submitting an application to the Secretary. The Secretary will require hospitals to submit information for a voluntary cooperative agreement with other hospitals for sharing medical technology or services. The application must include details of the activities, consideration passing under the agreement, and any other relevant information determined appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary will evaluate applications for voluntary cooperative agreements between hospitals to share medical technology or services. Evaluation guidelines will be developed by the Administrator of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and the Secretary will consider if the cooperative agreements meet these guidelines before awarding grants. The Secretary evaluates applications for voluntary cooperative agreements between hospitals to enhance care quality, preserve facilities, improve cost-effectiveness, utilize resources efficiently, and avoid duplication. Grant amounts are used solely for facilitating collaboration among hospitals, not for purchasing. The grants awarded under this section are used for collaboration among hospitals, not for purchasing facilities or equipment. Permissible uses include expenses for personnel, administrative services, support services, and instructional programs. At least three grants are designated to demonstrate how cooperative agreements can improve access to care in rural areas outside metropolitan statistical areas. The term 'rural areas' in this section refers to areas outside of metropolitan statistical areas. Cooperative agreements under this section involve sharing medical technology and services among participating hospitals, including drugs, devices, procedures, and support systems. Eligible services for sharing under these agreements are specified. The demonstration program established under this section allows for sharing high-cost services to avoid excess capacity in the community for a 5-year term. Mobile clinic services may be included in the shared services. The demonstration program under this section allows for cooperative agreements for 5 years to reduce healthcare costs, increase access to medical services, and improve healthcare quality. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress after 5 years with recommendations for future programs. It is not a violation of antitrust laws for hospitals to enter into these agreements. Antitrust laws do not prohibit hospitals from entering into cooperative agreements to reduce healthcare costs, increase access to medical services, and improve healthcare quality. The term 'antitrust laws' refers to the Sherman Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, and laws against unlawful restraints. The Clayton Act, along with State antitrust laws, prohibits certain activities. Appropriations are authorized for the implementation of these laws from 1994 to 1998."
