    "content": "The Forest Landscape Restoration Act may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The purpose of the Act is outlined in Section 2. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by encouraging sustainability, leveraging local and national resources, reducing wildfire management costs, and demonstrating the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques and the use of forest restoration byproducts. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act promotes collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by reducing wildfire management costs and utilizing forest restoration byproducts to offset treatment costs, benefiting rural economies and improving forest health. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries.\" It establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, overseen by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. Activities must comply with relevant laws, and proposals for funding must have a complete landscape restoration strategy. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, overseen by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. Funding proposals must have a landscape restoration strategy that identifies and prioritizes ecological restoration treatments for a 10-year period across a landscape of at least 50,000 acres, primarily forested Federal lands, accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, overseen by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. Funding proposals must prioritize ecological restoration treatments for a 10-year period across a landscape of at least 50,000 acres, primarily forested Federal lands, accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. The program aims to use woody biomass and small-diameter wood in ecological restoration, incorporate the best available science, and avoid establishing permanent roads. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program aims to prioritize ecological restoration treatments for a 10-year period across forested Federal lands. The program must use fire for ecological restoration, improve fish and wildlife habitat, and avoid establishing permanent roads. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program focuses on using fire for ecological restoration, improving wildlife habitat, maintaining water quality, controlling invasive species, managing roads, utilizing woody biomass, and reporting performance annually. It also includes developing small business incubators. The \"10 Year Comprehensive Strategy Implementation Plan\" from December 2006 includes developing small business incubators and providing employment and training opportunities in rural communities through various entities. It also emphasizes hiring or training local people for monitoring activities. The proposal aims to involve local communities in completing contracts, consider wildfire protection plans, analyze cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs and lower unit costs over time, estimate annual Federal funding needed, and determine non-Federal investment leveraged by Federal funding for ecological restoration treatments. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal involves local communities in completing contracts, considering wildfire protection plans, analyzing cost savings, estimating annual Federal funding needed, and determining non-Federal investment leveraged by Federal funding for ecological restoration treatments. The nomination process requires submission to the Bureau of Land Management and Regional Forester for selection. Management or a Regional Forester can nominate collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals for selection by the Secretaries. The State Director or Regional Forester making the nomination must include a proposal to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands. The Secretaries can select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals for Federal lands not covered by transferred amounts from the Fund. Evidence must show that funds transferred will be used for ecological restoration treatments in the same fiscal year. Activities on non-jurisdictional land must be included in the proposal. The restoration proposal for non-covered Federal lands must include evidence of the owner's intent to participate and fund the activities. The Secretaries will select the best collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals after consulting with advisory panels. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals that have been nominated and meet eligibility criteria. Special consideration will be given to the ecological case, collaborative process strength, cost reduction potential, and likelihood of success. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals based on ecological case, collaborative process strength, cost reduction potential, and likelihood of success. Limitations include funding up to 10 proposals per fiscal year and 2 proposals per region. Advisory panels may be involved in the selection process. The Secretaries will establish scientific and technical advisory panels to evaluate landscape restoration proposals for funding in the National Forest System. The panels will assess ecological case strength, proposed restoration strategies, and potential reductions in wildfire management costs. The Secretaries may establish a technical advisory panel of experts in rural business development and woody biomass to evaluate proposals for reducing wildfire management costs and providing local economic benefits. A Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund will be established in the Treasury of the United States. Establishment of the \"Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund\" in the Treasury of the United States to cover 50% of ecological restoration costs on Federal lands. The Fund will receive appropriations and interest earnings for restoration treatments selected under subsection (e). The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer necessary amounts to the Secretaries for restoration treatments from the Fund upon request. The Secretaries will determine necessary amounts for ecological restoration treatments and establish an accounting system for the Fund. $40,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2018. Within 180 days of selecting a forest restoration proposal, a work plan and budget will be created in collaboration with interested parties. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal requires a work plan and budget that includes a description of implementation methods for ecological and community benefits, a business plan addressing cost reductions, infrastructure needs, and sustainability of woody biomass supply. The proposal includes details on the supply of woody biomass and small-diameter trees for ecological restoration, projected local economic benefits, and documentation of non-Federal investments in the priority landscape. Amounts transferred from the Fund will be used for ecological restoration treatments consistent with the landscape proposal and identified through a collaborative process. The Secretaries will provide an annual report in collaboration with stakeholders. The Secretaries, in collaboration with stakeholders, will prepare an annual report on the accomplishments of selected collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals. The report will include details on treated acres, progress evaluation, community benefits, and multiparty monitoring results. The annual report on collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals will include details on community benefits achieved, results of multiparty monitoring, and a summary of costs for treatments and fire management activities. The Secretaries will use a multiparty monitoring process to assess the effects of each project for at least 15 years after implementation. The Secretaries will submit a report every 5 years on the forest landscape restoration program to relevant Senate and House committees, assessing its effectiveness in fulfilling the purposes of the Act."
