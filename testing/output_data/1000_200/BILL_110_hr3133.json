    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Financial Literacy for Homeowners Act\". The Congress acknowledges the impact of expanded access to credit on homeownership rates, but expresses concern about predatory lending practices by some lenders. Borrowers with fair credit can access prime loans with lower rates, while those with poor credit resort to subprime loans with higher costs. Predatory lending involves offering home mortgages, refinancing, equity loans, and repair loans with high interest rates, excessive fees, and unreasonable terms. These loans have disproportionately affected minority neighborhoods, stripping away wealth accumulated over decades. Some communities lacking access to traditional institutions are targeted by predatory lenders, contractors, and finance companies. Institutions were victimized by second mortgage lenders, home improvement contractors, and finance companies offering high-interest home equity loans with high fees to cash-poor homeowners. Borrowers, often unaware of loan terms, struggled with mortgage payments and faced foreclosure. A report urged Congress to pass legislation curbing abusive practices in mortgage markets and improving consumer protections. The joint report proposed a four-point plan to address predatory lending practices, including improving consumer literacy and disclosures by requiring lenders to recommend home mortgage counseling, disclose credit scores, and provide timely and accurate loan information. Several government agencies are involved in addressing predatory lending issues to reduce high-pressure sales tactics and misleading information to borrowers. This threatens the work of nonprofit organizations in improving distressed neighborhoods. More assistance is needed for borrowers with predatory loans, consumer education on home loan risks, and referrals to appropriate agencies for help. The government agencies address predatory lending issues by reducing high-pressure sales tactics and providing consumer education on home loan risks. They refer borrowers to appropriate agencies for help. The government addresses predatory lending by providing consumer education and counseling through a grant program. The Secretary of the Treasury may grant funds to States, local governments, and nonprofits for anti-predatory lending activities. These activities include education programs to inform vulnerable consumers about unfair lending practices related to home loans. The curr_chunk discusses unjustifiably high interest rates, excessive fees, and other predatory lending practices related to home loans. It also mentions counseling programs and referral services for homeowners and prospective homeowners to address these issues. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State, local government unit, or nonprofit organization must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. Grant funds are to be used for activities related to handling consumer complaints about predatory lending practices in home loans. The maximum grant amount is specified. The Secretary will select applicants for grants under this section based on established criteria, with a maximum grant amount of $1,000,000 per fiscal year. SEC. 4.

The Secretary designates a chairperson, and the Council meets at least three times a year. They have the authority to hold public hearings and provide advice on the grant program.

They also conduct a study on the root causes of default and foreclosure of home loans.
