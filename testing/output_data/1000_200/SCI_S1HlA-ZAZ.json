The memory is analytically tractable, enabling optimal compression through a Bayesian update-rule. Formulated as a hierarchical generative model, it combines memory and perception to produce observation codes. Empirical results show improved generative models on Omniglot and CIFAR datasets compared to DNC. The memory model has greater capacity and is easier to train than DNC variants. The model has greater capacity and is easier to train. Recent work in machine learning explores new ways to enhance neural networks with memory. The challenge of efficiently utilizing memory remains unresolved. Different models like DNCs collapse reading and writing into single slots, limiting information sharing. Matching Networks and Neural Episodic Controller store data embeddings, requiring memory volume to increase with stored samples. In contrast, the Neural Statistician summarizes datasets by averaging over them. The Neural Statistician BID7 summarizes datasets by averaging over their embeddings, resulting in small \"statistics.\" This method may drop information but contrasts with the desire for large memories to capture details of past experiences. Associative memory architectures like the Hopfield Net BID14 store patterns in low-energy states, limited by the number of recurrent connections. The Boltzmann Machine BID1 introduces latent variables to lift this constraint but at a cost. The Boltzmann Machine BID1 introduces latent variables to lift the constraint of recurrent connections, but requires slow reading and writing mechanisms. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory model BID15 resolves this issue by allowing fast reads and writes, dissociating capacity from input dimensionality. A conditional generative memory model inspired by Kanerva's model is presented in this paper, with learnable addresses and reparametrised latent variables. The model solves the problem of learning an effective memory writing operation by deriving a Bayesian memory update rule. Our proposal introduces a hierarchical generative model with a memory-dependent prior that quickly adapts to new data, enriching priors in VAE-like models through an adaptive memory. It offers an effective way to learn online distributed writing for compression and storage of complex data, extending the VAE architecture with an adaptive memory store. The memory architecture extends the VAE model with an adaptive memory store. It involves observable and latent variables, generative and inference models, and parameterised Gaussian distributions. The objective is to maximize log-likelihood by training the VAE on an iid dataset. The VAE is trained on iid samples to maximize log-likelihood by jointly optimizing \u03b8 and \u03c6. The model introduces an exchangeable episode concept where the objective is the expected conditional log-likelihood. The memory architecture includes observable and latent variables, generative and inference models, and parameterized Gaussian distributions. The equality utilizes the conditional independence of x given the memory M, factorizing the joint distribution of p(X, M) into p(X) and p(M|X). Maximizing J is equivalent to maximizing I(X; M), the mutual information between memory and episode. Latent variables Y and Z are defined, and the generative model's joint distribution is illustrated in FIG0. The joint distribution of the generative model can be factorized using the conditional independence of z, y, and x given memory M. The memory M follows a matrix variate Gaussian distribution, with R as the mean, U providing row covariances, and V providing column covariances. Independence is assumed between columns of M, with full freedom for U. The memory M in the generative model follows a matrix variate Gaussian distribution with R as the mean, U for row covariances, and V for column covariances. Independence is assumed between columns of M, with full freedom for U. The addresses A are optimised through back-propagation, with the addressing variable yt used to compute weights for memory access. The projection f transforms yt into a key vector, and the weights wt across rows of M are computed using a multi-layer perception (MLP). The projection f, implemented as a multi-layer perception (MLP), transforms the distribution of yt and wt to non-Gaussian distributions. The code zt generates samples of xt through a conditional distribution. Zt has a memory-dependent prior, resulting in a richer marginal distribution. In the hierarchical model, M is a global latent variable capturing episode statistics, while local latent variables yt and zt are also present. In a hierarchical model, M is a global latent variable capturing episode statistics, while local latent variables yt and zt capture local statistics for data xt within an episode. The posterior distribution q\u03c6(zt|xt, yt, M) refines the prior distribution p\u03b8(zt|yt, M) with additional evidence from xt. The generative model involves sampling M once, followed by sequential sampling of yt, zt, and xt for each sample in an episode of length T. The approximated posterior distribution is factorized using conditional independence, with parameterized approximate posterior distributions q\u03c6(yt|xt) and q\u03c6(yt|xt). The text discusses the trade-off in updating memory between preserving old information and writing new information. It suggests balancing this trade-off optimally through Bayes' rule. Memory writing is interpreted as inference, computing the posterior distribution of memory. Batch and online inference methods are considered, with the posterior distribution of memory approximated using one sample of yt and xt. The addressing variable q\u03c6(yt|xt) is also discussed. The text discusses updating memory by balancing old and new information through Bayes' rule. Memory writing is seen as inference, with the posterior distribution of memory approximated using one sample of yt and xt. The posterior of addressing variable q\u03c6(yt|xt) is considered, and the posterior of code q\u03c6(zt|xt) is a parameterised distribution. The posterior of memory p\u03b8(M|Y, Z) in the linear Gaussian model is analytically tractable, with parameters R and U updated based on prediction error and cross-covariance. The update rule for memory involves balancing old and new information using Bayes' rule. Prior parameters are trained through back-propagation to learn the general dataset structure, while the posterior adapts to features in each episode. Inverting \u03a3 z is the main cost, with a complexity of O(T 3 ). Online updating can reduce per-step cost by updating one sample at a time. The update rule involves balancing old and new information using Bayes' rule. Updating using one sample at a time simplifies the inversion of \u03a3 z. Performing intermediate updates with mini-batches can also be done. The storage and multiplication of the row-covariance matrix U is a major cost in the update rule, with a complexity of O(K 2 ). Future work may involve investigating low-rank approximation of U for better cost-performance balance. Future work may involve investigating low-rank approximation of U for better cost-performance balance during training of the model. This involves optimising a variational lower-bound of the conditional likelihood and using mean-field approximation for memory efficiency. Additionally, exploiting the analytical tractability of the Gaussian distribution can improve distribution-based reading and writing operations. The iterative sampling mechanism in Kanerva's sparse distributed memory involves feeding back output as input for multiple iterations, leading to decreased errors within a generous range and convergence to a stored memory. This process is also present in the model discussed, utilizing Gibbs-like sampling by repeatedly feeding back the reconstruction. While convergence cannot be proven, experiments have shown promising results. The model discussed utilizes Gibbs-like sampling for iterative reading, improving denoising and sampling. Training with the whole matrix M as input is costly, but loopy belief-propagation can efficiently approximate intractable posteriors. Iterative sampling with the model works well due to the local coupling between x t and y t. The model uses iterative reading with q \u03c6 (y t |x t ) to improve denoising and sampling. Implementation details are in Appendix C, with a focus on evaluating adaptive memory benefits. The model architecture remains consistent across experiments, with variations in filter numbers, memory size, and code size. The Adam optimizer is used for training, with minimal tuning required. Variational lower bound values are reported in all experiments. The model used an optimizer for training and required minimal tuning. Variational lower bound values were reported in all experiments. The Omniglot dataset was used to test the model, with challenges in capturing the complex distribution. A memory size of 64 \u00d7 100 and an address matrix size of 64 \u00d7 50 were used. Random sampling of 32 images from the training set was done to form an \"episode\". A mini-batch size of 16 was used for optimization. The model used a mini-batch size of 16 and optimized the variational lower-bound using Adam with a learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124. The model was also tested with the CIFAR dataset, using convolutional coders with 32 features at each layer and a code size of 200. The training process was compared with a baseline VAE model using the same encoder and decoder. The training process of the Kanerva Machine model was compared with a baseline VAE model using the same encoder and decoder. The model showed a modest increase in parameters compared to the VAE. Figure 2 displays the negative variational lower bound, reconstruction loss, and KL-Divergence during learning, indicating that the Kanerva Machine learned to use memory. The model achieved better results in terms of the negative variational lower-bound, reconstruction, and KL-divergence compared to the VAE on the Omniglot dataset. The Kanerva Machine model achieved better results in terms of reconstruction and KL-divergence compared to the VAE. The model learned to use memory effectively, leading to a sharp decrease in KL-divergence around the 2000th step. This rich prior from memory significantly improved sample quality, as observed in training curves for CIFAR. The VAE model showed a reduction in KL-divergence, improving sample quality in experiments with Omniglot and CIFAR. At the end of training, the VAE reached a negative log-likelihood of \u2264 112.7, demonstrating the power of incorporating an adaptive memory into generative models. The VAE model demonstrated improved sample quality by reducing KL-divergence and achieving a negative log-likelihood of \u2264 112.7 at the end of training. Incorporating an adaptive memory into generative models showed significant improvement, as seen in the reconstruction examples and denoising through iterative reading in Figure 3. The text discusses the generalization of \"one-shot\" generation to a batch of images with many classes and samples. Samples from the VAE and Kanerva Machine are compared, showing improved quality in consecutive iterations. Conditional samples from CIFAR are also shown, highlighting the convergence of iterative sampling. This approach does not apply to VAEs, as they lack the capability for iterative sampling. The comparison between samples from VAE and Kanerva Machine shows that the Kanerva Machine has clearer local structures despite using the same encoder and decoder. The iterative sampling approach converged for conditional samples from CIFAR, but it does not apply to VAEs due to their lack of structure for iterative sampling. Our model can recover original images from corrupted inputs through iterative reading, showing interpretability of internal representations in memory. Linear interpolations between address weights are meaningful, as demonstrated by interpolating weight vectors from random input images. The model can recover original images from corrupted inputs through iterative reading, showing interpretability of internal representations in memory. Interpolating between access weights from random input images produces meaningful and smoothly changing images. Training curves of DNC and Kanerva machine show differences in sensitivity to initialization and error rates. Test variational lower-bounds of DNC and Kanerva Machine are compared based on episode sizes and sample classes. The model is also compared with DNC and LRUA using the same storage and retrieval task. The Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) and the Kanerva Machine were tested in a storage and retrieval task with Omniglot data. The DNC was sensitive to hyper-parameters and random initialization, while the Kanerva Machine was robust and performed well with various hyper-parameters. The DNC reached a test loss close to 100, while the Kanerva Machine trained fastest with a batch size of 16. The Kanerva Machine, with batch sizes between 8 and 64 and learning rates between 3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124, trained fastest with batch size 16 and learning rate 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124. It converged below 70 test loss with all configurations, making it easier to train due to principled reading and writing operations. The model's capacity was analyzed compared to the DNC by examining the likelihood when storing and retrieving patterns from larger episodes. Both models exploited redundancy in episodes with varying numbers of classes. The Kanerva Machine generalizes well to larger episodes and outperforms the DNC in terms of variational lower-bound. It combines slow-learning neural networks with a fast-adapting linear Gaussian model as memory, removing the assumption of a uniform data distribution. Memory is implemented as a generative model, allowing for retrieval of unseen patterns through sampling, consistent with constructive memory neuroscience experiments. Our model generalizes Kanerva's memory model to continuous, non-uniform data while integrating with deep neural networks. This is the first model to do so while maintaining an analytic form of Bayesian inference. Other models have combined memory mechanisms with neural networks in a generative setting, such as using attention to retrieve information from a set of trainable parameters. Our model extends Kanerva's memory model to continuous, non-uniform data by integrating with deep neural networks. Unlike other models, our model quickly adapts to new data for episode-based learning. Our model learns to store information in a compressed form by taking advantage of statistical regularity in images. It employs an exact Bayes' update-rule for memory updates, combining classical statistical models with neural networks for novel memory models in machine learning. Kanerva's sparse distributed memory model in machine learning utilizes fixed addresses A pointing to modifiable memory M. Both A and M have the same size of K \u00d7 D, where K is the number of addresses and D is the input dimensionality. Inputs are compared with addresses through Hamming distance, with addresses randomly sampled to reflect input statistics. The Hamming distance between binary vectors a and b in {\u22121, 1} D is calculated as h(a, b) = 1 2 (D \u2212 a \u00b7 b). An address k is selected when the hamming distance between x and A k is smaller than a threshold \u03c4. During writing, a pattern x is stored into memory M by adding M k \u2190 M k + w k x. For reading, the memory contents pointed to by selected addresses are summed together to produce a readout. Kanerva's model shows that when both K and D are large enough, a small portion of addresses will always be selected, making operations sparse and distributed. Kanerva's model demonstrates that operations in memory are sparse and distributed, allowing for correct retrieval of stored vectors even with multiple overwrites. However, the model's application is limited by the assumption of uniform and binary data distribution, which is not often true in real-world scenarios. The model's architecture includes a convolutional encoder for image input conversion into embedding vectors. This differs from a standard VAE and is more efficient for high-level neural network implementations optimized for floating-point numbers. The model uses a convolutional encoder to convert input images into embedding vectors. It consists of 3 blocks with convolutional layers and ResNet blocks. The decoder mirrors this structure. Adding noise to the input helps stabilize training. Adding noise to the input into q \u03c6 (y t |x t ) stabilizes training by restricting information in the addresses. Gaussian noise with zero mean and standard deviation of 0.2 is used for all experiments. Different likelihood functions are used for Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. To prevent Gaussian likelihood collapsing, uniform noise U(0, 1 256 ) is added to CIFAR images during training. The DNC is wrapped with the same interface as the Kanerva memory for fair comparison, receiving addressing variable y t and z t during reading and writing stages. During writing, the DNC receives z t sampled from q \u03c6 (z t |x t) as input, using a 2-layer MLP with 200 hidden neurons and ReLU nonlinearity as the controller. To avoid interference with DNC's external memory, LSTM is not used. Controllers bypassing the memory are prevented to avoid confusion in the auto-encoding setting. The DNC generates output by ignoring the memory and functioning as a skip connection to avoid confusion in the auto-encoding setting. The focus is on memory performance, with models using full covariance matrices showing faster test loss decrease compared to models using diagonal covariance matrices. The bottom-up stream in the model compensates for the memory. The model utilizes a bottom-up stream to compensate for memory, sampling z t directly from p \u03b8 (z t |y t , M ) for reconstruction. Training on CIFAR shows a decrease in test loss, with a small difference in KL-divergence impacting sample quality. The advantage of the Kanerva Machine over the VAE is increasing during training. The Kanerva Machine shows increasing advantage over the VAE during training. A linear Gaussian model is defined in Eq. 6, with joint distribution and posterior distribution equations derived using Gaussian conditional formula. The update rule is presented in Eq. 9 to 11, and an alternative method utilizing the analytic tractability of the Gaussian distribution is described for reading and writing.
