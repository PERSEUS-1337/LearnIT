    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2008\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. The \"Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2008\" emphasizes the importance of experienced counsel, protecting privileged communications, and enhancing compliance programs through clarity on attorney-client privilege. Prosecutors and government officials can conduct investigations while respecting attorney-client privileges and individual rights. Law enforcement has effective investigative tools that do not require privileged information, as recognized in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The Department of Justice and other agencies are implementing policies that undermine the adversarial system of justice by pressuring organizations to waive attorney-client privilege to avoid indictment. This encroaches on employees' constitutional rights and legal protections. An indictment can have severe consequences for an organization, potentially leading to its demise or inability to defend itself in court. The purpose of this Act is to set clear limits to protect attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine for organizations and legal protections for employees. The Act aims to prevent these protections from being used to conceal wrongdoing or provide advice on evading the law. SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE OR ADVANCEMENT OF COUNSEL FEES AS ELEMENTS OF COOPERATION. In section 3014 of Chapter 201 of title 18, US Code, definitions for attorney-client privilege and attorney work product are provided in the context of investigations and enforcement matters regarding organizations. The term 'product' refers to materials prepared by an attorney in anticipation of litigation, containing their mental impressions or legal theories. The term 'organization' excludes criminal enterprises, groups seeking money through illegal acts, and terrorist organizations. In Federal investigations or enforcement matters, attorney-client privilege and work product are defined. In Federal investigations or enforcement matters, agents or attorneys of the United States are prohibited from demanding, rewarding, or penalizing organizations or individuals to waive attorney-client privilege or attorney work product protections. In Federal investigations or enforcement matters, agents or attorneys of the United States are prohibited from penalizing organizations or individuals for refusing to waive attorney-client privilege or attorney work product protections when making charging decisions. In Federal investigations or enforcement matters, agents or attorneys of the United States are prohibited from penalizing organizations or individuals for asserting attorney-client privilege or attorney work product protections. The work product doctrine includes provision of counsel, contribution to legal defense fees, joint defense agreements, and sharing relevant information in investigations. In response to an investigation or enforcement matter, an organization must not fail to take action against an employee for exercising their legal rights. This applies to federal investigations and enforcement matters. In federal investigations or enforcement matters, agents or attorneys cannot demand an organization or its employees to refrain from certain conduct. This does not prohibit them from requesting communication or material that they reasonably believe is not privileged. In federal investigations, agents or attorneys cannot demand privileged information unless it is not protected under attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine. Voluntary waivers of privilege are allowed, and charging decisions cannot be influenced by such waivers. Agents or attorneys of the United States are prohibited from considering privileged information, including material subject to attorney-client privilege or work-product protection, in making charging decisions or determining cooperation with the Government. Agents or attorneys of the United States may consider voluntary disclosures for lawful purposes. This section does not affect other statutes allowing agents to compel attorney-client privileged material. Charging decisions do not include charging under independent prohibitions. The text discusses the potential prosecution of individuals associated with an organization for specific conduct under Federal law. It also includes a conforming amendment to the table of sections for chapter 201 of title 18, United States Code. Preservation of fundamental legal protections and rights in investigations and enforcement matters involving organizations."
