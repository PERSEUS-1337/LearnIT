    "content": "President Trump proposes to resume development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, with a budget request of $120 million for the Department of Energy and $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in FY2019. The House passed an appropriations bill that includes $100 million more than the Administration's request. The House passed an appropriations bill (H.R. 5895) on June 8, 2018, with $100 million more than the Administration's request for Yucca Mountain. The Senate version of the bill, passed on June 25, 2018, does not include funding for Yucca Mountain. Yucca Mountain is the only site considered by the DOE for a national high-level radioactive waste repository under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Obama Administration halted funding for Yucca Mountain in 2010, but Congress has not amended the NWPA, which still designates Yucca Mountain as the sole repository. The Obama Administration halted funding for Yucca Mountain in 2010, but Congress has not amended the NWPA, which still designates Yucca Mountain as the sole repository. After terminating the Yucca Mountain project, the Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC) to develop a new nuclear waste policy. The BRC recommended creating a new organization to develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a \"consent based\" process involving negotiations with various levels of government. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing nuclear waste facilities through negotiations and conducting research on waste disposal technologies. The DOE issued a strategy for a new nuclear waste program, calling for a new management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The strategy included plans for an interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. The DOE issued a draft consent-based siting process for the Yucca Mountain repository in 2017. The House approved a bill in 2018 to withdraw the site from other uses, meeting NRC licensing conditions. NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report in response to a court order, determining if the repository meets standards. The NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) in October 2014, stating that DOE's Yucca Mountain repository design would comply with safety and environmental standards. However, construction authorization was withheld until all land and water rights requirements were met. The supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was completed in May 2016, using remaining licensing funds. NRC Chairman Stephen Burns testified in 2015 that an additional $330 million was needed to complete the licensing process. The NRC Chairman testified in 2015 that $330 million was needed for licensing activities for Yucca Mountain. The Trump Administration requested $47.7 million for NRC licensing and $120 million for DOE to defend its license application. The Obama Administration proposed a separate underground repository for defense waste, reversing a decision made in 1985. The DOE proposed a defense-only nuclear waste repository outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework, potentially easier to site and license due to the smaller volume and radioactivity of defense waste. This repository would still need to be licensed by the NRC and comply with NWPA requirements. The DOE's draft plan for a defense-only nuclear waste repository would require licensing by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and compliance with NWPA requirements. However, the Government Accountability Office criticized the plan for excluding major costs and having an overly optimistic schedule. Legislation introduced in 2017 would block the development of such a repository. Legislation introduced in 2017 and 2018 aims to block the development of a defense-only nuclear waste repository and prioritize the development of consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. The DOE would need the governor's consent to select a site for a pilot storage facility. The DOE would need consent from the governor, localities, and Indian tribes to select a site for a pilot storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. Congress would require reports on compensation for host jurisdictions and a mechanism to ensure timely transfer to a permanent repository. Consent-based siting provisions have been included in previous funding bills but not enacted into law. The House has not included such provisions in its Energy and Water bills. The House has not included consent-based siting provisions in its Energy and Water bills. However, a nuclear waste bill (H.R. 3053) passed by the House on May 10, 2018, includes provisions for a monitored retrievable storage facility. In the 114th Congress, bipartisan legislation (S. 854) was introduced to implement major recommendations for nuclear waste storage but was not enacted. Senator Lamar Alexander introduced S. 854 in March 2015 to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for nuclear waste storage. Holtec International filed an NRC license application in March 2017 for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico. The facility, to be developed in 20 phases over 20 years, will hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel with a total capacity of 120,000 metric tons. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) operates two low-level radioactive waste storage facilities near Andrews, TX. WCS proposed a spent fuel storage facility where DOE would take title to spent fuel, ship it to Texas, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years. Legislation passed by the House in 2018 included provisions authorizing DOE to enter contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. Legislation (H.R. 3053) passed by the House in 2018 authorized DOE to enter contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. The Trump Administration sought funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2018 and is again seeking funding for FY2019. The Trump Administration is seeking funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2019, with DOE receiving $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository. NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's application, and DOE would also get $10 million for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. Total funding for nuclear waste in FY2019 would be $120 million, sourced from two appropriations accounts. The FY2019 budget for Yucca Mountain includes $190 million for Nuclear Waste Disposal and $30 million for Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. The Senate version of the bill did not include funding for Yucca Mountain, continuing a trend of funding uncertainty. DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014 due to a court ruling, leading to uncertainty about the future of the nuclear waste program. The court ordered the Department of Energy (DOE) to stop collecting fees for nuclear waste disposal, totaling about $750 million per year. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans were too vague to estimate costs accurately, with an uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the nuclear waste fee. The NRC approved a final rule in 2014 on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule. The court ruled that NRC should have conducted an environmental review before issuing waste confidence findings in 2010. The court ruled that NRC should have conducted an environmental review before issuing waste confidence findings in December 2010. NRC halted licensing of new facilities generating radioactive waste after the rule was struck down. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected a lawsuit against NRC's continued storage rule in June 2016. NRC proposed a modification of its low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015. The NRC proposed significant modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015. The regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to ensure public protection. The commission issued further revisions on September 8, 2017, which must be incorporated before the final rule can be published. Nuclear waste disposal remains a significant challenge for the industry. The controversy surrounding nuclear power is mainly due to the lack of a disposal system for highly radioactive waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act focuses on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository site, but Nevada opposes it citing safety concerns like volcanic activity and earthquakes. The DOE determined Yucca Mountain suitable for a repository under the Bush Administration, but the Obama Administration decided not to open it due to Nevada's opposition. Funding for the NRC licensing process was halted, and the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management was closed. President Trump's administration reversed the decision to halt funding for the Yucca Mountain project, requesting $120 million in his FY2019 budget submission for licensing and interim waste storage. The Department of Energy (DOE) would receive $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository, while the NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider the application. Additionally, $10 million would be allocated for interim waste storage development. DOE would receive $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository, and NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's application. DOE would also receive $10 million to develop interim nuclear waste storage facilities. Under the Obama Administration, DOE had filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010, \"with prejudice,\" meaning the application could not be resubmitted to NRC in the future. Opposition came from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste expected to go to Yucca Mountain. State utility regulators also filed a motion to intervene on March 15, 2010, contending that \"dismissal of the Yucca Mountain application will significantly undermine the government's ability to fulfill its outstanding obligation to take possession and dispose of the nuclear waste. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion in June 2010, ruling that the NWPA prohibits DOE from withdrawing the license application until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. NRC commissioners sustained the ASLB decision in September 2011, but halted further consideration due to budget constraints. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the withdrawal, with the U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in August 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding is available. The court ruled in August 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding is available. NRC directed staff to complete the safety evaluation report, concluding in 2014 that the repository design met safety standards for 1 million years. The final volumes of the report were issued in January 2015. Staff recommended not authorizing construction until all requirements were met. The NRC completed a supplemental EIS for the Yucca Mountain project in May 2016, making licensing documents publicly available. Additional funding of $330 million was needed for the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues raised by Nevada and others. The Obama Administration halted the project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. The BRC recommended a new organization for waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) recommended the establishment of a new organization for nuclear waste disposal, using a consent-based process to select waste facility sites. In response, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued a strategy in 2013 calling for the development of consent-based storage and disposal sites. This included plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021. The DOE strategy aims to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites, with plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale storage facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility is set to open by 2048, with public input sought on the siting process and a draft consent-based siting process issued in 2017. The DOE issued a draft consent-based siting process in 2017, with five phases: initiation and community outreach, preliminary site assessment, detailed site assessment, agreement for storage or disposal facilities. Phase 4 involves communities deciding on hosting storage or disposal facilities, with an agreement taking 1-2 years for interim storage and 2-5 years for a repository. Phase 5 includes licensing, construction, operation, and closure, with estimated timelines of up to 5 years for an interim storage facility and 15 years for a repository. The Trump Administration's proposal aims to restart the Yucca Mountain project in FY2019, providing funding for various aspects of the program. The Administration's request for $10 million for interim storage includes planning for storage services, transportation, and waste shipments. The nuclear power industry supports completing NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and pursuing alternative storage facilities. The industry policy statement suggests opening Yucca Mountain or an alternative repository within 20 years of a consolidated storage site. Geologic disposal safety depends on rock formation characteristics. The geologic disposal of high-level waste (HLW) in the United States depends on rock formations to isolate radioactive materials until they decay. Despite worldwide consensus on geologic isolation as the safest option, specific sites like Yucca Mountain face challenges due to flaws like water intrusion or earthquake vulnerability. The geologic disposal of high-level waste in the United States faces challenges such as water intrusion and earthquake vulnerability. President Obama's budgets included research on technologies to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity. The Bush Administration proposed reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recycle long-lived elements like plutonium. The Obama Administration focused on research to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity, while the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget reduced funding for nuclear spent fuel reprocessing. President Bush proposed reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recycle long-lived elements like plutonium. The Yucca Mountain site was recommended by President Bush but faced a state veto from Nevada Governor Guinn. The state veto, or notice of disapproval, was issued on April 8, 2002, under NWPA. It would have halted further development at Yucca Mountain if Congress did not pass a resolution approving the site within 90 days. President Bush signed the approval resolution on July 23, 2002. Low-level civilian radioactive waste from nuclear power plants, medical institutions, and research activities is currently disposed of in trenches in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington. The Washington facility only accepts waste from its region, and the South Carolina site is limited to members of the Atlantic disposal compact. The South Carolina site is limited to members of the Atlantic disposal compact, while a Utah facility accepts class A low-level radioactive waste from across the US. Threats to close disposal facilities led to the authorization of regional compacts in 1985. The first new disposal site under the regional compact system opened in Texas in 2011. The Texas Legislature approved legislation to allow states outside the Texas Compact to use up to 30% of the facility's capacity. NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter into contracts for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and highly radioactive waste. Section 302 of the NWPA authorized DOE to enter contracts with U.S. generators of spent nuclear fuel and highly radioactive waste for disposal in exchange for a fee on nuclear power generation. Reactors were required to have a disposal contract with DOE to operate, with a deadline for waste disposal set for January 31, 1998. DOE missed the deadline, leading to lawsuits from nuclear utilities for additional storage costs. The first settlement was reached with PECO Energy Company in 2000, allowing them to keep up to $80 million in waste fee revenues over 10 years. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled on September 24, 2002, that nuclear waste fees can only be used for the DOE waste program, not as compensation for missing disposal deadlines. Subsequent compensation to utilities came from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund, totaling about $6.9 billion through FY2017. The U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund paid $6.9 billion to utilities for nuclear waste delays by FY2017. Settlements and court judgments covered past and future damages, with utilities submitting reimbursement claims to DOE annually. Utilities not settled with the DOJ sought compensation through the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for incurred damages. The settlements for DOE's nuclear waste delays cover all damages, including future ones. Utilities must continue filing claims for additional delay-related costs. DOE's potential liabilities for delays could reach $34.1 billion. Delays may lead to environmental enforcement actions over DOE's waste storage noncompliance. The DOE faced legal challenges over collecting nuclear waste fees after halting the Yucca Mountain project. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute filed petitions to end the $750 million annual fee collection. The DOE faced legal challenges over collecting nuclear waste fees totaling about $750 million per year. Energy Secretary Steven Chu determined that the fees must continue to cover future disposal costs. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a more thorough study of the fee within six months. The U.S. Court of Appeals deemed the DOE's evaluation of nuclear waste fees as inadequate and ordered a more comprehensive study within six months. The Secretary was instructed to consider alternative costs and timing, leading to varying scenarios with potential surpluses or deficits of trillions of dollars. As a result, the DOE concluded that there was no clear evidence to immediately adjust the fee. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees due to uncertainties in cost estimates for the Yucca Mountain program. DOE's $7 trillion uncertainty range was deemed too vague for fee calculations, leading to the suspension of fee collection from nuclear power generators. The Trump Administration plans to conduct a new fee adequacy assessment based on previous cost estimates until new information is available. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application with prejudice, stating that it is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal. This decision was based on policy changes and opposition from Nevada, rather than scientific findings. The DOE sought to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application due to opposition from Nevada and a desire for a waste solution with greater public acceptance. However, the ASLB denied the withdrawal motion, citing NWPA regulations that require NRC to determine the repository's acceptability before withdrawal. DOE appealed the decision, arguing that the Secretary of Energy has broad authority under the Atomic Energy Act. The DOE appealed the ASLB decision to the NRC commissioners, arguing that the Secretary of Energy has authority to make policy decisions regarding nuclear waste disposal. The NRC commissioners sustained the denial of the license withdrawal on a tie vote, halting further consideration due to budgetary limitations. Plaintiffs, including Nye County, petitioned the court to order NRC to continue the licensing process. The Court of Appeals ruled that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding was available, with $11.1 million in previously appropriated funds. Additional funding of about $330 million would be needed for NRC to complete the licensing review, along with DOE's estimated costs of $1.9 billion as the license applicant. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license for Yucca Mountain, with DOE estimating costs of $1.9 billion. DOE's FY2018 budget includes $110 million for a Yucca Mountain program office and $30 million for NRC to restart adjudicatory proceedings. NRC must ensure safe disposal of nuclear waste before issuing licenses, as mandated by a 1979 court decision. The NRC issued a Waste Confidence Decision in 1984, stating nuclear waste could be stored safely for 30 years after plant closure. DOE planned to meet the NWPA repository deadline of 1998 but faced delays. NRC updated the decision in 1990, predicting a repository by the 21st century. After Yucca Mountain delays, a 2010 rule allowed waste storage for 60 years. Lawsuits challenged the rule for not ensuring a timely repository. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on June 8, 2012, that the NRC must conduct an environmental review of the Waste Confidence Decision under NEPA. The court found flaws in NRC's rulemaking process regarding the environmental risks of long-term waste storage at reactor sites. The NRC failed to properly examine future dangers and consequences in allowing spent fuel storage on site for sixty years after a plant's license expires. Final licensing of new facilities producing nuclear waste was delayed for over two years due to a court ruling. The NRC approved a new rule in 2014 for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, focusing on environmental effects based on a generic environmental impact statement. The Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) analyzed the environmental effects of three potential time periods of storage for spent nuclear fuel. The GEIS assumed active management of the fuel with replacement every 100 years. The environmental impact was deemed minimal for all time frames. A consolidated lawsuit challenging the NRC's continued storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2016. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected a consolidated lawsuit challenging the NRC's continued storage rule. The Obama Administration's termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository sparked congressional controversy. President Trump's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process has shifted the nuclear waste debate in Congress. Despite this, the 115th Congress has not allocated new funding for Yucca Mountain. The House approved $100 million for Yucca Mountain in FY2019, but the Senate did not provide any funds. Concerns about nuclear waste were raised during Rick Perry's confirmation hearing for Secretary of Energy. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada expressed opposition to Yucca Mountain after voting to confirm Perry. Governor Perry understands the importance of the Yucca Mountain issue and is someone Senator Catherine Cortez Masto can work with to prevent the repository from being used. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 would withdraw the site from public lands laws and increase its capacity. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 would increase the capacity limit on the Yucca Mountain repository and address funding issues related to waste management. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 aims to use nuclear waste fee collections to fund the nuclear waste program. It allows for the use of Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel before disposal in a permanent repository. The bill specifies that the Department of Energy (DOE) would take ownership of the spent fuel when accepted at an MRS facility. DOE is authorized to site, construct, and operate MRS facilities, or store spent fuel at facilities developed by nonfederal entities with an MRS agreement. DOE cannot enter into an MRS agreement with a nonfederal entity without NRC licensing approval. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 allows for the use of Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. DOE can enter into an MRS agreement with a nonfederal entity after NRC licensing approval and state/governmental waste storage approval. Priority is given to nonfederal MRS facilities, unless a federal MRS is deemed quicker and cheaper. Spent fuel from closed reactors has priority for shipment to an MRS. Appropriations for an MRS would come from the general fund. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 allows for Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. An MRS facility can be constructed after NRC licensing approval and state/governmental waste storage approval. Priority is given to nonfederal MRS facilities, with appropriations from the general fund. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository would be located on federal land encompassing parts of DOE's Nevada Test Site and the Nellis Air Force Range. The Yucca Mountain repository, located on federal land in Nevada, would be permanently withdrawn for the development of a permanent underground repository for nuclear waste. The site would be under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Energy, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would need to issue a construction authorization within 30 days. The Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada must comply with hazardous waste requirements. A construction authorization decision must be made within 30 months. DOE can conduct infrastructure activities before the decision. The limit for nuclear fuel disposal would increase to 110,000 metric tons. Planning for a separate repository for defense-related waste is prohibited until NRC's decision. Collection of nuclear waste fees cannot resume until NRC's final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. The Department of Energy cannot resume collecting nuclear waste fees until the NRC approves or disapproves the construction authorization for the Yucca Mountain repository. Fees collected would be limited to 90% of each fiscal year's appropriations for the DOE's waste management program. Any uncollected fees may be required to be paid later. Collected fees would offset appropriations to the program, ensuring that annual appropriations do not exceed available fees. The existing balance of the Nuclear Waste Fund would remain available for appropriation. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill includes funding allocations for the Nuclear Waste Fund without offsets. The Secretary of Energy can enter into benefits agreements with Nevada and local governments, increasing annual payments to $15 million before spent fuel is received at Yucca Mountain and $400 million upon the first receipt. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill includes increased funding allocations for the Nuclear Waste Fund without offsets. The Secretary of Energy can enter into benefits agreements with Nevada and local governments, with annual payments increasing to $40 million after the first receipt of spent fuel at Yucca Mountain. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management would oversee these functions and could serve up to two five-year terms. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus, aims to require consent from State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for a repository. This legislation promotes a consent-based approach for siting nuclear waste repositories, as recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. The Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) introduced by Representative Joe Wilson aims to delay the development of a repository for defense nuclear waste until NRC issues a final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. Additionally, there are proposals in Texas and New Mexico for private-sector interim storage facilities for commercial spent nuclear fuel, with bills like H.R. 474 authorizing DOE to enter contracts with these facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017, introduced by Representative Issa, is similar to previous legislation but not enacted. It would allow DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors for storage at private facilities. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE to pay for storage without further congressional approval. Another bill, the Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017, introduced by Representative Lowey, would authorize DOE to store spent fuel at privately owned facilities, prioritizing sites with no operating reactors and large populations nearby. Legislation introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider aims to provide assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites. The bills would offer financial support, revive tax credits, and establish a task force to simplify the process for communities applying for government assistance. Additionally, the bills would require the Department of Energy to explore alternative options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste and study potential economic uses. The bill introduced by Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider aims to assist communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites by providing financial support, reviving tax credits, and simplifying the process for applying for government assistance. It also requires the Department of Energy to explore alternative options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste and study potential economic uses for secure closed reactor sites and spent nuclear fuel storage. Additionally, concerns have been raised in Congress about the risks of spent fuel storage pools in nuclear power plants, leading to proposed legislation such as the Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018. The bill H.R. 4891 proposes transferring spent fuel to dry storage facilities after seven years in storage pools. Emergency planning zones would expand to 50 miles around non-compliant reactors. NRC could use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund for grants. Similar legislation was introduced in previous Congresses. Senator Alexander introduced a bill in 2015 to redirect the nuclear waste program. The bill introduced by Senator Alexander in 2015 aimed to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) to develop nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. The NWA would have been required to open a pilot storage facility by the end of 2021 for priority waste and a storage facility for nonpriority waste by 2025, with a permanent repository by 2048. The siting of these facilities would require consent from affected state, local, and tribal governments. The bill introduced by Senator Alexander in 2015 aimed to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) to develop nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. NWA would have been authorized to issue requests for proposals or select sites for storage facilities for nonpriority waste only if funds were obligated for a permanent waste repository within the first 10 years. Financial compensation and incentives would be offered for hosting facilities, with preference given to sites including both storage facilities and a repository. Defense waste could be placed in defense-only storage and disposal facilities under S. 854, subject to appropriations. President Obama authorized DOE to pursue a defense-only repository in 2015 under S. 854. Nuclear waste fees collected after the bill's enactment would be held in a Working Capital Fund. The Nuclear Waste Administration could draw from the fund as needed, with the disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 in 2013, receiving positive feedback from Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz and NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd. The bill S. 1240 received positive feedback from NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd, who called it a step in the right direction but urged continued licensing action on the Yucca Mountain repository. However, Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney Geoffrey H. Fettus opposed the bill, citing concerns about temporary waste storage facilities opening without progress on a permanent repository and states having inadequate authority to regulate repository safety. S. 854 would require actions on a permanent repository before a storage facility for nonpriority waste could be sited. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for DOE to develop a pilot spent fuel interim storage facility in the FY2017 Energy and Water bill. Similar language was included in previous energy and water bills, with a focus on consent-based waste storage pilot facilities. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. A bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 (S. 944) would require the NRC to maintain safety and security requirements at closed facilities. The NRC released a study in 2013 on the expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage, concluding that the safety benefits would be minor and the costs not warranted. Radioactive waste varies in characteristics, with some types decaying quickly and others remaining dangerous for thousands of years. Major types of radioactive waste include spent nuclear fuel, which is the most radioactive type of civilian nuclear waste containing short-lived fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. Another type is high-level waste, which is highly radioactive residue that remains dangerous for thousands of years. High-level waste is highly radioactive residue created by spent fuel reprocessing, containing radioactive fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. Transuranic waste is low-activity waste with long-lived elements heavier than uranium, primarily plutonium, requiring radiation shielding. In the United States, transuranic waste is generated mainly by nuclear weapons production processes, necessitating long-term isolation. Transuranic waste in the United States is primarily from nuclear weapons production, requiring long-term isolation due to plutonium. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for TRU waste, which resumed underground waste emplacement in 2017 after a radioactive release. Low-level waste, not classified as high-level or TRU waste, is also disposed of at WIPP, with four classes established by the NRC based on radioactivity levels. Low-level waste disposal facilities have concentration limits set by the NRC. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues from uranium ore processing with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose hazards. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material, regulated by DOE or NRC. When spent nuclear fuel is removed from a reactor, it is thermally hot and highly radioactive, in the form of fuel assemblies containing metal-clad fuel rods. The fuel rods initially contain enriched uranium, but after fission in the reactor, most of the uranium nuclei have split into highly radioactive fission products. Most U-235 nuclei in fuel rods have split into radioactive fission products, while some U-238 nuclei have decayed into plutonium. Spent fuel assemblies are stored in water pools near reactors to prevent overheating and protect workers from radiation. Older fuel is sealed in dry canisters and transferred to storage facilities after cooling for 7-10 years. Currently, spent fuel from U.S. nuclear reactors is stored at various sites, including operating plants, shutdown plants, and the Idaho National Laboratory. The U.S. commercial nuclear reactors store spent fuel at 59 operating plant sites, 15 shutdown plant sites, and the Idaho National Laboratory. An average of 20-30 metric tons of spent fuel is discharged annually per large reactor, totaling about 2,200 metric tons for the entire U.S. nuclear power industry each year. A recent report estimates that 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel were stored at U.S. nuclear plants in 2017, with 30,000 metric tons in dry casks. This exceeds the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain, not including 7,000 metric tons of DOE waste. The amount of stored fuel will continue to grow until an interim storage facility or permanent repository is established. The amount of spent fuel stored at nuclear plant sites will continue to grow until a permanent repository is opened or alternative disposal technology is developed. DOE estimates that 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel may eventually require disposal. New storage capacity will be needed if waste cannot be accepted into the disposal system. Concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel were heightened after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, raised concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel. Reports by NRC and NAS highlighted the risk of overheating spent fuel leading to fires and release of radioactivity. Recommendations include interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage. The nuclear industry suggests interspersing hotter and cooler spent fuel assemblies in pools, installing spray systems, and transferring more fuel to dry cask storage. NRC's 2013 report found minor safety benefits in expedited transfers to dry casks. Lessons from Fukushima led to recommendations for improved safety measures in spent fuel pools, including assured power sources and water spray systems. NRC mandated improved water-level monitoring equipment for U.S. reactors in 2012. NRC mandated improved water-level monitoring equipment for U.S. reactors in 2012 for spent fuel pools. About 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to commercial disposal sites in 2017. The volume and radioactivity of low-level waste can vary widely based on nuclear decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. Low-level radioactive waste is categorized into Class A, B, and C for handling and disposal. The handling and disposal of low-level radioactive waste is divided into three categories: Class A, B, and C. Most of the radioactivity is found in Class B and C waste, which has been stored on-site since June 2008 due to the lack of a permanent disposal site. The disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste is a federal responsibility, while states can develop disposal facilities for commercial low-level waste. The Yucca Mountain repository was halted by the Obama Administration after FY2010, but the Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the Yucca Mountain program in FY2019 with funding requests for nuclear waste storage. Under the Obama Administration, an alternative waste management strategy was proposed in 2013, requiring new legislation. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) to manage the program funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The fee for the program can be adjusted by the Secretary of Energy based on projected costs. The act was modified in 1987 to designate Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a high-level waste repository. The 1987 amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act designated Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a permanent high-level waste repository. If Yucca Mountain cannot be licensed, DOE must return to Congress for further instructions. The law also authorized the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility (MRS) to store spent fuel, but DOE cannot select an MRS site until recommending the construction of a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain project and terminated OCRWM in FY2010. The Obama Administration terminated OCRWM at the end of FY2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop a new waste management strategy. The commission recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, stating that the existing policy with Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site has broken down. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing extensive negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. The commission expressed confidence in the success of this process, citing the example of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing a congressionally chartered federal corporation for a new waste management program, independent from Administration control. They called for prompt efforts to develop a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim storage facilities. The Nuclear Waste Fund should be modified to allow funds for the program without competition with other priorities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended creating a federal corporation for a new waste management program, including a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim storage facilities. The DOE issued a strategy for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, with plans for a pilot interim storage facility by 2021 and a larger facility by 2025. The DOE strategy aims to establish an interim storage facility by 2025 with a capacity of 20,000 metric tons or more, linked to the development of a permanent repository. However, current NWPA restrictions make it impossible to build the MRS. The strategy recommends not overly restricting progress on storage facilities while aiming for a geologic disposal facility to open by 2048, with a site to be selected by 2016. The Yucca Mountain repository's opening date was delayed, with site selection planned by 2016 and completion of studies by 2042. A \"consent based\" process for selecting storage sites was recommended, but details were lacking in the DOE strategy. The Obama Administration proposed waste program included a new nuclear waste management entity, but the organization's nature was unspecified. A bill introduced in the 114th Congress by Senator Alexander would have modified the waste program in line with the Obama Administration's strategy. Other proposals suggested privatizing waste management services. A report from DOE recommended testing a consent-based approach by developing a separate repository solely for defense and research waste, which would not be subject to the Yucca Mountain siting requirement. The Obama Administration proposed a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste generated by nuclear defense activities, in contrast to the long-standing federal policy of a single repository for both civilian and defense waste. The Department of Energy's 2014 report recommended a separate repository for defense and research waste, which could be developed more quickly than a repository for all highly radioactive waste. President Obama authorized planning for the defense-only repository in 2015, but the Government Accountability Office criticized the analysis in 2017, leading to bills being introduced to delay the plan. President Obama blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015, leading to the establishment of the Basin and Range National Monument. Waste Control Specialists applied for an NRC license to develop a storage facility in Texas, citing high licensing costs. WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility in 2018. WCS formed a joint venture with Orano USA and submitted a renewed application for a spent fuel storage facility in Texas. The proposed facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with a total capacity of 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel. DOE would take title to the spent fuel, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. WCS contends that costs would be covered through appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund. An NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was filed by Holtec International near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Local officials have long supported additional waste facilities at the site. The state of New Mexico has shown interest in accepting high-level waste and spent fuel at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant site, with conditions such as assistance with cleaning up contaminated uranium production sites. Governor Susana Martinez supported these efforts in a letter to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, but state senators opposed an interim storage facility without a plan for permanent disposal. Public support for expanded waste activities may be affected by a 2014 radioactive release from WIPP. Other groups in Mississippi and Texas have also expressed interest in hosting nuclear waste sites. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been expressed by groups in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. A bill (H.R. 474) was introduced to authorize the Department of Energy (DOE) to enter into contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The bill, similar to previous legislation, would allow DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to private storage facilities. The bill's 33 cosponsors, as of August 31, 2018, included 14 from Texas. The Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE for private interim storage without further congressional appropriation. A bill with 33 cosponsors, including 14 from Texas, includes provisions for a private-sector MRS facility. Previous efforts for private spent fuel storage were made after DOE missed the 1998 deadline. A consortium signed an agreement with the Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Indians in Utah to develop a storage facility. NRC issued a 20-year license for storing spent fuel in dry casks in 2006. The NRC issued a 20-year license for storing spent fuel in dry casks in 2006. However, the Department of the Interior issued decisions against the PFS project in 2006, citing risks of waste remaining indefinitely on tribal trust lands and environmental concerns with transportation routes. A federal lawsuit was filed in 2007 to challenge the Interior decisions. The Department of the Interior decisions on the PFS permits were challenged in court in 2007, leading to a reconsideration order in 2010. Despite efforts by the Obama Administration to change the nuclear waste program, current law still focuses on Yucca Mountain for civilian waste storage. NWPA mandates NRC licensing of high-level waste repositories, with EPA setting standards. DOE must follow NRC-approved siting guidelines for waste transportation. Transportation of waste to storage and disposal sites is regulated by NRC and DOT. Shipments to Yucca Mountain and an MRS facility must use NRC-certified casks and comply with NRC requirements. NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain require compliance with EPA's standards and establish procedures for seeking a repository license. DOE must receive construction authorization before being issued a license to bring nuclear waste to the site. Substantive regulatory requirements include a mandatory performance confirmation program to ensure systems are functioning as intended. The NRC requires a mandatory performance confirmation program for DOE's repository at Yucca Mountain to ensure systems are functioning as intended. Specific standards for Yucca Mountain were needed due to concerns about meeting EPA's general standards. The standards limit radiation dose to the public and are based on a study by the National Academy of Sciences. The EPA proposed Yucca Mountain radiation protection standards in 1999, focusing on risks to individuals near the repository. The proposal aimed to limit annual radiation doses for the maximally exposed individual and from groundwater exposure for the first 10,000 years of operation. The nuclear industry criticized the proposal as overly stringent, particularly the groundwater standard. The EPA issued final Yucca Mountain standards on June 6, 2001, including a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. Despite opposition from the DOE, the site was deemed able to meet the standards. The NRC revised its regulations to align with the EPA standards in September 2001. The NRC revised its regulations in 2001 to align with EPA standards for Yucca Mountain. A court ruling in 2004 struck down the 10,000-year compliance period, leading to EPA proposing new standards in 2005 with higher dose limits beyond 10,000 years. The EPA proposed new standards for Yucca Mountain in 2005, with higher dose limits beyond 10,000 years. Nevada officials criticized the proposed standard as too lenient. The final rule, issued in 2008, reduced the annual dose limit from 350 to 100 millirems for the period of 10,000 through 1 million years. Compliance with the post-10,000-year standard will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. The NRC revised its repository licensing regulations to conform to new EPA standards in 2009, with the 4 millirem groundwater standard applying only to the first 10,000 years. DOE estimated a maximum mean annual individual dose of 2 millirems after 10,000 years, significantly lower than previous estimates of 150 millirems after 400,000 years. This reduction was attributed to changes in DOE's computer model and assumptions. The DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. The Trump Administration's budget proposals have shifted funding away from the Obama Administration's integrated waste strategy. The FY2018 budget included funding for nuclear waste R&D, while the FY2019 request focuses on waste disposal R&D with no funding for integrated waste management. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes $10 million for waste disposal R&D and zero for integrated waste management. The Fuel Cycle R&D program focuses on technology for recycling spent fuel to convert long-lived radionuclides. Nuclear utilities had paid fees to cover disposal costs until halted in 2014. The Waste Fund balance was $37.2 billion at the end of FY2017. $7.41 billion had been disbursed from the Waste Fund before the Yucca Mountain project was halted in FY2010. The Yucca Mountain project was halted by the Obama Administration after FY2010. $7.41 billion had been disbursed from the Waste Fund. The estimated cost of the Yucca Mountain program was $96.2 billion in 2007 dollars. States are authorized to select disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste under the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. Most states have joined interstate compacts for low-level waste disposal. Under the 1985 amendments, commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their regional compacts after 1992. Sites in Beatty, NV, and Utah have restrictions on waste acceptance. A new disposal facility in Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 to alleviate storage issues for Class A, B, and C low-level waste. The low-level waste disposal facility in Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 to address storage issues for Class A, B, and C waste. It can accept waste from other states, with legislation signed by President Clinton in 1998. Governor Rick Perry authorized the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to license disposal facilities for low-level waste in 2003. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) was authorized in 2003 to license disposal facilities for low-level waste. Waste Control Specialists LLC filed an application to build the Andrews County disposal facility in 2004. TCEQ approved the license in 2009 and construction began in 2011. The Barnwell facility in South Carolina accepts low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact, which includes Connecticut, New Jersey, and South Carolina. Noncompact waste acceptance at the Barnwell facility ended in 2008. The Barnwell facility in South Carolina stopped accepting noncompact waste in 2008. South Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1995 and began accepting waste from all states except North Carolina. North Carolina also withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1999. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina was not subject to sanctions for its withdrawal. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina's withdrawal from the compact did not lead to sanctions. Hanford, WA is the only other facility for low-level waste disposal. Licensing for such facilities is done by NRC or agreement states under the Atomic Energy Act. NRC proposed changes to low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015. Transport of low-level waste is regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. The NRC proposed significant modifications to low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015, with final regulations submitted for commission approval in 2016. Further revisions were issued in 2017, including establishing time periods for technical analyses of waste sites to ensure population protection for up to 10,000 years. The NRC proposed modifications to low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015, with final regulations submitted in 2016. A new technical analysis may be required to protect intruders at low-level waste sites. Disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate, with spent fuel stored on-site indefinitely. Concerns about spent fuel storage safety have increased since the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in 2011. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy focuses on the Yucca Mountain site, despite President Obama's actions to terminate the project. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is centered on the Yucca Mountain site. President Obama's actions to end the Yucca Mountain project and establish a new waste strategy through the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future halted DOE waste program activities. Congress is debating the project's future, especially through the appropriations process. The NRC staff's finding in October 2014 that the Yucca Mountain site would meet NRC standards after closure has been used as evidence of the project's viability. The Trump Administration's plan to restart Yucca Mountain licensing and the retirement of Senator Reid, a strong opponent of the project, could impact legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. The Trump Administration requested $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage. The Trump Administration requested $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage to fulfill federal obligations, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. The funding was not approved for FY2018, but the request has been repeated for FY2019. Owners of existing reactors may seek damages from the federal government due to disposal delays, with potential liabilities estimated at $34.1 billion. The Department of Energy (DOE) may need to pay up to $600 million from the federal judgment fund for waste program delays, with potential liabilities totaling $34.1 billion. The nuclear industry warns of future damages in the tens of billions if the disposal program fails. Lack of a disposal system could impact licensing of new nuclear plants and defense waste disposal deadlines. The Blue Ribbon Commission suggested options like centralized interim storage and reprocessing in its 2012 report. The Blue Ribbon Commission's final report in January 2012 suggested options for nuclear waste storage, including centralized interim storage and reprocessing. A congressionally chartered corporation was recommended for siting new waste facilities. The \"consent based\" siting process has attracted interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. Delays in the nuclear waste program make longer on-site storage likely under any option. The \"consent based\" siting process for nuclear waste storage has attracted interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. Cooperation from states is crucial for its success. Previous voluntary siting efforts faced challenges from potential host state governments.
