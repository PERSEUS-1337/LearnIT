    "content": "Many observers criticized the United Nations for leaving Timor-Leste prematurely in 2005, leading to political violence in 2006. President Jose Ramos-Horta requested the UN to stay for five more years in May 2008 due to ongoing security concerns. In 2008-2009, civilians displaced in 2006 returned home. A failed assassination attempt on President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao in 2008 by a group led by former Major Alfredo Reinado, who was killed. Reinado's group surrendered in April 2008 after he was killed. The security situation in Timor-Leste has improved, but concerns remain about implementing security reforms after a mutiny by security forces in 2006. A joint Indonesian-East Timorese Truth Commission blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999, leading to President Yudhoyono expressing regret. President Ramos-Horta urged moving on from the past after the report was released. President Ramos-Horta expressed \"deep regret\" over human rights violations in Timor-Leste and urged the country to move on from the past. Concerns were raised about government plans to withdraw funds from Timor's Petroleum Fund in 2009. China's involvement in Timor-Leste increased, providing assistance with construction projects and offering to sell power plants and patrol boats. The government of East Timor implemented the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007 to address various areas including housing, community trust-building, security, social protection, and local socio-economic development. The government of East Timor created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007, covering areas like housing, community trust-building, security, social protection, and local socio-economic development. The approach to IDPs' return, resettlement, and reintegration is part of this framework. By June 2009, the last IDP camps were being closed, and support was needed to complete the decommissioning. East Timor's history includes Portuguese colonial control until 1975, followed by Indonesian invasion and occupation. East Timor declared independence in 1975 after a brief civil war. Indonesia invaded and occupied the country, leading to the deaths of thousands. A referendum in 1999 resulted in 78% of voters choosing independence, sparking violence and displacement. In 1999, 1,300 East Timorese were killed, with over 260,000 displaced in West Timor and 200,000 in East Timor. The militias destroyed much of East Timor's infrastructure. A U.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission, INTERFET, led by Australia, was deployed to restore order. Australia has played a significant role in U.N. operations and bilateral relations with East Timor since then. Jose Ramos-Horta, the president of Timor-Leste, was a key figure in advocating for the country's independence. Former President Jose Ramos-Horta of Timor-Leste served a five-year term and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 for his work promoting the country's cause. He became president in 2006 after Mari Alkatiri's resignation and survived an assassination attempt in 2008. Xanana Gusmao, the current Prime Minister, was a resistance leader against Indonesian occupation and was imprisoned before being released. Xanana Gusmao, a former resistance leader in Timor-Leste, became the country's first president in 2002. He later stepped down to become prime minister in 2007 after surviving an assassination attempt in 2008. Mari Alkatiri, the former prime minister, resigned in 2006 amidst unrest but remains Secretary General of Fretilin with significant support. Alkatiri, a Muslim minority in Timor-Leste, is the Secretary General of Fretilin with considerable support. His relationship with Gusmao is described as hostile due to opposing views on using petroleum reserves for budget deficits. The current unicameral national parliament of 65 members was elected in 2007, growing from an 88-member Constituent Assembly that drafted the constitution in 2002 after East Timor's independence from UN administration in 2002. East Timor became independent in 2002, with a new constitution establishing a parliamentary government. Xanana Gusmao led a coalition government from 2007, consisting of four parties. The main opposition party is Frente Revolucionario do Timor-Leste. The parliament in East Timor faces challenges with inexperienced members, limited education, and language barriers. Committees attempt oversight but lack staff and resources. In 2007, presidential elections saw Ramos-Horta elected with 69% of the vote, while parliamentary elections led to Xanana Gusmao becoming president. In 2007, former Prime Minister Ramos-Horta was elected as president with 69% of the vote. Xanana Gusmao became prime minister after parliamentary elections, leading the largest coalition of parties. Prior to the 2007 elections, East Timor held elections in 2001 and 2002, with high voter turnout. Events in 2006 caused internal turmoil in East Timor. In 2007, former Prime Minister Ramos-Horta won the presidential election with 69% of the vote. Xanana Gusmao became prime minister after parliamentary elections. Events in 2006 led to the deterioration of East Timor's internal security, prompting the deployment of foreign peacekeepers. The Australian military contingent was the largest, with UNMIT established to support stability and democratic governance. The East Timorese government is focused on consolidating stability, enhancing democratic governance, and promoting national reconciliation. Divisions within the Fretilin party, dating back to their struggle against the Indonesians, led to the 2006 strife. These divisions are evident in splits within the military and police forces, with many military recruits being loyal to Xanana Gusmao. This loyalty contributed to the creation of paramilitary units within the police force. The recruitment process in East Timor led to tensions between the military and police, with loyalists of Xanana Gusmao in the military and former Indonesian police officers hired into the new police force. Political turmoil in 2006 was triggered by Prime Minister Alkatiri's dismissal of 591 military members, leading to protests over conditions and discrimination. The dismissal of 591 military members by former Prime Minister Alkatiri in March 2006 led to protests over conditions and discrimination. This resulted in rioting, looting, and the fleeing of thousands of eastern East Timorese from the capital. Alkatiri stepped down in June amid accusations of forming \"hit squads,\" which he denied. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri stepped down in June amid accusations of forming \"hit squads,\" which he denied. A U.N. investigation found him to have failed to denounce the transfer of security sector weapons to civilians. Former Interior Minister Rogerio Lobato was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for authorizing the transfer of weapons to supporters and a hit squad. Major Alfredo Reinado, a leader of violent protests in March 2006, escaped from prison in August 2006. Australian forces failed to capture Reinado on March 11, 2007. Reinado and his supporters escaped from prison in August 2006. Australian forces failed to capture Reinado on March 11, 2007. The East Timor government ordered an operation to apprehend Reinado after he persuaded a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles. Reinado had attracted support among young men resentful of the foreign military presence in East Timor. Unemployment and underemployment is estimated to be as high as 70% in East Timor, contributing to escalating violence. The escalating violence in East Timor is fueled by gangs of unemployed youth, with up to 70% unemployment in the country. Gang violence following the 2006 clashes led to deaths, displacement of residents, and property destruction. The instability since April 2006 has displaced around 100,000 people, with many unable to return home due to damage. The escalating violence in East Timor has led to the displacement of around 100,000 people, with 30,000 as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in camps in Dili and 70,000 with host families in the districts. The IDPs faced challenges such as lack of access to clean water, poor sanitation leading to disease risks, and potential flooding in the camps. The overall context in East Timor includes high poverty rates, child mortality due to lack of sanitation and malnutrition, rice shortages, and increasing food prices, impacting social structures and services at the community level. The deteriorating social structures and services in East Timor have impacted the ability to provide healthcare, education, and respond to natural disasters. The transition from humanitarian programs to development activities is challenging due to extreme poverty levels. Funding has increased during times of insecurity, with the UN providing emergency assistance and generating a Flash Appeal in 2006. In 2006, the United Nations Office of the Coordinator of Humanitarian Assistance (UNOCHA) generated a Flash Appeal, raising nearly $40 million. Security incidents in February and March 2007 led to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement, affecting access and safety for displaced individuals and aid organizations. Concerns about displacement prompted contingency planning by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and Ministry of Labour and Community Reinsertion (MTRC). The international humanitarian aid community, including the UN, international organizations, NGOs, and donors, provided assistance alongside the U.N. peacekeeping operation. In April 2008, IDPs willing to return received recovery packages and the government began decommissioning some IDP camps. The Ministry of Social Solidarity oversaw the returns process with assistance from international organizations like the International Organization for Migration. By November 2008, roughly 10,400 families had returned and 21 camps had closed, while transitional shelter sites were constructed. In 2008, around 10,400 families received recovery packages and returned, with approximately 21 camps closed. Transitional shelter sites were built to house some displaced individuals. Limited access to food, water, and basic services remains a challenge for returning IDPs. Food security deteriorated due to high food prices, shortages, lack of arable land, and natural disasters. Land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence hinder the reintegration of IDPs into their communities. Despite these challenges, recent IDP returns did not experience major violence incidents. In December 2008, the U.N. Representative on Human Rights for IDPs visited East Timor and emphasized the need for sustainable returns and durable solutions. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ended its formal mission, with a national staff member continuing to work within UNMIT. The U.N. Security Council established the U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste to assist with security, political, and humanitarian challenges. The U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste was established to assist with security, political, and humanitarian challenges, including support for the electoral process. The mission's mandate was extended multiple times by the U.N. Security Council, with temporary reinforcement of police for national elections. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate for the U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste until February 26, 2010, with Resolution 1867 (2009). Despite some improvements, challenges like reintegration of IDPs, poverty, and high unemployment persist in East Timor. The Secretary General emphasized the need for long-term commitment to achieve stability, development, and democratic governance. The Secretary General highlighted three main areas of focus for achieving stability, development, and democratic governance in Timor-Leste: political developments, restoration of public security, and support for the 'Compact'. The report emphasized the need for dialogue, reconciliation, improving democratic governance, and maintaining public security. Since 2008, Timor-Leste has focused on increasing dialogue, reconciliation, democratic governance, public security, and strengthening security institutions. Additionally, efforts have been made to promote human rights, administer justice, support socio-economic development, and provide humanitarian assistance. This includes initiatives such as poverty alleviation, achieving Millennium Development Goals, improving health indicators, and implementing the U.N. Development Assistance Framework 2009-2013. The U.N. peace operations in East Timor have evolved since 1999, with various resolutions authorizing missions and overseeing the transition period after a national referendum. The United Nations Transitional Authority for East Timor (UNTAET) was established in October 1999 to administer East Timor's transition to independence after Indonesia's parliament confirmed the results of the August referendum. UNTAET's mandate included providing humanitarian aid, reconstruction assistance, establishing a functioning government, and aiding East Timorese who fled during the violence. In September 2000, three U.N. humanitarian workers were killed by East Timorese militia groups, leading to the temporary suspension of U.N. activities in West Timor. Security Council Resolution 1410 (2002) established UNMISET as a successor to UNTAET, with subsequent extensions until May 2005. Resolution 1599 (2005) then created UNOTIL for peace-building activities until May 2006, focusing on supporting state institutions and democratic governance. UNOTIL activities from 2005 to 2006 focused on supporting state institutions, democratic governance, human rights, and the development of a national police force in Timor-Leste. Progress was made in building skills for public administration, training national judges, and developing expertise in the finance sector. Progress was made in training state institutions, democratic governance, and human rights in Timor-Leste. However, concerns were raised about weaknesses in capacity building in justice and finance sectors, with 3,000 pending cases and unresolved issues in accountability for crimes against humanity in 1999. Outside supervision and international advisory support were deemed critical for continued success. Mr. Hasegawa described the situation in Timor-Leste as \"fragile\" due to unresolved issues over accountability for crimes against humanity in 1999. Additional training was needed for the Border Patrol Force to minimize incidents. UNOTIL's mandate was extended multiple times in response to increased violence in 2006, with a focus on maintaining stability for upcoming elections. The U.N. Security Council extended the mandate for UNOTIL in Timor-Leste multiple times in 2006 to address increased violence. The U.S. provided bilateral assistance to East Timor for economic and political development, focusing on building a self-sufficient economy, basic public services, and good governance. The U.S. provided bilateral assistance to East Timor for economic and political development, focusing on supporting independent media, civil society organizations, and political parties, strengthening the electoral process, building judicial institutions, and enhancing governmental capacity. Many experts believe East Timor still requires sustained bilateral, multilateral, and regional support for re-establishing basic government functions, including security services. The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) under USAID provides non-food humanitarian aid during international crises and disasters, facilitating U.S. government emergency assistance. In East Timor, the U.S. provides humanitarian aid through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and the Food for Peace Program (FFP). OFDA funds implementing partners for tasks like humanitarian coordination, shelter, water, sanitation, and psychosocial services. As of FY2008, OFDA provided around $1.2 million in assistance. In FY2008, OFDA, FFP, and CMM collectively provided over $3.1 million in humanitarian assistance to East Timor. This support included funding for water, sanitation, psychosocial services, and peacebuilding efforts. The U.N. role in East Timor was questioned in 2005 due to fragile state institutions, a concern that was validated by events in 2006. There is a continued need to enhance security services, the judiciary, institutional transparency, and the rule of law in the country. The U.N.'s presence in East Timor has been questioned due to fragile state institutions, with a need to improve security services, judiciary, transparency, and rule of law. The U.S. has ties with East Timor through Indonesia, with concerns over past human rights abuses. The East Timorese government aims to move forward and build a productive relationship with Indonesia. The East Timorese government is ready to move forward and build a productive relationship with Indonesia, despite past human rights concerns. The United States is considering its policies towards both countries, with a proposed legislation to provide tariff relief assistance for developing economies, including Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste seeks preferential tariff treatment and aims to join ASEAN. Australia and New Zealand have been key supporters of peace and security in Timor-Leste, with troops and police providing assistance. Australia views Timor as within its sphere of influence. Australia has historical and strategic interests in Timor, providing security through the ISF and supporting the police. They have economic interests in hydrocarbon resources in the Timor Sea and recognized Indonesian control of the province through the Timor Gap Treaty. The Timor Sea Treaty between Australia and Timor-Leste in 2003 replaced the previous agreement in the area. Despite disagreements on sovereignty, both countries work together on hydrocarbon development. Timor-Leste prefers a processing facility in Timor, while Australia supports one in Darwin. Commercial interests and political security concerns favor Darwin. Woodside, ConocoPhillips, and Shell are key players in the greater Sunrise project. The key commercial participants in the greater Sunrise project are Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Osaka Gas. Timor-Leste has a historical relationship with Portugal, with Portuguese colonial influence lasting until 1975. Portugal remains a key provider of foreign assistance to Timor-Leste. Indonesia invaded Timor-Leste after Portuguese departure in 1975, leading to a guerilla movement challenging Indonesian control. After Indonesia invaded Timor-Leste in 1975 following Portuguese departure, a guerilla movement emerged to challenge Indonesian control. Hundreds of thousands of Timorese died as a result of the fighting, with additional atrocities committed in 1999 after a referendum for independence. The Indonesian military-backed militias destroyed Timor's infrastructure and killed around 1,300 Timorese. The Indonesian government has since sought better relations with Timor-Leste, but President Ramos-Horta believes those responsible for the 1999 atrocities will never be brought to trial. President Ramos-Horta of Timor-Leste urges acceptance that those responsible for the 1999 atrocities will never be tried, emphasizing the need to move forward. A truth commission revealed Indonesian army support for pro-Indonesian militias involved in rape, murder, and torture. Former Indonesian General Wiranto, linked to human rights abuses in East Timor, ran for vice president in 2009. China has been increasing investments in Timor-Leste since 2005, possibly to counter U.S. influence in Southeast Asia and potentially gain ASEAN membership. China's increasing influence in Timor-Leste is a concern for Australia due to potential geopolitical implications. China's investments in Timor include construction projects and selling patrol vessels and defense equipment. Timor-Leste supports a One-China policy, aligning with China's diplomatic stance. Timor-Leste supports a One-China policy and plans to purchase second-hand oil burning power stations from China for $381 million, which has faced criticism for being unnecessary and polluting. Fretilin opposes the proposal and is preparing a legal challenge. Timor became a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum in July 2005 and is interested in full ASEAN membership. Timor's off-shore energy resources are extensive and could be beneficial if properly managed. In 2005, Timor expressed interest in joining ASEAN. The country's offshore energy resources could provide financial stability, with revenue sharing agreements with Australia. In 2006, a treaty increased Timor's share of hydrocarbon revenues. Timor earned $360 million in hydrocarbon revenues in 2005-2006. East Timor receives revenue from hydrocarbon resources through sharing agreements with Australia. The Bayu-Udan field has 400 million barrels of oil and 3.4 trillion cubic feet of gas, while Greater Sunrise has 300 million barrels of oil and 2.53 trillion cubic feet of gas. Infrastructure in Darwin, Australia, supports this production. Industry prefers Darwin over East Timor for stability reasons. ConocoPhillips built a new LNG plant in Darwin, but Timor-Leste prefers a plant on its southern coast. The Bayu-Udan field is expected to be depleted by 2023. East Timor has received significant revenue from its oil and gas fields, with most of the funds placed in a Petroleum Fund. The government has faced criticism for spending money from the fund, which was intended to save revenues for future generations. Despite being one of the poorest countries in Asia, Timor's top export destinations include Australia, Germany, Portugal, and Brazil. The country's economy is described as dual, with a focus on servicing the international donor community and agriculture. Infrastructure in East Timor was devastated by violence in 1999, leaving the country in poverty. The violence in 1999 devastated East Timor's infrastructure, leaving the country in poverty with widespread lack of basic amenities. The mountainous terrain poses challenges for development efforts, requiring sustained focus on job creation, infrastructure reconstruction, and improved health and literacy rates. External assistance remains crucial for capacity building in governance and economic development to improve the standard of living for the East Timorese people. Language barriers may also hinder progress, as Indonesian is more widely used than the official Tetun or Portuguese. Experts predict external assistance will remain critical in the post-independence phase for capacity building in governance, as revenue from oil and gas has increased. Other economic activities include coffee, tourism, and fisheries. The UNDAF provides a roadmap for UN agencies, while economic challenges include strengthening democratic institutions, education, rule of law, and infrastructure rebuilding. East Timor is a member of the World Bank and IMF, and has shown interest in ASEAN membership. An international tribunal was recommended in 2000 to address crimes. In January 2000, an international commission recommended establishing an international tribunal for crimes after the 1999 independence referendum in East Timor. The Indonesian government conducted its own investigation, leading to dissatisfaction from the United States and allies. The Serious Crimes Unit indicted over 380 individuals, convicting 55, and acquitting three for crimes related to the referendum. Only one person was imprisoned through the Indonesian process. President Gusmao has supported a joint East Timor-Indonesia Commission of Truth and Friendship to address past atrocities from the 1999 referendum. Critics argue that Gusmao has not held Indonesia accountable for documented executions, torture, mutilations, and rape. The Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor (CAVR) released a 2,000-page report in October 2005 detailing these atrocities. If Gusmao becomes prime minister, it is unlikely that there will be a change in policy regarding how to address these crimes. The 2009 State Department Country Report on Human Rights practices in Timor-Leste highlighted serious issues including police abuse, arbitrary arrests, an inefficient judiciary, and poor conditions in camps for displaced persons. Despite government control over the National Police and Defense Forces, discipline problems persisted. The 2009 State Department Country Report on Human Rights practices in Timor-Leste noted issues with police and defense forces' discipline and accountability. Questions arose about extending the UN presence due to fragile state institutions and security concerns. East Timor requested continued UN assistance, while the US had reservations. The United States believed East Timor should reduce reliance on direct UN assistance but continue support in key sectors like democratic institutions, infrastructure, and security services. East Timor could receive aid from other international entities like UNDP, World Bank, and expert advisors without compromising sovereignty. Debate arose over the timing of the UN's departure from East Timor. The debate over the timing of the United Nations' departure from East Timor reflects questions about international support, aid effectiveness, and national capacity building. Donor fatigue and limited budgets add pressure for assistance, complicating the decision-making process."
