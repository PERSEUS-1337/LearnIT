Technological advancements have revolutionized modern irrigated agriculture, but come with costs like infrastructure and potential impacts on water users and the environment. The main measurements of irrigation water use are water withdrawals and consumption. The primary measurements of irrigation water use are water withdrawals and consumption. Irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23% since 1980, with a 9% drop nationally from 2005 to 2010. Improvements in irrigation efficiency may lead to less water returning to water sources. Since 1980, irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23%, with a 9% drop nationally from 2005 to 2010. Improved irrigation efficiency results in less water returning to water sources. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003. Eastern states like Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee have significantly increased irrigated acres. Farmers have shifted from gravity irrigation to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation, especially in 17 western states where gravity irrigation declined from 62% in 1984 to 30% in 2013. Irrigated land in the West increased by 1.7 million acres during this time period. Since 1980, irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23%, with a 9% drop nationally from 2005 to 2010. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003. Gravity irrigation has declined from 62% in 1984 to 30% in 2013, with a shift towards pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation. Groundwater withdrawals have increased by over 740,000 AF despite an overall decline in irrigation withdrawals. Irrigated acres in the West have grown by 1.7 million acres, but the growth is smaller compared to increases in the East. Since 1984, irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres, with groundwater being the primary source for irrigation. This increase is attributed to higher commodity prices, droughts, and easy access to groundwater. However, the expanded use of groundwater has led to declining aquifer levels and environmental concerns. Irrigation efficiency refers to the beneficial use of applied water without loss to evaporation or seepage. Efficiency in irrigation refers to the percentage of applied water that is beneficially used and not lost to evaporation or seepage. Factors affecting irrigation efficiency include system performance, water application uniformity, crop response, evapotranspiration rates influenced by climate conditions, and the quality of water conveyance systems. Inefficient irrigation can lead to conveyance losses of up to 50%. Efficient systems allow for the same crop production with less water usage. Efficient irrigation systems aim to reduce conveyance losses by up to 50% and maintain crop production levels while conserving water. However, some studies suggest that efficient systems may actually increase water consumption in certain cases. Research on irrigation subsidies in the Upper Rio Grande Basin showed that increasing water conservation subsidies for drip irrigation could lead to higher water consumption, crop yield, and irrigated acreage. While microirrigation is more efficient than gravity irrigation, the latter typically uses less water due to lower evapotranspiration losses. Efficient irrigation systems may not always result in less water consumed overall, as they could encourage farmers to grow more profitable, water-intensive crops. Gravity irrigation typically uses less water than microirrigation due to lower evapotranspiration losses. The majority of water not lost to evapotranspiration through gravity irrigation is returned to surface or groundwater sources through runoff and deep percolation, allowing for potential subsequent beneficial use. Precision technologies are increasingly common in modern irrigation systems, complementing traditional pressure and gravity systems. Best management practices for irrigation focus on water management, including conveyance, scheduling, and application methods. These practices, identified by USDA's NRCS, aim to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Not all irrigation technologies are considered best management practices. Pressure systems for irrigation involve pumping water through tubing or pipes to apply water to crops using sprinklers or perforated pipes. They are divided into sprinkler systems, which use high- to medium-pressure to spray water, and microirrigation systems, which use low-pressure to apply water directly. Success of these systems depends on various factors and may require multiple practices for effectiveness. For a more comprehensive list of best management practices, refer to Appendix B. Pressure irrigation systems for agriculture use high- to medium-pressure for artificial precipitation, while microirrigation systems apply water directly to crop roots. These systems make up 58-65% of irrigation methods in the US, including center pivot, drip, and trickle systems. They are more efficient than gravity systems but require high initial investment costs. Proper irrigation water management is essential to maintain soil moisture levels and reduce erosion. Proper irrigation water management is crucial for maintaining soil moisture levels and reducing erosion. The plan involves intentional preparation to manage water through irrigation systems, including various BMPs like microirrigation and sprinkler systems. Sprinkler systems, such as center pivot and linear move tower irrigation, spray water over crops for adequate soil moisture. Microirrigation, with types like surface drip and sub-surface drip, is highly efficient for delivering water directly to crop roots. Microirrigation, including surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip systems, is a more efficient method compared to sprinkler and gravity irrigation. It applies water directly to the root zone of crops, converting standard center pivot systems to low-energy precision application (LEPA) systems. LEPA systems reduce evaporation losses and energy consumption by applying water directly into circular furrows through nozzles placed close to the soil surface. Gravity systems divert water from a source to flood over a crop area via land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows. Gravity irrigation systems, including canals, ditches, basins, and furrows, are generally less efficient than pressure systems. Land leveling is crucial for ensuring uniform water application and preventing issues like erosion and water logging. Furrow irrigation systems are suitable for row crops like potato and corn, while gravity systems are better for close-growing crops like rice. Land leveling improves gravity irrigation efficiency, reduces erosion, and prevents water logging. Irrigation ditch lining limits water loss during transit to crops. Canal linings increase conveyance efficiency. Tailwater recovery reuses excess water to prevent contamination and waterlogging. Incorporating precision technologies like satellite data, sensor networks, data analytics, and drones has increased irrigation efficiency in agriculture. These technologies reduce input costs and increase crop yield significantly. Technology companies are increasingly involved in the agricultural sector, offering data services to help farmers maximize profits. A collaborative project between NASA and USDA launched the SMAP satellite to gather soil moisture data globally. This data can inform decisions on irrigation water usage for governments and agricultural producers. Unmanned aerial vehicles and sensor networks can collect data on plant water status and soil moisture for informed irrigation decisions. Data analytics and regional weather networks can be used to automate irrigation systems based on real-time information. By combining data from regional weather networks with precipitation and soil moisture data, an accurate irrigation schedule can be established. A remote monitoring system wirelessly transfers real-time information to adjust irrigation operations, reducing water usage and field visits. Poly-pipe in furrow irrigation uses computer software to optimize hole sizes, decreasing water application and runoff. Implementing irrigation BMPs can increase efficiency and reduce production costs. The implementation of irrigation BMPs can increase efficiency by improving water application precision, reducing production costs, and promoting even watering across fields. Irrigated yields are typically double that of non-irrigated crops, allowing for the growth of higher value crops and extending growing seasons. Irrigation BMPs also enhance production of specialty crops by delivering water only when needed, preventing issues from overwatering. Additionally, irrigation systems can be used for applying nutrients and pesticides. Efficient irrigation systems can also be used for applying nutrients and pesticides, reducing costs and providing precise application. Implementation choices for irrigation technologies in the United States are influenced by factors like cost, crop type, climate, soil, labor, and water quality. The adoption of efficient irrigation systems is often driven by potential economic gains from increased crop yield rather than water conservation. The adoption of efficient irrigation systems in the United States is driven by economic gains from increased crop yield rather than water conservation. High-value crop growers are more likely to invest in costly systems like drip irrigation, while low-value crop growers are less inclined due to financial constraints. The USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey found that some respondents couldn't finance system improvements, and high-efficiency systems can be more expensive than gravity systems. Agricultural producers also consider the cost of developing a water supply when selecting an irrigation system. The cost of developing a water supply is a key factor for agricultural producers in selecting an irrigation system. This cost includes drilling wells, operating pumps, or building storage facilities. The expense of groundwater supply development, influenced by pumping depth and energy costs, often leads to the adoption of high-efficiency pressure systems in areas heavily reliant on groundwater. Conversely, regions with ample surface water may opt for gravity irrigation due to lower water development costs. Drought-prone areas relying on surface water are more likely to adopt efficient irrigation systems. Growers in drought-prone areas are more likely to adopt efficient irrigation systems based on the type of crop being irrigated. For example, perennial tree crops are better suited for drip irrigation systems to prevent fruit decay. Recent survey data in the United States shows that many farmers are unable to use more efficient systems due to crop type or physical field conditions. Local climate conditions also play a role in limiting irrigation technology adoption. Local climate conditions and soil type are key factors in determining the most suitable irrigation system for crop production. Climate conditions impact evapotranspiration rates and the effectiveness of irrigation methods, such as drip, surface, and sprinkler systems. Soil composition, such as sandy or clay soils, also influences the choice of irrigation system to optimize water efficiency. Gravity irrigation is ideal for clay soils due to their low infiltration rates. Soil surveys are used for irrigation water management planning. The labor-technology trade-off between pressure and gravity systems should be considered when selecting an irrigation system. Water quality and quantity can also limit irrigation choices. Water quality and quantity are key factors in determining irrigation choices. Gravity irrigation is best for sediment-heavy water, while sprinkler or drip irrigation is more suitable for managing salinity and selenium levels. The Clean Water Act addresses water quality concerns in various bodies of water, benefiting agriculture indirectly. State water rights laws play a significant role in determining the legal water availability for farmers and irrigation districts. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers for irrigation practices through various USDA agencies and conservation programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA. Financial assistance for irrigation BMPs adoption is available through farm bill conservation programs. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers for irrigation practices through programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA. Between 2009 and 2014, $564 million out of $1.2 billion in funding went towards implementing sprinkler and microirrigation systems. States in the West, such as California and Texas, received the highest amount of funding for irrigation BMPs. Increasing irrigation efficiency may reduce groundwater recharge and aquifer depletion. High Plains, Mississippi Embayment, and Central Valley aquifers are depleting at unsustainable rates, accounting for 93% of groundwater depletion in the US from 2000 to 2008. It is unclear if irrigation BMP funding is helping to mitigate depletion. EQIP provides financial and technical assistance for irrigation BMPs, including Conservation Activity Plans and Conservation Innovation Grants. EQIP provides funding for irrigation BMPs, including Conservation Activity Plans (CAPs) and Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG). Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) also funds irrigation BMPs based on conservation performance. Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) funds similar irrigation BMPs as EQIP. The USDA provides technical and financial assistance for irrigation technologies through various programs, including Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) and Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA). AMA funds irrigation BMPs in states with low participation in the Federal Crop Insurance program, while CTA helps irrigators adopt conservation plans through a national network of locally-based assistance. Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) offers technical assistance to help irrigators adopt conservation plans. While CTA does not provide financial assistance, the plans developed can qualify for financial aid programs. CTA is available to farmers, government units, citizen groups, and professional consultants, and has funded over $5.7 billion in technical assistance between 2003 and 2013. USDA also provides information resources through the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) related to irrigation BMPs. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the primary agricultural research organization in USDA, focusing on irrigation BMPs. Recent studies have looked at improving irrigation management and water conservation. The Economic Research Service (ERS) provides economic information and conducts studies on irrigation water use. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers funding for agriculture-related research, including irrigation programs like the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Water for Agriculture Challenge Area. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provide national data on irrigation water use, but their methodologies and reporting schedules differ. NASS conducts surveys of producers every five years to assess irrigated agriculture in the United States, while USGS, under the Department of the Interior, also produces relevant data. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) conducts a national assessment of irrigated agriculture every five years. This assessment evaluates trends in water use categories, including irrigation practices like sprinkler systems. These systems spray water over crop areas to provide soil moisture for crops and qualify for funding from the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Sprinkler systems are used for crop irrigation, cooling, frost protection, and dust control. Microirrigation is low-pressure, low-volume irrigation near plant roots. Irrigation pipelines minimize water loss. Pumping plants deliver water at a set pressure and flow rate. Land leveling increases irrigation efficiency and prevents soil erosion. Water wells are used for water supply. An engineered plan to increase surface irrigation efficiency, reduce erosion, prevent water logging of soil or crops, and prevent water quality loss. Includes water well extraction, water control structures, irrigation reservoirs, and water management planning. Considerations for neighboring wells, groundwater overdraft, and impacts on cultural or scientific resources. Irrigation reservoirs are built to provide a reliable water supply for irrigation. They may be constructed using various methods such as dams, embankments, pits, or tanks. Irrigation Water Management involves planning the efficient volume, frequency, and application rate of irrigation to manage soil moisture and promote plant growth. Irrigation scheduling is crucial for water management. An Irrigation System, Surface and Subsurface, includes earthwork, multi-outlet pipelines, and water-control structures to convey water to irrigated areas while reducing water loss, erosion, energy use, and water quality impairment. Irrigation Ditch Lining involves installing impervious material in canals, laterals, or ditches to improve water conveyance, reduce water loss and energy costs, prevent erosion, and maintain water quality.
