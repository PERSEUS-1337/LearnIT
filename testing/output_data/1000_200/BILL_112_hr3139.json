The District of Columbia National Disaster Insurance Protection Act establishes the Natural Disaster Protection Funds. It includes provisions for qualified contributions to the fund and special rules for assets held in the fund for determining gross income. The District of Columbia National Disaster Insurance Protection Act establishes the Natural Disaster Protection Funds. Any income, gain, loss, or deduction from assets in the fund is not counted. Distributions from the fund are subject to specific rules, including excluding returns of non-qualified contributions from gross income. The Natural Disaster Protection Funds are established under the District of Columbia National Disaster Insurance Protection Act. Any distribution that is not a qualified contribution for a taxable year will not be included in gross income if made before the qualified insurance company files its tax return for that year. The fund is defined as any money, securities, or property held by a qualified insurance company in a segregated account. The Natural Disaster Protection Fund, established under the District of Columbia National Disaster Insurance Protection Act, is any money, securities, or property held by a qualified insurance company in a segregated account designated as a 'natural disaster protection fund' and invested according to District of Columbia laws. The Natural Disaster Protection Fund, established under the District of Columbia National Disaster Insurance Protection Act, requires an excess balance drawdown amount to be distributed to qualified insurance companies in DC by the close of the following taxable year. Qualified insurance companies must be incorporated and domiciled in DC. The term \"insurance company\" refers to an insurer or reinsurer incorporated and domiciled in the District of Columbia, supervised by the DC Commissioner of Insurance, with an office employing at least 10 full-time employees, subject to DC taxes and fees, and any additional taxes imposed by DC on premiums. The District of Columbia imposes an additional tax on premiums for natural catastrophic risk coverage written through a fund, at a rate not exceeding the federal excise tax rate on reinsurance contracts issued by foreign insurers. A \"qualified contribution\" refers to a contribution to a fund established by an insurance company in DC. A \"qualified contribution\" is a contribution to a fund by a qualified insurance company, limited to the total of net premiums received for coverage of qualified losses. The contribution must not exceed the amount reasonably at risk for the payment of qualified losses insured through the fund, less reinsurance on those risks, as determined actuarially on a multi-year basis. A \"qualified distribution\" refers to payments made for qualified losses under insurance or reinsurance contracts, excess balance drawdown amounts, fund maintenance expenses, and claims investigation related to qualified losses. The term \"qualified loss\" refers to an insured loss on a United States risk caused by events such as wind, earthquake, flood, tsunami, volcanic eruption, fire, hail, snow, or ice. The term \"qualified loss\" refers to an insured loss on a United States risk caused by events such as wind, earthquake, flood, tsunami, volcanic eruption, fire, hail, snow, ice, freezing, pandemic, or other public health catastrophe. An insured loss satisfies certain criteria if total insured losses exceed $1,000,000,000 on an industry-wide basis or if the President of the United States designates it as a catastrophe. The term \"excess balance drawdown amount\" refers to the excess amount after certain criteria are met, such as insured losses exceeding $1,000,000,000 industry-wide, a disaster declaration by the President or Governor, or a catastrophic industry-wide loss declaration by Property Claims Services. The term 'excess balance drawdown amount' refers to the excess of the fund balance over the total exposure to qualified losses under contracts issued by a qualified insurance company. 'United States risk' refers to hazards or liabilities in the US or its territories. Premiums and losses on certain Puerto Rican risks are excluded. Contributions in kind to a fund are treated as a sale or exchange of property at fair market value. Losses realized upon such transfers are subject to Section 267. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for distributions in kind from a fund to a qualified insurance company. Additionally, there is an additional tax on certain distributions from a Natural Disaster Protection Fund under subsection (d) of section 831 of the tax code. The tax code imposes an additional tax on nonqualified distributions from a natural disaster protection fund made by qualified insurance companies. The tax code imposes an additional tax on nonqualified distributions from a natural disaster protection fund by qualified insurance companies, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
