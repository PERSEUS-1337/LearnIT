    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, sold to an unrelated person. The credit can be claimed for 10 years once a qualifying facility is in service. The maximum credit amount varies by year and technology, with wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualifying for the highest amount. Other technologies receive a reduced credit amount. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) applies to municipal solid waste, qualified hydropower, and marine and hydrokinetic energy facilities, with reduced credit amounts based on construction start dates. The credit is available for wind facilities starting construction before January 1, 2020, with reductions for later start dates. The PTC phases out once electricity market prices exceed threshold levels. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is set to phase out once electricity market prices exceed threshold levels, but this has not happened yet. Before 2018, the PTC was limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), but this limitation was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. Unused credits could be carried forward to offset future tax liability. The corporate AMT limitation was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. PTC-eligible taxpayers could claim the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) or an ARRA Section 1603 grant for property placed in service from 2009 to 2011. Production tax credits are available for Indian coal with specific placed-in-service requirements. Credits are not available for coal produced after 2017. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 and has been extended 11 times since 1999. Credits are available for Indian coal and refined coal facilities with specific placed-in-service requirements. The base rate for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, while the credit for refined coal was $7.307 per ton in 2018. The PTC was initially available for wind or closed-loop biomass systems. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been extended multiple times since its enactment in 1992. Initially available for wind or closed-loop biomass systems, the PTC was extended through various legislative acts, adding new qualifying technologies such as poultry waste, geothermal energy, and solar energy. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 further modified the PTC by including open-loop biomass and other resources. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA; P.L. 108-357) expanded the Production Tax Credit (PTC) to include new qualifying resources like open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These resources were limited to a five-year PTC period, with reduced credit amounts for some. Additionally, a PTC for refined coal was introduced at a rate of $4.375 per ton. The PTC was extended through the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) for all facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for all facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years, through 2007. It added hydropower and Indian coal as new qualifying resources, with Indian coal qualifying for a credit over a seven-year period. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-432) extended the PTC for one year, through 2008, for all qualifying facilities other than solar, refined coal, and Indian coal. The PTC was further extended and modified under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA; P.L. 110-343). The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended and modified under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA; P.L. 110-343). The PTC for wind, refined coal, and other resources was extended through 2009 and 2010. New qualifying resources like marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy were added, along with a credit for steel industry fuel. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA; P.L. 110-343) for wind, refined coal, and other resources through 2009 and 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) further extended the PTC for wind through 2012 and for other renewable energy technologies through 2013. ARRA also introduced the Section 1603 grant program for PTC- and ITC-eligible taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits for property placed in service or under construction in 2009 or 2010. The Section 1603 grant program was extended through 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind was extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, with the expiration date changed to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The PTC and the ITC in lieu of PTC option were retroactively extended through 2014 by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 extended the PTC. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) expiration date for nonwind facilities through 2016. The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) in lieu of PTC option was also extended through 2016. The production credit for Indian coal facilities was extended through 2016, with the placed-in-service limitation removed. The PTC for wind was extended through 2019, with reductions for facilities beginning construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for nonwind technologies and Indian coal was extended through 2016 in the PATH Act of 2015. The PTC for wind facilities was extended through 2019 with reductions for construction starting in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTC for nonwind technologies and Indian coal was retroactively extended for 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Without further action, these credits will not be available for facilities starting construction after 2017. Estimated revenue losses for the PTC between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion. Between 2018 and 2022, JCT estimates $25.8 billion in revenue losses from the Production Tax Credit (PTC), with wind energy accounting for $24.0 billion. Other PTCs include geothermal, open-loop biomass, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower. Production credits for refined coal and Indian coal each contribute $0.1 billion in revenue losses. Extending the PTC would further increase these estimates. Extending the Production Tax Credit (PTC) would increase tax expenditure estimates. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed PTCs totaling $2.8 billion, mainly for renewable electricity production. Unused credits can be carried forward to offset tax liability in future years. In 2010, nearly $1.2 billion in PTCs were carried forward. In 2010, $1.2 billion in PTCs were carried forward from previous tax years. Policy actions in response to the economic downturn affected renewable energy tax credit claims, with fewer taxpayers claiming the PTC after 2009 due to the availability of Section 1603 grants. $15.5 billion in grants were claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible. The economic downturn also led to a significant increase in the amount of PTCs being carried forward between 2008 and 2010. The economic downturn led to a significant increase in the amount of PTCs being carried forward between 2008 and 2010. Taxpayers had less net income to offset with tax credits, and weakness in tax equity markets made it harder for renewable energy project developers to establish partnerships to monetize tax credits. Estimates show that extending various tax credits would reduce federal revenues by billions between 2018 and 2028. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources. Recent extensions of the PTC reflect a belief that tax incentives drive investment in renewable energy infrastructure. Research shows that the PTC has contributed to growth in the wind industry. Extending the wind construction start date beyond 2019 would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has driven investment and growth in the wind industry. Further extension of the PTC may lead to more investment and growth in wind infrastructure, but short-term extensions have limitations. Retroactive extensions provide windfall benefits to taxpayers. Research on the PTC's impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Removing tax credits for renewable electricity could result in a small increase in power-sector emissions. The recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar contribute to reduced emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Government intervention in energy markets is justified by the presence of externalities and market failures caused by pollution from energy production. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are a policy option to address inefficiencies in the energy market. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are not the most efficient way to address market inefficiencies in the energy sector. They reduce energy costs, counter conservation efforts, and may favor costly emissions reductions over cheaper alternatives. Additionally, these subsidies decrease tax revenues and can lead to economic inefficiency. A more effective approach would be a direct tax on pollution or emissions. A more efficient approach to addressing pollution in the energy sector would be a carbon tax, generating revenues to offset other taxes or reduce the deficit. Tax incentives are not the best way to support renewable energy projects, as developers often rely on outside investors to monetize tax benefits. The use of tax equity investors reduces federal financial support for renewable energy, leading to more renewable electricity per dollar of subsidy. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) interacts with state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policies. Without legislative action, the PTC is not available for nonwind projects after 2017 or wind projects after 2019. Options include allowing the PTC to expire as scheduled. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) may expire for nonwind projects after 2017 or wind projects after 2019. Options include allowing the PTC to expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension with a set number of years. Congress may choose to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies retroactively for 2018 and apply the phaseout currently in place for wind to other technologies. The PTC phaseout for wind projects could be extended to other technologies or the PTC could be extended for nonwind technologies while removing the phaseout for wind. In 2014, Chairman Dave Camp proposed a PTC phaseout in the Tax Reform Act of 2014, which would have reduced the PTC value for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh. This proposal would have fully repealed the PTC. Chairman Camp's proposal in 2015 aimed to reduce the value of the PTC for existing facilities, potentially raising $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a permanent extension of the PTC, making it refundable and including solar facilities as qualifying property. Solar property eligible for the residential energy efficient property credit would also qualify for the PTC. The electricity consumed by the producer could qualify for tax credits, including the residential energy efficient property credit and the investment tax credit (ITC) for renewable energy. Making the PTC and ITC permanent, along with other changes, would cost $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026 according to the JCT's analysis of President Obama's FY2017 budget."
