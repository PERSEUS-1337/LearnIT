    "content": "AUTHORITY FOR 16- AND 17-YEAR-OLDS TO LOAD MATERIALS INTO SCRAP PAPER BALERS AND PAPER BOX COMPACTORS. The Fair Labor Standards Act now allows 16- and 17-year-old employees to load materials into scrap paper balers and paper box compactors that meet safety standards and cannot be operated while being loaded. The American National Standards Institute's Standard ANSI Z245.5-1990 for scrap paper balers and Standard ANSI Z245.2-1992 for paper box compactors must be met, or an equivalent standard certified by the Secretary as protective of minors' safety. Scrap paper balers and paper box compactors must have an on-off switch with key-lock control held by employees aged 18 or older, kept in the off position when not in use. The employer must ensure that scrap paper balers and paper box compactors are kept in the off position when not in use. Employees aged 16 and 17 can only load these machines, while those under 18 cannot operate or unload them. The Secretary will publish a standard for these machines to ensure the safety of minors. Employers must report any injuries or fatalities of employees under 18 involving scrap paper balers or paper box compactors to the Secretary for safety evaluation. Employers must report injuries or fatalities of employees under 18 involving scrap paper balers or paper box compactors to the Secretary. Reports should include details such as employer and employee information, incident date, injury description, and equipment manufacturer. Employers must report injuries or fatalities of employees under 18 involving scrap paper balers or paper box compactors to the Secretary within 10 days. The Secretary cannot solely rely on these reports to determine violations of child labor laws; an investigation and inspection must be conducted before making such a determination. Reporting requirements expire 2 years after enactment. SEC. 2. CIVIL MONEY PENALTY. Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act by expanding the scope of violations subject to civil money penalties. SEC. 3. CONSTRUCTION. Clarifies that certain exemptions for apprentices and student learners are not affected by the amendments."
