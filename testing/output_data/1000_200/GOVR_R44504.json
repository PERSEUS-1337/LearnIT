    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental protection. The BOEM is the lead agency responsible for developing these programs, which involve multiple drafts, economic and environmental analysis, and final leasing schedules submitted to the President and Congress. The Secretary of the Interior must submit each program to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. The planning process includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by NEPA, addressing potential environmental impacts from oil and gas exploration. Public comments from stakeholders are considered in both the PEIS and the five-year program. The Administration cannot revise a finalized program once approved. The final oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 was approved by former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell on January 17, 2017. The program includes 11 lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), with 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Sales cannot be added once the program is finalized, but scheduled sales could potentially be canceled during implementation based on environmental review requirements. The final oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 includes 11 lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS): 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Congress plays a role in the planning process but does not have approval authority over the program. Members of Congress can influence the program by submitting public comments and evaluating it in committee. Members of Congress can influence the proposed offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 by submitting public comments, evaluating the program in committee oversight hearings, and introducing legislation to set or alter its terms. The report discusses the history, legal framework, development process, and analysis of the program. Congress's role in oversight and legislation related to the program is also highlighted. The Submerged Lands Act and the OCSLA define jurisdiction and rights for offshore oil and gas exploration. Coastal states have rights up to 3 geographical miles from their coasts. OCSLA aims for orderly development of OCS resources with environmental safeguards. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added provisions to the OCSLA, including Section 18 mandating the creation of an OCS leasing program to meet national energy needs for a five-year period. The OCSLA Amendments of 1978 added Section 18, requiring the establishment of a five-year OCS leasing program to meet national energy needs. Subsequent legislation, like the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, have further shaped offshore oil and gas exploration and production. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 directed leasing in certain Gulf regions for oil and gas exploration, revenue sharing with Gulf states, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Congress removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions from annual Interior appropriations legislation starting in 2008. The statutory framework for BOEM's five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program includes OCSLA, NEPA, and CZMA. Section 18 of OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and revise an oil and gas leasing program. The Secretary of the Interior is required to prepare and periodically revise an oil and gas leasing program under the OCSLA. This program must consider economic, social, and environmental values, as well as the potential impact of exploration on marine and coastal environments. The program includes a schedule of proposed lease sales for the five-year period following its approval. The Secretary of the Interior must schedule oil and gas exploration and production in OCS regions based on various factors, including environmental considerations, state laws, and fair market value. The program must also include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs, as well as consultation requirements. The OCSLA imposes consultation requirements on the Secretary of the Interior when preparing the five-year program, including inviting suggestions from federal agencies and state governors. The program must be submitted to affected state governors for comments before publication in the Federal Register. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission, is also authorized under the OCSLA. The OCSLA requires consultation with federal agencies and state governors when preparing the five-year program. Comments must be submitted at least 60 days prior to publication in the Federal Register. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission, can provide comments on competition effects. The Secretary must submit the program to Congress and the President for approval, explaining any rejections of recommendations. The Secretary can revise the program at any time, with significant revisions requiring the initial approval process. The OCSLA requires consultation with federal agencies and state governors for the five-year program. BOEM carries out the Secretary of the Interior's responsibilities. Consultation requirements include sending letters to governors for input. NEPA and CZMA also influence the program's formation. The preparation of the five-year program involves compliance with NEPA and CZMA, which require federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of major actions. BOEM assumes the significance of the program's impact on the environment without conducting an environmental assessment. Under the CZMA, states are encouraged to enact coastal zone management plans to coordinate protection of habitats and resources in coastal waters. State programs must designate conservation measures and permissible uses for land and water resources, addressing various sources of water pollution. The CZMA requires states to enact coastal zone management plans that designate conservation measures and permissible land and water uses, addressing water pollution sources. BOEM regulations for the five-year program consider state coastal zone management programs, requiring information from governors and the Secretary of Commerce. The program development process involves multiple drafts for review and comment. The development of a five-year program involves multiple drafts published for review and comment, submitted to various government entities, and undergoes public comment and environmental review at each stage. The process includes consultation with state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. Individual lease sales and companies' exploration and development plans also go through environmental review and public comment. The successive drafts represent a winnowing process, leading to the final proposed program. The drafting of the five-year program involves multiple stages of review and analysis. The initial draft examines all planning areas for oil and gas leasing, leading to a proposed schedule of lease sales. Subsequent drafts focus on a more targeted analysis of listed areas, with the ability to remove proposed sales but not add new ones. The final version allows for the removal of proposed sales but requires reverting to earlier stages for any new additions. Step 1 - BOEM initiates development of a new five-year program by publishing a request for information (RFI) in the Federal Register. The RFI seeks input on energy needs, leasing interests, environmental concerns, and input from state and local governments, tribes, and the public. \n\nStep 2 - Based on analysis and public comments from the RFI, BOEM publishes a draft proposed program (DPP) for lease sales in the upcoming period. BOEM publishes a draft proposed program (DPP) for lease sales in the upcoming five-year period, analyzing all OCS planning areas and identifying areas proposed for lease sales. The DPP for 2017-2022 was published on January 29, 2015, with over 1 million comments received. BOEM also issues a notice of intent (NOI) for a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) and seeks public input on the issues to be analyzed. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) publishes a proposed program (PP) for the 2017-2022 period, refining lease sale locations and timing based on public comments. The PP is accompanied by a draft PEIS for analysis of OCS areas identified for leasing. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) published the Proposed Final Program (PFP) for the 2017-2022 period on November 18, 2016. The PFP is based on analysis of factors in the OCSLA and public comments received on the PP. It is submitted to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. Along with the PFP, a final PEIS is published to conclude the analysis of proposed leasing areas. BOEM published the PFP for 2017-2022 on November 18, 2016, along with a final PEIS. The final PEIS is submitted to the President and Congress. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP at least 60 days after submission, with a record of decision issued. Former Secretary Sally Jewell approved the final program on January 17, 2017. Since 1980, eight five-year programs have been submitted to Congress and approved after the 60-day review period required by the OCSLA. The Obama Administration submitted the 2012-2017 five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program to Congress, reflecting policies post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It included 15 proposed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska region. The 2012-2017 offshore oil and gas leasing program included 15 proposed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska region. The program was submitted by the Obama Administration and reflected policies post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The George W. Bush Administration had previously submitted the 2007-2012 five-year program to Congress, with a schedule of 21 sales that was later revised to 16 sales by the Obama Administration. The 2010 program to Congress replaced the original lease sale schedule with 16 sales, approved after a 60-day review period. Eleven of the 16 sales were held before the program expired in June 2012. The 2002-2007 program under Secretary Gale Norton included 20 lease sales, with 15 held before expiring in June 2007. The 1997-2002 program under Secretary Bruce Babbitt listed 16 sales, with 12 held before expiring in June 2002. The submission listed 16 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 2002. Programs from 1992-1997, 1987-1992, and 1982-1987 were presented to Congress reflecting energy policies of past administrations. The 1980-1982 program for domestic oil and gas leasing was presented to Congress in April 1980 under President Carter's direction. It consisted of 36 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 1987. This program was succeeded by the 1982-1987 program. The 1980-1982 domestic oil and gas leasing program included 36 sales, with 12 held before it expired in June 1987. This program was followed by the 1982-1987 program. In November 2016, BOEM released the final offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions of the OCS. The program covers four OCS regions: Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Atlantic, and Pacific. Sales are planned for the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. U.S. offshore crude oil production declined from 31% to 16% of total production between FY2010 and FY2015, while offshore natural gas production fell from 9.5% to 4%. Offshore production volumes decreased by 12% for oil and nearly 50% for gas during this period, despite a 73% increase in total crude oil production to 9.4 million barrels per day. Between FY2010 and FY2015, U.S. natural gas production volumes dropped by nearly 50%, while total annual production increased by over 30% to 28.7 Tcf. The surge in production is attributed to shale gas and shale oil extraction in various onshore formations like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford. This increase in oil production has reduced imports, particularly from OPEC countries. Offshore oil plays have higher production costs compared to onshore shale plays. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing offshore oil and gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the OCS. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects over the 2015-2020 period. Estimates by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) show a decrease in bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years compared to previous periods. For example, in ONRR's FY2015 budget request, offshore bonus bid revenues were estimated at around $1 billion annually for FY2015-FY2019, while in the most recent FY2017 budget request, estimated bonus bid revenues were closer to $500 million. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates fell from $80-$90 per barrel in the FY2015 budget request to $50-$60 per barrel in the FY2017 budget request. Despite the impact of low oil prices on new investment, offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels of 1.91 mbd in 2017 due to new deepwater projects. BOEM emphasizes the importance of energy diversification, including continued oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) emphasizes the importance of energy diversification, including continued oil and natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil and gas exploration and production proceed in stages, with increasing data certainty about resource volumes. Reserves are reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission by well owners. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mostly in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. BOEM estimates 89.9 billion barrels of oil and 327.5 Tcf of natural gas in undiscovered resources, with the Gulf of Mexico holding the majority. No reserves have been reported along the Atlantic OCS due to no discoveries. The Gulf of Mexico holds the majority of undiscovered oil and gas resources in the U.S. OCS, with Alaska's Chukchi and Beaufort Seas also containing significant reserves. BOEM must consider resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts when planning OCS leasing. Some areas were unavailable for leasing consideration in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. Areas unavailable for oil and gas leasing in the 2017-2022 program included the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico, Alaska Withdrawal Areas, and National Marine Sanctuaries and Marine Monuments. In December 2016, President Obama withdrew parts of the U.S. Arctic, including the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea planning areas, from future oil and gas leasing activities. Additionally, certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean associated with major canyons were also withdrawn. The President's December 2016 withdrawals included parts of the U.S. Arctic and certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean associated with major canyons. These withdrawals did not impact the 2017-2022 leasing program but would affect future leasing considerations. BOEM's leasing strategy evaluates each U.S. ocean region based on various criteria for leasing, resulting in the inclusion of 11 regions in the final program. The BOEM's final leasing program includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, excluding the Atlantic and Pacific regions. The program offers almost half of the undiscovered oil and gas resources on the U.S. OCS, with the Gulf of Mexico being the most mature region. The Gulf of Mexico region is the most abundant in proven and estimated oil and gas resources, with broad industry interest and well-developed infrastructure. It accounts for 97% of all U.S. offshore oil and gas production, and the majority of lease sales in the 2017-2022 program are scheduled in this region. The Gulf states are supportive of offshore oil and gas activities, with 10 out of 11 proposed sales in the Gulf region. The region includes three BOEM planning areas: the Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf, with some areas closed to leasing due to congressional moratoriums. For the 2017-2022 program, BOEM has replaced area-specific sales in the Gulf with region-wide sales to provide greater flexibility to industry. The final program schedules fewer lease sales in the Gulf compared to previous five-year programs. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has grown due to decreased summer polar ice, allowing for longer drilling seasons, and estimates of substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters. Estimates of substantial undiscovered oil and gas resources in Arctic waters have increased interest in offshore drilling in the region. Challenges such as severe weather, sea ice, and lack of infrastructure persist. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, support expanding offshore oil and gas activities, while others, including environmental groups, oppose drilling due to concerns about oil spills and climate change. The Obama Administration has expressed support for expanding offshore oil activities. The Obama Administration supported expanding offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic but also aimed to minimize oil spill risks. Lease sales in the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea were canceled due to market conditions. BOEM removed sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas for the final program, retaining only the sale for Cook Inlet. BOEM removed sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas for the final program, retaining only the sale for Cook Inlet. Factors considered included significant hydrocarbon resources, State of Alaska support, industry interest decline, and current market conditions. BOEM noted declining industry interest in the Arctic OCS due to low oil prices and Shell's unsuccessful drilling in the Chukchi Sea in 2015. Active leases on the Arctic OCS decreased by over 90% between February and November 2016. BOEM stated that industry interest in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas may increase after 2017-2022. The agency concluded that the Arctic lease sales were not immediately necessary due to the current strength of the domestic energy supply. President Obama withdrew large portions of the final program after its publication. President Obama withdrew large portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration for an indefinite time period after BOEM's final program publication. The final program for 2017-2022 excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region, which would have been the first since 1983 due to congressional bans and presidential moratoria on offshore leasing in the region. Since FY2009, Congress no longer included an Atlantic leasing moratorium in annual appropriations acts, allowing for potential lease sales in the region. However, no Atlantic lease sale has occurred. As of December 2016, certain parts of the Atlantic are under presidential moratorium, while other areas are available for leasing. BOEM analyzed various factors for the Atlantic region under the OCSLA for the 2017-2022 program. BOEM analyzed factors for the Atlantic region under the OCSLA for the 2017-2022 program. Initial plans for a lease sale in 2021 were later removed due to strong local opposition and conflicts with other ocean uses. BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to conflicts with existing ocean uses and the less pressing national energy needs, citing the region's lack of offshore mineral production history compared to the Gulf of Mexico. The 2017-2022 program by BOEM does not include lease sales for the Pacific region, which has not had federal oil and gas lease sales since 1984. Despite lifting leasing moratoria in FY2009, California, Oregon, and Washington governors still oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the Pacific region. Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program in various ways. California, Oregon, and Washington governors continue to oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the Pacific region. Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. The 114th Congress pursued these avenues for the 2017-2022 program, and the 115th Congress may also address it. The 115th Congress could address the proposed 2017-2022 program, with stakeholders submitting comments on draft versions. BOEM received comments from Members of Congress on various aspects of the program, including lease sales and seismic testing in the Atlantic. The 115th Congress could address the proposed 2017-2022 program, with stakeholders submitting comments on draft versions. BOEM received comments from Members of Congress on lease sales, seismic testing in the Atlantic, and potential revisions to the program based on public feedback. Congressional oversight hearings may be held to evaluate the program, providing an opportunity for BOEM to hear Members' views. The House and Senate held hearings on the proposed 2017-2022 program by BOEM. Discussions included the number of lease sales, leasing in the Atlantic and Arctic, seismic surveying, and targeted lease sales in Alaska. Congress has the authority to modify or remove lease sales through legislation. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to impact the 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program by requiring the use of an earlier-proposed draft program and directing specific lease sales. Bills like H.R. 1487 and S. 791 sought to modify the program by removing certain lease sales and conducting a previously proposed sale in the Atlantic region. The bills in the 114th Congress aimed to impact the 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program by requiring specific lease sales, including in the Atlantic region. H.R. 1663 would have approved the FY2015-FY2020 program under NEPA without further environmental review and added lease sales in various regions, such as the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Bristol Bay, and off the coast of Virginia. The bill H.R. 3682 aimed to amend the OCSLA by requiring BOEM five-year programs to make at least 50% of available unleased acreage in areas with significant oil and gas resources available for leasing. It also aimed to increase production by at least 3 million barrels of oil per day. The bill H.R. 4749 aimed to increase offshore energy production by 3 million barrels of oil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by 2032. It also included provisions for adding additional areas to leasing programs, conducting lease sales in specific regions, and addressing revenue sharing with states. H.R. 4749 aimed to increase offshore energy production by conducting lease sales off North Carolina and other regions, with military protections and revenue sharing with coastal states. S. 1276 and S. 2011 proposed amending OCSLA to lease areas with large undiscovered resources, reducing the Eastern Gulf of Mexico leasing moratorium, and adding lease sales to the 2017-2022 program, along with state revenue-sharing provisions. The bills S. 1276, S. 2011, S. 1278, and S. 1279 aimed to increase offshore energy production by amending OCSLA, conducting lease sales in various planning areas, extending existing leases, and implementing revenue-sharing provisions with states like Alaska. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held hearings on bills S. 1278, S. 1279, and S. 3203 on May 19, 2015. These bills aimed to include different planning areas in lease sales programs, address conflicts with military operations, consult with state governors, and conduct geological surveys. S. 3203 also proposed increased revenue sharing with Alaska. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 3203 on September 22, 2016, which aimed to include different planning areas in lease sales programs, increase revenue sharing with Alaska, and make changes to lease terms for the Alaska region. Congress has the authority to introduce legislation to alter the final version of each five-year program submitted under the OCSLA. In response to the current five-year leasing program, Representative Doc Hastings introduced H.R. 6082 to replace it with a congressionally developed plan including additional lease sales in various regions. The bill passed the House but did not become law. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to make changes to the lease sale schedule for the 2017-2022 program, with potential for further alterations in the 115th Congress."
