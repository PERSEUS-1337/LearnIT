The \"Tax Equity Act of 2009\" includes regional cost-of-living adjustments in individual income tax rates, with subsection (f) of section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amended to provide for these adjustments. The \"Tax Equity Act of 2009\" adjusts individual income tax rates based on regional cost-of-living factors, with specific adjustments made to minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate bracket in the applicable statistical area. The tax rate for each bracket remains unchanged, but the overall tax amount is adjusted as necessary. The Tax Equity Act of 2009 adjusts individual income tax rates based on regional cost-of-living factors by adjusting minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate bracket in the applicable statistical area. The tax rate for each bracket remains unchanged, but the overall tax amount is adjusted to reflect the adjustments in the rate brackets. The Secretary prescribes an applicable multiplier for each statistical area of the United States annually, which applies to taxable years beginning in the following calendar year. The Tax Equity Act of 2009 adjusts income tax rates based on regional cost-of-living factors by applying multipliers to different statistical areas. Multipliers are determined based on the cost-of-living differentials for each area, with varying percentages for different ranges of differentials. The Tax Equity Act of 2009 adjusts income tax rates based on regional cost-of-living factors by applying multipliers to different statistical areas. The cost-of-living differential for any statistical area is determined by dividing the area's cost-of-living by the average cost-of-living for the United States. The Secretary of Labor determines and publishes the cost-of-living for each area annually. The Secretary of Labor determines and publishes a cost-of-living index for each statistical area annually based on average market prices for the area. The index is calculated for the 12-month period ending on August 31 of each calendar year, using the same methodology as the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The amendment made by this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009, with a transition rule in place. The area applicable multiplier for any area outside the United States is 1. The transition rule for prescribing applicable multipliers for taxable years beginning in 2010 is one year after the enactment of the Act."
