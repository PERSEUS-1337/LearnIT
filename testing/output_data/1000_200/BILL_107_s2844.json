    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Incentives to Educate American Children (I Teach) Act of 2002\". Congress finds that there is a need for 2,000,000 new teachers in the next decade. The No Child Left Behind Act requires States to recruit qualified teachers by 2006, especially in rural and high-poverty schools. Rural education is crucial in 25 States, and high poverty schools often lack certified teachers in their fields. High poverty schools face challenges in meeting the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act as they are twice as likely to lack certified teachers in their fields. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was established in 1987 to set high standards for accomplished teachers, with over 16,000 teachers certified nationwide. Recent data from the Accomplished Teaching Validation Study shows that teachers certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards outperform non-certified peers on 11 of 13 key teaching expertise measures. Teacher salaries have stagnated over the past decade, with two-thirds of states falling below the national average of $40,582. The Act aims to incentivize teachers through a refundable tax credit. The Act aims to encourage teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools through a refundable tax credit. It also provides an additional tax credit for teachers who achieve certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards to recruit and retain highly qualified teachers in public schools. The Act introduces a tax credit for individuals teaching in high poverty or rural schools and certified teachers. A tax credit is introduced for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools, allowing a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year. The applicable amount is $1,000 for teachers in public kindergartens or elementary/secondary schools meeting specific criteria. The tax credit of $1,000 is available for eligible teachers certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards who work in public kindergartens or schools with at least 75% of students receiving free or reduced-cost lunches, or with a School Locale Code of 7 or 8. For eligible teachers certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, the tax credit amount is $1,000. Certified teachers in rural areas or high-poverty schools receive $2,000. An eligible teacher is a full-time kindergarten through grade 12 classroom teacher in a public school. The terms 'elementary school' and 'secondary school' are defined by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. An eligible academic year is any academic year ending in a taxable year after December 31, 2002. Amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Tax credit for individuals teaching in high poverty or rural areas and certified teachers.
