    "content": "Federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs are subject to periodic reauthorization. The most recent authorization before SAFETEA was the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), which provided funds for FY1998-FY2003. Short-term extension acts were used after October 1, 2003, causing uncertainty in the highway and transit community. Long-term reauthorizations, like TEA-21, are preferred for better planning and construction needs. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed by highway and transit interests due to uncertainty caused by short-term extensions. SAFETEA, originally a six-year bill, was delayed and became a four-year bill expiring in FY2009. Federal funding for surface transportation is closely tied to the highway trust fund, which consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit. The primary revenue sources for these accounts are gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, with fuel taxes providing about 90% of the funds' income. The transit account receives 2.86 cents per gallon, while 0.1 cent per gallon is reserved for other purposes. The fuel taxes provide about 90% of the income to the funds, with the transit account receiving 2.86 cents per gallon. Over almost 50 years, there have been several increases in taxation, with the last one in 1993. The trust fund has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation, with the highway account receiving $31 billion and the mass transit account receiving $5 billion in FY2004. However, in recent years, the funds have been collecting more than has been expended. The trust funds have collected more than expended in recent years, but the unexpended balance is declining. There is uncertainty about the long-term financial health of the trust fund, despite additional income provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The trust fund faces uncertainty about its long-term financial health despite additional income from the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Proposed changes in federal gasohol taxation could provide an extra $4 billion annually starting in FY2005, but disagreements between Congress and the Administration hindered agreement on total program funding for the next reauthorization period. Some Members of Congress supported higher project funding levels than the Administration was willing to back, with objections to raising fuel taxes in the future. The Administration opposes raising fuel taxes now or in the future, while some Members of Congress suggest various mechanisms to support a larger program, including gasohol changes. However, these changes alone would not be enough to fund the desired program size. Conferees on SAFETEA considered tax and other changes to increase revenues for the trust fund and offset additional highway and transit spending. The revenue increases in the finance title of the act are seen as modest, mainly coming from cutting back on tax fraud and transferring some Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. TEA-21 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by creating new budget categories for highway and mass transit. It also set limitations on obligations for fiscal years FY1999 to FY2003. Additionally, the act provided a mechanism to transfer some Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. TEA-21 set limitations on obligations for fiscal years FY1999 to FY2003 in authorizing legislation. It introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust highway account amounts based on revenue changes. This created a discretionary spending guarantee for core highway and transit programs. Annual revenues and expenditures affecting trust fund balances are still part of the federal deficit calculation. SAFETEA, like TEA-21, establishes discretionary spending guarantees for highway and transit programs through \"firewalls.\" These firewalls ensure funds allocated for these programs are not used for other purposes. SAFETEA provides $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending authority for FY2004-FY2009, a significant increase from TEA-21's $218 billion for FY1998-2003. The main focus of SAFETEA was on funding allocation and distribution. SAFETEA provides over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority for FY2005-FY2009, representing a significant increase from TEA-21. All major federal surface transportation programs receive substantial new funding under SAFETEA. The legislation provides significant new funding for major programs, with total annual spending increasing each year. Funding details can be found in the report's appendix or at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/fundtables.htm. The House version of SAFETEA included a provision for Congress to reconsider funding at a later date, which was opposed by the Bush Administration and not included in the final act. The Bush Administration objected to a provision in the SAFETEA legislation that would allow Congress to reconsider funding at a later date. The legislation aimed to adjust highway program obligations based on changes in revenue from the highway trust fund. The RABA calculation in FY2003 called for a program reduction, but Congress chose to increase spending instead. SAFETEA changed how RABA is calculated by using a two-year average instead of a single year, to make revenue swings less dramatic. The SAFETEA legislation changes how RABA is calculated by using a two-year average instead of a single year, reducing the likelihood of spending reductions. Transportation policy battles often align regionally rather than along partisan lines, especially regarding the distribution of federal highway aid among states. Congress has included provisions in surface transportation acts since 1982 to address funding distribution concerns. Some states have long complained about receiving less federal highway aid than they contribute in taxes to the highway trust fund. Donor states seek a higher share rate-of-return, while donee states oppose any reduction in their current shares. Donor states argue for equity, stating they have been subsidizing the infrastructure of donee states for too long. Donor states advocate for equity in federal highway funding, arguing that they have been subsidizing the infrastructure of donee states for too long. They emphasize their road dependency and limited benefits from federal transit spending. Donee states, on the other hand, argue that fairness should be based on needs, pointing to the age and cost of maintaining their infrastructure, especially in congested urban areas. The debate over equity in federal highway funding involves donor states arguing they have been subsidizing donee states for too long. Donee states justify their need for federal funds due to the age and cost of maintaining their infrastructure, especially in congested urban areas. The debate has implications for addressing federal transportation needs beyond just highway funding. The debate over federal highway funding equity raises questions about the federal government's role in transportation funding, including the possibility of converting the Federal aid highway program to a revenue sharing or block grant program. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return with donee state demands to be held harmless, as the Highway Trust Fund revenue base was insufficient to meet both goals. Some states proposed broadening the Minimum Guarantee to include Federal Transit Administration programs, adding to the complexity of the issue. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return with donee state demands to be held harmless, as the Highway Trust Fund revenue base was expected to be insufficient to easily fund both goals. To overcome this obstacle, a minimum guarantee mechanism was constructed with \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain certain base shares for all states. This required increasing the overall federal highway program size to bring donor state shares up to a designated percentage share. The TEA21 program aimed to provide equity by giving more money to all states, with donor states receiving even more to reach a designated percentage share. This approach was costly, leading to the creation of the largest highway program. SAFETEA replaced the TEA-21 program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to ensure donor states reached their guaranteed rate-of-return levels. The Equity Bonus program directs the Secretary of Transportation to allocate funds to ensure each state receives a minimum return percentage on their payments to the highway account of the HTF for fiscal years 2005-2009. Various programs under TEA-21 are subject to the equity provision, along with new formula programs and hold harmless provisions for certain states. The Equity Bonus program allocates funds to ensure each state receives a minimum return percentage on their payments to the highway account of the HTF for fiscal years 2005-2009. The EB program includes hold harmless provisions for certain states based on specific criteria such as population density, population size, median household income, fatality rate on Interstate Highways, and state motor fuel excise tax rate. Twenty-seven states qualify under these criteria. The Equity Bonus program guarantees a minimum return percentage on state payments to the highway account of the HTF for fiscal years 2005-2009. Twenty-seven states qualify based on specific criteria, including a high state motor fuel excise tax rate. Each state also has an annual percentage floor set relative to their TEA-21 average apportionment. The program distributes funds annually, with the first $2.639 billion allocated. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees a minimum return percentage on state payments to the highway account of the HTF for fiscal years 2005-2009. Funds are distributed annually, with the first $2.639 billion allocated to the STP. Any funds above this amount are distributed to six core programs based on each program's apportionment ratio. Over the five-year life of SAFETEA, the EB program distributions will cost $40.9 billion. Under SAFETEA, funds for various programs are apportioned to states annually using formulas. These programs, also known as \"apportioned\" or formula programs, include core programs like interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation, highway bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation, air quality, and highway safety improvement. The Equity Bonus Program, replacing the TEA-21 minimum guarantee program, guarantees a minimum return percentage on state payments to the highway account. The majority of funding in the surface transportation bill goes to core highway programs, with additional smaller apportioned programs like metropolitan planning and recreational trails. SAFETEA includes new formula programs like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and Safe Routes to School Program. The SAFETEA bill allocates funding to core highway programs, as well as smaller apportioned programs like metropolitan planning and recreational trails. New formula programs include the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and Safe Routes to School Program, which replaced the TEA-21 discretionary program. The distribution of funds under the Federal-Aid Highway program is based on various factors outlined in Title 23 of the U.S. Code. While SAFETEA did not make significant changes to existing program formulas, it did eliminate the 10% safety STP set-aside. The SAFETEA bill made adjustments to existing program formulas, including eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside and creating new set-asides for Transportation Enhancements, ferry boats, and ferry terminal facilities. It also adjusted the calculation for CMAQ in non-attainment areas and maintenance areas for ozone. Additionally, set-asides were established for the National Highway System, Territorial Highway Program, and off-system bridge program. The off-system bridge program under the SAFETEA bill has a minimum set-aside of 15% and removes the 35% ceiling. The distribution formula is based on federal lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities. Each state receives a minimum payment of 0.5%. The Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP and is distributed based on a formula that includes public railway-highway grade crossings. The distribution formula for the Railway-Highway Crossings program is based on the number of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state. Additionally, $90 million annually must be set aside by states for high-risk rural road improvements. Funds under SAFETEA are apportioned to states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on commercial truck and personal vehicle crossings ratios. The distribution formula for funds under SAFETEA is based on various ratios related to commercial truck and personal vehicle crossings, weight of incoming cargo, and number of ports-of-entry in each state. Funds are apportioned based on student enrollment in primary and middle schools, with no state receiving less than $1 million. Highway programs not apportioned are subject to allocations based on established criteria. SAFETEA allocates funds based on specific criteria, with some programs receiving significant funding levels. The largest allocated program is for congressionally mandated high priority projects, along with other large programs like the federal lands program and the interstate maintenance discretionary program. SAFETEA also introduces new large allocated programs. SAFETEA introduces new large allocated programs such as a transportation improvement program, a national corridor infrastructure program, and a program for projects of national or regional significance, all subject to 100% earmarking. The act includes project selection criteria for these projects, creating a different operating framework compared to other allocated programs. Innovative financing mechanisms aim to expedite project completion and leverage additional funds for highways. In the 1990s, innovative financing mechanisms use future highway funds to speed project completion and leverage additional funds. Three mechanisms are in use: GARVEEs, TIFIA credit assistance, and SIBs. SAFETEA makes changes to TIFIA and SIB programs, providing federal financial assistance for transportation projects. SAFETEA provides federal financial assistance for major transportation projects through secured loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit. It reduces project size thresholds and supports TIFIA's leveraging activities with $122 million annually. The act also allows any state to establish State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs) eligible for federal funds. Additionally, SAFETEA consolidates tolling provisions and authorizes tolling programs, including tolling of HOV lanes. SAFETEA consolidates tolling provisions in Section 1604, authorizing four tolling programs and a provision for tolling HOV lanes. The act also includes a program for private facility bonds under Section 1143 of the revenue title. $11 million is authorized for FY2005, with $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009, allocating $3 million each year for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects. The program directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out 15 demonstration projects. The new program under SAFETEA directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out 15 demonstration projects allowing toll collection at existing toll facilities or highways to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or finance highway expansion. Funding will primarily go towards HOT lanes, with revenue use restricted to debt service, private financing return, and operating costs. Excess revenues can be used for federal-aid highway or transit projects if the toll facility is adequately operated and maintained. The new program under SAFETEA allows toll facilities to vary toll prices based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality and manage traffic. High occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities must also adjust toll prices accordingly. Fees for express lanes must be collected electronically. A pilot toll program permits states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. The pilot program under SAFETEA allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. States must demonstrate that toll financing is the most efficient way to advance the project. Restrictions are in place to prevent private agreements that hinder improvements to public roads adjacent to toll facilities. Revenues can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and operating costs. The SAFETEA pilot program allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes, with restrictions in place to prevent private agreements that hinder public road improvements. Revenues can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and operating costs, including resurfacing and maintenance of toll facilities. Additionally, state departments of transportation can allow vehicles to pay a toll to use HOV lanes, with requirements for enrollment, toll collection, demand management, and enforcement. The SAFETEA pilot program allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes, with restrictions in place to prevent private agreements that hinder public road improvements. Revenues can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and operating costs, including resurfacing and maintenance of toll facilities. Section 1121 of the act allows for the tolling of \"low emission and energy-efficient vehicles\" at a preferential rate for HOV use and amends the Internal Revenue Code to issue tax-exempt private activity bonds for highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. The provision in SAFETEA allows for tax-exempt facility bonding for specific projects, including highways, international tunnels/bridges, and truck-train transfer facilities. There is a $15 billion limit on the bonds that can be issued, with the potential for substantial impact if fully utilized. This bonding provision is considered crucial in the legislation, with the possibility of creating significant infrastructure. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) is a road building initiative funded by the highway trust fund to promote economic development in Appalachia. Administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, funds are allocated to member states based on cost estimates for completing the approved Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). As of 2004, 85% of ADHS roads are either completed or under construction. (CRS contacts: John Fischer and Bob Kirk) The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) is 85% completed or under construction as of 2004. Additional federal funds of $4.47 billion are needed to finish the system. The ADHP receives $450 million annually under TEA-21 and $470 million under SAFETEA. SAFETEA has more earmarks for high priority projects compared to TEA-21. Toll revenues cannot be used as credits for non-federal matching funds on ADHP projects. SAFETEA contains over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects worth $14.8 billion, compared to TEA-21's 1,849 earmarks valued at $9.4 billion. Additionally, SAFETEA introduces new earmarked categories, including projects of national and regional significance and national corridor infrastructure improvements. These new categories allocate funds for larger-scale projects. The SAFETEA bill includes earmarks for national corridor infrastructure improvements, transportation improvements, and individually listed projects totaling over $5.1 billion. These earmarks introduce new categories and allocate funds for various projects. The SAFETEA bill contains numerous earmarks totaling over $24 billion, with specific allocations for infrastructure projects in different titles of the bill. The discussion post-passage has focused on how earmarks impact the Equity Bonus calculation. The SAFETEA bill contains earmarks totaling over $24 billion, with specific allocations for infrastructure projects. Earmarks in the bill affect the Equity Bonus calculation, with two types for EB purposes: \"below the line\" and \"above the line\" projects. This computation significantly impacts state shares, as some states receive more earmarked funds proportionally. Highway title earmarks include below the line HPPs and above the line miscellaneous earmarks. Transit earmarks and Transportation Enhancements program activities are not part of the EB calculation. The TE program under TEA-21 funds 12 categories of projects including pedestrian and bicycle facilities, historic preservation, and environmental mitigation. Funding mechanism for TE program activities has been modified under TEA-21. The funding mechanism for TE program activities has been modified under SAFETEA, ensuring additional funding for enhancement projects. The TCSP program assists in integrating transportation, community, and system preservation plans, with funding authorized for projects. The TCSP program aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans by funding projects to improve transportation efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and encourage compatible private sector development patterns. Eligible recipients include state, tribal, regional, and local governments, with a total funding authorization of $270 million over six years. The Transportation, Community, and System Preservation (TCSP) program received increased funding under SAFETEA, with $61.25 million authorized for FY2005 and FY2006-FY2009. This is more than TEA-21's authorization but less than the total appropriations during TEA-21's lifespan. Competitive grants were awarded in FY1999, with earmarked projects in subsequent years. SAFETEA continues to fund bicycle and pedestrian programs for non-motorized trips and safety initiatives. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program provides funding for bicycle and pedestrian programs, safety, health, and education initiatives. States can allocate TE funds for facilities, safety activities, and preservation of railway corridors for pedestrian or bicycle trails. Between FY1992 and FY2004, 55% of TE funds were used for these activities, with 46.3% allocated to pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The Safe Routes to School Program under SAFETEA aims to promote walking and biking to school for children, encouraging a healthy lifestyle. It will receive $612 million in funding from FY2004-FY2009, apportioned among states based on total student population. The Safe Routes to School Program will receive $612 million in funding from FY2004-FY2009, apportioned among states based on student enrollment. Each state will receive a minimum of $1 million per year, with the federal government covering 100% of project costs. Funds will remain available until expended, and eligible agencies include state, local, and regional entities. The Safe Routes to School Program will receive $612 million in funding from FY2004-FY2009, apportioned among states based on student enrollment. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional entities, as well as nonprofit organizations. Funds can be used for infrastructure-related projects to improve walking and biking to school, such as sidewalk improvements, traffic calming, bicycle facilities, pedestrian crossings, and secure bike parking. States can also use funds for noninfrastructure activities to encourage safe routes to school. The Safe Routes to School Program allows funds for infrastructure projects like sidewalk improvements and traffic calming, as well as noninfrastructure activities to promote walking and biking to school. States must allocate 10-30% of funds for noninfrastructure activities, including public awareness campaigns and traffic education. Each state must fund a full-time coordinator for their safe routes to school program. The Secretary is required to fund a full-time coordinator for the state's safe route to school program, make grants to a national nonprofit organization for a safe routes to school clearinghouse, and establish a task force to study and develop a strategy for advancing safe routes to school programs nationwide. Funding for the clearinghouse would come from the Secretary's administrative expenses. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed funding for transit for the five-year authorization period. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed funding for transit for the five-year authorization period (FY2005-FY2009), with a total of $52.6 billion over six years. Congress shifted funding shares within the transit program, with a decrease in funding for Urbanized Area Formula Program and an increase for Non-Urbanized Formula Program. Funding distribution also changed among states, with a decrease for larger states and an increase for smaller states. The SAFETEA act made minor changes to the federal transit program, adding new programs, creating new funding categories, and making changes to existing programs. It also included provisions such as requiring federal agencies in the National Capital Region to offer transit passes as a fringe benefit and earmarks for the Bus and Bus Facilities Program. The SAFETEA act included provisions for the Bus and Bus Facilities Program, providing $1.7 billion in additional funding over FY2006-FY2009. Funds are apportioned based on population forecasts and population densities to increase transportation availability. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program under the SAFETEA act distributes funding to urbanized areas with population densities over 370 persons per mile to improve transportation services for persons with disabilities. It is authorized at $339 million over FY2006-FY2009 and is exempt from certain labor protection provisions. Additionally, a discretionary grant program aims to provide transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands, with a total authorization of $97 million and exemptions from labor protection provisions. A new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program provides additional funding for small urbanized areas with populations under 200,000 that offer comparable transit service to larger urbanized areas. This program addresses issues faced by smaller urbanized areas and measures transit service based on various criteria. The Urbanized Area Formula Program addresses issues faced by smaller urbanized areas with populations under 200,000 by providing additional funding based on transit service criteria. This program was created in response to the lack of performance factors in the formula for smaller urbanized areas, leading to disparities in funding for areas providing higher levels of transit service. DOT's study under Section 3033 of TEA-21 identified the need for changes in the Urbanized Areas Formula Program. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program is being revised to reward transit-intensive areas. Approximately 1% of funding will shift from urbanized areas over 200,000 in population to those under 200,000. A new category within the New Starts program will streamline evaluation for projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding. This program is authorized at $200 million annually for FY2007-FY2009. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program is being revised to reward transit-intensive areas, with funding shifting to areas under 200,000 in population. A new category within the New Starts program streamlines evaluation for projects seeking $75 million or more in federal funding. $45 million is allocated for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on reservations. 20% of the Non-Urbanized Area Formula program funding will be apportioned based on a state's non-urbanized land area. The act authorizes $90 million for magnetic levitation train deployment for FY2005-FY2009. The act authorizes $90 million for magnetic levitation train deployment for FY2005-FY2009, with 50% allocated for a project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and 50% for a project east of the Mississippi River. The program is intended to be administered as a new program, not a continuation of any previous program. The act reauthorizes the Swift Rail Act, expanding eligible expenses for high-speed rail development. It authorizes funding for corridor development and technology improvements, as well as grants for Alaska Railroad. Additional funds are allocated for the elimination of rail-highway grade crossing hazards. The SAFETEA act authorizes grants for high-speed rail development, corridor improvements, and Alaska Railroad. It also mandates the review of rail joint bar inspection data and the improvement of crack identification in rail joint bars. Additionally, it requires the development of design standards for pressurized tank cars to reduce the risk of catastrophic fractures. The SAFETEA act authorizes grants for high-speed rail development, corridor improvements, and Alaska Railroad. It mandates the review of rail joint bar inspection data and the improvement of crack identification in rail joint bars. Additionally, it requires the development of design standards for pressurized tank cars to reduce the risk of catastrophic fractures. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) is a new categorical grant program for highway safety under SAFETEA, replacing the existing roadway hazard elimination program. This program funded projects like installing barriers and guard rails. Under TEA-21, the Section 152 program and the Section 130 program focused on hazard elimination at rail-highway grade crossings and infrastructure hazards, funded through a 10% set-aside from the Surface Transportation Program. The new HSIP Program, authorized under the SAFETEA act, allocates funding for hazard elimination on highways. States must spend a minimum amount annually, with set-asides for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination. Funding is apportioned based on lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities on federal-aid highways. The HSIP Program, authorized under the SAFETEA act, allocates funding for hazard elimination on highways. States must spend a minimum amount annually, with set-asides for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination and projects on high-risk rural roads. States are required to prepare a strategic highway safety plan. The overall program authorization is $1.2 billion in FY2006, rising to $1.3 billion by FY2009. Additionally, a new Safe Routes to Schools program is created to fund infrastructure projects that increase the safety of children. The Safe Routes to Schools program, created under the SAFETEA act, funds infrastructure projects to increase children's safety within two miles of schools. Funding is based on student enrollment, with a minimum of $1 million for each state. At least 10% of funds are allocated for non-infrastructure projects. The program is authorized at $54 million in FY2005, increasing to $183 million in FY2009. Additionally, a grant program is established to promote seat belt use, with states enacting primary seat belt laws eligible for grants. The grant program promotes seat belt use by offering grants to states with primary seat belt laws or achieving a seat belt use rate of 85% for two years. The funds can be used for highway safety purposes, with a federal share of 100%. The program is authorized at $125 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 and also includes grants to reduce alcohol-impaired driving. States must meet certain criteria or carry out specified programs to receive these grants. For FY2006, states must carry out 3 specified programs, increasing to 4 for FY2007 and 5 for FY2008 and FY2009. Programs include checkpoints, prosecution, blood alcohol testing, harsher penalties for high BAC levels, rehabilitation programs, prevention strategies for underage drinking, license revocation, and fines reinvestment for DUI cases. The program includes grants for preventing impaired driving, returning fines to communities, and funding various related programs. Up to 15% of funds are set aside for states with high rates of impaired driving fatalities. Total authorization is $555 million. Other new programs include a motorcyclist safety grant program and an incentive grant program for child restraints. The program includes grants for preventing impaired driving, returning fines to communities, and funding various related programs. Up to 15% of funds are set aside for states with high rates of impaired driving fatalities. Total authorization is $555 million. Other new programs include a motorcyclist safety grant program and an incentive grant program for child restraints. The act also directs DOT to establish standards to reduce vehicle rollover crashes, increase roof strength, and enhance passenger motor vehicle occupant protection in side impact crashes through the use of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) enable traffic management centers to receive real-time video and data on traffic flow, incidents, and weather conditions to improve performance and safety. Federal investment in ITS during TEA-21 totaled $230 million annually, with $100 million for research and $120 million for deployment. SAFETEA provides $110 million yearly for ITS research. The ITS deployment program ended in FY2005, with ITS project costs now eligible in core highway programs. The ITS deployment program was terminated after FY2005, with project costs now eligible in core highway programs. The federal role in research and development aims to address challenges like congestion, security, and infrastructure rehabilitation. The federal role in research and development aims to address challenges like congestion, security, and infrastructure rehabilitation in the surface transportation arena. The FHWA administers a comprehensive program involving all aspects of the highway system, with an annual budget of roughly $295 million authorized under SAFETEA. Title V of SAFETEA authorizes increased funding for transportation research and education, including $169.4 million for surface transportation research, $26.7 million for training and education, $27 million for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and $69.7 million for the University Transportation Research Program. These funds are used to advance technologies for highway improvement and safety, with specific allocations for various research projects and institutions. Title IX of SAFETEA, \"Rail Transportation,\" focuses on infrastructure capacity, rail-to-rail competition, and grade crossing conflicts in freight rail transportation. Congress is evaluating the ability of freight railroads to expand their infrastructure capacity to handle increasing trade volumes and highway congestion. Freight railroads primarily finance their infrastructure needs without government aid. The federal government is considering assisting freight railroads in expanding their networks due to increased train traffic causing delays for motor vehicles. Despite reducing the total number of railway miles, railroads are intensifying the use of their remaining tracks for operational efficiency. Congressional concerns also include the captive shipper question since the deregulation of the rail industry in 1980. The captive shipper question arises from the price deregulation of the rail industry in 1980. Concerns include high rail rates and poor service for shippers served by only one railroad. Congress debates these issues in stand-alone legislation and SAFETEA, with a focus on rail system performance, rates, demand, and public policy effectiveness. Funding mechanisms in SAFETEA aim to address these concerns. SAFETEA expands federal loan program for rail track rehabilitation and improvement. RRIF Program increases from $3.5 billion to $35 billion, with $7 billion reserved for smaller railroads. Loan availability is expedited, and collateral requirement is removed. Secretary of Transportation must approve or disapprove loans promptly. SAFETEA expands federal loan program for rail track rehabilitation and improvement, increasing RRIF Program to $35 billion with $7 billion for smaller railroads. Loans can be approved within 90 days without collateral requirement. Section 9003 allows loans for rail connections between plants and second rail carriers. SAFETEA also introduces a federal grants program for relocating or grade separating rail tracks to improve motor vehicle traffic flow in communities. SAFETEA introduces a federal grants program for relocating rail track or grade separating rail track to improve community traffic flow, quality of life, and economic development. The program authorizes $350 million annually from 2006 to 2009, with grants not exceeding $20 million each and federal share capped at 90% of project cost. Additionally, SAFETEA funds rail infrastructure capacity enhancement and grade crossing elimination projects through earmarks, including $90 million for a Virginia-Ohio rail line, $100 million for a New York harbor rail tunnel, $100 million for Chicago rail connections, and $125 million for grade crossing elimination on a rail line. SAFETEA authorizes federal grants for rail track relocation and grade crossing elimination projects, with earmarks including $100 million for a New York harbor rail tunnel, $100 million for Chicago rail connections, $125 million for grade crossing elimination east of Los Angeles, $14 million for El Paso rail yards relocation study, and $15 million for Port of Portsmouth rail line connection relocation. DOT is directed to conduct a comprehensive study on the nation's rail transportation system post-deregulation in 1980. SAFETEA creates a new grant program for improving freight mobility around U.S. ports and intermodal facilities. It designates six projects in various states to carry out the program. Additionally, SAFETEA continues the Recreational Trails Program to help states develop and maintain recreational trails for various uses. The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) provides funds for various recreational trail uses, including hiking, biking, horseback riding, and off-road vehicle activities. SAFETEA authorizes $370 million in contract authority for the RTP for FY2005-2009, with $840,000 allocated annually for administrative expenses. Funds are distributed to states based on a legislative formula. The RTP under SAFETEA authorizes $370 million for FY2005-2009, with $840,000 allocated annually for administrative expenses. Funds are distributed to states based on a legislative formula, with 50% equally among all eligible states and 50% in proportion to off-road recreational fuel use. States must allocate 30% of funds for motorized trail uses, 30% for non-motorized trail uses, and 40% for diverse trail uses. SAFETEA eliminates the discretionary waiver for motorized and nonmotorized projects but retains the small state exemption for states with less than 3.5 million acres. SAFETEA amends the federal-aid highway program to change the federal share for RTP projects and encourages states to use youth conservation corps. It expands permissible uses for RTP funding, including trail safety and training, with a limit of 5% of the state's apportionment. A new provision allows funding for trail condition assessment. SAFETEA expands permissible uses for RTP funding, including trail safety and training, with a limit of 5% of the state's apportionment. A new provision permits funding for trail condition assessment for accessibility and maintenance. Before final design, property acquisition, or construction on a highway or transit project can proceed, DOT must comply with certain environmental review requirements, including those of NEPA. NEPA requires DOT to consider environmental impacts of federally funded actions by preparing an EIS for significant effects on the human environment. Projects with unclear impacts start with an EA, and if impacts are significant, an EIS is needed. Projects with no significant impact are processed as categorical exclusions. The NEPA process includes compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966, which applies to the use of parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites for transportation projects. Concerns have been raised about the inefficiency of environmental reviews for large highway and transit projects. The Environmental Streamlining provisions in TEA-21 aim to expedite the environmental review process for large transportation projects while protecting the environment. Improved interagency cooperation is crucial for the success of this streamlined approach. The streamlining provisions of TEA-21 required the Department of Transportation to develop a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impact. SAFETEA includes provisions to further expedite this process, focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. SAFETEA includes provisions to streamline the environmental review process, primarily focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. The term \"streamlining\" is not used in SAFETEA, but the goal remains the same - to expedite compliance with environmental requirements. Many provisions in SAFETEA codify existing regulatory requirements related to NEPA, such as designating DOT as the lead agency for transportation projects and specifying roles of lead and cooperating agencies. SAFETEA provisions aim to streamline the environmental review process by designating DOT as the lead agency for transportation projects, establishing procedures for collaborative development of project statements, and setting deadlines for decision-making. Key changes include the creation of a \"participating agency\" in the NEPA process, a 180-day statute of limitations on judicial claims, and authorization for the use of certain environmental requirements. The SAFETEA provisions aim to streamline the environmental review process for transportation projects by setting deadlines, establishing a dispute resolution process, allowing the use of transportation funds for expedited reviews, and authorizing state pilot programs for compliance with environmental laws. Additionally, under Section 4(f), publicly owned parks and recreation areas can be used if impacts are deemed minimal. The SAFETEA provisions allow for the use of publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites with minimal impacts, requiring concurrence from relevant authorities. DOT is mandated to issue regulations clarifying factors for determining prudent and feasible alternatives under Section 4(f) requirements. The SAFETEA provisions allow for the use of publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites with minimal impacts under Section 4(f) requirements. \u00a76007 of SAFETEA specifies that the Interstate System cannot be considered a \"historic site\" under Section 4(f) provisions. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 directed the establishment of the CMAQ Program to reduce emissions from highway travel to comply with NAAQS. The CMAQ Program aims to reduce emissions from highway travel to help states meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). It funds projects like transportation control measures, auto emission control programs, alternative fuel vehicles, traffic improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. Funding is allocated based on a state's population and pollution reduction needs, with a focus on areas not meeting NAAQS for ozone and/or CO. The CMAQ Program aims to reduce emissions from highway travel to help states meet NAAQS for ozone and/or CO. States with no maintenance or nonattainment areas are guaranteed a minimum apportionment of CMAQ funds. TEA-21 expanded the program to include projects for reducing particulate matter. CMAQ funding for FY2005-FY2009 totals $8.6 billion, with SAFETEA amending the apportionment formula and program requirements. SAFETEA amends the CMAQ program by expanding funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation system management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. It also changes requirements for states receiving minimum apportionment and directs evaluation of CMAQ projects' impacts on air quality and congestion. Under SAFETEA, DOT is directed to evaluate CMAQ projects' impacts on air quality and congestion levels. A database describing project impacts is to be maintained and disseminated, with no direct funding provided for the evaluation or the database. Areas not meeting air quality standards must develop State Implementation Plans. State Implementation Plans (SIPs) are required for areas not meeting air quality standards under the Clean Air Act. Federal agencies cannot fund projects in these areas unless they conform to the SIPs, ensuring they do not worsen air quality or delay attainment of standards. Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) must demonstrate conformity every two years to receive federal funds for highway and transit projects. The conformity of Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs) must be demonstrated every two years to receive federal funds for highway and transit projects. Recent court decisions and stricter air quality standards will make it harder for areas to show conformity, potentially leading to a temporary suspension of funds in metropolitan areas. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers of conformity, and only a one-year grace period is permitted after an area is designated as nonattainment. Limited exempt projects are mostly safety-related or for replacement and repair. The Clean Air Act allows only a one-year grace period after an area is designated as nonattainment. Limited exempt projects, mostly safety-related or for replacement and repair, can be funded in lapsed areas. However, new projects that might reduce emissions, such as new transit lines, are not allowed. Concerns have been raised about the mismatch between the SIP, TIP, and long-range transportation planning cycles, with calls for less frequent but better-coordinated conformity demonstrations. The GAO recommended extending the three-year time frame between required transportation plan updates and amending the Clean Air Act to align conformity rules. This recommendation was generally supported by transportation planners and highway builders. The Clean Air Act was amended to require less frequent conformity demonstrations, shorten the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases, and establish a 12-month grace period after a failure to demonstrate conformity. This change was supported by transportation planners and highway builders but opposed by environmental groups and air quality planning officials. The Clean Air Act was amended to require less frequent conformity demonstrations, shorten the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases, and establish a 12-month grace period after a failure to demonstrate conformity. If a lapse occurs, a declaration would be made. (For more details, refer to CRS Report RL32106, Transportation Conformity Under the Clean Air Act: In Need of Reform? by [author name scrubbed].)
