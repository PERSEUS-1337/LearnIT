    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that type 2 diabetes affects millions of Americans, costing billions annually. Diabetic retinopathy, a common complication, leads to blindness in many diabetics. The risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes, especially as onset occurs at younger ages. Clinical trials have shown the importance of early detection. Early detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy can reduce vision loss by 90 percent, with remote assessment having the potential to reach diabetic patients in underserved areas. Medicare coverage is expanded to include remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, aiming to improve early detection and treatment for diabetic patients in underserved areas. The term 'remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy' refers to a diagnostic examination of the retina for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, provided annually to individuals with diabetes. The examination must meet technical standards set by the Secretary and be conducted via a telecommunications system by qualified healthcare professionals. The Act allows for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy to be provided to eligible patients through store-and-forward technologies, despite the physician not being in the same location as the patient. This provision is applicable for asynchronous transmission of healthcare information in various formats. Additionally, interim payments will be made until the final rule is published by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. During the period after the enactment of the Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide payment for retinopathy assessments and assign temporary HCPCS codes. A study will be conducted on the costs incurred by healthcare providers for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy services, including per-patient and start-up/administrative costs. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the study conducted on the costs of remote assessments for diabetic retinopathy, including per-patient and start-up/administrative costs. Recommendations will be made on reimbursements under the Medicare program and the need for repeating the study. The amendments will apply to assessments performed 30 days after the enactment of the Act. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, with amendments to the Social Security Act specifying the effective date and state compliance requirements. The Social Security Act requires states to comply with new diabetic retinopathy assessment rules by the first day of the first calendar quarter after the state legislature's session following the Act's enactment. If a state has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate session. SEC. 5. MOBILE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish a pilot program for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening. The Secretary will establish a grant program called the \"Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program\" to provide grants to 5 eligible entities for setting up mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Grants cannot exceed $1,000,000 per year, and entities must use the funds for designing, demonstrating, and implementing the screening program. Applications must be submitted within 90 days of funds becoming available. The Secretary will prioritize applicants with experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment for grants under the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program. Applications must be submitted with specified information within 90 days of funds becoming available. The Secretary will prioritize applicants with experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment for grants under the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program. Applicants must propose to serve rural, impoverished, minority, and remote populations. Congressional notification is required before making a grant. An advisory committee will evaluate the program within 3 years of the first grant. The advisory committee will evaluate the effectiveness of the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program in increasing early detection of diabetic retinopathy and decreasing its prevalence and severity. They will also assess if the program can be a model for similar screening programs for other chronic conditions. A report is due within 42 months of the first grant. The advisory committee will evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program's effectiveness in detecting diabetic retinopathy early and reducing its prevalence. A report must be submitted to Congress within 42 months of the first grant. Eligible entities include hospitals, states, educational institutions, local governments, tribal governments, nonprofit health organizations, and community health centers. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program is defined as a program that offers remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy primarily in rural, underserved, and remote areas. It is mobile and established under this section. Eligible entities for the program include hospitals, states, educational institutions, local governments, tribal governments, nonprofit health organizations, and community health centers. The Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program is established under this section with an authorization of appropriations of $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009."
