    "content": "The United States ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, calling for reducing greenhouse gases by 2000. Various actions have been proposed, but carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, which aimed for emissions reductions. The Administration has since focused on U.S. climate change policy. The Administration under President George W. Bush rejected mandatory emissions reductions and focused on voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 2002 Climate Action Report highlighted mostly voluntary programs with only a few regulatory ones aimed at achieving energy or environmental goals. Congressional proposals have been made to advance climate change policies. In the 109th Congress, congressional proposals have been introduced to address climate change by improving monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions, enacting market-oriented reduction programs, and implementing energy programs to reduce greenhouse gases. These proposals aim to incorporate climate change effects into decision-making processes for new rules and regulations. The report focuses on comparing two proposals from Senators McCain and Lieberman in the Senate's debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The proposals aim to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through market-based mechanisms and encourage innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies. The bill, similar to previous amendments, aims to reduce carbon emissions through market-based strategies. It requires economy-wide reductions but allows participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs. Residential and agricultural sources are excluded, along with entities emitting less than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. The draft amendment, based on the report of the National Commission on Energy Policy, mandates an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of the economy. It requires a 2.4% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP between 2010 and 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually after 2019. Implementation would be through a market-oriented allowance trading program. The draft amendment proposes an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of the economy, with a 2.8% annual reduction after 2019. It includes a cost-limiting safety valve for covered entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions. The amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity rather than placing an absolute cap on emissions. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by implementing a 2.8% annual reduction after 2019. It includes a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" for covered entities to purchase tradeable allowances or make payments to DOE. This approach differs from S. 1151, which would place an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities. If economic growth outpaces reductions in emissions intensity, overall U.S. emissions could continue to grow under the draft amendment. The draft amendment proposes a 2.8% annual reduction in greenhouse gas intensity after 2019, with a \"safety valve\" allowing covered entities to purchase tradeable allowances or make payments to DOE. Contrasting S. 1151, which sets an absolute cap on emissions, the draft amendment lacks a price limit per allowance and differs in covered entities, agency responsibility, credit generation, and allowance proceeds utilization. Emission reduction estimates for both options have uncertainties, especially for the draft amendment. The estimates provided in Table 2 for both S. 1151 and the draft amendment involve uncertainty. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) analyzed S. 1151 in 2004, predicting a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. However, CRS estimated a 2.5% reduction for the draft amendment. Long-term reductions were not estimated due to uncertainty, but it is likely that greenhouse gas emissions would continue to increase under both options. Emissions of greenhouse gases would likely continue to increase under both options, albeit more slowly than business-as-usual. In the case of S. 1151, the percentage of greenhouse gases not covered by the bill would increase over time. Under the draft amendment, covered emissions would grow if economic growth outpaced the reduction in carbon intensity, potentially leading to faster emissions rise than under S. 1151. Under the draft amendment, emissions could potentially rise faster than under S. 1151. Projected emissions data is provided for both options, with uncertainties discussed. Based on projected GDP and carbon intensity improvements by Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy Outlook 2005, DOE/EIA-0383(2005), February 2005, the draft amendment's estimated emission reductions are more uncertain than under S. 1151. The primary source of uncertainty for S. 1151 is the number of covered entities, with estimates ranging from 75% to 85% coverage. Higher coverage means more reductions but lower compliance costs, while lower coverage means greater uncertainty about quantity. The draft amendment has uncertainties regarding emissions reductions, with a future baseline calculated from projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. Economic growth projections range from 2.5% to 3.6% annually, with a reference case at 3.1% annually. The estimate could be off by 20% or more, and the carbon intensity improvement projection is also uncertain. The draft amendment raises uncertainties about emissions reductions, with projections for 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. The estimate for GDP growth could be off by 20% or more, and the carbon intensity improvement projection is also uncertain. The targeted 2009 carbon intensity is in the range of 159 MMTCE/M$GDP, lower than current levels. There are questions about the coverage of the draft amendment, with potentially entities not covered. The final uncertainty is the safety of emissions reductions achieved under the draft amendment. The draft amendment raises uncertainties about emissions reductions, with projections for 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. There are potentially entities not covered under the draft amendment, adding uncertainty to the emission reductions achieved. The safety valve is another source of uncertainty, with conflicting projections on when it would be triggered. The projected cost under the draft amendment is more uncertain than under S. 1151, due to uncertainties in future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. The uncertainty surrounding S. 1151 is mainly due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. The firm cap on emissions set in 2000 would require offsetting any increased emissions from economic growth. The cost estimates for S. 1151 are also uncertain, with varying projections on permit prices based on different assumptions. The cost estimates for S. 1151 range from $9 to $15 a ton, showing sensitivity and uncertainty. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive and require fewer emission reductions. Economic growth is incorporated into the draft amendment's emissions limitation target. The draft amendment requires fewer emission reductions than S. 1151 and incorporates economic growth into its emissions limitation target, allowing for some increase in future emissions. This results in lower costs compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive and do not include international credits in its flexible market implementation program. The draft amendment's safety valve limits potential costs to $4.8 - $5.9 a ton in 2001 dollars, narrowing cost uncertainties. It aims to cap costs of climate change control programs while allowing for some emissions increase. Market-based mechanisms focus on reducing CO2 emissions. The safety valve in the draft amendment limits costs of climate change control programs to $4.8 - $5.9 a ton in 2001 dollars, aiming to cap costs while allowing for emissions increase. Market-based mechanisms focus on reducing CO2 emissions by setting acceptable levels or compliance costs and letting the marketplace determine the economically efficient solution. This can be done through tradeable permit programs or a carbon tax, with the preference depending on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved. The preference for a pure tradeable permit system or inclusion of a safety valve depends on how one views the uncertainty of costs involved and benefits to be received. A pure tradeable permit program may be most appropriate for those confident that achieving a specific level of CO2 reduction will yield significant benefits. Through trading permits, emission reduction efforts concentrate at sources where controls can be achieved at least cost. Including a safety valve in a CO2 reduction scheme can cap control costs but may lead to uncertain emission reductions. The safety valve acts as a contingent carbon tax, raising the question of whether economic costs or emission reductions are of greater concern. The draft amendment proposes a market-based system to limit greenhouse gas emissions, leaning towards a price-based approach compared to S. 1151 which focuses on setting an absolute cap on emissions. The draft amendment aims to establish a cost-limiting safety valve for emissions intensity control. The draft amendment proposes a market-based system to limit greenhouse gas emissions, with a cost-limiting safety valve. Short-term U.S. emissions would likely be below business-as-usual, with larger reductions compared to S. 1151. Total U.S. emissions are expected to continue increasing, but at a slower rate."
