    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Education Act of 2007\". The Congress finds that pulmonary hypertension is a serious and often fatal condition where blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerously high levels. The walls of the arteries thickens and constricts, causing the right side of the heart to pump harder, leading to enlargement and potential failure. Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment, and collaboration among research centers should be increased. Pulmonary hypertension is difficult to diagnose and is rarely detected in routine medical examinations. In advanced stages, pulmonary hypertension limits activity and causes symptoms even at rest, leading to disability. The disease can progress to complete bedridden state. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first pulmonary hypertension patient registry in 1981. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first pulmonary hypertension patient registry in 1981, following 194 patients over at least one year. Research is focusing on immunologic and genetic factors in the cause and progression of the illness, as well as treatments for pulmonary hypertension. The number of physicians treating pulmonary hypertension and patients receiving treatment has significantly increased over the past decade, leading to a growing need for medical professionals' education. There are currently six FDA-approved medications for pulmonary hypertension, with more in trials, but not all are effective for all patients. Lung transplantation is often a last-resort treatment for this condition. In 2001, there were 100 physicians treating pulmonary hypertension and 3,000 patients receiving treatment. By 2006, the number of physicians increased to 3,000, treating 30,000 patients. Despite the availability of oral therapies, managing pulmonary hypertension remains complex. Educating medical professionals on this condition is crucial for optimal patient care. In December 2006, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute hosted a significant meeting of pulmonary hypertension researchers and clinicians worldwide. During a meeting hosted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, over 500 researchers and clinicians gathered to discuss the importance of communication in advancing the fight against pulmonary hypertension. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a section on pulmonary hypertension research and training. The Director of the Institute will establish a Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network to conduct trials on new treatments for pulmonary hypertension. The network will consist of at least 15 clinical centers designated by the Director. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network will include 15 clinical centers, an institute project scientist, a data and coordinating center, a data and safety monitoring board, a steering committee, and an independent protocol review committee. The steering committee in the Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network determines specific clinical trials, establishes subject selection standards, develops trial protocols, and analyzes results. Clinical trials may include combination therapies and new drug therapy approaches for pulmonary hypertension. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network focuses on new drug therapy avenues, use of endothelial progenitor cells, and predictive treatment effects for long-term outcomes. The Institute manages and supports the network, with a project scientist monitoring subject recruitment. The project scientist appointed under paragraph (1)(B) is responsible for monitoring subject recruitment, ensuring disclosure of conflicts of interest, and conducting fiscal management of the network with the assistance of an institute grants management specialist. The Director appoints members to assist in fiscal management of the network and carries out a grant program for a pulmonary hypertension training program. A national nonprofit entity will establish a Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program to educate medical professionals in clinical settings. The program aims to increase the number of physicians trained to diagnose, treat, and manage pulmonary hypertension in the United States. The Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program will establish regional training sites across the United States at academic health centers, hospitals, or private medical practices. Each site will have a designated contact and receive a stipend from grant funds. Participant recruitment and program guidelines will be specified by the Director. The nonprofit entity awarded the grant will establish mechanisms for recruiting health professionals and enrolling them in the program. Model guidelines for the program will be developed in collaboration with regional training sites and the Institute. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. Increasing public awareness of pulmonary hypertension. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share information on pulmonary hypertension, including basic information, incidence, diseases related to it, early diagnosis importance, and treatment options. This information will be disseminated through a national non-profit entity with expertise in pulmonary hypertension. Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension through a national non-profit entity with expertise in the field. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 to support this initiative. The government will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension through a national non-profit entity with expertise in the field. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension to healthcare providers, including warning signs, early diagnosis importance, diagnostic criteria, and FDA-approved therapies. This aims to keep providers informed about the disease. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension to healthcare providers through a national non-profit entity with expertise in the field. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards for individuals with pulmonary hypertension, detailing coverage for FDA-approved therapies. The study will consider outpatient or home health care settings. A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment."
