    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and has caused a large outbreak in West Africa, with nearly 10,000 cases and almost 5,000 deaths reported as of late October. As of late October, nearly 10,000 people have contracted Ebola virus disease (EVD), with almost 5,000 deaths reported. WHO estimates actual cases may be higher due to weak surveillance systems in neighboring countries. Mali reported its first EVD case on October 23, prompting WHO to send a team for assistance. Efforts are underway to develop drugs for prevention and treatment, with plans to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers in January. In October, WHO planned to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers. Treatment might be available in Liberia by early November. Health practitioners provide supportive care for EVD symptoms to reduce fatality rate. Disease spread can be limited through surveillance and containment measures outlined in WHO manuals. Previous Ebola outbreaks were successfully contained. The Ebola virus in West Africa is not new, but the disease is spreading quickly due to weak health systems. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is spreading quickly due to weak health systems, leading to simultaneous multi-country outbreaks. The disease has spread from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to other countries, but efforts in Senegal and Nigeria have successfully halted the spread through contact tracing and containment measures. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has spread to other countries, but contact tracing and containment measures have stopped the spread in Senegal and Nigeria. In Nigeria, an imported case led to an outbreak infecting 20 people and killing eight, while in Senegal, a single imported case was contained. WHO is investigating a new case in Mali. Health workers in the United States and Spain contracted EVD while caring for patients, but no additional cases have been reported. Previous outbreaks were in rural areas, but the current outbreak is spreading in both rural and urban settings. The current Ebola outbreak is spreading rapidly in rural and urban areas with limited access to clean water and healthcare. Cases are doubling every 15-40 days in affected countries. A separate Ebola outbreak in the DRC started in late July after a woman contracted the virus from a wild animal. In late July or early August 2014, a woman in the DRC contracted an EVD-like hemorrhagic fever after butchering a wild animal, leading to 66 cases and 49 deaths. Congressional actions have been accelerating to address the outbreak, with $88 million allocated for the Ebola response. Congress allocated $88 million for the Ebola response, with $30 million for CDC activities in West Africa and $58 million for research and development of treatments and vaccines. The Department of Defense was authorized to reprogram $750 million for building Ebola treatment units in Liberia. The health systems in affected countries were already weak and overwhelmed by the crisis. The health systems in the affected countries were weak before the Ebola outbreak and have been further overwhelmed by the crisis. WHO identifies six components of a health system, all of which are deficient in the affected countries. This has enabled the virus to continue spreading, leading to perceptions of government ineptitude and mistrust among civilians. Attacks on health workers and facilities persist, prompting the use of armed forces by the affected governments. Reports of attacks on health workers and facilities persist in the affected countries, leading to the use of armed forces to enforce disease control measures and quarantine neighborhoods. Some governments have faced criticism for their quarantine practices due to concerns about human rights, food scarcity, and unrest. Despite this, Liberia and Sierra Leone have stopped quarantining some neighborhoods following protests. Per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is relatively low, contributing to poor healthcare conditions. Financial aid from donors, including the United States, is being offered to Liberia to support payment of health workers' salaries and other incentives amid the Ebola outbreak. Health workers in the affected countries face delays in compensation and benefits, leading to absenteeism and worker shortages. Ebola treatment unit staff in Liberia have reportedly gone unpaid for three months. The outbreak-affected countries lack sufficient financial resources to fund their national Ebola response plans. Several donors have pledged financial support to outbreak-affected countries like Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to address health needs and secondary effects of the Ebola outbreak. The United Nations estimates it will cost Guinea $194 million, Liberia $473 million, and Sierra Leone $220 million to combat the outbreak. Severe shortages of health workers and clinics in Liberia result in many infected individuals lacking access to medical care. Similar challenges exist in Sierra Leone and Guinea, where human resource constraints and inadequate health facilities prompt people to care for the ill on their own. The shortage of medics and health facilities in Sierra Leone and Guinea is leading to people caring for the ill on their own, which is facilitating the spread of the virus. This lack of access to Ebola care is also impacting broader health issues, particularly maternal and child health, as maternal and child mortality rates were already high in the affected countries before the outbreak. In 2012, 46,000 women died from pregnancy-related complications, with nearly 1 million children dying before their fifth birthday in sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these deaths could have been prevented with access to vaccines, clean water, and nutrition. Pregnant women are avoiding health facilities due to fear of contracting EVD, leading to clinic closures and limited medical attention during labor. The shortage of health workers in affected countries is contributing to high maternal and child mortality rates. High maternal and child mortality rates in Ebola-affected countries are linked to the lack of health workers. Sierra Leone had only two doctors per 100,000 people between 2006 and 2013. Liberia had fewer than 200 doctors before the outbreak, with only about 50 remaining afterwards. Ebola control requires labor- and resource-intensive measures due to staffing shortages and deaths among health workers. The Ebola outbreak in affected countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone has led to severe shortages of healthcare workers. WHO estimates that a facility treating 70 Ebola patients needs at least 250 healthcare workers. The affected countries require over 13,000 health workers for various tasks, with only 5% coming from foreign countries. The outbreak has worsened healthcare options, with many facilities closed even before the crisis. Countries are deploying medical personnel to the region to help combat the spread of Ebola. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone has severely diminished healthcare options in the affected countries. Many health facilities are closed, and access to clinics was already limited. Ebola treatment centers are concentrated in high prevalence areas, leaving large portions of the population without access to healthcare. Delayed health-seeking practices are reducing survival prospects and hindering efforts to detect and contain the virus. Severe deficiencies in Ebola treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services are present in all affected countries. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone has severely diminished healthcare options in the affected countries. Severe deficiencies in Ebola treatment centers, laboratories, contact tracing, and safe burial services are present in all affected countries. Liberia faces the most severe treatment shortage, with only 23% of the needed beds available. Treatment capacity is expected to improve with U.S. plans to support the construction of 27 ETUs in the country. Health experts are investigating a recent reduction in people seeking Ebola care in Liberia, with plans to build 27 ETUs in the country. Safe disposal of dead bodies is improving, with 90% removed within 24 hours. EVD responders are working to adapt traditional funeral practices to prevent transmission. Inconsistent adherence to infection control protocol is contributing to EVD cases among health workers. A cluster of Ebola cases among healthcare workers in Liberia was linked to various transmission opportunities, including exposure to undetected Ebola patients, inadequate use of protective equipment, and potential transmission between ill workers. CDC Director Tom Frieden observed poor sanitation conditions in health facilities, with limited access to water and power outages. Ambulance services are lacking in rural areas, further complicating healthcare delivery. Power outages and water delivery interruptions are common in Sierra Leone, with limited ambulance services in both rural and urban areas. Shortages of protective gear among health workers are associated with Ebola cases, leading to the spread of the disease within health facilities. Limited supplies of protective equipment leave healthcare workers at risk of contracting and spreading Ebola and other infectious diseases. The Ebola outbreak has led to shortages of protective gear and supplies among health workers, increasing the risk of disease spread. Transportation of aid workers and supplies is hindered by poor road conditions and limited air service. Awareness about preventing Ebola has improved, but poverty and infrastructural deficiencies continue to pose challenges. Efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak are hindered by limited air service and weak laboratory and surveillance systems. Poverty and infrastructural deficiencies contribute to the challenges in preventing EVD infection, particularly in rural areas where hunger drives people to consume wild animals despite the risks. Health officials are expanding efforts to educate the public about the dangers of eating animals that may carry EVD. Limited laboratory capacity in Liberia has led to extensive diagnosis backlogs, hindering efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak. Uncertainty about the number of cases endangers health workers and other patients. International responses are accelerating, but the financial requirements for containment are rising as the outbreak spreads. WHO estimated it would take $4.8 million to contain the outbreak in March, but the cost and timeline for containment remain uncertain. The Ebola outbreak is spreading, with rising costs for containment. WHO estimated $4.8 million in March, but by August, it was estimated to cost $490 million. The outbreak has caused over 3,600 cases and 1,800 deaths. The United Nations established UNMEER in September to coordinate the international response. The United Nations Security Council urged member states to support the Ebola outbreak response plan, which requires $988 million. Donors have contributed $493 million and pledged an additional $279 million. In total, $894 million has been committed to addressing the outbreak. The UNOCHA estimates that $894 million has been committed for addressing the Ebola outbreak, with an additional $938 million pledged for preparedness needs. WHO is leading the response and has requested $490 million for building treatment centers, increasing diagnostic capacity, and attracting health workers. Since September, pledges to send health workers to the region have increased, with commitments from various countries including Cuba, the U.S., Britain, and China. The African Union and East African Community have also committed to sending health workers. Human resource constraints continue to hinder containment efforts in the region. The African Union and East African Community have committed to sending health workers to Liberia. The Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners developed the Community Care Campaign to target vulnerable households. Community care centers will be managed by NGOs, CHWs, and family members of EVD patients to complement Ebola Treatment Units. Sierra Leone is also establishing CCCs. The United States is the leading funder of the international Ebola response, with financial support continuing to rise. As of October 22, U.S. humanitarian funding for EVD responses totaled $344.6 million. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) reports that the Department of Defense (DOD) is planning to spend over $1 billion on containing the outbreak in West Africa. President Obama established an Ebola Czar to coordinate U.S. domestic and global responses to the outbreak, with a focus on four key goals. The U.S. Global Ebola strategy aims to control the outbreak, mitigate impacts, establish leadership, and advance health security. U.S. efforts focus on Liberia, with nearly 900 personnel in the region. Prior efforts to build capacity for disease outbreaks are implemented through USAID and CDC, with contributions from other departments. Since 2005, USAID has invested roughly $1 billion in pandemic preparedness efforts, including responses to Ebola outbreaks. The Emerging and Pandemic Threats program, operating in 18 countries in Africa and Asia, received $72.5 million in FY2014. Congressional funds for these initiatives have fluctuated between FY2005-FY2014. USAID has received funds from Congress for the Emerging and Pandemic Threats program since 2005. The program focuses on viral detection, risk determination, institutionalization of a \"one health\" approach, outbreak response capacity, and risk reduction in 18 countries in East and Central Africa and South and Southeast Asia. USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to West Africa for coordination. USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola outbreak. Between March and October 2014, USAID committed over $300 million for combating Ebola in West Africa, providing treatment beds, protective equipment, hygiene kits, and support for public awareness and disease prevention efforts. The Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, with support from USAID and CDC, are working to raise public awareness, train volunteers, and provide support for Ebola prevention and response efforts. CDC funds its global pandemic preparedness through various accounts, including the Global Disease Detection program. CDC has requested additional funding for FY2015 to support these activities. CDC has requested additional funding in FY2015 ($45 million) to support the Global Health Security Agenda and activities to detect, prevent, and respond to global infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries through various partnerships and expert deployments. CDC teams traveled to Guinea and Liberia in March 2014 to assist Health Ministries in controlling the Ebola outbreak, conducting contact tracing, and improving data management. CDC has committed over $16.7 million for Ebola responses, while DOD focused on researching treatments and vaccines. DOD announced a $22 million field hospital in Liberia for EVD cases among healthcare workers. On September 8, the DOD announced a $22 million field hospital in Liberia to treat EVD cases among healthcare workers. The hospital will be managed by 65 officers from the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. President Obama launched \"Operation United Assistance\" on September 16, deploying 4,000 military forces to support relief efforts, train health workers, and establish treatment centers in Liberia. The US is providing medical personnel to train up to 200 health workers weekly and establishing 12 treatment centers in Liberia with 100-bed capacity. The first 22-bed ETC is expected to be completed by the end of October. Over 700 US military personnel are in the region, operating three mobile medical labs for EVD testing. Congress has approved funding for Operation United Assistance and related activities, with total DOD funding for the global Ebola response expected to exceed $1 billion. The current Ebola outbreak has overwhelmed Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia's governments due to insufficient capacity for detection, treatment, and prevention. The current Ebola outbreak has overwhelmed Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia's governments due to insufficient capacity for detection, treatment, and prevention. Congress has approved funding for Operation United Assistance, with total DOD funding expected to exceed $1 billion. The Administration may request additional funds to contain the outbreak, as WHO estimated it would take 13,000 health workers to do so. The United States, WHO, and other groups are working to develop a Community Care Campaign in Liberia to address the human resource constraints in containing the Ebola outbreak. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about the campaign's potential to become \"contamination centers\" without proper infection control, supplies, staff training, supervision, patient diagnosis, and burial methods. WHO acknowledges the risk of virus transmission within the Community Care Campaign if implementation quality is deficient. WHO acknowledges the risk of virus transmission within the Community Care Campaign due to deficiencies in implementation quality, including inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols among health workers. Concerns arise about ensuring IPC protocols among trained personnel and lay caregivers, with WHO recommending only one family member provide care for each patient to prevent the spread of EVD. WHO recommends only one family member provide care for each patient in CCCs to prevent EVD spread. Compliance may be challenging due to cultural norms, loss of income, and emotional stress. The IPC protocol requires strict adherence to PPE guidelines for handling EVD patients, cleaning CCCs, and burying victims. Waste management deficiencies exist in affected countries, with limited access to sanitation facilities. Oversight and supervision are crucial for the success of the approach, especially for lay caregivers without medical training. The Community Care Campaign emphasizes the need for daily supervisory visits by trained health care workers to ensure compliance with IPC protocols and proper use of PPE. Poor supply chain management in health clinics leads to interruptions in medical supplies, including protective equipment, increasing the risk of EVD infection among health workers. The lack of protective equipment in ETUs and health clinics has been linked to EVD infection among health workers. WHO and partners aim to ensure a continuous supply of commodities to CCCs, advising a gradual approach. The US is implementing the Community Care Campaign, providing care kits in Liberia. The White House has provided 9,000 community care kits in Liberia for use at home. NGOs have autonomy over USAID grants, with oversight to ensure program targets are met. Concerns exist about U.S. government oversight of grantees managing CCCs and standardization of quality control. Critics question WHO leadership in the global Ebola response, citing budget cuts that have reduced effectiveness in outbreak containment. The 2014-2015 WHO program budget called for a 51% reduction in outbreak and crisis response activities. Budget cuts have crippled the agency, reducing critical staff and operational capacity. Critics argue that bureaucratic bloat and underqualified staff have hindered WHO's response. Weak health systems, inadequate capacity, and insufficient international responses have sparked debates on WHO's role. Analysts propose a \"Health Systems Fund\" administered by WHO for long-term development. Some analysts suggest establishing a WHO-administered \"Health Systems Fund\" to build long-term health system capacity and address crises like the Ebola outbreak. The spread of EVD in West Africa is due to weak health systems. Donors have struggled to address health emergencies amidst dysfunctional health systems, turning to disease-based funding in the early 2000s. Opponents argue that disease-specific programs worsen human resource shortages and weaken health systems by creating parallel bureaucracies. Supporters claim that disease-based funding enhances oversight and monitoring of investments. The debate intensified with the introduction of PEPFAR, which provided funding to non-governmental organizations to establish care facilities outside of government networks. While saving millions of lives, the U.S. became the primary supporter for at-risk populations worldwide. In the second phase of PEPFAR, increasing resources were used to support health systems. Now in its third phase, debate on the use of PEPFAR funds for building health systems has resumed. A 2013 GAO report noted that roughly 21% of PEPFAR funds were spent on capacity building projects. Health system advocates fear that budgetary reforms may imperil efforts. Health system advocates are concerned that budgetary reforms may jeopardize efforts to strengthen health systems. The U.S. Congress also faces a dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, as affected countries require focused support to contain it. However, without support for developing strong health systems, these countries may struggle to detect, prevent, or respond to future disease outbreaks. Ken Isaacs highlighted this issue during a congressional hearing on Ebola in August 2014. USAID has established an Ebola Health Systems Strengthening working group to support health care delivery and bolster health systems post-outbreak. Despite calls for greater investment in health systems, U.S.-funded programs lack specific appropriations for this purpose. The majority of health aid is directed towards specific diseases, leaving minimal resources for broader health system strengthening activities. The affected countries' inability to respond to health crises may prompt Congress to review global health fund appropriations. The ongoing Ebola outbreak has prompted various U.S. agencies to respond, with the Department of State leading diplomatic efforts, USAID coordinating responses, CDC managing public health activities, and DOD providing support to foreign armed forces. Each agency, except USAID, can use flexible authorities to fund their responses. The Department of State's coordination efforts do not require additional funding. The CDC and DOD can finance outbreak responses through existing channels without needing additional funding. USAID often receives specific directives from Congress on fund usage, limiting its ability to address unforeseen events like the Ebola outbreak without reallocating funds. USAID is reprogramming funds from ongoing health efforts to address the current Ebola outbreak, along with other outbreaks like H7N9 avian influenza and MERS-CoV. Supporters view the appropriation structure as a way to oversee health programs, while opponents argue it hinders agility in the field. Disease outbreaks are unpredictable, but with proper surveillance and response mechanisms, their impact can be minimized. USAID pandemic preparedness efforts are focused on East and Central Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and West Africa where Ebola has emerged. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is $50 million, 30% less than FY2014. Experts predict the outbreak can be contained by the end of January, but high death tolls are disrupting social structures. The Ebola outbreak may be contained by the end of January, but high death tolls are disrupting social structures and causing long-term effects in the region. MSF reports that affected villages in Sierra Leone have lost many adult community members, leaving vulnerable populations without resources. Concerns also arise about growing numbers of orphaned children, who are particularly vulnerable to marginalization. The outbreak is hindering the capacity of governments in West and Central Africa. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa is causing high death tolls, disrupting social structures, and leaving many orphaned children vulnerable. Experts are concerned about the impact on child and maternal mortality rates, as well as the hindrance to addressing other health issues in the region. The full health effects of the outbreak may not be known until it is contained, leading to potential debates over global health assistance funds allocation. Congress may face arguments from advocates for various health and development issues worsened by Ebola, including maternal and child mortality, poverty, food scarcity, and water-borne infections. There is no specific cure or vaccine for Ebola, and experimental treatments are being tested for safety and efficacy. The use of untested drugs raises debates on equity. The appropriate use of experimental drugs not tested for human safety and effectiveness has sparked debate on equity. Global health lawyer questions whether U.S. workers should receive scarce drugs over African patients. WHO deemed it ethical to offer unproven interventions during the Ebola outbreak, despite potential unknown efficacy and adverse effects. In October, WHO planned to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers. An experimental treatment might be available in Liberia by early November. A meeting was held to fast track vaccine testing and deployment. Ethical debates may arise if trial participants die. WHO is warning neighboring countries about the risk of Ebola cases, with Mali reporting its first case. An Oxford University study raises concerns about future outbreaks in Central and West Africa. The article raises concerns about future Ebola outbreaks in Central and West Africa, particularly in urban areas and countries with limited pandemic preparedness capacity. Questions are raised about the effectiveness of the U.S. response, support for pandemic preparedness efforts, impact of disease-specific funding, reprogramming of USAID funds, and the capacity-building efforts in affected countries and the region."
