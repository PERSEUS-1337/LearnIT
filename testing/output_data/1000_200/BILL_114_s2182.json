The \"Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2015\" sets spending limits for fiscal year 2016 in the House of Representatives and the Senate to prevent exceeding specified budget authority and outlays. Adjustments can be made by the House or Senate Committee on the Budget for enforcement purposes. The budgetary aggregates in the concurrent resolution on the budget are adjusted by the amount of new budget authority in a measure for enforcement purposes. The House or Senate Committee on Appropriations may revise suballocations accordingly. The appropriations for fiscal year 2016 include $58 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, as specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. SEC. 317 of the bill sets limits on total spending in the House of Representatives and the Senate, with exemptions for certain functions like Social Security and Medicare. SEC. 102 enforces these spending caps through sequestration. SEC. 102 enforces spending caps through sequestration.

Implementation of sequesters will be done separately for discretionary and direct spending, following the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Certain categories like TRICARE for Life, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, net interest, and discretionary appropriations shall be exempt from sequestration. Modifications to the Presidential Order may apply if a bill or joint resolution achieves the same level of reductions in new budget authority and outlays. The joint resolution must achieve the same level of reductions in new budget authority and outlays as set forth in the sequestration order. A point of order in the House or Senate prevents consideration of any bill or joint resolution that alters a sequestration order without certification from the Budget Committee chair. Title II of the CAP includes a limit on total spending, with definitions and caps outlined in the legislation. The term 'GDP' is defined as the gross domestic product for any fiscal year. Additionally, enforcement of GDP outlay limits is addressed in Section 319 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The GDP outlay limit is determined by multiplying the projected GDP for the fiscal year by specific percentages outlined for each year from 2016 to 2025. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is responsible for estimating this limit. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget establishes the GDP outlay limit for the budget year, including all federal outlays. Sequestration to enforce this section follows the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Certain programs are exempt from this section, such as military personnel accounts, TRICARE for Life, Medicare, military retirement, and Social Security. Certain payments are exempt from the GDP outlay limit enforcement, including military personnel accounts, TRICARE for Life, Medicare, military retirement, Social Security, veterans, and net interest. SEC. 320 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 prohibits bills, resolutions, amendments, or reports that would exceed the current GDP outlay limits. TITLE III--BALANCE\n\nSec. 301 requires a balanced budget amendment to be submitted to states. The Secretary of the Treasury cannot use additional borrowing authority until a balanced budget amendment is transmitted to the States, which includes requirements such as total outlays not exceeding total receipts, a spending limitation as a percentage of GDP, and tax increases needing a \\2/3\\ vote in Congress for ratification. It is not allowed in the House or Senate to consider any legislation causing the Secretary to exercise additional borrowing authority until the balanced budget amendment is transmitted. The Archivist of the United States will transmit an amendment to the Constitution described in subsection (a) before additional borrowing authority can be used by the Secretary of the Treasury."
