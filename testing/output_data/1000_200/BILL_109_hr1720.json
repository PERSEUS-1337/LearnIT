    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act.\" It includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the US annually, caused by inadequately treated sewage containing harmful pathogens. Swimming in contaminated waters leads to millions of Americans falling ill each year, resulting in significant economic losses. The economic impact of sanitary sewer overflows includes $1-2 billion in losses from beach closings and $28 billion from swimming-related illnesses annually in the United States. Many sewer systems lack monitoring and reporting of overflows, leading to public health risks. Improved monitoring and reporting could prevent millions of illnesses each year. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. This definition includes overflows or releases of wastewater reaching waters of the United States, those that do not reach waters of the United States, and backups caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer other than a building lateral. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement a system to alert to sanitary sewer overflows, notify the public of any potential health risks, and inform the public promptly. Publicly owned treatment works must notify the public and relevant authorities of any sanitary sewer overflow that poses a risk to human health within 24 hours of becoming aware of the issue. They must also report the overflow to the Administrator or State within the same timeframe. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days of becoming aware of the issue. The report must include details on the overflow's magnitude, duration, suspected cause, steps taken to reduce and prevent recurrence, and steps to mitigate the impact. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days. The report should include details such as the amount of wastewater released, duration of each overflow, location, responses to clean up, and actions to prevent future overflows. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 5 days, including details of the amount of wastewater released, duration of each overflow, location, responses to clean up, and actions to prevent future overflows. States must report annually to the Administrator the details of reported sanitary sewer overflows that occurred in that State. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows. Additionally, the authorization of appropriations is set at $2.2 billion for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2012."
