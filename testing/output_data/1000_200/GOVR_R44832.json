    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rapid rise in retail drug spending. Factors contributing to this increase include the introduction of new drugs at higher prices, fewer brand-name drugs losing patent protection, and a forecasted 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending from 2017 to 2026. Despite efforts to reduce growth rates, retail drug spending is expected to outpace other areas of medical spending in the next decade. Retail drug spending is projected to increase rapidly over the next decade, outpacing other areas of medical spending. A report will address government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including research and development, direct-to-consumer advertising regulation, legal restrictions on reimportation, and federal price negotiation. Data on prescription drug spending are commonly sourced from the National Health Expenditures accounts compiled by CMS, tracking annual spending by all payers for drugs purchased in retail settings. The United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016 and is forecasted to spend $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of national health care spending. Prescription drug spending is expected to increase to 11% by 2027. Retail drug spending has ranged from 5% to 10% of total health care expenditures since 1960. Since 1960, the NHE accounts have been compiling prescription spending data, but analysts argue that the data only reflect retail drug sales, not the complete picture of U.S. drug spending. Various studies provide different estimates of total U.S. prescription drug spending, taking into account factors like rebates, coupons, and retail versus institutional use. Despite variations in national estimates, there is a consistent trend towards higher spending. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. has shown a trend towards higher spending in recent years. From 2003 to 2013, spending grew at a slower rate due to various factors such as the economic recession and increased use of generic drugs. However, in 2014, there was a significant increase of 12.4% in retail drug spending, the largest annual jump in over a decade. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. accelerated in 2014 with a 12.4% increase, the largest in over a decade. Spending rose by 8.9% in 2015, slowed to 1.3% in 2016, and is forecasted to increase by 2.9% in 2017. Projected growth is about 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. This growth rate exceeds that of physician services and hospital care. Hearings on prescription drugs have been held during the 114th and 115th Congresses. Retail prescription drug spending grew significantly in 2014 and 2015 due to new high-cost drugs, price increases, and the impact of the Affordable Care Act. The growth was driven by changes in drug availability, pricing, and usage. Hearings on prescription drugs were conducted during the 114th and 115th Congresses in response to rising spending and prices. The rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016 despite increased utilization, attributed to fewer new drug approvals, decreased use of high-cost hepatitis C drugs, and reduced spending on diabetes treatments. Drug mix, comparing costs of new versus older drugs, impacts overall spending. FDA approval of numerous novel drugs, including specialty drugs for hepatitis C, has influenced the market. The FDA has approved many new expensive specialty drugs for hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease in recent years, leading to significant growth in prescription drug spending. The introduction of new hepatitis C drugs accounted for a large portion of this spending increase, but the impact is decreasing as fewer new patients are treated and drug prices drop. Since 2009, patents for best-selling brand-name drugs have expired, leading to the production of new generic versions. Spending for brand-name drugs subject to generic competition fell by $32.6 billion in 2012. Changes in drug mix, including the development of biologics with high introductory prices, will continue to impact drug spending. FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, but savings from brands losing patent protection have decreased since 2012. Prescription drug prices have risen faster than overall U.S. inflation since 2014. The gap between drug and overall inflation narrowed in 2017. Drug inflation is driven by price increases for existing brand-name drugs and adoption of expensive new innovator brand-name drugs. FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, but savings from brands losing patent protection have decreased since 2012. Prescription drug inflation driven by price increases for brand-name and specialty drugs, as well as adoption of new innovator drugs. Generic drug prices have not significantly contributed to inflation. ACA expansion of drug coverage has increased demand. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has boosted demand for drugs, with tax credits for ACA exchange-based health plans and required coverage in private insurance plans. Studies show a 15% annual increase in drug spending for insured consumers from 2014 to 2015. Medicaid coverage expansion under the ACA also led to an 8% jump in Medicaid prescription drug claims in 2014. The aging baby boomer population has also contributed to increased demand, with patients aged 50 and older accounting for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. The aging baby boomer population and ACA expansion have increased demand for prescription drugs. Patients aged 50 and older accounted for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. Out-of-pocket spending for drugs has decreased over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs covering a growing share of the nation's retail prescription drug bill. Out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs has decreased over the years, but consumers can still face high expenses depending on factors like insurance coverage and drug type. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for drugs to control spending, with a rise in prescription drug deductibles from 2012 to 2015. Out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs has decreased over the years, but consumers can still face high expenses depending on factors like insurance coverage and drug type. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for drugs to control spending, with a rise in prescription drug deductibles from 2012 to 2015. The use of formulary tiered pricing and coinsurance for expensive drugs has also increased, leading to a greater financial burden on consumers. For example, in 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans with multiple drug tiers had significantly higher co-payments for high-priced drugs compared to generic drugs. The ACA has helped moderate cost-sharing increases for prescription drugs through measures like capping out-of-pocket spending and reducing costs for certain enrollees. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have also provided assistance through discount coupons and patient assistance programs. While out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs has decreased overall, consumers with serious conditions or those prescribed specialty drugs still face high costs. The number of consumers facing high out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs has increased in recent years. A 2016 study showed that while average out-of-pocket spending decreased, nearly 3% of enrollees had costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, with outpatient specialty drug costs rising significantly. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs decreased from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, with a forecast to decrease to $137 in 2017 and gradually increase to $207 by 2026. Government share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has risen due to expanded subsidized drug coverage through programs like Medicare Part D and Medicaid under the ACA. The government's share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has increased from 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017, with a forecast to rise to 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for government-sponsored drug benefits, procurement, or pricing. Various departments and agencies manage drug discount and contracting systems, including market-based negotiations in Medicare Part D, direct procurement in the Veterans Health Administration, and a combination of rebates and negotiations in Medicaid. The U.S. government's share of retail prescription drug spending has increased significantly over the years. Unlike other countries, the U.S. lacks a centralized system for government-sponsored drug benefits, procurement, or pricing. Various federal agencies manage drug discount and contracting systems, with Medicaid rebates being significantly higher than Part D rebates. Legislation has been proposed to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. The U.S. government's share of retail prescription drug spending has increased significantly over the years. Legislation has been proposed to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. A table outlines prescription purchasing systems for federal health care programs like Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration. Medicare Part D is designed as a market-oriented program where commercial health payers compete for enrollees based on drug coverage and prices. Part D plan sponsors negotiate drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers to dispense drugs to enrollees at set rates. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 created Medicare Part D with a noninterference provision to promote market competition. Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Program spending has been below initial budget projections, with total Part D drug rebates increasing over the years. Total Part D drug rebates have risen from 9.6% in 2007 to a forecasted 24% in 2018. Studies show that Part D plans have higher drug prices compared to Medicaid. Lawmakers propose giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices to secure larger discounts for Medicare beneficiaries. Lawmakers proposed giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, aiming to secure larger discounts by leveraging the combined purchasing power of millions of beneficiaries. In 2007, the House approved a bill allowing price negotiation but not formulary creation, which was not passed by the Senate. A CBO analysis suggested minimal savings without additional regulatory actions by the Secretary. Patient and consumer groups have expressed concerns about potential reductions in drug coverage with increased Secretary control over the Part D formulary. Lawmakers have proposed giving the Secretary more control over the Part D formulary to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. The Obama Administration recommended this for high-cost drugs, while the Trump Administration suggested passing on more rebates to enrollees and moving some drugs from Part B to Part D. Lawmakers also introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, with potential cost savings according to CBO. State governments play a key role in regulating prescription drug use and pricing, administering and funding Medicaid, and offering health insurance plans to state employees. Some states have patient assistance programs for low-income residents. States are implementing various strategies to address prescription drug spending, focusing on limiting costs for high-priced drugs and promoting transparency. States are enacting laws to limit prescription drug costs and increase transparency. For example, California, Delaware, and Vermont have implemented measures such as capping cost sharing and requiring manufacturers to justify price increases. This legislation aims to hold drug companies accountable for their pricing practices. The Vermont act and similar bills aim to make drug companies justify prices based on costs. Some states are also passing laws to prohibit gag clauses in pharmacy contracts and allow importation of prescription drugs from other countries. The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs compared to other nations, with projections showing an increase in global drug spending share by 2021. The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs compared to other nations, with projections showing an increase in global drug spending share by 2021. U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs was $1,162 in 2015, higher than any other industrialized nation. Studies have found significant price differences for specific drugs between the U.S. and other countries, with U.S. prices often double that of the European Union. The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs compared to other nations, with U.S. prices often double that of the European Union. Reasons for higher U.S. spending and prices include faster adoption of new drugs, patent protections, and market exclusivity. EU countries use external reference pricing to set drug prices. In Canada, the Common Drug Review evaluates new and existing drugs for reimbursement by federal, territorial, and provincial drug plans. The U.S. is exploring alternative pricing models, such as value-based purchasing, with initiatives like discounts for drugs that don't meet health improvement goals. Medicaid programs are encouraged to move towards value-based purchasing by CMS. The CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to shift towards value-based purchasing to improve health outcomes and reduce hospitalizations. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is producing reports on the effectiveness and cost of newly approved drugs, which has raised concerns in the pharmaceutical industry. The federal government focuses on basic research, while ICER is refining its methodology for valuing prescription drugs. The federal government and pharmaceutical industry focus on different aspects of drug research. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging, as both basic and applied research play a crucial role. Studies have shown that a small percentage of new drugs originate from sources other than private industry. Only 6.7% of new drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 1999 originated from non-industry sources. A study in 2010 found that 24.1% of new molecular entities and biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 were publicly funded. A 2011 study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. provided a more comprehensive look at the contribution of publicly funded research to the discovery of new drugs. The Stevens study in 2011 found that 9.3% of FDA-approved drugs from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Of the drugs that received priority review, 19% came from publicly funded labs, showing a higher percentage compared to private-sector research. The 2011 Stevens study found that publicly funded research contributed to 9.3% of FDA-approved drugs from 1990 to 2007. Publicly funded labs were responsible for 19% of drugs that received priority review, showing a higher percentage compared to private-sector research. PSRIs tend to discover drugs with significant clinical effects, excluding their role in developing platform technologies that enabled the development of new drug classes. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology and methods for producing antibodies and recombinant proteins. These technologies enabled the development of many new drugs, highlighting their importance in the creation of novel drug classes. A 2018 study found that public funding from the NIH was associated with every one of 210 new drug approvals by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. Up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, around $100 billion, contributed to research that led to these new drug approvals. The NIH allocated around $100 billion from 2000 to 2016, contributing to research associated with new drug approvals from 2010-2016. Detailed information on drug development costs is generally not available, but academic studies have estimated average spending. The study estimates average spending for clinical research on new drugs by 10 large drug manufacturers. The pretax cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug was $2.6 billion in 2014, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. Academic and government research have challenged the study's assumption of a 10.5% rate of return for attracting capital during drug development. The study raises questions about drug companies needing a 10.5% rate of return for capital during drug development, the mix of drugs sampled, and the impact of federal tax breaks. Estimates for new drug development range from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion and are sensitive to factors like development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs. Transparency legislation may compel drugmakers to provide data on research and marketing costs for high-priced drugs. Price transparency legislation would require drugmakers to disclose data on research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs. Research and development costs are not always the main factor in drug pricing, as shown in a Senate investigation of Gilead Pharmaceutical's hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. Gilead's pricing strategy focused on maximizing revenue rather than research costs. Gilead and Pfizer's pricing strategies focused on maximizing revenue rather than research costs. The US allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy and balance in information. Pharmaceutical companies can deduct advertising expenses under current law. Pharmaceutical companies can deduct advertising expenses for drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising regulated by the FDA since 1962. Advertising to physicians and other healthcare providers is also common practice. In the 1980s, pharmaceutical firms started advertising to consumers, which was addressed by the FDA in a 1985 notice. FDA issued guidance on broadcast ads in 1999 and has since updated guidance on internet advertising. DTC prescription drug advertising grew to over $5 billion in 2006, dipped during the 2007 recession, and rebounded around 2014. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising in recent years, with pharmaceutical advertising rising 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Advertising spending on pharmaceutical DTC rose 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015, with a focus on newly introduced drugs. Internet-based drug ads are the fastest-growing area, while TV and newspaper ads still dominate. FDA regulations require drug companies to submit ads for assessment, showing an increase in internet promotions compared to flat TV promotions. Prescription drug promotions are increasing, while television promotions remain flat. Supporters believe pharmaceutical advertising leads to more informed consumers and better diagnosis of undertreated illnesses. Critics argue that it may encourage inappropriate prescribing and higher drug spending. New brand-name drug ads may lead to consumers choosing higher-priced products over lower-priced or generic alternatives without clear evidence of their effectiveness or safety. Recent studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased use of prescription drugs. A 2015 study found that a 10% rise in drug advertising views leads to a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions for the advertised drugs. Government reports have shown that advertising may encourage the use of specific drugs, even if alternatives may be more appropriate. A government survey revealed that many people feel DTC advertisements lack sufficient information about the benefits and risks of the drugs. Congress has debated restrictions on DTC advertising. The American Medical Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recommended a ban on DTC drug ads due to concerns about inadequate information on risks. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, raising constitutional issues regarding commercial speech protection. Manufacturers are focusing ad dollars on newly introduced products, as shown by Kantar data. In the 114th Congress, legislation was proposed to impose a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, with concerns about promoting drugs before long-term evidence of safety and effectiveness. The FDA regulates pharmaceutical sales in the US under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Congress has also debated disallowing federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising to reduce drug spending. The FDA regulates pharmaceutical sales in the US under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. An approved marketing application is required to sell a drug in the US market, including clinical data on safety and effectiveness, manufacturing procedures, reporting processes, and labeling. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified the requirements for drug approval. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved prescription drug can legally bring it back into the US. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 allowed importation of FDA-approved drugs, but in practice, this has not been implemented. The HHS Secretary must certify to Congress that implementing import provisions will not pose additional health risks and will reduce costs for consumers. The importation provision has never been carried out due to lack of certifications, prohibiting importation of prescription drugs from abroad. Legislation has addressed importation by entities other than the manufacturer holding the marketing application. If the importation provision were implemented, a company could produce and package a drug outside the United States according to FDA approval and bring it into the US for sale. Lawmakers have tried to use the agriculture appropriations bill to allow importation of prescription drugs by individuals, pharmacies, and wholesalers. FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation restrictions. The FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation restrictions, allowing individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. This policy aims to save FDA resources and permit medical treatments not available in the US. The FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation restrictions, allowing individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use, saving resources and permitting unavailable medical treatments in the US. Some states have tried to pass laws for prescription drug importation. The Senate Committees have held hearings on various issues related to drug costs, including the FDA's role in the generic drug marketplace, Valeant Pharmaceuticals' business model, sudden price spikes in decades-old Rx drugs, and sudden price spikes in off-patent drugs. The Senate Committees have held hearings on sudden price spikes in off-patent drugs, examining the cost of prescription drugs and the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration. The Senate Committees have held hearings on the cost of prescription drugs, including discussions on EpiPen price increases and regulatory barriers inhibiting pharmaceutical competition. The Senate Committees have held hearings on accelerating patient access to generic drugs, biosimilar implementation progress, advancing research and development for patients, examining the drug supply chain, and how covered entities utilize the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The House Committees held hearings on various topics related to drug regulation and access, including the 340B Drug Pricing Program, patient access to investigational drugs, modernizing FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs, and FDA's prescription drug user fee programs. The House Committees held hearings on topics related to drug regulation and access, including the FDA's Generic Drug and Biosimilar User Fee Program, Medicare drug experiment, antitrust concerns in the FDA approval process, and competition in the pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy marketplaces. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform conducted hearings on federally funded cancer research, voluntary restricted distribution systems in the pharmaceutical supply chain, rising prices of EpiPens, and developments in the prescription drug market."
