    "content": "China maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. The Chinese central bank controlled the peg by buying or selling dollar-denominated assets to balance demand for the yuan. Despite economic changes, the exchange rate remained stable. Economists believe the peg was close to the market value initially but would have likely appreciated in the later years. The Chinese government modified its currency policy on July 21, 2005, allowing the yuan's exchange rate to be adjustable based on market supply and demand. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the yuan was immediately adjusted from 8.28 to 8.11, appreciating by about 2.1%. The yuan would be allowed to fluctuate daily against a basket of currencies, but it remained not fully convertible in international markets. Since July 2005, China has allowed the yuan to appreciate steadily but slowly, accumulating foreign reserves rapidly. The government maintains tight restrictions and controls over capital transactions, describing the current situation as a \"managed float.\" China's foreign exchange reserves grew significantly from $403 billion in 2003 to $1.7 trillion in March 2008, with a large trade surplus of $262 billion in 2007. Since the 2005 reforms, China's yuan has risen 16% against the dollar, leading to concerns about the U.S. economy. Despite the increase in the yuan's value, U.S. exports are growing rapidly, and imports from China have slowed. China, however, is hesitant to make significant changes due to concerns about its own economy. China's yuan has increased in value by 16% against the dollar since 2005, causing concerns in the United States. China is reluctant to make significant changes to its currency policy due to its own economic worries. This paper reviews the economic issues surrounding China's currency policy, including concerns raised by the U.S., China's fixed exchange rate regime, the U.S.-China trade imbalance, and the economic consequences for both countries. Many U.S. policymakers and business representatives are concerned about China's undervalued currency, which they believe has led to a significant trade deficit with the United States. They are exploring policy options to induce China to reform its currency policy, including legislation introduced in Congress. Many U.S. policymakers and business representatives are concerned about China's undervalued currency, leading to a significant trade deficit. Calls for China to revalue its currency or allow it to float freely in international markets have been made by various groups, including the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration initially rejected calls to pressure China on its currency peg, instead focusing on encouraging financial system reforms. However, by April 2005, there was a shift towards advocating for a more flexible exchange rate, driven by complaints from Members of Congress and the introduction of currency bills. During the 109th congressional session, complaints arose over China's currency policy and the introduction of currency bills. A failed Senate vote on April 6, 2005, rejected an amendment imposing a tariff on Chinese goods if their currency didn't appreciate. Senate Republicans later negotiated to allow a vote on a similar bill, S. 295, sponsored by Senator Schumer. During the 109th Congress, complaints were raised about China's currency policy, leading to the introduction of various currency bills. Significant events included a 4.1% increase in import prices from China, a 1.8% rise in U.S. imports from China, and a 15.9% appreciation of the yuan against the dollar since July 2005. The Bank of China reported an exchange rate of 7.00 yuan to the dollar on May 8, 2008, representing a 15.9% appreciation since July 2005. China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion by the end of March 2008. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was launched on September 29, 2007, with an initial capitalization of $200 billion. CIC announced a $5 billion investment in Morgan Stanley on December 15, 2007. China stated on August 13, 2007, that it had no plans to sell off its dollar assets in response to rumors. In response to an article in the Daily Telegraph, high-level Chinese officials claimed China would sell off dollar assets if US imposed sanctions over currency policy. China eliminated regulations on converting foreign exchange holdings into yuan. IMF clarified currency manipulation as policies affecting exchange rates to increase exports. 42 House Members filed a petition over China's currency practices with the US Trade Representative's office. On May 17, 2007, 42 House Members filed a petition with the U.S. Trade Representative's office over China's currency practices. The USTR's office declined the petition on June 13, 2007. The Treasury Department is required to report annually on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses and determine if they manipulate their currencies. Treasury must negotiate an end to such practices if manipulation is found. The Treasury Department is required to report annually on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses and determine if they manipulate their currencies. If manipulation is found, Treasury must negotiate an end to such practices. China was cited for currency manipulation five times from May 1992 to July 1994, but no country has been designated as a currency manipulator since 1994. The focus on China's currency policy has increased in recent years, with criticism of its pace of reforms. Treasury praised China's currency reform in July 2005. Since China reformed its currency in July 2005, Treasury praised the reforms but noted that China had not fully implemented its commitment to increase the role of market forces in determining the yuan's value. Despite Chinese officials describing a new managed float exchange rate regime, Treasury found that the yuan's daily closing level was still tightly managed against the dollar. Treasury decided not to label China as a currency manipulator due to assurances received from Chinese officials. The Treasury Department decided not to label China as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law, citing assurances from Chinese officials about market-determined currency flexibility and promoting domestic growth. Despite China's central bank heavily intervening in currency markets and the undervaluation of the currency, it did not meet technical requirements for manipulation. Treasury continues to press China to accelerate the appreciation of the RMB. The Treasury Department's December 2007 report urged China to speed up the appreciation of the RMB's exchange rate to reduce risks for the global economy. Many Members criticized Treasury for not labeling China a currency manipulator despite its interventions in the exchange rate. Chinese officials argue their currency policy is not solely for promoting exports. Chinese officials argue that the yuan's peg to the dollar is for economic stability and investor confidence, not to boost exports. They fear abandoning this policy could lead to an economic crisis, especially impacting export industries during ongoing economic reforms. Concerns also arise from rural unrest due to income disparities and government issues. Chinese officials are concerned about rising rural unrest due to income disparities and government issues. They argue that appreciating the currency could lower farmers' income and lead to tensions. They believe that a fully convertible currency could strain the underdeveloped banking system, citing the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis as an example. Prior to the crisis, officials were considering currency policy reforms. The 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis highlighted the importance of China's currency peg in maintaining economic stability. Chinese officials were considering currency policy reforms before the crisis, but the negative impact on other East Asian countries convinced them to gradually make the currency more flexible. U.S. officials suggest faster financial sector reforms and currency flexibility, such as allowing faster yuan appreciation and reducing intervention in currency markets. Fixed exchange rates, like the Bretton Woods system, have a long history of use. China's currency policy previously operated under a fixed exchange rate, where the central bank maintained a constant yuan-dollar exchange rate. This system was in place until July 2005 when China started to consider reforms to make the currency more flexible. The alternative to fixed exchange rates is a floating exchange rate system, like the one the United States has with the Euro area, where market forces determine the exchange rate. Under a floating exchange rate system, the euro-dollar exchange rate fluctuates based on supply and demand in the marketplace. Increased demand for Euro area goods or assets would cause the euro to rise in value. If China had maintained a floating exchange rate, appreciation would likely have occurred in recent years due to changing economic circumstances. If China had a floating exchange rate, appreciation would have likely occurred due to productivity and quality improvements, increased demand for Chinese goods, and foreign direct investment. The central bank would need to adjust currency supply to match market demand by increasing or decreasing foreign exchange reserves. The current account balance is close to the trade balance, with net exports and net private capital inflows affecting it. The Chinese central bank maintained a pegged exchange rate through 2005 by increasing foreign reserves, primarily holding U.S. financial securities. A peg can be sustained as long as the central bank accumulates more foreign exchange reserves. Since July 2005, China has rapidly accumulated foreign reserves, surpassing Japan to become the world's largest holder. Foreign reserves grew from $75 billion in 1995 to $1.53 trillion in 2007. China's foreign exchange holdings rose by $463 billion from 2006 to 2007, leading to a 43% increase. The yuan has appreciated steadily against the dollar, with a 16% increase by April 2008. This situation is best described as a \"managed\" exchange rate regime. Since 2005, China's yuan has appreciated steadily, reaching 7 yuan per dollar by April 2008. The current situation is a \"managed float\" where market forces influence the yuan's movement, but government intervention slows its appreciation. China's rapid accumulation of foreign reserves suggests that allowing the yuan to freely float would lead to a faster appreciation. The Chinese government's accumulation of foreign exchange reserves is not solely to prevent the yuan from appreciating against the dollar. These reserves are essential for financing international trade and defending against currency speculation. China's rapid increase in reserves has outpaced GDP and imports growth, raising questions about the nature and composition of these reserves. Public information on China's foreign reserves is limited, making it unclear how much is held in U.S. assets and the reasons behind the annual increase in reserves. China's foreign exchange reserves are crucial for trade and defending against currency speculation. The composition of these reserves, including the share held in U.S. assets and the reasons for annual increases, remains unclear. The real exchange rate between the United States and China has fluctuated due to inflation differences, impacting export prices and import costs. The Chinese exchange rate appreciated, making exports more expensive and imports cheaper. In 2003, the yuan reached its lowest level since 1994 in real terms, gradually making exports less expensive. The yuan has since risen, almost returning to its 1998 level in real terms. Appreciation in the nominal exchange rate brings the yuan back to market value. If demand for Chinese goods increases, the floating yuan would appreciate until excess demand is balanced. If the yuan were floating, it would appreciate as more yuan were acquired to purchase Chinese goods, leading to a return to equilibrium in the trade balance. With a fixed exchange rate, the real exchange rate adjusts through price changes over time. A fixed exchange rate below market levels results in a trade surplus with the United States, with capital flowing from China to the U.S. through various channels like asset purchases and remittances. The capital flow from China to the United States consists of private Chinese citizens purchasing U.S. assets and the Chinese central bank accumulating dollar reserves. This leads to an increase in yuan supply, causing inflation in China. As prices rise, exports become costlier abroad and imports cheaper, eventually returning the trade surplus to equilibrium. Undervaluing a fixed exchange rate does not provide a permanent competitive advantage, as the real exchange rate adjusts over time through price changes. Floating exchange rates return to equilibrium value quicker than fixed rates, limiting a country's ability to use monetary policy to counteract economic downturns. Pegged currencies restrict interest rate adjustments, leading to capital outflows and pressure on the currency peg. This loss of monetary autonomy is less significant for smaller economies. China's use of capital controls helps maintain some monetary autonomy despite a fixed exchange rate. The currency is convertible for trade but not for various financial flows. This allows China to limit the impact of economic downturns compared to countries without such controls. China's currency, the yuan, is convertible on a current account basis for trade transactions but not on a capital account basis for financial flows. Chinese enterprises must exchange foreign currency for yuan, and foreign exchange purchases are regulated. China's capital controls provide flexibility in monetary and fiscal policy despite a fixed exchange rate. The yuan's value has remained stable since 1994, and its potential appreciation is uncertain. Estimates of yuan undervaluation have been cited in various sources, grouped into two methodological categories: the \"fundamental equilibrium exchange rate\" and \"purchasing power parity\" methods. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate method is based on estimating misalignments in exchange rates. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) method estimates misalignments in exchange rates based on current account balances. It calculates how much the exchange rate must change to achieve a fundamental current account balance. This method is controversial as not all economists agree on the misalignment of current account balances worldwide. Ernest Preeg, a senior fellow at the Manufacturers' Alliance, provided estimates using this method. Ernest Preeg estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003, based on rule-of-thumb estimates. He observed that the increase in Chinese foreign exchange reserves equaled 100% of the trade surplus less net foreign direct investment in 2002. Preeg also noted that a 1% decline in the dollar leads to a $10 billion decline in the US trade deficit, suggesting a 40% decline in the dollar would eliminate the deficit. The Institute for International Economics estimated that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003, with a current account surplus larger than the actual surplus. They suggested reducing the surplus by $50 billion to return to equilibrium, leading to a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP in China. The Institute for International Economics estimated that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003. They suggested reducing the surplus by $50 billion to return to equilibrium, leading to a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP in China. IIE Fellow Morris Goldstein testified that the revaluation required to achieve this reduction in the current account surplus is unusually large due to the extensive use of imports in Chinese exports. Goldman Sachs Economic Research Group estimated the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, aiming for a fair contribution to reducing global payment imbalances. Goldman Sachs estimated the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, suggesting a revaluation to bring the current account deficit to a sustainable level. Virginie Coudert and Cecile Couharde argue that China has an underlying current account deficit of 1.5%-2.8% of GDP. Their analysis is based on parameters such as per-capita income, demographics, and the budget deficit. The current account balance regression in China is estimated to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio, with the yuan being undervalued by 44%-54% against the dollar in 2003. These estimates are not based on econometric models but on simple assumptions. The main point of contention is defining an \"equilibrium\" current account balance. The estimates of the yuan's undervaluation are disputed due to differing opinions on what constitutes an \"equilibrium\" current account balance. This assumption is crucial as it significantly impacts the estimated undervaluation. Some argue that the current account balance would always be close to zero in equilibrium, but this overlooks the variations in saving and investment rates among countries. Some studies suggest that the current account balance should be close to zero in equilibrium, but this overlooks the fact that countries with different saving and investment rates may lend to and borrow from each other. The Preeg, IIE, and Goldman Sachs estimates use a less favorable equilibrium assumption for China, calling for balance only in official and portfolio borrowing, allowing for FDI inflows. Their estimate of China's \"equilibrium\" current account position is actually a deficit, leading to larger estimates of the yuan's undervaluation. The current account balance in China is difficult to determine due to capital controls. Increasing foreign reserves is necessary to prevent a rise in foreign indebtedness. Maintaining capital controls post-currency reform may lead to a reasonable assumption of the current account balance. If capital controls were eliminated in China, the economic situation would change entirely, with private citizens potentially borrowing or lending to the rest of the world. This could result in a persistent trade deficit or surplus. The equilibrium market exchange rate would be affected by private capital outflows, potentially leading to yuan depreciation. If China eliminated capital controls, private citizens could borrow or lend globally, affecting the market exchange rate and potentially leading to yuan depreciation. The high internal saving rate in China could finance its investment, offsetting FDI inflows with official outflows in foreign reserve accumulation. Foreign reserve accumulation should not be seen as proof of undervaluation. Wang argues that China's equilibrium current account surplus may be larger than actual, suggesting the yuan is overvalued. The FEER approach believes the U.S. trade deficit is unsustainable and revaluing the yuan would help. Coudert and Couharde estimate the yuan is 54% undervalued, based on the belief that the dollar is 35% overvalued in 2003. In 2003, the dollar was 35% overvalued, the yen 37% undervalued, and the euro 27% undervalued. The sustainability of the U.S. trade deficit is debated, with no widely accepted theoretical approach. The trade deficit has not hindered the U.S. economy in the past, and there have been no significant declines in the dollar. If China stopped buying U.S. assets, it could reduce its bilateral trade deficit with the United States. The sustainability of the U.S. trade deficit is debated, with no widely accepted theoretical approach. Large declines in the dollar since the trade deficit emerged have not occurred. If China stopped buying U.S. assets to reduce its bilateral trade deficit with the United States, it may not significantly impact the overall U.S. trade deficit. It is uncertain if a \"fair share\" of the reduction in the U.S. trade deficit can be attributed to China. International experience suggests that even if China's overall trade surplus is eliminated, it could still run a bilateral trade surplus with the United States. The experience of East Asian countries in maintaining high saving rates and current account balances is mixed. Some countries ran deficits while others had surpluses. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, these countries have mostly had large current account surpluses, indicating a challenging environment for developing world borrowing. Several countries in the region have large foreign exchange reserves and current account surpluses. Several East Asian countries, including China, have large foreign exchange reserves and current account surpluses. Estimates suggest that China's currency is undervalued, with the yuan being estimated to be undervalued by 56% in February 2007 according to the Big Mac Index. The Economist's Big Mac Index estimated China's currency was undervalued by 56% in February 2007. The index compares Big Mac prices in China and the US, but it has drawbacks as it only applies to tradeable goods. Li Ong estimates that most of a Big Mac's value comes from non-tradeable services. The Big Mac Index compares the price of Big Macs in different locations to determine purchasing power parity. However, this method has limitations as it only considers tradeable goods. While PPP is a powerful concept in theory, it has been unreliable in reality, especially in predicting exchange rates over the long run. Estimates based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) should be approached with caution as they may only predict exchange rates accurately in the long run. PPP can identify if a country's currency is overvalued or undervalued compared to another country, but the estimate may not change significantly over time even with changing trade deficits. Economists like Jeffrey Frankel use income levels to predict equilibrium exchange rates based on PPP, with China's exchange rate estimated to be undervalued by 36% in 2000. Coudert and Couharde made a similar calculation for 2003. The exchange rate was undervalued by 36% in 2000, with speculations that the undervaluation has increased since then. Coudert and Couharde estimated the yuan to be undervalued by 41%-51% in 2003. Frankel cautions that PPP may not hold in the short run, and adjustments in the exchange rate should be gradual to avoid economic disruption. He also notes that an appreciation of the renminbi may not immediately impact the U.S. trade deficit or employment. Theoretical rationale for linking income levels to exchange rate values includes the \"Balassa-Samuelson\" effect, where countries with higher income levels are predicted to have appreciating exchange rates. Proxy indicators like the consumer price index to producer price index ratio can be used to estimate undervaluation, such as the yuan being 18% undervalued in 2003. The yuan was estimated to be undervalued by 47% in 2003 using a proxy indicator, but other studies suggest it was only modestly undervalued. However, there are concerns about the accuracy of the proxy for China due to non-market determined consumer prices and restrictions on labor and capital mobility. Some findings indicate significant undervaluation of the yuan, but these estimates may not meet statistical inference standards. The yuan is believed to be undervalued, but some studies question the statistical significance of these estimates. Adjusting for factors like serial correlation and adding variables like trade openness can significantly reduce the estimated undervaluation. Changes in the model, such as altering the time period or sample countries, can also greatly impact the estimate. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates in December 2006 addresses these issues. The Treasury Department's December 2006 report on exchange rates discusses the use of economic models and methodology to estimate a currency's \"misalignment\" or fair market rate exchange rate. It notes that no single model accurately explains exchange rate movements, and using multiple models can provide useful information in understanding exchange rate movements. The report emphasizes focusing on serious misalignments, using real effective exchange rates, and considering protracted misalignments where currency adjustments are not occurring. Treasury Department's report on exchange rates emphasizes using multiple models to estimate currency misalignment, focusing on protracted misalignments where currency adjustments are not happening. Critics of China's currency peg point to the U.S.-China trade imbalance as evidence of undervaluation, but bilateral trade balances reflect structural causes and exchange rate effects. Other factors also play a significant role. The U.S.-China trade imbalance is influenced by structural causes and exchange rate effects. China's overall trade surplus was $262 billion in 2007, with a small surplus of $6 billion excluding the U.S. Despite an undervalued yuan against the dollar, China runs deficits with other countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. The U.S. trade deficit with China is part of a larger trade imbalance, with deficits also seen with Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. Despite the rise in imports from China, U.S. exports to China have also increased significantly, making China the third largest U.S. export market in 2007. This growth in imports from China is attributed to export-oriented multinational companies moving production facilities to China. The rise in the U.S. trade deficit with China is mainly due to export-oriented multinational companies relocating production to China to benefit from low-cost labor. Chinese data shows a significant increase in exports and imports from foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) in China over the years. FIEs import raw materials from East Asia for assembly in China, leading to trade deficits with East Asian countries and surpluses with others. The rise in the U.S. trade deficit with China is attributed to export-oriented multinational companies moving production to China for low-cost labor. China serves as a production platform for foreign companies, leading to trade deficits with East Asian countries and surpluses with high consumer demand countries like the United States. Analysts suggest that the increase in U.S. imports from China is due to China becoming a production hub for foreign companies, rather than unfair trade policies. The growth of foreign direct investment in China has led to a significant increase in trade by foreign-invested enterprises. China's trade by FIEs is strongly linked to the rapid growth in FDI in China, which increased from $1.9 billion in 1986 to $74.8 billion in 2007. The U.S. trade deficit with China began to rise in the early 1990s, coinciding with a significant increase in FDI and exports by FIEs. FIEs import about 80% as much as they export, having little effect on China's overall trade balance. Foreign multinational companies have shifted production to China, with Japan being the largest foreign supplier of U.S. computer equipment in 2000. In 2000, Japan was the largest foreign supplier of U.S. computer equipment, but by 2007, China became the largest supplier with a 51.5% share of total U.S. imports. U.S. imports of computer equipment from China rose significantly, while the total value of imports from the world only rose slightly. Many foreign computer companies have moved manufacturing facilities to China, contributing to the increase in Chinese computer production. If the yuan is undervalued against the dollar, it benefits Chinese export industries and attracts foreign investment in manufacturing facilities in China. However, it makes imports more expensive, hurting Chinese consumers and firms that rely on imported parts and materials. A revaluation of the yuan could benefit Chinese exporting firms owned by foreign multinational corporations, but hurt non-exporting Chinese firms reliant on imports. This policy may disrupt resource allocation in the Chinese economy. Some argue that revaluation could help control an overheating economy and prevent inflation, while others believe it could negatively impact underemployed rural labor. Some economists argue that China's undervalued yuan helps absorb underemployed rural labor and prevents inflation. However, others believe that this currency policy limits the government's ability to use monetary policy for stable economic growth. They also suggest that the policy has led to an overreliance on fixed investment and exports, potentially destabilizing the banking system with increased non-performing loans. China's easy credit policy has increased the risk of non-performing loans in banks and attracted \"hot money\" for speculative ventures. The inability to adjust interest rates freely hinders investment regulation, leading to potential overproduction in certain sectors. Large foreign exchange reserves may pave the way for China to adopt a fully convertible currency. China's large foreign exchange reserves may help move towards a fully convertible currency, but also have opportunity costs for funding development needs. Accumulation of reserves can impact exchange rates, making Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. exports more expensive. The accumulation of China's large foreign exchange reserves impacts exchange rates, making Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. exports more expensive. This leads to a rise in the U.S. trade deficit and a decrease in aggregate demand in the short run. China is the second largest supplier of imports to the United States, with a focus on labor-intensive consumer goods. Many affected U.S. industries, particularly in manufacturing, see a decline in exports and production. Many U.S. industries, such as machine tools, hardware, plastics, furniture, and tool and die, are concerned about China's growing competitive challenge. An undervalued Chinese currency may impact their output. However, U.S. producers also import capital equipment and inputs from China, which can lower prices and increase competitiveness in world markets. The undervalued yuan lowers the price of U.S. products, increasing their competitiveness in global markets. This also benefits U.S.-invested enterprises in China and leads to increased capital flows from China to the United States, boosting capital investment and lowering interest rates. Lower interest rates caused by capital inflow from China benefit private firms and interest-sensitive household spending in the U.S. China holds a significant amount of U.S. Treasury securities, funding federal budget deficits. China is the second largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, with $397 billion as of September 2007. If the U.S. trade deficit with China is eliminated, the government would need to find other buyers for its securities at higher interest rates, increasing the budget deficit. An undervalued yuan allows the U.S. to increase consumption of goods through improved terms of trade. The undervalued yuan increases U.S. purchasing power, impacting Chinese product prices in the U.S. Import prices from China rose by 4.1% in a year, leading to concerns about the effect on the U.S. manufacturing sector. Critics argue that China's low yuan value has impacted the U.S. manufacturing sector, leading to job losses. However, there is no clear link between job losses and imports from China, as manufacturing output has increased, and the trade deficit is growing overall. Additionally, there is a long-term trend shifting U.S. employment from manufacturing to the service sector. The trend of shifting U.S. employment from manufacturing to the service sector is driven by changing technology and comparative advantage, leading to a decrease in the share of manufacturing jobs. This trend is predicted to continue due to globalization and trade dynamics, with the U.S. focusing on knowledge- and technology-intensive goods for trade with countries like China. The trend of shifting U.S. employment from manufacturing to the service sector is driven by changing technology and comparative advantage. Trade leads to more manufacturing abroad, regardless of China's currency policy. An undervalued yuan does not significantly increase manufacturing activity and jobs in the United States, but rather leads to a shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates caused by Chinese capital inflows. The undervalued yuan does not significantly increase manufacturing activity and jobs in the United States. Instead, it leads to a shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates caused by Chinese capital inflows. This shift is expected to have no medium- or long-run effect on aggregate U.S. employment or unemployment, although there may be adverse short-run consequences. The gains and losses in employment and production caused by the trade deficit will not be evenly dispersed across regions and sectors of the economy. If output in the trade sector falls more quickly than U.S. recipients of Chinese capital rise, aggregate spending and employment could temporarily decline. A fall in aggregate spending is more concerning if the economy is already sluggish. Government policy and market forces can compensate for any trade sector output decline. The economy would be larger in the long run due to the capital inflow/trade deficit, but U.S. citizens would not benefit from Chinese-owned capital. The United States has a trade deficit with China, which has led to a capital inflow. While U.S. citizens do not benefit from Chinese-owned capital, U.S. workers using this capital experience higher productivity and wages. The U.S. has been running an overall trade deficit due to a domestic imbalance between saving and investment, with saving as a share of GDP declining over the past two decades. The United States has a trade deficit with China, leading to a capital inflow. Americans save little, resulting in foreigners financing profitable investments in the U.S. China has a much higher gross national saving rate compared to the U.S. (51.3% vs. 13.5%). China's gross national saving as a percent of GDP is significantly higher than the U.S. level. China also has a higher rate of gross fixed investment compared to the United States. This results in China having excess saving that it can invest overseas, while the United States needs to borrow from abroad to fund its investment needs. The current account balance as a percent of GDP is 9.0% for China and -6.2% for the United States, indicating the need for fundamental changes in saving/investment patterns for both countries. China and the United States need to adjust their saving/investment patterns to reduce the trade deficit. China aims to increase consumer spending to shift from export reliance to domestic consumption for GDP growth. It may take years for this transition, despite government efforts to modernize the financial sector. China and the United States need to adjust their saving/investment patterns to reduce the trade deficit. Economists are more concerned with the overall trade deficit than bilateral trade balances. The United States has a low saving rate, making it reliant on foreigners to finance its investment opportunities. If the United States did not borrow heavily from China, it would still have economic concerns. The United States is heavily reliant on foreign financing for its investment opportunities, including capital from China. The depreciation of the dollar could potentially disrupt the economy, with concerns about a sudden plummet in value causing severe dislocations. Economists fear this scenario due to the size of the trade deficit. The trade deficit is unsustainably large, leading to concerns about significant dollar depreciation and potential dislocations in U.S. financial markets. Economists worry that investors may suddenly realize this inevitability and flee dollar assets, causing disruptions in efficient financial intermediation. Despite being seen as highly unlikely, the costly scenario may still be worth guarding against. The dollar has not depreciated rapidly since 2002 due to central banks in China and other developing countries accumulating foreign reserves to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar. This commitment to support the dollar's value by China and other countries has made private investors feel secure investing in U.S. assets despite the large trade deficit. Other Asian countries may continue this policy to compete with China in exports. The value of the dollar has made private investors feel secure despite the trade deficit. If China and other countries stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could fall, triggering a crisis. The US could pressure China for currency reforms, such as making the yuan convertible and allowing it to appreciate. This has sparked a lively policy debate. The policy debate on inducing China to reform its exchange rate regime has sparked frustration among Members of Congress over the Treasury Department's failure to designate China as a currency manipulator since 1994. This designation could increase pressure on China to reform its currency, according to the Treasury Department's November 2005 currency report. The Treasury Department's currency report states that identifying \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" is complex. Proposed bills aim to increase pressure on China to reform its currency, potentially leading to designation as a currency manipulator. The U.S. government could persuade China to reform its currency policy through direct negotiations. President Bush and officials believe China's currency policy is detrimental to its economy and global growth. Efforts have been made to assist China in financial sector reform and encourage policies for greater domestic consumption. The U.S. is working with China to promote domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports. China has been attending G-7 finance meetings since 2004, with currency policy being a major topic. The U.S. is pressuring China to make its currency more flexible. The United States could build consensus within the G-7 to pressure China on currency reform or engage in talks with East Asian economies. This approach aims to address concerns about China's impact on regional exports and encourage the IMF to assist China in understanding economic risks. The United States could urge the IMF to work with China on understanding economic risks of over-relying on exports and domestic investment. Pressure could be applied through threats of trade sanctions or tariffs on Chinese imports unless their currency appreciates. Legislation like H.R. 1002 proposes additional tariffs on Chinese goods to push for currency appreciation. Legislation is being considered to impose sanctions on China if it does not appreciate its currency to fair market levels. Proponents believe that threats of tariffs have been effective in the past, while opponents argue that sanctions may violate WTO rules and could backfire. Some proposals aim to impose sanctions on currency policies without violating WTO rules. S. 1607 proposes sanctions on countries with misaligned policies, including denying access to U.S. government procurement and cutting off financing. Critics argue that China's currency policy violates WTO rules, and the U.S. could file a case with the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. If ruled in favor, China would need to modify its currency policy or face trade sanctions. The advantage of using the WTO is a multilateral approach, but there is no guarantee of a favorable ruling. The United States could use a multilateral approach through the WTO to address China's currency policy, potentially initiating a Section 301 case. Failure to use WTO dispute resolution procedures may lead to China filing a case against the U.S. in the WTO. The USTR rejected two Section 301 petitions on China's exchange rate policy, one from the China Currency Coalition and another from 30 Members of Congress. The Bush Administration expressed doubts about winning a WTO case against China over its currency practices. Various bills contain provisions to compel U.S. officials to take action under certain circumstances. H.R. 321, H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, S. 1607, and S. 1677 include provisions to bring a case against China over its currency policy. H.R. 321 also urges the U.S. to work within the WTO to update rules on currency manipulation. Commerce Department previously argued countervailing laws couldn't apply to non-market economies like China, but in 2006 pursued a case against certain products. In November 2006, the Commerce Department pursued a countervailing case against Chinese paper products, imposing duties ranging from 11 to 20%. China's currency policy is seen as an export subsidy under U.S. countervailing laws. Bills like H.R. 782 and S. 796 aim to apply countervailing laws to non-market economies. Several bills aim to apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China, including addressing currency misalignment as an actionable offense. Critics argue that determining the subsidy level from China's currency manipulation would be challenging and could lead to WTO challenges. Critics of China's currency policy believe that undervaluing the yuan significantly impacts the price of Chinese exports to the U.S. Critics argue that undervaluing the yuan significantly affects Chinese exports to the U.S., harming many U.S. industries. Proposed bills would factor in currency misalignment when determining antidumping duties, but challenges exist in accurately quantifying undervaluation. Utilizing U.S. trade remedy laws or invoking safeguard provisions could be alternative options to address the issue. The United States could use safeguard provisions to restrict Chinese imports causing market disruption to domestic producers, as seen with textile and apparel imports. The Bush Administration reached an agreement with China in 2005 to limit certain exports to the U.S. until 2008. The Bush Administration reached an agreement with China in 2005 to limit textile and apparel exports to the U.S. through 2008. H.R. 782 and S. 796 propose considering China's exchange rate misalignment in determining market disruption under the safeguard. Policy analysts caution against pressuring China too much on its currency policy, suggesting a more comprehensive approach to trade relations. Policymakers aim to address China's currency policy as part of a broader U.S. trade strategy to push for economic reforms and address various trade issues. U.S. officials urge China to increase domestic consumption and make its currency policy more flexible to tackle global trade imbalances and comply with WTO commitments. Key concerns include market access, protection of intellectual property rights, industrial policies favoring domestic content, and indirect subsidization of Chinese state-owned enterprises. The United States aims to push China to liberalize its economy and open its markets, leveraging China's WTO commitments. Policymakers are concerned about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt and the potential use of it as a political tool. China's leaders may be more responsive to international rules than direct U.S. pressure. China could use its large holdings of U.S. Treasuries as a political tool against the United States, threatening to make the dollar collapse if trade sanctions are imposed. This prompted concern among U.S. policymakers, including Senator Charles Grassley, who sought clarification from the Chinese government. The Chinese ambassador reassured that China does not have plans to drastically adjust its holdings. The Chinese ambassador reassured Senator Grassley that China does not plan to adjust its foreign reserves structure drastically. China considers dollar-denominated assets important in its investment portfolio and is a responsible investor. Liquidating a large portion of its dollar assets would impact the dollar's value but is unlikely to happen due to potential losses for China. China's potential liquidation of dollar assets could lead to a sharp yuan appreciation, causing capital loss and lower asset value. The move may also reduce U.S. economic growth and demand for imports from China. The China Investment Corporation was launched in 2007 to manage foreign reserves, potentially diversifying away from dollar assets like Treasury securities. China's potential diversification away from dollar assets, like Treasury securities, could impact U.S. interest rates. If the yuan appreciates, U.S. exports may increase, reducing the bilateral trade deficit. However, U.S. borrowers would need to find new lenders, leading to a rise in interest rates and reduced spending. If China reduces its demand for U.S. assets, U.S. borrowers will need new lenders, causing interest rates to rise. This could lead to reduced spending on investments, housing, and consumer goods, impacting the U.S. economy. Additionally, a rise in the yuan's value could increase import prices and inflationary pressures in the United States. A rise in the yuan's value could lead to import price increases and inflationary pressures. Moving to a floating exchange rate may result in the removal of capital controls in China, potentially causing a large private capital outflow due to fears of the state banking system's instability. Citizens fear their deposits in the state banking system are unsafe, causing concerns about a potential capital outflow affecting the exchange rate. China may consider floating its exchange rate while maintaining capital controls to prevent currency depreciation. China may consider floating its exchange rate to address concerns about capital outflow affecting the exchange rate. This could lead to difficulties in imposing effective capital controls, but could also help adjust the real exchange rate over time. However, this adjustment may not guarantee the elimination of the bilateral trade deficit. China's high saving rate and the US's low saving rate contribute to their trade imbalances. Even with a floating exchange rate, persistent trade deficits can occur. China's low-cost labor and productivity gains continue to drive exports to the US, unaffected by currency appreciation. The debate over China's currency policy remains a key issue for US policymakers. The significant appreciation of the yuan since 2005 has not reduced the trade deficit with the US. The debate among US policymakers over China's currency policy is linked to concerns about the trade deficit, decline in manufacturing employment, and China's economic rise. Economists believe that China's currency would likely appreciate against the dollar if allowed to float, but the trade deficit has not fallen in response to the yuan's appreciation so far. The debate over the effects of yuan appreciation on the U.S. economy is complex, with considerations for various economic sectors and consumers. Factors affecting manufacturing employment include productivity growth, shifts to the service sector, and the overall trade deficit. It is unclear if production has shifted to China from the U.S. or other low-wage countries. Foreign multinational corporations play a significant role in China's manufactured exports. The debate over the effects of yuan appreciation on the U.S. economy is complex, with considerations for various economic sectors and consumers. Foreign multinational corporations play a significant role in China's manufactured exports, complicating the issue of who benefits from China's trade. There is considerable debate over what policy options would promote U.S. economic interests since changes to the current system would produce both winners and losers. Chinese officials plan to make the currency more flexible in the near term and eventually adopt a floating currency. They insist on gradual reforms to avoid disruptions to the economy, citing the need for further banking system reforms and reducing non-performing loans. However, the current currency policy may be expanding the money supply, leading to easy credit policies and potentially more non-performing loans. China's currency policy promotes easy credit by banks, leading to more non-performing loans. Efforts to limit bank loans in booming sectors are mainly government-directed, undermining a market-based financial system. US officials criticize China's cautious exchange rate reforms, which prevent adjustments in global trade imbalances. China's currency policy is criticized for being overly cautious and preventing adjustments in global trade imbalances, particularly in the United States. Both countries agree on the need for major economic reforms, with China focusing on boosting domestic consumption and the US on increasing domestic saving. China plans to enhance economic development in the hinterland and invest in social security, healthcare, and education, but implementation will take time. Currency legislation in the 110th Congress aims to address China's currency manipulation. Currency legislation in the 110th Congress aims to address China's currency manipulation through bills such as H.R. 321 and H.R. 782/S. 796. These bills require the Treasury Department to determine if China has manipulated its currency, impose tariffs equal to the estimated manipulation rate, and apply U.S. countervailing laws to products from non-market economies like China. Exchange rate misalignment would also be actionable under these bills. The bills in the 110th Congress address China's currency manipulation by imposing tariffs and applying countervailing laws to products from non-market economies like China. They also make exchange rate misalignment actionable and include currency misalignment as a factor in determining safeguard measures on imports of Chinese products causing market disruption. H.R. 1002 would impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods unless China stops manipulating its currency, while H.R. 2942 applies countervailing laws to nonmarket economies and considers an undervalued currency in determining actions. H.R. 2942 (Tim Ryan) and other bills aim to address China's currency manipulation by applying countervailing laws to nonmarket economies, making undervalued currency a factor in determining antidumping and countervailing duties. The bills require Treasury to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies and take action in the WTO if consultations fail to resolve the currency issues. S. 364 (Rockefeller) and S. 1607 (Baucus) also address currency manipulation by applying U.S. countervailing laws and requiring the Treasury Department to designate misaligned currencies for priority action. The U.S. would take action against countries with undervalued currencies, including imposing antidumping duties, banning federal procurement, and opposing multilateral financing. If necessary, a case would be filed in the WTO and the Treasury Department may intervene in currency markets. A bill requiring the Treasury to identify currency manipulators passed the Senate Finance Committee. The Finance Committee approved bills requiring the Treasury Department to identify currency manipulators and take action, including filing cases in the WTO. Several bills in the 109th Congress addressed foreign exchange rate policies, with a comparison provided in Table 8. A proposed amendment would impose tariffs on Chinese goods if their currency did not appreciate. The Senate failed to reject S.Amdt. 309 imposing a tariff on Chinese goods. Senator Schumer pushed for consideration of S. 295 due to disappointment over China's currency reforms. Senator Schumer pushed for consideration of S. 295 to reform China's currency policy, but delayed the bill after assessing China's commitment to reform. Despite disappointment with China's progress, Schumer and Graham were persuaded by President Bush to give more time for negotiations with China. H.R. 3283 (English) passed on July 27, 2005, applying U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China and requiring the Treasury Department to define \"currency manipulation.\" A similar bill, S. 1421 (Collins), was introduced in the Senate."
