    "content": "Economics is the study of efficient use of scarce resources and trade for mutual enrichment. Countries benefit from trade by producing efficiently and trading for goods produced less efficiently, driven by comparative advantage. Trade allows for higher standard of living and consumer welfare through imports of goods and services. The United States imports for various reasons including goods that cannot be produced domestically in sufficient quantities or are more cost-effective to produce by foreign firms. Trade allows for access to a variety of goods at lower costs, benefiting consumers and controlling inflation. It also helps producers access lower-cost inputs, improving global competitiveness and expanding production for economies of scale. Trade, through markets for exports, allows domestic firms to exploit economies of scale and benefit from increasing returns to scale. Economist David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage explains how specialization and trade can be mutually beneficial, even if a country is more efficient in producing all goods. Trade leads to greater competition, encourages innovation and investment in research and development, ultimately supporting increased productivity and economic growth. David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage explains that specialization and trade can lead to mutual benefits for countries. By focusing on producing goods in which they have a comparative advantage, countries can trade for goods they produce less efficiently, resulting in gains from trade. Subsequent economic theories have built upon and refined the concept of comparative advantage. Subsequent economic theories have expanded on and qualified the theory of comparative advantage, examining complex trade patterns in the 21st century with the rise of global value chains, services, digital trade, and cross-border flows of data and technology. Differences in comparative advantage between countries may arise due to variations in factor endowments such as labor, physical capital, human capital, and technology. Countries are predicted to have a comparative advantage in activities that utilize their abundant factors of production. Economic theory predicts that countries will have a comparative advantage in activities that utilize their abundant factors of production. For example, the United States has a relative abundance of high-skilled labor, leading to a comparative advantage in producing goods like aircraft. Differences in technology and government policies can also influence comparative advantage. The ICT revolution has facilitated knowledge and technology flows across countries, impacting trade patterns. Policies can influence comparative advantage through indirect or direct means. Indirect policies include eliminating corruption, enforcing property rights, and liberalizing trade barriers. Direct policies like subsidies or tariffs can promote strategic industries needing government support. Debate exists on the effectiveness of such targeted policies. Protectionist policies can distort trade and investment flows, reduce efficiency, and hinder competitive industries. Intra-industry trade is common among advanced economies, suggesting trade based on economies of scale rather than comparative advantage. Economies of scale lead to more efficient production processes at larger scales. Trade based on economies of scale can lead to more efficient production processes at larger scales. Countries tend to specialize in producing and trading a subset of goods due to limited productive capacity. Overall, trade is seen as a positive force driving changes in employment, wages, income distribution, and standard of living, with benefits including resource efficiency, competition, and economies of scale. Trade benefits include more efficient resource use, competition, economies of scale, and consumer gains through lower prices and more choices. Increased trade can boost GDP, efficiency, and consumer welfare. Global trade liberalization has reduced extreme poverty by half in the past 25 years. However, trade benefits are not evenly distributed, with some sectors disrupted and costs concentrated in certain regions and industries. The impact of trade on jobs and wages is debated due to various factors, including technological changes. The economic impact of trade on jobs and wages is a widely debated issue. While economic analyses show that trade brings overall gains, the challenge lies in how to help those negatively affected by market forces, such as trade. Economists argue that policies aiding adjustment and compensating for losses are more cost-effective than protective measures. Political experts also stress the importance of providing assistance to displaced workers to maintain support for free trade. Policymakers are still discussing the effectiveness of current trade-related assistance policies in the United States. Trade can have different effects on workers in different occupations, causing disruptions and job shifts within industries. Trade liberalization can lead to job reallocation based on comparative advantage, without necessarily resulting in a net loss of jobs. Trade liberalization can lead to job reallocation based on comparative advantage, with estimates suggesting a small share of job loss attributed to trade. While some jobs may be displaced, workers may be reemployed elsewhere, although short-run costs such as reduced wages can be substantial. Increased import competition from China has negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. Increased import competition from China has negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. Most economists argue that equating net imports with unemployment is questionable. U.S. trade deficit and unemployment rate have moved in tandem historically. International trade can impact worker wages positively and negatively. Several studies have examined the impact of international trade on wages of U.S. workers and income inequality. Trade tends to increase returns to capital and high-skilled workers while decreasing returns to low-skilled labor. Increased imports, especially from countries like China, could negatively affect wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. The growth of global value chains has led some U.S. multinational corporations to shift low-value, labor-intensive production overseas, impacting low-skilled U.S. workers. However, U.S. workers in export-oriented industries earn more than those in non-exporting industries, with an average earnings premium of 16% in export-intensive manufacturing industries and 15.5% in services. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) estimated a 16% earnings premium in export-intensive manufacturing industries and 15.5% premium in services. Economic globalization involves trade in goods and services, capital flows, technology transfer, and international labor flows. Global trade as a percentage of global GDP increased from 25% to 57% from 1960 to 2017, marking a period of economic globalization since World War II. Global trade as a percentage of global GDP increased from 25% to 57% between 1960 and 2017, driven by economic globalization post-World War II. The integration of the world economy was aided by advancements in transport and communication, reducing barriers to international exchange. Policymakers have also worked to lower barriers such as tariffs and quotas. The debate continues on the overall impact of globalization on living standards worldwide. Globalization has led to increased global trade, with a focus on global value chains (GVCs) organized by multinational corporations. These chains involve the production of goods across multiple countries, contributing to over half of global manufacturing imports being intermediate goods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data shows that a significant portion of global services imports are also intermediate services. The debate on globalization's impact on inequality and living standards continues. Global value chains (GVCs) play a crucial role in the global economy, with 75% of global services imports being intermediate services. The international fragmentation of production has increased trade associated with final products and blurred the distinction between advanced economies, emerging markets, and developing countries. GVCs have facilitated lower trade barriers, technological advances, faster international transport, and accelerated information flow across borders. The evolution of global value chains (GVCs) has blurred the distinction between exports and imports, making it challenging to determine who benefits from global trade. Trade in intermediates has made imports essential inputs for exports, impacting policies that affect both imports and exports. Analysts predict fundamental shifts in GVCs that will shape the future of globalization and policy challenges. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a significant driver of trade, as trade and investment flows are complementary. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a major driver of trade, supporting the development of global value chains by multinational corporations. FDI leads to inter- and intra-firm trade, where components are sent between locations to create final products. U.S. firms often invest abroad to sell products. U.S. firms invest abroad to sell goods and services to foreign markets, adapting to local preferences. In 2016, 11% of sales from U.S. foreign affiliates went to U.S. parent companies, 59% to the host country, and 30% to other foreign countries. Some firms establish operations abroad for production, access to resources, or to reach new markets. Foreign firms invest in the U.S. for access to the consumer market, skilled labor, and resources. Greater global integration through trade and investment flows can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing. U.S. multinational corporations focus on high-end activities like research and development, while outsourcing production abroad. While globalization may not significantly impact overall U.S. employment, it could result in greater income volatility and employment shifts in certain sectors. While globalization and trade liberalization may not greatly affect the overall U.S. employment rate, there could be increased volatility in worker incomes and shifts in employment across sectors. For instance, moving manufacturing assembly overseas could reduce U.S. manufacturing jobs but create more service-related jobs. Globalization also impacts wealth distribution by potentially lowering wages for lower-skilled U.S. workers facing foreign competition and increasing returns to capital. The OECD found that about 10% of the decline in labor share in advanced economies is due to globalization, including pressure from production delocalization and import competition from low-wage countries. Globalization has contributed marginally to rising U.S. wage inequality, with studies suggesting a 10% to 20% factor. Most-favored-nation treatment (MFN) in the World Trade Organization requires members to grant equal trade benefits to all members, with some exceptions allowed. Most-favored nation (MFN) treatment in the World Trade Organization requires equal trade benefits for all members, with exceptions allowed for trade agreements and special treatment for developing countries. National treatment ensures non-discrimination between domestic and foreign products, services, and intellectual property rights. \"Most-favored nation (MFN) trade status, known as permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) in U.S. law, ensures equal treatment of trading partners. Countries without PNTR face higher duty rates on imports. Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries not receiving it at the time of the law's enactment. The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies PNTR status to countries restricting freedom of emigration.\" The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies PNTR status to countries restricting freedom of emigration. As a WTO member, the United States must extend MFN treatment to all members. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule determines tariffs on imported goods using a structure of tariff classification developed by the World Customs Organization. The Harmonized System (HS) developed by the World Customs Organization groups 1,200 product headings into 96 chapters. Each heading is divided into product subheadings at the four-digit and six-digit levels, totaling 5,000 groups of goods at the 6-digit level. HS codes are standard worldwide up to the 6-digit level, while the U.S. further subdivides them into 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines unique to the country. The U.S. International Trade Commission publishes and updates the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The Harmonized System (HS) groups 1,200 product headings into 96 chapters. Each heading is divided into subheadings at different levels. The U.S. further subdivides them into 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines unique to the country. U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the tariff code, while rules of origin (ROO) determine product nationality for imports. ROO are crucial for determining duty rates and eligibility for trade programs. Origin determination can be complex due to global sourcing of parts. The U.S. negotiates different ROO within its FTAs to ensure eligible trading partners. The United States negotiates rules of origin (ROO) within its FTAs to ensure only eligible trading partners receive tariff benefits. The \"yarn-forward\" rule in apparel requires yarn and fabric to come from FTA partners, impacting import-sensitive industries. Some argue the rule is strict, while others say it is crucial for the U.S. industry's survival. Global trade is a significant driver of the global economy, with trade as a share of global GDP increasing from 25% in 1960 to about 57% in 2017. Global trade has been a key engine of the global economy, with trade as a share of global GDP rising from 25% in 1960 to about 57% in 2017. Trade openness and reforms have led to higher productivity, real incomes, and reduced poverty worldwide. While trade growth outpaced GDP growth for decades after World War II, recent years have seen a slowdown attributed to various factors such as weak import demand, exchange rate fluctuations, and falling commodity prices. However, trade growth has rebounded since then, increasing from 2%. Global trade growth rebounded from 2% in 2016 to over 5% in 2017, driven by increased investment and consumption expenditure. The IMF and WTO projected a trade growth rebound for 2018 and 2019, but now expect a slowdown due to rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Restrictive trade measures by the US and its partners are affecting trade flows and prices, impacting businesses' outlooks and investment plans. The top-five largest trading economies in 2017 were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The EU would be the largest trading economy if its 28 members are treated as a single bloc. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The U.S. share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9%. In 2017, the United States was the second-largest exporter behind China and the largest importer and exporter in services trade. The U.S. share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9% due to the rapid increase of global trade. U.S. exports and imports of goods and services combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP in 2017. The United States ranked first in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. In 2017, the United States was the second-largest exporter behind China and the largest importer and exporter in services trade. U.S. exports have grown more than 40% over the past decade, while imports have grown more than 20%. Trade relative to GDP has risen markedly since 1960, with U.S. exports as a percent of GDP expanding from 5% to 12% in 2017. China was the top U.S. trading partner in 2017, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is both the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States, accounting for a significant portion of U.S. global trade. Multinational corporations now operate globally, utilizing inputs from various countries, leading to complex value chains and trade in intermediate goods. Traditional trade statistics may not accurately reflect the true source of resources used in production or who benefits from the trade. Traditional trade statistics may not accurately reflect the true source of resources used in production or who benefits from the trade. For example, U.S. imports from China often include components from multiple countries, but the full value is attributed to China. This can lead to an inflated bilateral trade balance. The \"trade deficit\" between the U.S. and China is often inflated due to the way imports are attributed. \"Trade in value-added\" (TiVA) aims to accurately identify the origin of value added in goods and services. According to TiVA estimates, the U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third in 2011 if measured this way. The trade balance is the difference between a country's exports and imports of goods and services. The trade deficit is the difference between a country's exports and imports of goods and services. It indicates that a nation consumes more than it produces and does not save enough domestically to fund its investment needs. The United States has had trade deficits annually since WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017. The deficit is mainly driven by goods trade, while the U.S. usually runs annual surpluses in services. In 2017, the United States had a $449.1 billion current account deficit, down from its peak of $806 billion in 2006. The deficit was due to reduced demand for imports after the global financial crisis in 2008 and the decline in commodity prices and U.S. oil imports. The U.S. global trade deficit reflects that the country consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports. The U.S. global trade deficit reflects that the country consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports. Economists attribute the deficit to an imbalance between domestic savings and total investment, with low rates of savings leading to borrowing from countries like China. This borrowing fuels economic growth, boosting consumption and demand for imports, resulting in a trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit is influenced by factors like economic growth differences between countries and the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency. Foreign investors seek dollar-denominated assets during economic stress, sustaining the deficit. As long as foreigners continue to finance the lack of savings in the U.S. economy, the trade deficit can persist. The deficit relative to the economy's size is used to analyze trends and compare with other countries. The U.S. trade deficit relative to GDP reached a historic high of 5.8% in 2006 but has since declined to 2.3% in 2017. Countries with current account deficits, like the U.S., are net borrowers. The U.S., UK, and Canada had the largest deficits, while the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea had surpluses. The United States has the largest current account deficits as a percent of GDP, while countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea have surpluses. Some policymakers believe U.S. trade deficits with countries like China are due to unfair trade practices. However, reducing protectionist measures may not necessarily lead to smaller overall trade deficits. The United States has large trade deficits, but reducing protectionist measures may not necessarily decrease overall deficits. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by factors beyond trade barriers, such as economic development, raw materials, and technological change. The United States trade deficits are influenced by various factors including economic development, raw materials, and technological change. Bilateral trade deficits with certain partners reflect complex supply chain relationships, impacting exchange rates and causing a surplus of U.S. dollars to flow abroad, potentially leading to higher import costs for Americans. The excess supply of U.S. dollars abroad can lower its value relative to other currencies, making imports more expensive for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers, potentially reducing the trade deficit. However, the dollar's global status as a reserve currency and safe haven for investments, especially for countries like China, can lead to appreciation when foreigners buy U.S. Treasury securities, making U.S. exports more expensive. Foreign governments also intervene to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar by buying dollars and investing in the U.S. Some countries, like China, intervene in currency markets to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar by buying dollars and investing in the U.S. This intervention has been criticized for hindering the realignment of global trade balances. Trade deficits reflect a savings/investment shortfall, leading to the United States borrowing from abroad. Concerns arise from the debt accumulation due to sustained trade deficits. The impact of borrowing to finance imports depends on whether the funds are used for productive investments or current consumption. Borrowing to finance new technology or productivity-enhancing products can result in a deficit that can be paid off with higher economic growth. However, borrowing for consumer purchases pushes repayment to future generations without raising the ability to finance those repayments. A rising U.S. trade deficit could lead to a fall in the value of the dollar, risking financial turmoil. Many economists argue that reducing the trade deficit without addressing underlying issues may not be effective. Many economists argue that reducing the U.S. trade deficit without addressing underlying macroeconomic imbalances could harm the economy and have little long-term impact on the trade balance. Ways to reduce the current account deficit include increasing domestic savings, realigning exchange rates, and ensuring other countries do not manipulate their currencies. Trade policies are not seen as the most effective tool for balancing trade. In 2017, the U.S. exported $1.3 trillion in goods and imported $2.0 trillion. In 2017, the United States exported $1.3 trillion in manufactured goods and imported $2.0 trillion, resulting in a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion. U.S. manufactures accounted for 56% of total exports and 70% of total imports. The top exports and imports included transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, chemicals, and machinery. Global value chains have transformed U.S. manufacturing, leading to the expansion of production requiring advanced technology and less labor. Labor-intensive activities like assembly have moved abroad for many products. The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen a shift towards advanced technology and less labor-intensive activities, leading to factory closings and layoffs. While there has been a decline in manufacturing employment, output has increased due to higher productivity. Reports of merchandise made in other countries have contributed to the perception of a shrinking manufacturing sector. Since 1980, U.S. manufacturing output has increased significantly, reflecting higher productivity and fewer workers needed. Despite a decline in its share of GDP, manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy. Employment in manufacturing has decreased since its peak in 1979 but has been rising since 2010. In 2017, manufacturing accounted for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment, down from 20.7% in 1980. In recent years, employment in manufacturing has been on the rise, with the services sector expanding significantly. The decline in manufacturing employment is a global trend, not unique to the United States, and is influenced by factors such as technology, consumer preferences, and trade dynamics. Some attribute the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs to increased imports from China, while others argue that job losses have been offset by gains in other sectors. Increased imports from China led to a decline in U.S. manufacturing employment in the 2000s, but job losses were offset by gains in services from global exports. Trade, automation, and other factors have all played a role in the restructuring of the U.S. manufacturing sector. Despite challenges in measuring manufacturing activity, it remains a significant component of the U.S. economy, accounting for a large portion of private-sector research and development and exports. In 2017, U.S. agricultural exports totaled $138 billion, with imports at $121 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $17 billion. Agriculture accounts for 6% of total U.S. exports and 4% of imports, with exports making up about 20% of total farm production value. Foreign markets play a significant role in the agricultural sector. Foreign markets are crucial for U.S. agricultural goods, with exports accounting for 20% of total farm production value. Imports of products like coffee, cocoa, spices, fish, and juices play a significant role in U.S. food consumption. \"Services\" encompass various economic activities that support the economy, including transportation, telecommunications, and financial services. Services such as transportation, telecommunications, and financial services play a vital role in supporting the economy by facilitating the movement of goods and providing credits for manufacturing. Barriers to trade in services, unlike those for goods, often involve regulations within the importing country that may favor domestic providers over foreign ones. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion in services, with exports totaling $798 billion and imports at $542 billion. Services trade accounted for 34% of total U.S. exports and 19% of total U.S. imports, playing a significant role in the economy by contributing to 79% of U.S. GDP and 82% of U.S. private sector full-time employment. Unlike trade in goods, the U.S. consistently exports more services than it imports. The United States has a trade surplus in services, with exports exceeding imports. Trade deficits in goods are partially offset by surpluses in services. Trade data may underestimate services trade, as services inputs are not fully accounted for. Value-added services like R&D, design, and engineering play a crucial role in the value chain of manufacturing and agriculture. Digital trade, including online shopping, communication channels, and financial services, plays a significant role in facilitating economic activity and enhancing productivity. It encompasses services like online health and educational services, as well as the transmission of information for business operations. Nontariff barriers in digital trade can restrict what firms offer in a market or how they operate. Trade constraints can be classified as tariff or nontariff barriers, with nontariff barriers establishing restrictions that affect a firm's offerings and operations in a market. Digital trade, being intangible, faces barriers in the form of localization requirements that restrict commercial data flow. Data transfer regulations, such as data localization barriers, may limit the type of services a firm can sell or how it can communicate and share data internationally. The United States has historically focused on supporting economic growth through trade policies that reduce barriers and enforce trade commitments. Another key objective is to advance strategic goals by promoting economic development and integration in developing countries. The U.S. trade policy aims to support economic development, strengthen alliances, and advance strategic goals. Key objectives include promoting national security, negotiating better trade deals, enforcing trade laws, and reforming the multilateral trading system. The U.S. government plays a crucial role in formulating trade policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing trade laws, and administering trade. The U.S. government plays a crucial role in formulating and coordinating trade policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing trade laws, and administering trade programs. Congress collaborates with the executive branch on trade agreements, while the USTR and various agencies are involved in implementing trade policy through interagency coordination. The U.S. government, through various agencies like the Commerce Department and Department of Agriculture, plays a key role in trade policy. Congress has primary authority over trade policy, enacting tariff schedules, trade remedy laws, and approving trade agreements. U.S. trade policy is shaped by Congress through tariff schedules, trade remedy laws, and reciprocal trade agreements. Congress delegates powers to the President for negotiating trade agreements and taking executive action. Congressional oversight ensures conformity to U.S. law and intent. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the President to enter into agreements to reduce tariffs within approved levels and implement new tariffs without additional legislation. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded this authority to open markets and negotiate international trade norms. Congressional committees oversee trade policy due to revenue implications. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee, along with other relevant committees, have primary responsibility for trade matters. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations provide advice to USTR during trade agreement negotiations. Separate Congressional Advisory Groups (CAGs) are established for both houses: a House Advisory Group on Negotiations (HAG) and a Senate Advisory Group on Negotiations (SAG). CAGs can receive briefings and access trade negotiating documents. Individual Members influence trade policy through voting, serving on relevant committees, providing testimony, writing letters to USTR, and exerting informal influence over other Members. Trade promotion authority (TPA), or \"fast track,\" is the process for approving most trade agreements. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements by Congress through a guaranteed up-or-down vote with no amendments. Negotiations must meet specific requirements and reflect the objectives outlined in the TPA statute, with consultations and notifications to Congress and stakeholders. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements by Congress through a guaranteed up-or-down vote with no amendments. TPA defines how Congress exercises its authority over trade policy, giving the President negotiating credibility and assuring U.S. trading partners that the final agreement will be considered by Congress in a timely manner. Congress first enacted TPA in 1974 and has renewed it four times, with the most recent legislation signed into law on June 29, 2015. The executive branch is responsible for executing trade policy, with the President conducting foreign relations and negotiating treaties with other nations. The President is responsible for conducting foreign relations, negotiating treaties, and overseeing U.S. trade agreements. The executive branch handles customs enforcement, trade laws, budget proposals, and export/import policies. The USTR advises the President on trade policy and is in charge of developing, coordinating, and enforcing trade agreements. The USTR is responsible for developing and implementing trade policy, negotiating trade agreements, and enforcing U.S. trade laws. It reports annually to Congress on the President's trade policy agenda and foreign trade barriers. Established in 1962, the USTR aims to balance domestic and international interests in trade policy, previously managed by the State Department. Various departments and agencies within the executive branch handle delegated trade functions. The executive branch agencies, including the USTR, coordinate trade functions and policy decisions with input from advisory groups. Other key agencies involved in trade enforcement include Commerce, Agriculture, State, Treasury, Homeland Security, and Labor. The Trade Policy Committee, chaired by the USTR, oversees a multidepartment interagency process for trade negotiations. The President influences trade legislation and policies, with input from various government agencies and advisory groups. Trade policy decisions are made at different levels, including the Trade Policy Review Group and the Trade Policy Staff Committee. Trade advisory committees provide advice to the executive branch on trade matters. The President influences trade legislation and policies through direct participation in various trade policy areas. This includes requesting TPA, initiating trade remedy cases, and deciding on import restrictions. The private sector and stakeholders play a role in U.S. trade policy through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress. The system includes 28 committees with citizen advisors, administered by USTR's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs & Public Engagement. The three-tier committee system established by Congress includes the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN), five general policy advisory committees, and 20 technical advisory committees. These committees ensure that U.S. public and private sector views are considered in trade policies and programs, providing information and advice on negotiating objectives for trade agreements. Private sector, NGOs, and labor groups also influence U.S. trade policy through various channels such as testifying before congressional committees. Private sector representatives and NGOs testify before congressional committees and government bodies like the U.S. International Trade Commission to provide assessments on trade negotiations. The executive branch seeks comments from stakeholders on trade initiatives through Federal Register notices. Private sector, NGOs, and labor groups lobby Congress and the executive branch to promote their interests in U.S. trade policies and agreements. Trade is vital to the U.S. economy, with agricultural and manufactured goods being exportable and importable. Trade is a crucial aspect of the U.S. economy, encompassing a wide range of goods and services that can be traded internationally. The decisions made regarding trade policies and agreements can have significant impacts on various industries, businesses, and workers in the United States, influencing employment, economic growth, product choices, and prices for consumers. Market access in different countries and nontariff issues like intellectual property rights and labor and environmental protections are also key considerations in trade agreements. The focus on trade agreements has expanded to include nontariff issues like intellectual property rights and labor and environmental protections, leading to increased stakeholder interest. Various groups advocate for their trade policy views, while legal challenges can be brought in federal court by parties affected by governmental trade decisions. This may involve customs classification, antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings, national security investigations, or challenges to state economic sanctions. The federal government can initiate legal proceedings against individuals and firms to enforce customs laws or statutory restrictions on imports and exports. Some trade statutes may prevent judicial review, such as preliminary determinations in AD and CVD proceedings. Court decisions can have a significant impact on U.S. trade policy by examining agency actions and interpretations of statutory mandates. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, and import embargoes. It consists of nine judges and plays a significant role in interpreting trade statutes and enforcing customs laws. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) was renamed in 1980 and consists of nine judges with jurisdiction over trade-related matters. Judges are appointed by the President and decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The court enforces customs laws and interprets trade statutes. The United States participates in trade agreements to reduce tariffs and barriers, gain competitive advantages, increase market access, encourage liberalization, and strengthen alliances. Trade agreements are categorized as multilateral agreements negotiated in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and free trade agreements (FTAs) negotiated outside the WTO. The United States has 14 FTAs in force, covering 20 countries, with nearly 300 trade agreements globally. U.S. FTAs mainly involve small, developing countries, while some include major trading partners. The United States has 14 FTAs in force, covering 20 countries, with the majority being small, developing countries. U.S. trade policy under the Trump Administration has shifted towards bilateral trade deals, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiating existing FTAs. The United States under the Trump Administration has shifted towards bilateral trade deals, renegotiating existing FTAs and proposing new negotiations. This includes the signing of the USMCA and amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA. Future trade agreements are also being considered with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. The United States, under the Trump Administration, has shifted towards bilateral trade deals, renegotiating existing FTAs and proposing new negotiations. This includes the signing of the USMCA and amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA. Future trade agreements are also being considered with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. U.S. FTAs are comprehensive, covering tariff reductions, services trade, foreign investment, intellectual property rights, government procurement, labor standards, environment, and digital trade. The United States has over 50 Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) with developing countries, allowing for consultations on economic interests. TIFAs do not require congressional approval and can lead to Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) or bilateral investment treaties (BITs). The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1947 post-WWII to create an international economic framework. It governed international trade for 47 years until the World Trade Organization (WTO) was formed in 1995. The GATT focused on lowering tariffs and applying them in a non-discriminatory manner, known as the most-favored nation principle. The WTO, established in 1995, enforces trade rules and agreements among its 164 members, including the US, to reduce tariffs and create fair trade practices. It also facilitates negotiations for trade liberalization and resolves disputes. The WTO succeeded the GATT, which was founded in 1947 and focused on tariff reduction and non-discriminatory trade practices. The WTO, established in 1995, succeeded the GATT and administers various trade agreements including GATT, GATS, TRIPS, GPA, and ITA. The Doha Development Agenda, initiated in 2001, faced challenges due to differences among the US, EU, and developing countries on issues like agriculture, tariffs, services, and trade remedies. The WTO's effectiveness in negotiating trade liberalization has been questioned since the collapse of the Doha Round. Members are exploring reforms to improve the organization's role in global trade and dispute resolution. Proposed reforms also aim to enhance the WTO's dispute settlement system. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body amid concerns over \"judicial overreach\" and certain procedures, which could lead to the dispute settlement system ceasing to function by late 2019. WTO members can initiate dispute settlement proceedings to challenge trade practices that violate WTO agreements, starting with consultations and potentially leading to a dispute panel decision that can be appealed to the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO dispute settlement system allows members to request a dispute panel to adjudicate disputes, with decisions appealable to the WTO Appellate Body. If a member is found in violation, they must remove the measure or face retaliatory action. The United States has been heavily involved in WTO disputes, including challenges to recent tariff measures. WTO decisions do not directly impact U.S. law. The WTO dispute settlement system allows members to request a dispute panel to adjudicate disputes, with decisions appealable to the WTO Appellate Body. If a member is found in violation, they must remove the measure or face retaliatory action. The United States has been heavily involved in WTO disputes, including challenges to recent tariff measures imposed by the Trump Administration. WTO decisions do not have direct effect in U.S. law, and compliance with them may require U.S. legislative action. The United States generally complies with WTO decisions by providing compensation to the complainant country. U.S. FTAs also have procedures to resolve disputes, with the option to request a panel to adjudicate. Compliance with panel decisions is expected, with possible trade benefits suspension as a consequence. State-state dispute settlement under U.S. FTAs is not frequently used, with only three cases decided under NAFTA. Countries can choose the forum to bring a dispute if it is common to both FTA and WTO rules. The United States generally complies with WTO decisions by providing compensation to the complainant country. U.S. FTAs also have procedures to resolve disputes, with the option to request a panel to adjudicate. State-state dispute settlement under U.S. FTAs is not frequently used, with only three cases decided under NAFTA. Most U.S. disputes with FTA partners are resolved via consultations or adjudicated under WTO rules. NAFTA and USMCA maintain a unique binational panel system for trade remedy laws. Trade preference programs provide duty-free access to the U.S. market for selected exports from eligible developing countries. The United States has six trade preference programs for eligible developing countries, including GSP, APTA, CBERA, CBTPA, AGOA, and HOPE. GSP is the largest program, covering 120 countries and territories, providing duty-free treatment to thousands of products. In 2017, $21 billion worth of imports entered the U.S. under the GSP program. The United States has six trade preference programs for eligible developing countries, including GSP, APTA, CBERA, CBTPA, AGOA, and HOPE. GSP is the largest program, covering 120 countries and territories, providing duty-free treatment to thousands of products. In 2017, $21 billion imports entered the United States under the GSP program, out of $220 billion total imports from GSP countries. Countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible, including protections for intellectual property rights and worker rights. USTR is currently conducting eligibility reviews of several GSP beneficiary countries. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance to support developing countries' integration and participation in international trade. The U.S. government has viewed TCB as an important way to help developing countries negotiate and implement trade agreements. The U.S. government provides Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance to developing countries to help them negotiate trade agreements, implement reforms, and improve their capacity to benefit from increased trade. USAID receives the most funding for TCB activities, with other agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) also involved. Various departments, including Agriculture, Labor, and State, have TCB responsibilities. Congress has the power to set tariffs, which has been partially delegated. The Constitution empowers Congress to set tariffs, partially delegated to the President. Tariffs historically used for revenue collection, now developed countries like the US rely on other means. US Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs at ports, totaling $32 billion in 2016, just 1% of federal revenue. US has used tariff policy to promote global trade liberalization, reducing tariffs through negotiations and agreements. The United States has reduced tariffs through trade negotiations and agreements since 1934, promoting global trade liberalization. By 2016, U.S. tariffs averaged 3.3%, the lowest among top economies. The Trump Administration has increased tariffs on certain goods from key trading partners. The United States has increased tariffs on certain goods imported from key trading partners using trade remedies such as antidumping and countervailing duty laws. These laws are administered by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration and the U.S. International Trade Commission. Other trade remedy laws include Section 201 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Trade remedy laws in the United States, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, aim to protect U.S. industries from unfair competition. Other trade laws like Section 201 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 focus on import surges and violations of trade agreements. These laws must comply with U.S. WTO obligations. Supporters argue that trade remedies are necessary, while some worry about disguised protectionism and inefficiencies in the global trading system. Antidumping (AD) is a common U.S. trade remedy law used to address unfair trade practices where goods are sold at lower prices in the U.S. than in other markets. AD duties are imposed when foreign goods are sold at \"less than fair value\" and cause harm to U.S. industries. AD orders are subject to annual review if requested. Antidumping (AD) laws are used to address unfair trade practices by imposing duties on goods sold at lower prices in the U.S. than in other markets. AD orders are subject to annual review if requested. Countervailing duty (CVD) laws aim to offset competitive advantages foreign manufacturers may have due to subsidies. CVD duties are levied on imports of subsidized goods into the U.S. The United States has 113 CVD orders in place, with nearly half against China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to restrict imports causing serious harm to domestic industry. Safeguard actions provide temporary relief to domestic industries facing import competition, without requiring allegations of unfair trade practices. The ITC conducts investigations initiated by petitions from trade associations, companies, or unions representing U.S. industries. The ITC conducts safeguard investigations initiated by petitions from trade associations, companies, or unions representing U.S. industries. If imports are found to cause serious injury, recommendations are made to the President for final action. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration, resulting in safeguard measures on solar cells and large residential washing machines. The last safeguard investigation prior to this was in 2001 over steel products. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, known as the \"national security clause,\" allows the President to impose restrictions on imports that threaten national security. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security consults with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies to investigate the impact of imports on national security. The President can then impose tariffs, quotas, or other measures to address any adverse effects. The President can impose tariffs, quotas, or other measures under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to address the impact of U.S. imports on national security. Recent investigations led to tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the U.S. to enforce trade agreements and respond to barriers to exports, such as inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the United States to enforce trade agreements and respond to barriers to exports, including inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. USTR can initiate cases through petitions or self-initiation, seeking negotiated settlements with trading partners. If no resolution is reached, tariffs may be imposed on selected products. The USTR can retaliate with tariffs if a resolution is not reached under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The \"Special 301\" provision requires USTR to report annually to Congress on countries with inadequate IPR protection. USTR designates countries on a three-tier list based on concern levels, with \"Priority Foreign Country\" being the most serious. USTR has initiated 125 Section 301 cases since 1974, retaliating in 16 instances. In 2017, USTR launched an investigation into China's IPR technology policies. USTR initiated a new investigation into China's IPR technology policies that could harm U.S. economic interests. Following findings of unreasonable and discriminatory Chinese policies, the Trump Administration imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports and threatened more. China retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. products. Despite WTO dispute cases, China has not changed its unfair practices. Trump and Xi Jinping agreed to negotiate structural changes on IP and technology issues. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to start negotiations on \"structural changes\" regarding IP, technology, agriculture, and services within 90 days. China agreed to make significant purchases of U.S. agricultural, energy, and industrial products, while the U.S. agreed to suspend planned tariff increases from 10% to 25% on January 1, 2019. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits unfair competition in importing goods to the U.S., including infringement of patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits imports that infringe U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and semiconductor products. The ITC conducts investigations and may issue exclusion orders. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs provide federal assistance to workers and firms affected by trade. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs provide federal assistance to workers and firms affected by trade, authorized by the Trade Act of 1974. TAA for Workers (TAAW) is the largest program, with appropriations of $790 million in FY2019, supporting trade-affected workers with benefits and services including career services, training, and income support. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs provide benefits to workers affected by trade, including Trade Readjustment Allowance. Benefits are distributed through state workforce and unemployment systems. TAA aims to offset the challenges faced by firms and workers due to import competition, justified for economic efficiency and equity reasons. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs aim to help workers affected by trade by facilitating the adjustment process, promoting equity, and generating support for international trade. Despite some skepticism about the cost and effectiveness of TAA, Congress has consistently maintained the program over the past five decades. Several federal agencies, including the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank), support U.S. exports and investment. Several federal agencies, including the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank), the Department of Agriculture, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), administer finance programs to help U.S. firms export and invest in developing countries. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes a new agency to succeed OPIC, with mandates focusing on U.S. commercial interests and foreign policy objectives. U.S. trade financing aims to level the playing field against foreign firms receiving subsidized financing. The Department of Commerce's International Trade activities also play a role in supporting U.S. trade. The Ex-Im Bank provides financial support for U.S. exports to counter foreign government subsidies. Despite reauthorization, the bank is not fully operational due to a lack of board quorum. The Ex-Im Bank, reauthorized in 2015, has faced operational constraints due to unfilled board positions, limiting approval of export financing above $10 million. Presidential appointments to the board require Senate approval, sparking debate over government's role in export financing. Export controls, governed by various acts, aim to balance national security and export competitiveness. The United States restricts exports of defense items, dual-use goods, certain nuclear materials, and items aiding in proliferation of weapons. Export controls are administered by multiple departments and licenses are required for certain exports. The Export Controls Act of 2018 provides authority for implementing dual-use export controls, replacing the Export Administration Act of 1979. The Export Controls Act of 2018 replaced the Export Administration Act of 1979, giving the President broad legislative authority for dual-use export controls. This law allows the Department of Commerce to regulate the export of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" crucial for national security. Dual-use goods have both civilian and military applications and are licensed by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security issues licenses for goods and technologies based on technical characteristics, destination, and end use. Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves acquiring real assets in another country, while foreign portfolio investment (FPI) involves purchasing foreign equities or bonds. FDI stimulates direct employment, while FPI is highly liquid. Official capital flows are generated by governments. Global trade in goods and services grew significantly from 1990 to 2017, with exports increasing from $4 trillion to $23 trillion. Capital flows also expanded, reaching about $4 trillion annually, with a peak of over $12 trillion in 2007. Foreign exchange and derivatives markets saw substantial growth during this period. The foreign exchange and over-the-counter derivatives markets have experienced significant growth, with daily trading of foreign currencies exceeding $5.1 trillion in 2016. Firms invest abroad to increase profits, influenced by factors such as special knowledge or managerial abilities. Major determinants of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) include the presence of multinational corporations with advantages over foreign firms. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is driven by competitive advantages, resources like low-cost labor, and intra-firm relationships. Multinational corporations (MNCs) invest abroad to improve efficiency, gain market share, and access global value chains. Operating close to customers in foreign markets allows firms to adapt to different preferences and access resources like a well-educated workforce. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) allows Multinational Corporations (MNCs) to access resources and markets in foreign countries, improving efficiency and competitiveness. The United States is the largest source and recipient of FDI globally, with developing Asia leading in FDI inflows. According to UNCTAD, the total stock of global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion. In 2017, FDI inflows were led by developing Asia, Europe, North America, Latin America, and Africa. The United States is the largest source and recipient of FDI, with rapid growth in FDI stock from 1985 to 2017. The top destinations for U.S. FDI outflows included the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany, and Japan. The main sources of FDI inflows were the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France, and Ireland. The largest sources of cumulative FDI inflows for the United States included the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France, and Ireland. U.S. outward FDI is concentrated in high-technology, finance, and services sectors, while the largest share of U.S. inward FDI is in the manufacturing sector, primarily chemicals and transport industries. Economists advocate for unimpeded international flows of capital like FDI, as it benefits both the home and host economies by allowing firms to exploit competitive advantages and acquire skills in foreign markets. Direct investment, whether inward or outward, brings various benefits to both home and host countries. It allows firms to exploit competitive advantages, acquire skills, and contribute to technological advances. This leads to a more competitive business environment, increased productivity, and international trade integration. In 2016, the affiliates of multinational corporations played a significant role in U.S. trade, jobs, and production. Foreign firms investing in the United States have a significant impact on the economy, employing millions of workers and contributing billions to GDP. Concerns have been raised about U.S. firms investing abroad and potentially shifting manufacturing and jobs overseas. Data on U.S. firms moving plants or jobs abroad is not officially tracked. Most data on U.S. firms shifting plants or jobs abroad is anecdotal. Outward FDI is mainly in high-income developed countries with similar markets. Economists argue that U.S. direct investment abroad doesn't necessarily lead to job losses or lower incomes for Americans. However, specific companies and sectors can be negatively impacted when production is moved overseas. International investment agreements play a role in these decisions. International investment agreements (IIAs) establish rules on investment protections, with over 2,600 IIAs globally. They aim to reduce FDI restrictions, ensure fair treatment of investors, and safeguard a government's right to regulate in the public interest. U.S. IIAs involve reciprocal commitments for foreign investors in the U.S. and U.S. investors in partner countries. The United States has bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with 40 countries, mainly developing countries. The latest BIT ratified with Rwanda in 2012. The US also has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, most including investment chapters. BIT negotiations with China and India have stalled. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows private parties to settle disputes. The United States has 14 FTAs in force covering 20 countries, most with investment chapters. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows private investors to bring claims against host country governments before an international arbitration panel. ISDS cases have increased with global FDI growth, with U.S. investors accounting for about one-fifth of investment claims worldwide. The growth of global FDI has led to an increase in ISDS cases, with U.S. investors accounting for a significant portion of claims worldwide. The U.S. government has not lost any of the 16 cases brought against it by foreign investors. ISDS provisions are common in U.S. BITs and FTAs, with most cases under NAFTA. The use of ISDS is a topic of debate in recent U.S. trade negotiations, focusing on investor protections and government regulatory rights. The Trump Administration made significant changes to ISDS in the NAFTA renegotiation, with the proposed USMCA aiming to eliminate ISDS between the U.S. and Canada. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), signed in November 2018, aims to eliminate ISDS between the United States and Canada, with specific limits for Mexico. The EU is advocating for an investment court system in its trade agreements. CFIUS, established in 1975, oversees foreign investment transactions that could impact U.S. national security. CFIUS, established in 1975, oversees foreign investment transactions that could impact U.S. national security. The committee's role was expanded in 2007 with the Foreign Investment and National Security Act, giving the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to review and block foreign investments that pose a threat. The President can also block transactions, which has been done five times since 1988. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has the authority to block proposed transactions, which has been invoked five times since 1988. Recent examples include President Trump blocking acquisitions by Chinese and Singapore-based firms. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 expands CFIUS's scope to review non-controlling investments in critical technology or infrastructure, sparking objections about the impact on the U.S. investment climate. The United States promotes both inward and outward foreign direct investment (FDI) through various programs like the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 (BUILD Act). The establishment of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) aims to expand and consolidate development finance functions. SelectUSA, a Department of Commerce program, coordinates efforts to attract FDI to the United States. SelectUSA, established in 2011, coordinates federal efforts to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States by providing information to businesses and economic development organizations, resolving issues with federal programs, and advocating for investments in the U.S."
