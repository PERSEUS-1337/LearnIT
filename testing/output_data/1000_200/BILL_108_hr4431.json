    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"One Church, One Child Act of 2004\". The Congress finds a shortage of qualified foster and adoptive parents, with a decrease in foster parents despite an increase in children in foster care. The number of waiting children for adoption exceeds the number of adoptions, leading to a growing need for post-adoption support. One Church, One Child is a national foster care and adoption ministry established in 1980 in Chicago, Illinois. It aims to provide services for at-risk children and support adoptive families. Over 140,000 children have been placed in adoptive families through its programs. One Church, One Child has successfully placed over 140,000 children in adoptive families nationwide. Despite its success, programs based on this concept have received limited federal funding. The creation of a federally-funded grant program to support programs modeled on One Church, One Child will benefit abused and neglected children by increasing the pool of qualified adoptive and foster parents.
