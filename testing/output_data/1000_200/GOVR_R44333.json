    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising enrollment in health insurance and demographic changes. The tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for health care provision are often overlooked in budget discussions. These subsidies, known as tax expenditures, confer preferential tax status to certain forms of income, resulting in foregone revenue. Congressional attention to health-related tax expenditures raises questions about their value, changes over time, and impact since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. The report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to understand the value and changes over time. It examines how the value of health tax expenditures has changed relative to total revenue collected and compares it to discretionary and mandatory outlays on health programs. The focus is on analyzing these tax expenditures at the budget function level rather than individual provisions. This report analyzes tax expenditures at the budget function level, using the definition and methodology of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). For more detailed information on individual tax expenditures, refer to CRS Committee Print CP10001 and CRS Report R44012. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 defines tax expenditures as revenue losses from special tax provisions. The Joint Committee on Taxation uses a modified income definition to estimate these losses, publishing them during each session of Congress. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates tax expenditures by categorizing provisions based on budget functions like health, commerce, and energy. The Department of the Treasury also lists tax expenditures by budget function. JCT's health budget function is broader than that used by agencies like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) due to historical practices and cross-cutting challenges. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) categorizes tax expenditures based on budget functions like health, commerce, and energy, which differs from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) due to historical practices and cross-cutting challenges. Tax expenditures are also analyzed by forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act, such as exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Academic researchers categorize tax expenditures in various ways, including provisions that substitute for social policy or economic spending programs. Economists evaluate tax expenditures based on their impact. Tax expenditures are categorized based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity. Evaluating these criteria can help identify how policies impact economic distortions and certain groups. For example, tax expenditures in health insurance can correct some market inefficiencies but create others. Exclusions and deductions in tax expenditures may undermine tax progressivity. Administrative considerations show that the tax code can be advantageous in administering social policies for lower-income individuals. The tax code can be advantageous in administering social policies for lower-income households by using information reported on tax forms. However, administering social programs through the tax code may increase complexity and costs. Direct spending or grant programs could be easier for beneficiaries and reduce administrative costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures, excluding Medicare-related provisions. The tax code includes Medicare-related provisions in its estimates. Health tax expenditures are estimated at $234.0 billion in FY2016. The largest tax expenditure is the exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance, increasing from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. The second largest expenditure is subsidies for insurance purchased in exchanges. The tax code includes various health-related provisions, with subsidies for insurance purchased in exchanges being a significant expenditure. The annual tax expenditure for these subsidies is projected to increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. These provisions aim to subsidize private health insurance costs and reduce the expenses of activities with positive societal benefits. Older health tax provisions also play a role in shaping healthcare policy. Some older health tax provisions in the code have origins in legal doctrine or thought about income definitions at the time of adoption. These provisions, like the itemized deduction for charitable giving to nonprofit health organizations, are part of larger categories of activity. The ESI tax exclusion, dating back to 1918, allowed employer payments for individual health coverage to be deductible as a cost of doing business. Regulatory rulings had conflicting views on these provisions. The ESI tax exclusion, originating in 1918, allowed employer payments for individual health coverage to be deductible as a cost of doing business. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 expanded this exclusion, explicitly excluding employer health contributions from income. JCT data on health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019 show changes in the number of provisions over time. The number of provisions within the health category of tax expenditures has changed over time, as provisions have expired or been added. JCT does not typically add multiple tax expenditure values together, as interactions between provisions could affect the total estimated value. After adjusting for inflation, health-related tax expenditures have increased over time. From FY2004 to FY2014, these expenditures increased by 43.0% in real terms. The annual tax expenditure value for health-related provisions has increased by 11.5% in nominal dollars from FY1974 to FY2014. Post-ACA enactment in 2010, growth rates fluctuate around historical averages. In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated to total $234.0 billion, with annual growth rates fluctuating above and below historical averages. Factors contributing to the net growth include changes in demographics, health care costs growing faster than inflation, and policy changes affecting the cost of health-related tax expenditures. Before FY2015, JCT identified Medicare-related tax expenditures as benefits exceeding insurance payments, not the total value of Medicare. Before FY2015, JCT identified Medicare-related tax expenditures as the value of benefits exceeding insurance payments, not the total value of Medicare benefits received. Medicare benefits are excluded from income tax, with a positive tax expenditure only if insurance benefits exceeded payments. For example, a positive tax expenditure for Medicare Part D indicated that insurance value exceeded premiums paid. Tax expenditures for Medicare increased over time, with estimates showing minimal values before FY1987. From FY1987 to FY2014, the annual tax expenditure value for Medicare-related provisions increased by 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) on average. JCT's estimates show that the value of Medicare insurance benefits to beneficiaries grew at a higher rate than payments during this period. In FY2014, Medicare provisions accounted for 26.8% of total health tax expenditures, which have risen from 1.9% of total revenue in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014. This indicates that health-related tax expenditures have increased faster than total revenue collections. The value of health-related tax expenditures has generally increased at a rate greater than the growth of total revenue collections. Health tax expenditures are estimated to increase from 6.4% of total revenue collected in FY2015 to 7.7% in FY2019. Several taxes imposed by the ACA raise revenue, such as the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage, the individual mandate, the employer mandate, and the medical device tax. Additionally, the ACA imposed a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax on higher-income taxpayers. The annual revenue raised by these provisions is small compared to the total value of health tax expenditures. The comparison between OMB's health budget function and JCT's organization of tax expenditures shows differences in activities classified and measurement of changes in expenditures. The comparison between outlays and tax expenditures can track federal support to the health sector over time. Medicare and Medicaid costs are mostly mandatory outlays, while health research and veterans' health care are funded through discretionary spending. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays but were less than health mandatory costs. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays but were still much less than health mandatory outlays. Mandatory health outlays increased from 1.0% of GDP in FY1974 to 5.0% in FY2014, while health tax expenditures grew from 0.3% to 1.5% of GDP during the same period. Health discretionary outlays remained between 0.3% and 0.5% of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. This appendix provides a description and legislative origins of each health tax expenditure provision identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). The report provides a brief description and legislative origins of health tax expenditure provisions identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). These provisions, some of which are long-standing in the Internal Revenue Code, may have had different historical rationales for their creation.
