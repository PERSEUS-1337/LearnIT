    "content": "The Act titled \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" mandates that a minimum of 10 percent of engineering research grants from the National Science Foundation be allocated for coastal engineering and shoreline protection research starting from fiscal year 2001. Additionally, supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas are established. SEC. 3 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose artificial reef and habitat restoration projects instead of fines. SEC. 4 grants access to publicly owned shores. Amendments are made to the eligibility of shoreline protection projects and cost sharing, defining publicly owned shores with insufficient public access as privately owned shores. The term 'privately owned shores' is redefined to include publicly owned shores with insufficient public access. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to ensure public access to every one-half mile of publicly owned shore. Exceptions may be allowed for shores in environmentally sensitive areas. The Beach Nourishment Account is established. The Beach Nourishment Account is established in the Treasury to receive funds from the general fund under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. These funds are to be used for a pilot program by the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA without needing further appropriation. The Beach Nourishment Account is established to receive funds for a pilot program by the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA. Remaining funds are allocated to the Secretary of the Army for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. The Secretary of the Army must adhere to cost-sharing requirements and other project-specific regulations. Transactions in the account must be reported annually. The Beach Nourishment Account receives funds for a pilot program by the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA. Remaining funds are allocated to the Secretary of the Army for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. The Secretary of the Army reports receipts, obligations, and expenditures annually to Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury invests excess funds in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Beach Nourishment Account allows for the sale of acquired obligations at market price. Interest and proceeds from the sale of obligations are credited to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly implement a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. Partnerships will be formed with local interests to collect data on coastal oceans and inland waterways for real-time availability. Data collected will include wave heights, periods, swell direction, and water temperature. The pilot program will include monitoring wave heights, coastal currents, large mammal movement, sewage outfall, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion, weather, river mouth sediment observation, and coastal mapping. Federal cooperation will involve the Geological Survey, Navy, and Environmental Protection Agency. Regional test projects will also be conducted. The pilot program will involve regional test projects in Southern California and another location, coordinated with existing monitoring efforts by Federal, State, and local entities. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of $4,000,000 from the Beach Nourishment Account for fiscal years 2001 through 2006 to coordinate regional test projects in Southern California and another location."
