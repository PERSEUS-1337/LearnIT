    "content": "The Middle East poses challenges to U.S. foreign policy due to various state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests, including Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is a major concern with potential global consequences. There are fears of a preemptive strike by Israel against Iran leading to a wider war. Iran's strong ties to Syria further complicate the situation. The Middle East presents challenges to U.S. foreign policy with Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and fears of Israel preemptively striking Iran. Iran's ties to Syria complicate U.S. efforts for Israeli-Arab peace. Despite some improvement in the U.S. image under the Obama Administration, dissatisfaction with U.S. policy in the region persists. The ongoing war in Afghanistan and failures in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process have diminished U.S. influence in the broader Middle East. The Middle East challenges U.S. influence due to Afghanistan and Israeli-Palestinian peace process failures. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey take more responsibility. The region faces economic and social issues like poverty, inequality, and water scarcity. Lack of human rights and democracy are criticized. U.S. advocates for reform. The United States advocates for economic and political reform in the Middle East to address challenges such as Palestinian divisions, Hamas' control of Gaza, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to peace. Congressional considerations include supporting regional initiatives amidst budget constraints and employing new tools to change the behavior of radical regimes like Iran and Syria. The 112th Congress may face various issues in the Middle East, including terrorism, foreign assistance, democracy promotion, and the global financial crisis. Policymakers need to consider new tools to address radical regimes like Iran and Syria while balancing counterterrorism strategies with diplomatic efforts to improve bilateral relationships with Arab regimes. The United States remains vulnerable to terrorist attacks from Al Qaeda-inspired groups, and unexpected challenges are likely to arise. The 112th Congress may face issues in the Middle East, including terrorism and economic sanctions against Iran. International consensus is growing to adopt stricter sanctions to compel Iran to compromise on its nuclear development. The U.S. and major allies believe sanctions should target Iran's energy sector to isolate it from the international financial system. U.S. efforts to curb investment in Iran's energy sector began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act. The U.S. has been implementing sanctions against Iran's energy sector since 1996 to isolate Iran from the international financial system. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 significantly expanded these efforts to restrict Iran's ability to import gasoline and imposed measures to limit access to the U.S. market for banks conducting transactions with sanctioned Iranian entities. The U.S. has been imposing sanctions on Iran's energy sector since 1996 to isolate the country from the global financial system. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 further restricted Iran's access to the U.S. market for banks dealing with sanctioned Iranian entities. Additionally, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 and European Union sanctions banned heavy weapon sales to Iran and limited involvement in Iran's energy sector. Japan and South Korea also imposed similar restrictions on trade with Iran. The U.S. has been imposing sanctions on Iran's energy sector since 1996 to isolate the country from the global financial system. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 further restricted Iran's access to the U.S. market for banks dealing with sanctioned Iranian entities. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 and European Union sanctions banned heavy weapon sales to Iran and limited involvement in Iran's energy sector. Japan and South Korea also imposed similar restrictions on trade with Iran. Major economic powers have imposed sanctions on Iran, affecting its economy, with many international firms exiting the Iranian market. There is debate on whether sanctions are shifting Iran's commitment to its nuclear program. The 112th Congress might consider additional Iran sanctions legislation and measures to support Iran's domestic opposition. The United States and Israel have strong bilateral relations based on domestic support for Israel, shared strategic goals in the Middle East, democratic values, and historic ties. U.S. foreign aid has reinforced these ties, despite differences over Israel's settlements and arms sales. Critics argue that U.S. aid exacerbates tensions in the region. U.S. aid to Israel is a contentious issue, with critics in the Middle East arguing that it exacerbates tensions in the region. Congress and successive administrations have consistently affirmed their commitment to strengthening Israel's security and maintaining its military edge over neighboring countries. Assistant Secretary of State Andrew J. Shapiro reiterated the Obama Administration's dedication to preserving Israel's qualitative military edge in 2010. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. aid to Israel in the future. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. aid to Israel, with a request for $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for FY2011. Defense appropriations for missile defense systems, including the Iron Dome, may also be addressed. In FY2010, over $202 million was appropriated for U.S.-Israeli missile defense, with an additional $205 million announced for the purchase of up to 10 Iron Dome batteries. Congress may act to authorize and appropriate these funds. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. aid to Israel, with a request for $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for FY2011. Assistance may be provided for the purchase of up to 10 Iron Dome short-range missile defense batteries. Congressional aid appropriations have reinforced Israel's peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and have helped enable the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians to proceed. President Obama declared Israeli-Palestinian peace to be a U.S. national security interest due to its impact on U.S. relations in the Middle East and elsewhere. The Obama Administration's efforts to halt Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank led to short-lived proximity talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Despite offering incentives for a settlement freeze, Israel continued with settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, hindering peace talks. The Obama Administration offered incentives to Israel for a settlement freeze but abandoned the effort in December. Final status issues in negotiations include borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and water. Congress remains interested in the Arab-Israeli peace process due to its oversight role in U.S. foreign policy and support for Israel. Resolutions were introduced in the 111th Congress to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the U.S. embassy there. Foreign operations appropriations legislation restricts U.S. official conduct. In the 112th Congress, legislation may revisit moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and the conduct of all U.S. official business in the region. Congress passed resolutions supporting Israel's right to self-defense against attacks and a flotilla attempting to break Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip. In the 112th Congress, legislation may address moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and conditions for a new Palestinian state. U.S. aid to Palestinians supports combating terrorism, promoting stability, and preparing for peaceful coexistence with Israel. U.S. aid policy towards Palestinians in the 111th Congress focused on stability, prosperity, and meeting humanitarian needs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Annual assistance averaged over $600 million, with a peak of nearly $1 billion in 2009 after the Gaza conflict. U.S. bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip has averaged over $600 million annually, peaking at nearly $1 billion in 2009 after the Gaza conflict. This aid includes direct budgetary assistance, non-lethal security assistance, and humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees. Congressional concerns about fund diversion to terrorist groups have led to vetting and oversight requirements. U.S. assistance is provided alongside aid from other Western donors. The Obama Administration notified Congress of proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion over 10 to 15 years, including fighter aircraft, helicopters, and related weaponry and services. The sales aim to sustain long-term assistance to the Palestinians alongside aid from other Western donors. The Obama Administration notified Congress of proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion, including fighter aircraft, helicopters, and related weaponry. The proposed sales aim to strengthen Saudi Arabia vis-\u00e0-vis Iran and ensure continued U.S. influence for decades, raising policy questions about regional security balance and effects on Israel's security. Improvements in U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism cooperation praised, with ongoing concerns about terrorist financing and human rights in Saudi Arabia. Saudi leaders share U.S. concerns about Iran but remain cautious about Iraq and Israel engagement. Proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia reviewed by Congress in 111th Congress, with concerns raised by 198 members in a letter to the Obama Administration. In October 2010, proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia were reviewed by Congress, with 198 members expressing concerns in a letter to the Obama Administration. The Administration's response emphasized maintaining Israel's military edge while strengthening the U.S.-Saudi military partnership. Additionally, a bill introduced in December 2010 aimed to prohibit the sales to Saudi Arabia. Members of the 112th Congress may seek further oversight. H.J.Res. 104 introduced in December 2010 aimed to prohibit proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The United States has been involved in training and arming the Saudi military since the 1940s, with ongoing support programs. Congress retains the option to block or modify arms sales at any time before delivery. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to block or modify arms sales to Saudi Arabia, subject to presidential veto. Congress may also enhance oversight of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia due to policy concerns. Additionally, there may be a focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen, given the threat of Yemen-based terrorists. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen, particularly on Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and American citizen Anwar al Awlaki's radical influence on terrorist activities. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to combat Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist groups. Options include using drones and placing U.S. military units under CIA control. Congress may assess the Administration's ability to balance military presence in Yemen. The 112th Congress may consider new appropriations for Yemen, with the United States providing an estimated $290 million in total aid in FY2010. The Defense Department has proposed increasing security assistance to Yemen to $1.2 billion over a five- or six-year period. Lawmakers may demand more U.S. military involvement in Yemen, especially if AQAP threatens the United States. The Defense Department has proposed increasing security assistance to Yemen to $1.2 billion over a five- or six-year period. Yemeni forces have launched campaigns against suspected AQAP strongholds. U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation sustainability is a key question for lawmakers. Disagreements may arise over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists. Iraq's political system has seen peaceful competition and attempts to form cross-sectarian alliances. Iraq's political system has shown peaceful competition and attempts to form cross-sectarian alliances, but ethnic and factional infighting persists, delaying agreement on leadership after the 2010 national elections. With U.S. intervention, major factions agreed on new government positions in November 2010, breaking a long deadlock. The major political blocs are now working to implement the agreement and form a broad-based government, although challenges remain. The formation of a broad-based government in Iraq after the 2010 national elections has faced challenges, with concerns about U.S. influence waning and dominance by parties aligned with Iran. There are worries about potential conflicts between the Kurdistan Regional Government and nationalist Arabs, contributing to uncertainty and disillusionment among Iraqis despite the drawdown of U.S. forces. Experts question the stability post-2011 when all U.S. forces depart. The violence in Iraq has raised concerns about stability post-2011 when all U.S. forces depart. Some experts fear that without U.S. presence, ethnic and sectarian rifts may widen, potentially leading to Iraq becoming a \"failed state.\" U.S. officials doubt Iraqi Security Forces will meet benchmarks by the end of 2011. The formation of the government is crucial for securing a long-term strategic partnership with Iraq, but opposition from some Iraqi parties may complicate efforts for lasting cooperation. The U.S. faces challenges in securing lasting cooperation in Iraq due to the inclusion of various parties in key ministries. The transition from military to civilian leadership is complex, with the State Department overseeing a significant expansion in personnel and costs. Economic assistance to Iraq has decreased since 2003-2007, with the Economic Support Fund reaching $382.5 million in FY2010. The FY2011 request aimed to maintain this level of aid and support Iraq's security forces. The FY2011 funding for Iraq under the Continuing Appropriations Act aimed to maintain economic aid at $382.5 million, despite Senate appropriators recommending cuts. Concerns in the 112th Congress revolve around Iraq's ability to invest in its own reconstruction and security forces, despite potential growth in oil revenues. The transition from U.S. military operations to a U.S. civilian-led presence in Iraq opens new avenues for oversight by Congress, including appropriations, authorization requests, and arms sales for U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation. Turkey's complex relationship with the U.S. has drawn congressional attention, particularly regarding issues of interest to diaspora communities. Turkey has not been a major recipient of U.S. foreign aid since the 1990s. Turkey's complex relationship with the U.S. has drawn congressional attention, particularly regarding issues of interest to diaspora communities. Congressional concern increased after Turkey's actions against Iran and Israel. Legislation in the 111th Congress called for Turkey to respect the property and religious rights of the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved H.Res. 252 to recognize the Armenian genocide and called for the protection of Greek Orthodox religious sites in Turkish-occupied areas of northern Cyprus. Issues concerning the Greek Orthodox Church and the genocide resolution may resurface in the 112th Congress. Turkey's role in NATO's new missile defense architecture could lead to Ankara seeking US funding for missiles and radar. Turkey's role in NATO's new missile defense architecture may prompt Ankara to seek US funding for missiles and radar. Congressional interest in potential political changes from the 2011 Turkish national election could lead to oversight hearings. Lawmakers in the 112th Congress may focus on US policy towards Syria in efforts to distance the country from Iran. The Obama Administration shifted its approach towards Syria in 2009, engaging in diplomatic dialogue to secure cooperation on various issues. Despite some gestures towards the Asad government, U.S. sanctions against Syria remained in force. After two years of diplomatic efforts, the Administration is now focusing on applying more pressure for Syria to play a constructive role in stabilizing Lebanon. The Obama Administration is shifting tactics towards Syria, applying pressure for a more constructive role in stabilizing Lebanon and advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process. International concern about Lebanon has increased due to Hezbollah's threats. Efforts to restart Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been unsuccessful. Congress may consider imposing new sanctions on the Asad regime. During the 111th Congress, lawmakers introduced the Syria Accountability and Liberation Act, which aimed to impose sanctions on countries and individuals aiding Syria in acquiring weapons of mass destruction. There were also discussions about funding democracy and governance programs for opposition members and human rights activists oppressed by the Asad government. The nomination of Robert S. Ford as Ambassador-Designate to Syria was on hold, with no confirmation vote scheduled in the Senate. Supporters argued for sending an ambassador to Syria, as there has been no U.S. Ambassador in Damascus since 2005. Supporters advocate for sending an ambassador to Syria to enhance U.S. interests, while opponents view it as a concession to a rogue regime. Current U.S. policy towards Lebanon aims to limit Iranian and Syrian influence, support the unity government led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, and contain Hezbollah. The U.S. provides economic and military assistance to strengthen state institutions, particularly in the security sector, since Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005. The U.S. also supports the Special Tribunal for Lebanon with an annual contribution of $10 million. The Hariri government faces challenges with pending STL indictments causing sectarian tension, as Hezbollah aims to discredit the STL. Nasrallah rejects potential indictment as a U.S. and Israeli attack on the \"resistance.\" U.S. support for Hariri and the STL may be at odds due to escalating rhetoric. Hariri's legitimacy depends on the STL's success, but Hezbollah and the opposition could threaten his power if indictments proceed. The STL's success is crucial for Hariri's government, but Hezbollah and the opposition could challenge his power if indictments proceed. Changes in the Lebanese government may impact U.S. policy and assistance, especially if Hezbollah gains more influence. The U.S. Congress may need to consider funding for Lebanon to strengthen central authority and deter non-state actors. In a recent incident, the LAF clashed with the IDF along the Blue Line, resulting in casualties on both sides. In response to a clash between the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israeli Defense Forces, some members of Congress halted a $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon. The hold was lifted after consultations with the State Department, but raised concerns about future U.S. assistance to Lebanon. As Egypt faces a potential leadership transition, the 112th Congress may support a more democratic government that upholds human rights and religious freedom. Egypt, the largest country in the Arab world, is a key partner of the United States in regional affairs. Its domestic politics are closely watched by U.S. policymakers. Some believe political liberalization in Egypt could have a ripple effect in the Middle East. However, others argue that a stable, autocratic Egypt at peace with Israel is in the U.S. interest to prevent a takeover by the Muslim Brotherhood. In the 2010 parliamentary elections, the ruling party dominated while only one Muslim Brotherhood member won a seat. In the 2010 parliamentary elections in Egypt, the ruling National Democratic Party won over 90% of all seats, with just one Muslim Brotherhood independent winning a seat. The State Department expressed concern over reports of election irregularities, including disruption of opposition campaign activities, arrests of supporters, and denial of media access. These issues raised doubts about the fairness and transparency of the electoral process. The fairness and transparency of the electoral process in Egypt have been called into question due to interference and intimidation by security forces. Congress has provided Egypt with significant military and economic aid, with some members using appropriations as a tool to promote democracy. The Egyptian government has opposed foreign support to independent NGOs working on political reform and government accountability. Funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been controversial over the last six years, with some funds directed towards USAID programming and direct support to Egyptian NGOs. In FY2005, Congress directed Economic Support Funds towards USAID programming in democracy and governance (D&G) sector and Egyptian NGOs. P.L. 111-117, FY2010, provided $25 million for democracy promotion. Some believe the Obama Administration wants to ease tensions with Egypt by reducing democracy assistance, while others argue for more effective aid targeting daily needs of Egyptians. Some critics suggest conditioning U.S. aid to Egypt on human rights and religious freedom improvements. Despite weakening Al Qaeda, its survival and appeal remain concerning. Al Qaeda operatives are determined to attack the U.S. and exploit vulnerabilities. Recent events indicate that Al Qaeda supporters are using the Internet for ideological outreach and promoting independent, low-cost operations. This trend could complicate counterterrorism efforts by spreading Al Qaeda's ideology and making threats less predictable. In the Middle East, U.S. policymakers face multiple challenges in pursuing counterterrorism goals alongside other strategic priorities. The text discusses the challenges of U.S. military operations in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, focusing on targeting Al Qaeda operatives and stabilizing countries. It also mentions criticisms of U.S. support for undemocratic regimes and efforts to promote democratic reform in certain regions. The text discusses challenges of U.S. military operations in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, targeting Al Qaeda operatives and stabilizing countries. It mentions criticisms of U.S. support for undemocratic regimes and efforts to promote democratic reform in certain regions. Some suggest more direct, robust efforts to destroy Al Qaeda, while others propose a containment strategy due to potential negative consequences of direct intervention. Muslims in many countries remain skeptical of U.S. intentions despite increased outreach. The 111th Congress focused on U.S. counterterrorism policy, including hearings on specific threats, foreign assistance, and terrorist financing. Legislative input was mainly through annual appropriations and authorization legislation, with a key law being the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-73). The 112th Congress may evaluate U.S. counterterrorism strategy and engagement with predominantly Muslim countries. Key issues include U.S.-Iraqi counterterrorism partnership, defeating Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and the Sahel, and securing peace between Israel and its neighbors. Congressional interest also extends to securing greater counterterrorism cooperation from allied governments in the Gulf.
