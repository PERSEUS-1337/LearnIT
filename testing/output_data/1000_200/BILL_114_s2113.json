    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2015\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of crowdsourcing and citizen science. The Congress recognizes the benefits of using incentive prizes and challenges by Federal agencies, including paying only for success, setting ambitious goals without predicting success, involving a broader group of people, bringing diverse perspectives, and maximizing cost-effectiveness. The Congress acknowledges the advantages of using incentive prizes and challenges by Federal agencies, such as maximizing cost-effectiveness and involving a broader group of people. Granting agencies the authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity, encourage their appropriate use, and stimulate public participation in the innovation process. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits, including improving government service delivery with lower resource investments. Citizen science benefits include connecting citizens to federal agency missions, acquiring data at greater geographic extents, enabling community involvement in research, and advancing scientific research. Citizen science has additional benefits, such as advancing scientific research through group discovery, improving science literacy, furthering science diplomacy, and building trust between citizens and scientists. Federal agencies should consider meaningful incentives to engage and retain participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, such as receiving attribution for contributions, learning new skills, connecting with others, and knowing their work contributes to solving important problems in science for society's benefit. SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. In this section, \"citizen science\" refers to open collaboration in the scientific process, including formulating research questions, conducting experiments, and making discoveries. \"Crowdsourcing\" is a method to obtain services or content by soliciting contributions from a group, especially online. \"Crowdsourcing is a method to obtain services or content by soliciting voluntary contributions from individuals or organizations, especially from an online community. The terms 'Director', 'Federal agency', and 'Participant' are defined within the context of this process.\" The head of each Federal agency, or multiple agencies working together, can use crowdsourcing and citizen science to advance their missions. Participants are individuals or entities volunteering in these projects, and related entities include contractors, subcontractors, and others working with Federal agencies. Participants in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects can provide voluntary services to Federal agencies without financial compensation, as long as the services are not used to replace any government employees. Federal agencies running crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must promote them for broad participation. Agencies can determine the level of consent, registration, and terms of use required from participants on a project basis, with disclosures on privacy, intellectual property, and data ownership. Federal agencies must disclose various terms to participants in a clear manner for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. Consent can be obtained electronically or in writing. Projects involving human subjects must adhere to regulations. Data security and privacy are still important considerations. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must inform participants about data usage, ownership, availability, and publication rights. Data collected should be made open and accessible to the public in machine-readable formats. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must inform participants about data usage, ownership, availability, and publication rights. Participants in these projects must agree to assume all associated risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for specific circumstances. Additionally, technologies and applications developed through these projects should be made open and available to the public. Federal agencies coordinating citizen science projects must ensure participants adhere to scientific integrity and ethics policies. Multi-sector partnerships can be formed to share administrative duties for crowdsourcing or citizen science activities. Federal agencies can collaborate with private sector entities, government agencies, or foreign government agencies to share administrative duties for crowdsourcing and citizen science activities. Funding for these activities can come from Congress, other Federal agencies, or private sector entities. Federal agencies can collaborate with private sector entities, government agencies, or foreign government agencies for crowdsourcing and citizen science activities. The General Services Administration will provide assistance to facilitate the use of these activities within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Act encourages Federal agencies to utilize crowdsourcing and citizen science activities, with guidance from the Director. A report is required every 2 years to assess the implementation of these activities. The Director must report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies, including project goals and participation statistics. The Director must report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies, including project goals, participation statistics, resources used, activities, and allocation of obligations and expenditures. The Director must report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies, including project goals, participation statistics, resources used, activities, and allocation of obligations and expenditures. The report should include a description of how each project advanced the agency's mission, project results, methods used for data quality and public availability, and any savings or costs incurred by using these projects instead of agency resources. The report must include details on the challenges faced by Federal agencies in conducting crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, steps taken to address these challenges, recommendations for future actions, and the use of these methods by all agencies since the last report. The report must include details on challenges faced by Federal agencies in conducting crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, steps taken to address these challenges, recommendations for future actions, and the use of these methods by all agencies since the last report. Additionally, it should cover interagency and multi-sector partnerships and any other relevant information deemed important by the Director. Nothing in this section should affect the authority to conduct crowdsourcing and citizen science under other laws or displace resources allocated to agencies using these methods for projects."
