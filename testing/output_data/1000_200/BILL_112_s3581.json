The text chunk outlines the national limitation for qualified carbon dioxide captured by carbon capture equipment after July 31, 2013. It also discusses the establishment of procedures for allocating the national limitation under Section 45Q of the Code. The Secretary will establish processes and procedures for allocating the national limitation for carbon capture projects and certifying allocated projects. Applicants must submit applications for allocation, which will be ranked by the Secretary based on priority. The Secretary will rank applications for carbon capture project allocation based on the date received, giving priority to earlier submissions. Applications received on the same date will be considered concurrently. The Secretary will allocate tonnage to applicants based on the amount requested and the rank of the application. Priority will be given to applicants applying for certification on the same date, with higher priority given to projects that commenced construction earlier.

The Secretary cannot allocate more than the projected metric tons of captured carbon dioxide over a 10-year period to any project. During a 10-year period, projects must capture a specified amount of qualified carbon dioxide for disposal in secure geological storage or have a disposal plan in place. The minimum requirement is 15,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide. Projects must capture 15,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide for disposal in secure geological storage or have a disposal plan in place. Any prior credits for carbon dioxide captured before August 1, 2013, will reduce the allocation for the project. No credit is allowed for carbon capture equipment use before project certification. Projects allocated national limitation must submit an application for certification to the Secretary within 6 months of receiving an allocation. The application must contain required information and be submitted within 30 days of established regulations. The certification process for projects with national limitations must be completed within 6 months of allocation. The construction start date is defined as the date when significant work begins or when 5% of the project cost is spent. The Secretary can revoke certification for inaccurate representations. The Secretary can revoke certification under this paragraph if an applicant makes a materially inaccurate representation regarding the project. Certification will also be revoked if carbon capture equipment is not placed in service within specified timeframes. The Secretary can revoke certification if there are inaccurate representations or if carbon capture equipment is not operational within specified timeframes. If certification is revoked or a taxpayer fails to obtain certification, the allocated national limitation for the project will be reallocated. The Secretary has the authority to revoke certification for inaccurate representations or non-operational carbon capture equipment. If certification is revoked or not obtained, the national limitation for the project will be reallocated. The Secretary must publicly disclose any allocation, certification, revocation, or change in project ranking within 30 days. An annual report summarizing allocated credits will be issued. The Secretary will issue an annual report summarizing credits allocated and available for allocation. Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a 10-year credit limitation for carbon capture equipment. The amendment to Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code includes a 10-year credit limitation for carbon capture equipment, with specific conditions for the beginning of the period related to the equipment's placement in service or certification of the project. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define \"carbon capture equipment\" as equipment to capture and pressurize qualified carbon dioxide. The credit under Section 45Q(d) is allowed to the taxpayer who captures the qualified carbon dioxide. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 defines \"carbon capture equipment\" as equipment to capture and pressurize qualified carbon dioxide. The credit under Section 45Q(d) is allowed to the taxpayer who disposes of the qualified carbon dioxide in a manner meeting specific requirements. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows a tax credit under Section 45Q(d) to taxpayers who dispose of qualified carbon dioxide in compliance with specific requirements. Amendments have been made to sections 45Q(a) and 45Q(c) of the Code to ensure conformity. The amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include redesignating paragraphs and adding rules relating to credit recapture for qualified carbon dioxide. These changes will apply to carbon dioxide captured after July 31, 2013."
