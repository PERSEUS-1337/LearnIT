In August 2013, Islamist-led mobs burned and destroyed Christian properties in Egypt after the government led by the Muslim Brotherhood was removed. The succeeding government, under President Sisi, announced that the army would rebuild the damaged churches at government expense. President Sisi also made an appearance at a Coptic Christian Christmas liturgy in January 2015. President Sisi, in January 2016, promised to restore all churches damaged in the 2013 violence, with 26 already repaired by the Egyptian military. The Egyptian military and private citizens have restored a total of 49 out of 78 churches and Christian buildings damaged in the August 2013 sectarian violence. However, 29 buildings in 24 locations still need to be restored as of September 6, 2016. A new law passed in August 2016 imposes challenges on church construction in Egypt, with government approval for building or repairing churches often leading to sectarian violence targeting Christians. In El-`Our, Minya, protests erupted in March 2015 against the construction of a new church honoring Egyptian Christians beheaded by Da'esh militants in Libya. President Sisi had approved the construction. In response to calls by Coptic Orthodox Church leaders, President Sisi approved the construction of a church honoring Egyptian Christians beheaded by Da'esh militants in Libya. Protestors armed with Molotov cocktails besieged the existing village church, set fire to a Christian-owned vehicle, and threw bricks at another Christian victim's house. Egyptian government officials engage in informal reconciliation sessions to address sectarian violence, aiming to prevent further incidents. The Coptic Church, representing the largest Christian community in the Middle East, has been in Egypt for over 2,000 years.
