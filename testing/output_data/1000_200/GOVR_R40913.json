    "content": "The United States has historically relied on domestic energy sources, but growing industrialization and population led to increased dependence on foreign energy in the 20th century. Federal efforts have focused on increasing energy independence, reducing consumption, and developing renewable energy sources. Many programs have been established over the past 40 years to promote energy efficiency and conservation. The United States has focused on energy independence, conservation, and renewable energy sources through various research programs and legislation enacted since 2005. These programs target a wide range of sectors and have been periodically reauthorized and redesigned to meet changing economic conditions and national interests. Since 2005, the United States has implemented legislation such as the Energy Improvement and Extension Act (EIEA), the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA), and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to support energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) administers the majority of these programs, with additional initiatives from the Departments of Treasury, Agriculture, Interior, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Affairs, and the Small Business Administration. These programs offer grants, loans, loan guarantees, and other incentives for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy. The curr_chunk outlines federal programs providing grants, loans, and incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy RDD&D. Programs are grouped by administering agency with references to federal agency websites. Incentives are summarized and indexed in the appendixes. Program descriptions were compiled from statutes, U.S. Code, budget documents, DSIRE, Assistance Listings, and Energy Star website. Budget figures were compiled from agency justifications and congressional reports. For more information on agriculture-related grant programs, refer to CRS Report R43416. The curr_chunk provides additional information on agriculture-related grant programs and programs supporting alternatives to conventional fuels and engines in transportation. It also mentions tax credits for biofuels and vehicles covered in another CRS Report. The information is sourced from executive agency budget justifications and congressional committee reports. The curr_chunk provides a summary of various federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentive programs, including expired programs like the Assisted Housing Stability and Energy and Green Retrofit Investments Program and the Clean Renewable Energy Bonds. Program of Competitive Grants for Worker Training and Placement in High Growth and Emerging Industry Sectors, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds, Qualifying Advanced Energy Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit, and Renewable Energy Grants (1603 Program) are some of the federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentive programs summarized in the curr_chunk."
