    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing issues for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance are key, along with block grant programs like HOME and CDBG for community development. Other specialized grants help homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides mortgage insurance for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus funds from FHA have been used to support HUD's budget, which has also received emergency funding for disaster recovery and economic stimulus, totaling over $33 billion in recent years. The economic stimulus legislation provided over $13 billion to HUD's programs in recent years, with a 57% increase in regular funding over the past nine years. Year-over-year budget growth has been significant, reaching nearly 12% in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, HUD's budget grew by about 17% over a nine-year period. The growth in HUD's \"real\" funding has been less robust, with a 17% increase over a nine-year period. Funding is made up of regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. HUD's programs are funded mainly through regular annual appropriations. Congress may also provide emergency appropriations in some years. The funding for HUD's programs is determined by Congress through regular annual appropriations, with additional emergency appropriations provided in some years. Congressional appropriators are limited in the amount of new discretionary funding they can provide, leading to offsets through rescissions and offsetting receipts. The funding for HUD's programs is determined by Congress through regular annual appropriations, with additional emergency appropriations provided in some years. This funding is offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts, derived from fees paid by HUD partners or clients, to determine HUD's total net budget authority. This net budget authority is not necessarily the best measure of the amount of funding provided for HUD's programs and activities. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 57% between FY2002 and FY2010, from over $29 billion to over $46 billion. However, this increase is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations grew by only 37% during the same period. Offset receipts and collections declined, impacting the overall increase in budget authority. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57% from FY2002 to FY2010, with regular appropriations growing by 37%. The growth in appropriations is mainly due to the increase in HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs. Offset receipts and collections declined significantly during this period, affecting the overall budget authority increase. Appropriations for HUD's Section 8 programs increased by over 70% from FY2002 to FY2010, accounting for about 57% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs also began to grow in FY2009 and FY2010. The decline in offsetting receipts was mainly due to decreases in receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs. The cost of new HUD appropriations has decreased significantly from FY2004 to FY2010. The annual appropriations process starts with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Appropriations must be enacted before September 30 to avoid a government funding lapse. In years when Congress doesn't finish appropriations, short-term continuing resolutions are enacted to maintain funding at prior levels. The FY2011 appropriations process began in February 2010 and ended later. The FY2011 appropriations process for HUD began in February 2010 with the President's budget request and ended with the signing of P.L. 112-10 in April 2011. The President's budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a 1% decrease from FY2010 enacted levels, but a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate. The President's budget for FY2011 requested a decrease in net new budget authority, which would actually result in a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs overall. The budget proposed significant increases in offsetting collections and receipts, primarily from changes to the FHA mortgage insurance programs. Funding increases were requested for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research and technology needs, while funding for programs for the elderly, persons with disabilities, and public housing repairs were decreased. No new funding was requested for the brownfields redevelopment program. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House on July 29, 2010 would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. This bill would have rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. It also rejected funding for initiatives like Choice Neighborhoods and Transforming Rental Assistance. The bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 HUD funding bill that would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The bill included a 1% increase in net new budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. The Senate bill also provided funding for the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative. Unlike the House bill, the Senate committee bill funded the President's Choice Neighborhoods initiative. The Senate committee bill for FY2011 HUD funding included increases in appropriations for HUD programs and rejected proposed cuts to housing programs. It also funded the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods initiative. The 111th Congress enacted a series of continuing resolutions to continue funding at FY2010 levels due to the lack of appropriations legislation before the fiscal year began. The 111th Congress enacted a series of continuing resolutions to continue funding at FY2010 levels. The CR approved before adjournment was set to expire in March 2011, leaving funding for the remainder of FY2011 to the 112th Congress. P.L. 111-322 extended FHA mortgage limit increases through FY2011. H.R. 1 proposed funding HUD programs at FY2010 levels but with cuts, resulting in $5 billion less in aggregate appropriations for HUD programs compared to FY2010. In FY2011, there was a $5 billion decrease in aggregate appropriations (11%) for HUD programs compared to FY2010, with a net new budget authority decrease of $7 billion (16%). The difference is due to rescissions of prior-year funding proposed by H.R. 1 and an increase in offsets from the FHA insurance fund. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 or a Senate Amendment that would have increased HUD funding by nearly $6 billion without rescinding FY2010 funding. In FY2011, there was a decrease in HUD program appropriations compared to FY2010, with a net budget authority decrease of $7 billion. The difference is due to rescissions of prior-year funding proposed by H.R. 1 and an increase in offsets from the FHA insurance fund. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR to fund the government through March 18, 2011, with funding for most accounts at FY2010 levels, except for a reduction in the Community Development Fund account. In FY2011, HUD program appropriations decreased compared to FY2010, with a net budget authority decrease of $7 billion. The Community Development Fund (CDF) was funded at a lower level under H.J.Res. 44, with a reduction equivalent to funding for congressional earmarks in FY2010. Subsequent short-term CRs continued the funding reduction for the CDF and provided no funding for HUD's Brownfields Redevelopment account. In FY2011, HUD program appropriations decreased by $7 billion. A final short-term CR, P.L. 112-8, extended funding through April 15, 2011. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011, P.L. 112-10, provided year-long appropriations for HUD and other government agencies. Funding for some HUD programs remained at FY2010 levels, while others were reduced. An across-the-board 0.2% rescission was applied to non-defense discretionary accounts. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 included a 0.2% rescission for non-defense discretionary accounts, affecting HUD's budget. The law provided $41.1 billion in new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of 11% from FY2010. Despite the decrease, there was only a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs due to increased offsetting collections from FHA mortgage insurance programs. FHA insures mortgage loans to make credit more accessible and affordable for eligible borrowers. The FHA insurance programs help make mortgage credit more widely available and affordable for borrowers by charging upfront and monthly fees. The programs are administered through two accounts in the HUD budget: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund and the General Insurance Fund. The MMI Fund is the largest and covers single-family home loans, including the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) established two risk categories in the MMI Fund: MMI Purchase and Refinance, and MMI HECM. The MMI Fund covers single-family home loans, while the GI/SRI Fund insures riskier mortgages and special-purpose loans. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) established risk categories in the MMI Fund for single-family home loans. The subsidy rate is determined by comparing cash inflows from insurance premiums to cash outflows for loan defaults. The subsidy rate, expressed as a positive number, is applied to the expected loan volume to determine the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs. Agencies must adjust initial subsidy estimates based on actual loan experience. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, generating money for the government by making more in fees than paying out in claims. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, making money for the government by generating more fees than paying out in claims. The Purchase and Refinance risk category of the MMI Fund is estimated to have a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, generating about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy. The MMI Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category is projected to generate around $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy in FY2011. This increase is partly due to proposed FHA reforms by HUD. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a smaller negative credit subsidy of around $1.9 billion for this category, including $960 million without proposed changes and an additional $902 million with reforms. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the MMI Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate around $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy in FY2011, with an additional $902 million projected with HUD-proposed program reforms. The differences between the President's budget request and CBO's re-estimate are shown in Table 3. FHA's estimates of negative credit subsidy for FY2011 were revised upward due to an increase in the annual premium that went into effect in April 2011. In FY2011, FHA's estimates of offsetting receipts for the Purchase and Refinance risk category increased to nearly $10 billion, up from $5.8 billion. CBO also raised its estimate of FHA receipts by over $1 billion during the FY2011 appropriations process. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program was moved into the MMI fund by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. In FY2011, HUD proposed changes to the HECM program to reduce the need for positive credit subsidies. This included increasing borrowers' annual insurance premiums and adjusting the formula for loan sizes. Despite efforts in FY2010, a positive credit subsidy of $250 million is still required for the MMI HECM risk category. The HECM program underwent changes in FY2011 to reduce the need for credit subsidies by adjusting loan sizes and increasing insurance premiums. Legislation proposed different amounts for credit subsidies, with the final FY2012 appropriations law aiming for a zero credit subsidy. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing due to tightening lending standards in the private market. FHA insured a higher percentage of new mortgages in recent years. The FHA has seen an increase in the volume of new mortgages insured, with a higher percentage of new single-family mortgages being insured by FHA in recent years. Despite the average credit score on FHA-insured loans improving, the default rate on past loans is still rising, putting strain on the MMI Fund. Congress mandated that the MMI Fund must have a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% within 10 years after enactment. The FHA's capital reserve ratio fell below 2% in FY2009, prompting proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs. These changes include increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium, with some requiring congressional action. After the FHA's capital reserve ratio fell below 2% in FY2009, Congress enacted P.L. 111-229 on August 11, 2010, setting maximum annual insurance premium amounts for FHA borrowers. Following this law, FHA increased annual mortgage insurance premiums, with rates varying based on downpayment percentages. Subsequently, FHA raised the premiums again in April 2011. Congress also sets a statutory cap on upfront mortgage insurance premiums. FHA increased the upfront mortgage insurance premium to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, but lowered it to 1% for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. Congress sets a statutory cap of 3% on upfront premiums. FHA also raised annual insurance premiums and adjusted downpayment and credit score requirements. FHA proposes changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, reducing seller concessions from 6% to 3%, and increasing oversight of FHA-approved lenders. These changes were detailed in a Federal Register notice published on July 15, 2010. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced changes in downpayment and credit score requirements in a notice published on July 15, 2010. They also plan to increase oversight of FHA-approved lenders, with potential enforcement actions requiring congressional approval. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to grant FHA broader authority to hold lenders accountable for non-compliance and fraud in mortgage origination. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to give FHA more authority to terminate lenders with high default rates and establish a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management. It would abolish the position of FHA chief risk officer and allow FHA to contract with outside credit risk analysis sources. Appropriations were authorized for staff to review lender performance. HUD provides grants and assistance for housing programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance to nonprofit developers to build or rehabilitate housing units for elderly residents and residents with disabilities in the Section 202 and Section 811 programs. Supportive services may be provided in Section 202, while they are required in Section 811. Over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and over 30,000 units of Section 811 housing have been funded by HUD. A proposal to redesign the programs in FY2011 would have resulted in reduced funding for both programs. The President's proposal would have reduced funding for Section 202 and Section 811 programs in FY2011. Section 202 and related programs would have been funded at $274 million, compared to $825 million in FY2010. The Section 811 program would have received $90 million, compared to $300 million in FY2010. However, both the House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) maintained the same level of funding for Section 202 at $825 million. H.R. 5850 also provided $300 million for the Section 811 program. In FY2010, funding for Section 202 and Section 811 programs was $825 million and $300 million respectively. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed different funding levels for Section 811, with the former allocating $300 million and the latter $200 million. The difference in funding was due to the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with both bills moving funding for voucher renewals to the Section 8 account. Congress ultimately appropriated $400 million for Section 202 and related programs in FY2011. In FY2011, Congress appropriated $400 million for Section 202 and related programs, with $150 million allocated for the Section 811 program. Funding for Section 811 vouchers was split between the Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts, totaling $67 million for voucher renewals. Additionally, funds were provided for Service Coordinators and the Assisted Living Conversion program within the Section 202 budget. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program received approximately $89 million for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program. This program is the largest assistance program administered by HUD and the largest account in HUD's budget, funding almost 2.3 million vouchers for families to subsidize their housing. Funding also covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Since FY2004, funding for voucher renewals in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program has been a key debate in the HUD appropriations process. Congress provided over $16 billion for voucher renewals in FY2010, allocating funding to Public Housing Authorities based on voucher costs and utilization from the prior fiscal year. In FY2010, Congress allocated over $16 billion for voucher renewals to Public Housing Authorities based on prior year costs and utilization. However, funding was insufficient to cover all vouchers as PHAs were not using all their vouchers in FY2009. This led to only PHAs with decreased costs or reserve funding being able to increase utilization in CY2010. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, aiming to fund 95% of all vouchers. The funding allocation formula would prioritize PHAs with lower reserves to increase utilization and serve more families. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for PHAs with low reserves to serve more families. The budget also proposed lifting the ban on \"over-leasing\" to facilitate additional leasing. The House bill allocated $150 million less for renewals than requested, citing lower renewal funding needs due to recent inflation estimates. The committee report on H.R. 5850 indicated that less renewal funding would be needed than requested in the President's budget due to lower inflation estimates. The bill's allocation was deemed sufficient to meet program needs, with support for funding all vouchers in use. While the funding formula largely followed the President's request, the bill did not include the reallocation authority sought. The committee believed the program required major authorization changes beyond their jurisdiction. The committee report on S. 3644 states that the program needs major authorization changes outside the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction. The bill would have changed the funding formula to base PHA funding on prior calendar year spending, like H.R. 5850. It would have funded renewals at less than the President's request and allocated funding using the same formula as H.R. 5850. The Senate bill did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. The committee report on S. 3644 did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. Concerns were raised about potential cost increases in the program and the need for better financial management monitoring. Both H.R. 1 and the final FY2011 appropriations law did not change the funding allocation formula from FY2010. The President's budget requested funding renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account. The President's budget requested Congress to fund the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account with $114 million in FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated less than requested for Section 811 renewals, directing funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. Each Public Housing Authority (PHA) has a contract with HUD for authorized vouchers, totaling around 2.3 million across PHAs. In recent years, Congress has allocated around 2.3 million authorized vouchers to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), with additional vouchers created at times. These include replacement vouchers for families displaced from HUD programs and new \"incremental\" vouchers. Specific populations or purposes may receive these vouchers, such as families in the child welfare system or homeless veterans. Funding has been allocated for supportive housing programs for at-risk families and individuals experiencing homelessness. The House and Senate bills from the 111th Congress included funding for the President's homelessness demonstration, $75 million for VASH vouchers for homeless veterans, $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes, and $16 million for the Family Unification Program. H.R. 1 did not include funding for new incremental vouchers, but the final FY2011 appropriations law provided about $50 million for VASH vouchers. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided about $50 million for VASH vouchers, which are used to assist homeless veterans. The project-based rental assistance account funds existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private property owners. Congress funded these contracts for 20- to 40-year periods in the past, but new annual appropriations are now required as contracts expire. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, with $662 million needed for contract amendments. New annual appropriations are required as old contracts expire, requiring more funding to maintain subsidies. In FY2011, HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications indicated that $662 million would be needed for contract amendments. The President requested $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative, but the final FY2011 appropriations law provided just under $120 million less than the request. The FY2011 budget provided less funding than the President's request for the \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative, which aims to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for tenants. The funding would be used to convert HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance, allowing families to take their subsidies with them if they move to a new unit. The President's budget aims to transfer 300,000 housing units to a new form of assistance modeled after the Section 8 project-based voucher program. Three categories of properties are targeted for transfer: public housing properties without a Section 8 program, properties owned by PHAs combining administrative activities, and multifamily properties with old rental assistance programs. HUD will select properties for participation. The President's budget proposes transferring 20,000 housing units to a new program called the Rental Assistance Program (RAP). Most of the $300 million funding would cover the difference in subsidy levels, with $50 million for PHA activities and landlord outreach, and $10 million for technical assistance. HUD will select properties for participation, and legislation will be submitted to Congress for implementation. The draft legislation for the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act was proposed by HUD to Congress. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 did not include funding for the President's initiative. Committees expressed concerns about the proposal's lack of development and unknown future costs. Funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. The public housing program, established in 1937, provides rental units for low-income families. No new public housing developments have been built in recent years. The Public Housing program, established in 1937, is HUD's oldest housing assistance program. Congress continues to fund over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) that maintain 1.2 million units. HUD provides operating funds to fill the gap between rent and maintenance costs, as well as capital funds for large projects. HOPE VI grants help redevelop distressed housing. The President's FY2011 budget proposed increased operating funds and decreased capital funds for public housing. The President's FY2011 budget proposed increased operating funds and decreased capital funds for public housing, aiming to fund PHAs' full eligibility under the operating fund formula. The requested decrease for the capital fund considers the capital funding received from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Fully funding the operating fund would allow more capital funds to be spent on capital needs. The Senate bill proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request with a $500 million increase over the capital fund. It included a $50 million set-aside for grants for PHAs to provide early childhood education and care. H.R. 1 suggested cutting the public housing capital fund by over $1 billion and the operating fund by almost $150 million compared to FY2010. The final FY2011 funding law funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and the operating fund about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and funded the operating fund at about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The reduced appropriations for the operating fund may be voluntarily offset by PHAs' use of program reserves. The President's budget requested no new funding for HOPE VI in FY2010, instead requesting $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new Obama Administration proposal modeled after HOPE VI to revitalize severely distressed public housing. The Choice Neighborhood Initiative expands on HOPE VI by offering grants to revitalize distressed neighborhoods, not just public housing. Funding is aimed at transforming, rehabilitating, and replacing HUD public and assisted housing. In FY2010, Congress allocated $200 million to HOPE VI, with $65 million set aside for Choice Neighborhoods. The House and Senate had differing positions on funding for FY2011, with H.R. 5850 providing $200 million for HOPE VI and S. 3644 providing no funding for either program. In FY2011, funding for HOPE VI and Choice Neighborhoods was debated. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while S. 3644 offered $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. The House Financial Services Committee discussed the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative in March 2010. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) allocated just under $100 million for HOPE VI and maintained the $65 million set-aside from FY2010. The funding law (P.L. 112-10) allocated nearly $100 million for HOPE VI in FY2011, with a $65 million set-aside from FY2010 remaining unchanged. The Housing Trust Fund, established in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289), aims to provide a dedicated funding source for affordable housing, focusing on rental housing for extremely low-income families. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were initially designated for the Housing Trust Fund but were suspended in November 2008. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, lost its funding source when contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were suspended in 2008. Despite requests in the FY2010 and FY2011 budgets for $1 billion in funding, no money has been directed to the fund yet. The President's FY2010 budget requested $1 billion for the Housing Trust Fund, but Congress did not provide funding in the FY2010 appropriations law. Neither H.R. 5850 nor S. 3644 included funding for the Housing Trust Fund in the final FY2011 appropriations law. Despite various legislative proposals, no funding has been allocated to the Housing Trust Fund. The Transformation Initiative aims to enhance HUD's research and technological capabilities. The President's budget aims to strengthen HUD's research and technology capabilities through a fund used for research, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. In FY2010, Congress provided $20 million for addressing mortgage fraud and authorized a 1% transfer authority, resulting in a fund of $239 million instead of the potential $435 million. In FY2010, the fund received $239 million out of a potential $435 million due to restrictions. In FY2011, the President requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority, which could have resulted in a fund of almost $470 million. However, both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 limited the total funding available from transfers to less than half of the President's request. The House and Senate bills proposed limits on the department's discretion in allocating funds across eligible activities. The 111th Congress proposed limits on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's discretion in allocating funds for eligible activities. The Transformation Initiative was to be used for core department needs, with oversight and minimum funding levels recommended for IT modernization and technical assistance. The House and Senate reports emphasized the importance of oversight and restricted the flexibility of fund usage requested by HUD. The Committee recommends minimum funding levels for IT modernization and technical assistance. H.R. 1 did not include transfer authority under the Transformation Initiative. Instead of $20 million for combating mortgage fraud, the bill allocated $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and Section 8 voucher program. The final FY2011 appropriations law included $71 million for new FHA and Section 8 voucher computer systems, with HUD granted transfer authority under the transformation initiative from a limited number of accounts. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives to transform CDBG and related programs. The FY2011 budget included community development initiatives to transform CDBG and related programs. The budget proposed funding CDBG at FY2010 levels and eliminating funding for the Rural Innovation Fund, Neighborhood Initiative, and Economic Development Initiative. New initiatives like Catalytic Competition Grants and Capacity Building Clearinghouse were requested, along with revamping programs like the University Community Fund and Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a reduction in funding for Community Development Fund activities, including defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants. The savings would be used for new initiatives like the Sustainable Communities Initiative, University Community Fund, and Catalytic Investments Competition Grants. No new funding was requested for the Brownfields account. The President's budget for FY2011 proposed reducing funding for Community Development Fund activities, including defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants. The budget did not request new funding for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account, arguing that it duplicates other federal programs. The House bill recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for CDF activities, including $89.3 million for congressional earmarked funds for EDI and NI projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities, also including funding for EDI and NI congressional earmarked projects. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, appropriated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, which is 21.2% less than the $4.450 billion appropriated for FY2010 activities. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%, and the Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund were maintained at their FY2010 levels. The Administration's proposed new initiative, Catalytic Investments Competition Grants, did not receive funding. The FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, 21.2% less than the previous year. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%, and the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) saw a 33% cut. The Brownfield Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) program was not funded. The CDF supports various community development programs, including CDBG, EDI, and NI. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, is a major federal financial assistance program for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. In 2010, CDBG funds were awarded to various communities and states for eligible activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals, addressing slums or blight, or public health and safety threats. The FY2011 budget proposed maintaining funding at over $3.9 billion for the CDBG formula-based component. The FY2011 budget proposed freezing funding for the CDBG formula-based component at over $3.9 billion. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed modestly higher funding levels. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing CDF account funding by 66.3% below FY2010 levels. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing CDF account funding by 66.3% below FY2010 levels and prohibiting funds for earmarks and the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative. Allocation instructions for the CDBG program were not included in the bill. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.501 billion for CDF activities, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. There was a 0.2% mandatory cut and a 1% discretionary transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative, reducing the CDF account by $7 million and transferring $35 million. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative called Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs) to support economic development projects in distressed areas. Unlike CDBG funds, CCG program funds would be awarded competitively to various entities for creating green infrastructure and sustainable projects. The Administration requested $148.5 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to fund green infrastructure projects, economic activities, and administrative costs. However, neither the House-passed nor the Senate Committee-passed bills included funding for the program. In FY2010, Congress approved $148.5 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to fund green infrastructure projects, economic activities, and administrative costs. The SCI appropriations are allocated for four components, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants. In FY2011, $100 million was requested for competitive awards to regional organizations in metropolitan areas to develop effective models integrating planning requirements across disciplines. HUD plans to award grants averaging $3 million to larger metropolitan areas and $500,000 to smaller ones. In FY2010, Congress approved $148.5 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to fund green infrastructure projects, economic activities, and administrative costs. The SCI appropriations are allocated for four components, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants. In FY2011, $100 million was requested for competitive awards to regional organizations in metropolitan areas to develop effective models integrating planning requirements across disciplines. HUD plans to award grants averaging $3 million to larger metropolitan areas and $500,000 to smaller ones. Additionally, Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) are competitively awarded to communities to reform building codes and zoning ordinances for sustainable growth. HUD proposed grant awards not exceeding $2 million. Funding is also allocated for Housing-Transportation Integration Research to evaluate benefits and tradeoffs. The Administration requested funding for a joint HUD-Department of Transportation research initiative in FY2011 to evaluate benefits and tradeoffs. $2 million was allocated for evaluating long-term benefits of Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. Congress appropriated $10 million in FY2010 for research efforts. Additionally, capacity building was proposed as a new component of the Sustainable Communities Initiative to improve technical capacity of various organizations and lenders. These initiatives are to be administered through the Office of Sustainable Housing. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed continued funding of the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) at its FY2010 level of $148.5 million. They also recommended allocating $25 million for the Rural Innovation Fund (RIF) to assist various organizations in addressing housing and poverty-related issues, with a $5 million set-aside for rural areas. Additionally, both bills suggested awarding at least $25 million of the Regional Integrated Planning Grant component to metropolitan areas with populations under 500,000. The bills proposed funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) at the FY2010 level of $148.5 million. They also recommended allocating $25 million for the Rural Innovation Fund (RIF) to address housing and poverty-related issues, with a $5 million set-aside for rural Indian tribes. Additionally, the bills supported HUD's Transformation Initiative and prohibited the use of Community Development Fund dollars for SCI activities. Funding for SCI activities in FY2011 was reduced by 33% compared to FY2010. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to use their CDBG allocations as collateral for redevelopment. The program's loan commitment ceiling was proposed to double from $250 million to $500 million in FY2011 to help finance large-scale projects. The proposed increase in funding in the credit markets will assist local governments in financing large-scale projects slightly above Treasury yields. The Administration suggested revamping the program by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers, eliminating the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. Congress rejected this proposal in favor of maintaining the current structure. H.R. 5850 recommended a loan commitment ceiling of $427 million with a credit subsidy of $10 million, while S. 3644 suggested a ceiling of $275 million with a subsidy of $6.4 million. P.L. 112-10 continued the program at a commitment level of $275 million with a credit subsidy of $5.988 million. The Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program had a commitment ceiling of $275 million supported by a credit subsidy. The program was proposed to be redesigned in the FY2011 budget to provide technical assistance and funds to local organizations through national intermediaries. The program may be used for training and education activities to enhance capabilities. The Administration's budget request aimed to increase funding for the Capacity Building Program by $10 million, establishing it as a stand-alone account. Grant funds would be competitively awarded to national and regional intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development. The proposal aimed to provide technical and financial assistance through intermediaries to assist CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments in developing capacity for community development and affordable housing activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals. Assistance would include funding for training, education, market research, organizational assessments, and other activities determined by HUD. Successful grantees would need to meet a 3:1 match from private sources. The House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills did not include funding for a new initiative that required successful grantees to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 recommended continuing funding for capacity building activities by organizations like the Local Initiative Support Corporation, Enterprise Community Partners, and Habitat for Humanity under the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program account. P.L. 112-10 also continued to fund capacity building through SHOP. The Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program funds the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) and two other set-asides. SHOP provides grants to organizations for self-help homeownership opportunities where homebuyers contribute labor towards building their homes. The program also funds Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Assistance Council, which supports rural housing needs. The Housing Assistance Council (HAC) supports local organizations in addressing rural housing needs through loans, research, and technical assistance. The President's FY2011 budget did not allocate funding for the SHOP account but proposed $60 million for a new Capacity Building account to fund various activities. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included $82 million for the SHOP program. The SHOP account received $82 million in funding in FY2011, with $27 million for SHOP itself, $50 million for capacity building (including $5 million for rural activities), and $5 million for HAC. This funding level remained the same as in FY2010, with a total of $81.8 million allocated for account activities after a 0.2% across-the-board rescission. HUD provides funding for the Housing Counseling Assistance Program, which offers various counseling services for homeowners, renters, and seniors. Congress has increased funding for this program in recent years due to concerns about mortgage defaults. In recent years, Congress has increased funding for HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance Program due to concerns about mortgage defaults. Funding for the program was steady between FY2003 and FY2007, but increased to $87.5 million in FY2010. The President's FY2011 budget requested $88 million for the program, and both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included funding at similar levels. The President's budget included $100 million for HUD housing counseling assistance, an increase of $12 million over the President's request and the House-passed bill. The final FY2011 appropriations law eliminated funding for this program, resulting in an $87.5 million decrease from FY2010. Critics argue that HUD housing counseling funding overlaps with the NeighborWorks National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program, but HUD funding can be used for a wider variety of counseling types. HUD has also faced criticism for slow distribution of housing counseling grants. HUD has faced criticism for slow distribution of housing counseling grants. Congress has appropriated separate funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling to NeighborWorks America instead of HUD. NeighborWorks is an independent nonprofit corporation funded by Congress for community reinvestment activities. NeighborWorks, an independent nonprofit corporation funded by Congress for community reinvestment activities, received $180 million in FY2008 for mortgage foreclosure counseling. Additional funding of $180 million was appropriated in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The President's budget requested $113 million for NeighborWorks in FY2011, an increase from previous years. In FY2011, funding for the NeighborWorks Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP) was a point of contention. The House bill allocated $113 million, while the Senate bill allocated $125 million. Ultimately, the final appropriations law maintained funding at the FY2010 level of $65 million for the NFMCP. Many housing counseling agencies support the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) by providing counseling to eligible troubled borrowers. Recipients of funding through the NFMCP can use up to 30% of their grants to counsel borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios. All borrowers who may be eligible for HAMP are encouraged to contact housing counselors for assistance. The housing counseling program provides counseling to borrowers, including Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBGs) for Indian tribes to assist low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households. In FY2010, Congress allocated $700 million for NAHBG, with set-asides for technical assistance, training, and loan guarantees. In FY2010, $700 million was allocated for Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBG) with set-asides for technical assistance, training, and loan guarantees. The President's FY2011 budget requested $580 million for NAHBG, while the final FY2011 appropriations law provided nearly $650 million, over $50 million below the FY2010 enacted level. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided nearly $650 million to the account, $50 million below the FY2010 enacted level but $70 million higher than the President's FY2011 budget request. The law also maintained set-asides at FY2010 levels. The annual budget resolution sets spending and revenue parameters for Congress to consider legislation. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees divide their allocation among 12 subcommittees responsible for regular appropriations bills. Committees receive input from various sources during the budget formulation process. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011, but no further action was taken. The House Budget Committee did not report an FY2011 budget resolution. The House and Senate took different approaches for the FY2011 budget. The House adopted a budget enforcement resolution, while the Senate did not agree to enforceable spending allocations. Financial reform was included in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act included $1 billion in funding for the Community Development Fund for a third round of Neighborhood Stabilization Program grants. Funds will be available starting October 1, 2010, considered FY2011 funds. HUD was also authorized to provide up to $1 billion in mortgage assistance to homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to income loss. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 provided $100 million for CDBG disaster relief funding for areas affected by severe storms and flooding. Additionally, HUD was authorized to provide $1 billion in mortgage assistance to homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to income loss. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 allocated $100 million for CDBG disaster relief funding for areas affected by severe storms and flooding from March 2010 through May 2010. This emergency funding, considered emergency FY2010 funding, was provided under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1974.
