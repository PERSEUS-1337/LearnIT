    "content": "The NLRA, as amended, aims to improve workers' bargaining power by allowing them to join or form labor unions and collectively bargain over wages and working conditions. It seeks to eliminate obstacles to the free flow of commerce and encourages collective bargaining practices. The NLRA allows workers to join or form labor unions and collectively bargain over wages and working conditions. It requires employers to bargain in good faith with a union chosen by a majority of employees and defines certain activities as unfair labor practices. The act does not apply to certain industries or exclude unauthorized workers from engaging in union activities. The NLRB administers and enforces the NLRA as an independent federal agency. The NLRB, an independent federal agency, administers and enforces the NLRA. It consists of a five-member board and a General Counsel. The board resolves objections to secret ballot elections, determines bargaining unit composition, and hears appeals of unfair labor practices. The General Counsel's office conducts elections, investigates unfair labor practice complaints, and supervises regional offices. Bargaining units are groups of employees represented by a union based on a \"community of interest\" in wages, hours, and working conditions. A bargaining unit consists of employees grouped together based on common interests in wages, hours, and working conditions. It may include employees of one employer, establishment, or occupation. Professional and nonprofessional employees can be part of the same unit if the majority of professionals agree. Guards cannot be in the same unit as other employees. The appropriate bargaining unit can be agreed upon by the union and employer or determined by the NLRB. In a specific case involving certified nursing assistants (CNAs) at a healthcare center in Mobile, AL, the NLRB found the petitioned-for unit of CNAs to be appropriate. The Center in Mobile, AL petitioned to be represented by the United Steelworkers (USW) for a bargaining unit of CNAs. The CNAs assist residents with daily functions, wear nursing uniforms, and work under licensed practical nurses in the facility's nursing department. The employer argued that the bargaining unit should include all nonprofessional service and maintenance employees. The CNAs at the facility work three eight-hour shifts and must maintain certification from Alabama. The employer argued for including other employees in the bargaining unit, such as resident activity assistants, a staffing coordinator, a maintenance assistant, a medical records clerk, and cooks, who have similar educational requirements as CNAs. These employees receive similar evaluations, pay raises, and benefits, but are not part of the nursing department. The CNAs at the facility, who work three eight-hour shifts, were granted a bargaining unit by the board. The board determined that the CNAs shared a community of interest due to their distinct training, certification, supervision, uniforms, pay rates, work assignments, shifts, and work areas. The employer failed to show that the CNAs shared an overwhelming community of interest with other service and maintenance employees. Rules for campaigning and soliciting union support differ for employers, employees, and union organizers. Rules for campaigning and soliciting union support differ for employers, employees, and union organizers. Employers may campaign against unionization by requiring employees to attend \"captive audience\" meetings during work hours. Supervisors can provide written information and hold individual meetings with employees. Employees can campaign for union support during work hours in various areas. Employees can campaign for union support from coworkers in work and nonwork areas, but only on their own time. Distribution of union literature is allowed in nonwork areas if not permitted in work areas. Using employer's e-mail for union activities depends on the employer's policy regarding other causes or organizations. Employees can use their work email for union activities and solicit support for other causes. Union organizers have restrictions on conducting campaigns on company property but can meet with employees on union property or public areas. Nonemployee union organizers may be allowed in certain circumstances, such as inaccessible sites or with employer permission. Organizers can also contact employees at home through phone, mail, or visits. Neutrality agreements may allow organizers onto company property to protect rights. The NLRA protects the rights of employees and employers, defining unfair labor practices. Employers cannot interfere with employees' right to form or join a union, including threats, discrimination, or wage manipulation. Employers must bargain in good faith. Employees have the right to organize and bargain collectively, and unions must bargain in good faith regarding wages, hours, and working conditions. Unions cannot coerce employees to join or not join, threaten job loss for not supporting unionization, or discriminate against employees. Unions also cannot boycott or strike an employer related to the one they are trying to organize. Unfair labor practice charges can be filed by various parties with the NLRB. The NLRA aims to prevent and address unfair labor practices. Charges can be filed by employees, employers, or unions. NLRB investigates and may issue cease-and-desist orders or remedies for violations. If a charge is valid, it may go to an administrative law judge and be appealed to the board. The act does not aim to punish but to rectify unfair practices, such as wrongful termination for union activities. The NLRA aims to address unfair labor practices, with orders to stop violations and provide remedies. Backpay may be awarded to workers fired for union activities, with estimates of 1,000 to 3,000 illegal firings annually. In a study, 25% of union campaigns resulted in workers being fired for union activities. In 1998 and 1999, Kate Bronfenbrenner found that 25% of union campaigns resulted in workers being fired for union activities. The number of unfair labor practice charges filed peaked at 44,063 in FY1980 and stood at 21,629 in FY2012. 36.4% of charges filed in FY2012 were found to have merit. The NLRA allows unions to be designated by a majority of employees for collective bargaining. Employees can join or form a union through NLRB elections or employer recognition based on signed authorization cards. The National Labor Relations Act allows unions to be designated by a majority of employees for collective bargaining. An employer may voluntarily recognize a union if a majority of employees have signed authorization cards, or the NLRB may order recognition if unfair labor practices have occurred. Certification through a secret ballot election or employer recognition is necessary for collective bargaining to begin. A petition can be filed by a union, worker, or employer to request an election for representation. If at least 30% of employees sign authorization cards, employees or a union can petition the NLRB. An employer can also request an election if a union claims to represent a majority of its employees. Certification by the NLRB as the employees' bargaining representative occurs if a majority of employees voting in the election choose union representation. The NLRA does not specify a timeline for holding elections, and certification does not mandate an immediate contract agreement between the union and employer. The NLRB can conduct union elections without requiring an initial contract agreement. If the employer and union cannot agree on election details, a hearing may be held at the NLRB regional office. The regional director can order an election if necessary. Employees vote in a secret ballot election to decide on union representation. Challenged ballots can impact the election outcome and may be decided by the regional director. An individual's right to vote in an NLRB election can be challenged by the employer or union. The regional director decides if challenged ballots could affect the election outcome. Objections to an election can be filed by either party, which may be appealed to the board. Secret ballot elections can be conducted by a third party, and the NLRB also conducts secret ballot elections for decertifying a union. Employees or a union can file a decertification petition signed by at least 30% of the employees in the bargaining unit. A decertification petition must be signed by at least 30% of employees in the bargaining unit represented by the union. A union certified after a secret ballot election is protected for a year from decertification or election petitions. The NLRB made changes to procedures for filing union representation petitions, conducting secret ballot elections, and resolving challenges. In 2011, the NLRB issued a final rule with changes to representation procedures, effective April 30, 2012. However, implementation was suspended due to a court decision in May 2012. The rule allowed hearing officers to limit pre-election hearings to matters relevant to representation questions and consolidated pre-election and post-election requests for review. The 2011 rule consolidated pre-election and post-election requests for review of decisions by regional directors. Requests for review will now be filed after an election. Special permission for review of pre-election decisions will only be granted in extraordinary circumstances. The NLRB stated that current regulations lack a standard for granting special permission for review. The NLRB's 2011 rule eliminated the 25-day waiting period for scheduling elections and made board review of post-election disputes discretionary. Requests for review of decisions by regional directors will now be filed after an election, with special permission for pre-election decisions granted only in extraordinary circumstances. In FY2010, the NLRB conducted 1,823 elections with unions winning 62.3% of them, up from 46.6% in FY1994. Most elections are based on consent or stipulated agreements between the employer and union. The NLRA does not specify a timetable for elections, but they are typically held within two months of petition filing. In FY2012, 93.9% of initial representation elections were held within 56 days, with a median time of 38 days from petition filing to election. In FY2011, post-election objections and challenges were filed in 115 cases. For cases that resulted in an investigative hearing, it took a median of 62 days to issue a decision; for cases resolved without a hearing, it took a median of 21 days. The NLRB does not track how long it takes for a union and employer to reach a first contract agreement after an election, but a study found that over two-fifths of cases did not reach an agreement within two years. A recent study found that over two-fifths of cases did not reach a contract agreement within two years of winning an NLRB election. The NLRA allows for voluntary union recognition through card check agreements, where a majority or supermajority of employees sign authorization cards. A neutral third party often validates these signatures. A neutral third party validates signatures on authorization cards for collective bargaining contracts, which may include a card check arrangement for unorganized branches. Voluntary recognition allows employees 45 days to file a decertification or election petition. Neutrality agreements may accompany card check arrangements, where the employer agrees to remain neutral during a union organizing campaign. Neutrality agreements in union organizing campaigns involve the employer and union agreeing not to criticize each other. The agreement may include access to company property, employee information, and organizing drives at new branches. Unions may use corporate campaigns to push for a card check campaign with a neutrality agreement, which can involve consumer boycotts, rallies, and public relations efforts. The final way a union may be recognized by an employer is through a bargaining order issued by the NLRB based on specific facts of employer violations. The NLRB issues bargaining orders based on employer violations, which can be appealed to higher courts. Certification by the NLRB is only granted after a union wins a secret ballot election, giving them certain advantages such as protection from decertification for a year. Voluntary recognition or bargaining orders do not result in NLRB certification. Under voluntary card check recognition, employees have 45 days to file a decertification petition or an election petition to be represented by a different union. The duration of an employer's duty to bargain depends on whether a union has been certified by the board or recognized voluntarily. If a union wins an NLRB election, the employer must bargain for a year. After one year without a contract agreement, the employer may withdraw recognition of the union. After one year without a contract agreement, an employer may withdraw recognition of the union if there are doubts about majority employee support. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 granted employers the right to request a secret ballot election. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 granted employers the right to request an election if they had \"good faith\" doubt about union support. The \"Joy Silk doctrine\" required employers to recognize the union if no doubt existed. The doctrine was abandoned in 1969, allowing employers to choose between voluntary recognition or requesting an election if a majority of employees signed authorization cards. In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if an employer insists on an election, the union must file an election petition. The NLRB has dealt with cases of voluntary recognition, including a 2004 decision where employees filed a decertification petition after the employer recognized a union under a card check agreement. In September 2002, Metaldyne recognized the UAW as the bargaining representative of workers at its Pennsylvania plant. Similarly, in August 2003, Dana Corporation entered into a card check agreement with the UAW at its Ohio plant. Both cases involved card check and neutrality agreements before union recognition. Employees filed decertification petitions after recognition, but before a contract was reached, which were dismissed by NLRB directors citing the \"recognition bar\" doctrine. The NLRB dismissed decertification petitions at Dana and Metaldyne Corporations, citing the \"recognition bar\" doctrine. Employees represented by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation petitioned the NLRB for review. The board ruled that after voluntary recognition, employees have 45 days to file a decertification petition, and a rival union has the same timeframe to file an election petition. Following voluntary recognition, employees have 45 days to file a petition to decertify the union. A rival union also has 45 days to file an election petition, which must be signed by at least 30% of bargaining unit employees. If a petition is not filed within 45 days, an election petition cannot be filed during the recognition bar period. The NLRB reversed its decision in the Dana and Metaldyne cases, where employees had petitioned for decertification. Following voluntary recognition, a bargaining unit employee filed a petition for a decertification election within 45 days. The NLRB ruled that after voluntary recognition, an election petition is barred for a reasonable period, defined as at least six months but not more than a year after the first bargaining session. The decision in Lamons Gasket set this precedent. Following voluntary recognition, the NLRB decision in Lamons Gasket established that an election petition is barred for a reasonable period after the first bargaining session. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce requested information on cases affected by this decision, including those dismissed due to unfair labor practice charges. After the NLRB decision in Lamons Gasket, a contract bar prevents election petitions for up to three years after a collective bargaining agreement is reached. In a case involving Shaw's Supermarkets, the employer withdrew recognition of the union after three years of a five-year contract, leading to an appeal to the NLRB. Currently, neither the employer nor the incumbent union can initiate an election. The NLRB ruled in favor of Shaw's Supermarkets, allowing them to withdraw recognition of the union during the five-year contract term. The board majority found that Shaw's had evidence of a loss of majority support for the union, justifying their action. The NLRB allowed Shaw's Supermarkets to withdraw recognition of the union based on evidence of a loss of majority support. If a union and employer cannot reach a collective bargaining agreement, it may lead to an impasse and potential work stoppage. Mediation can be used to help reach a contract agreement in such situations. In mediation for collective bargaining impasses, a mediator assists the union and employer in reaching an agreement by defining issues, suggesting solutions, and promoting compromise. In arbitration, an arbitrator decides on resolving disputes in grievance or contract arbitration, determining terms of existing or new contracts. Interest arbitration can be voluntary or compulsory. In interest arbitration, an arbitrator determines contract terms. It can be voluntary or compulsory, conventional or final-offer, and binding or nonbinding. Final-offer arbitration allows the arbitrator to choose between complete final offers from both sides. Final-offer arbitration in interest arbitration allows the arbitrator to choose between the complete final offers from both the union and the employer. The decision can be binding or nonbinding, and different forms of arbitration can be combined, such as voluntary or compulsory conventional arbitration. Med-Arb combines the role of mediator in the arbitration process. Med-Arb combines the roles of mediator and arbitrator, where a neutral third party facilitates an agreement and then decides on a settlement if parties cannot reach one. Interest arbitration is commonly used in the public sector where striking is limited, while in the private sector, the right to strike can encourage parties to reach a contract agreement voluntarily. Interest arbitration is used in the private sector to settle bargaining impasses between unions and employers, aiming to prevent strikes or lockouts. It may change negotiating behavior and become the norm for resolving disputes. Strikes over wages, hours, or working conditions can lead to economic strikes where employers can replace striking workers. Interest arbitration in the private sector aims to settle bargaining impasses and prevent strikes or lockouts. Economic strikes over wages, hours, or working conditions can lead to workers being permanently replaced. Interest arbitration may have adverse effects on negotiations, such as a \"chilling\" effect and a \"narcotic\" effect, impacting the willingness of both sides to engage in serious bargaining. Interest arbitration in the private sector aims to settle bargaining impasses and prevent strikes or lockouts. One adverse effect is the \"narcotic\" effect it may have on contract negotiations, leading parties to rely on arbitration rather than engaging in serious bargaining. Final-offer arbitration is proposed as a solution to encourage compromise by limiting arbitrators to selecting the last offer from either party. Final-offer arbitration aims to encourage compromise by limiting arbitrators to choosing the last offer from either the union or employer. This approach may lead to a contract settlement through increased willingness to compromise. The NLRA does not provide a statutory exemption for small businesses, but the NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee or have jurisdiction over employers with low annual revenues or sales. The NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee or have jurisdiction over employers with low annual revenues or sales. The board's jurisdiction is based on employers whose operations affect interstate commerce, and they must meet administrative standards before the board will assert jurisdiction over a question of union representation. These standards are generally based on an employer's annual sales or gross revenue. The NLRB's jurisdictional standards are based on an employer's annual sales or gross revenue. For example, a retail business needs at least $500,000 in annual sales for the board to assert jurisdiction. Nonretail businesses must have $50,000 in annual direct or indirect sales to buyers in other states. Private colleges and symphony orchestras need at least $1 million in annual revenue. These standards have been in effect since August 1, 1959, established by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The NLRB's jurisdictional standards are based on annual sales or gross revenue of employers. The Board may decline to assert jurisdiction over a labor dispute if it does not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The Board must assert jurisdiction over a labor dispute if the employer meets the standards in effect on August 1, 1959. This could impact smaller employers and their employees' ability to unionize. The NLRB may not assert jurisdiction over a labor dispute that lacks a significant impact on interstate commerce. Smaller employers and their employees could still unionize through alternative methods, such as voluntary recognition by the employer or a third-party supervised secret ballot election. State agencies or courts can also take jurisdiction over disputes where the NLRB declines involvement. The GAO estimated that 5 million employees of small employers lacked collective bargaining rights under the NLRA due to jurisdictional standards. In February 2001, 5 million employees of small employers lacked collective bargaining rights under the NLRA due to jurisdictional standards. Recent legislation proposed changes to union certification procedures, including requiring secret ballot elections. Recent legislation proposed changes to union certification procedures, including requiring secret ballot elections or card check certification. Supporters and opponents have different arguments regarding the potential effects on unionization levels in the United States. Employers raise concerns about coercion under card check certification, while unions argue against employer pressure during secret ballot elections. Research on union certification procedures' impact on success rates is also reviewed. During an election campaign, employers may pressure employees to vote against a union. Proponents of secret ballot elections argue that it ensures privacy. Unions argue that card check certification is less costly but employers claim unionization may be costly for employees. Research suggests changes in union recognition procedures could impact unionization levels in the United States. Research suggests that changes in union recognition procedures, such as card check certification, can impact the level of unionization in the United States. Studies show that unions have a higher success rate with card check certification compared to secret ballots, and they undertake more unionization drives under this method. Additionally, combining a card check campaign with a neutrality agreement further increases the union success rate. In Canada, evidence indicates that automatic card check recognition leads to higher union success rates compared to secret ballots. In Canada, provinces shifted from card check recognition to secret ballot elections in 1984. Mandatory voting was repealed in 1993 and reinstated in 2001. Under mandatory voting, a union needs a majority of votes in a secret ballot election to be recognized. Card check recognition automatically recognizes a union if a certain percentage of employees sign authorization cards. A study found that union success rates are higher under card check recognition than secret ballots in Canada. The study examined union organizing campaigns in Canada between 1978 and 1996, comparing union success rates under card check recognition and secret ballots. In British Columbia, union success rate fell when mandatory voting was adopted in 1984 but increased when card check recognition was reinstated in 1993. There were fewer organizing drives during mandatory voting, and the number did not return to pre-1984 levels after 1993. In Ontario, card check recognition was allowed before 1995. Since November 1995, secret balloting is required for union certification in Ontario. A study comparing card check recognition and secret ballots found that certification rates were higher with card checks. However, union success rates decreased from 72.7% to 64.3% under secret balloting. Larger bargaining units were organized under secret balloting, with an average size of 63.1 workers compared to 36.3 employees under card check recognition. The study compared union certification methods, showing higher certification rates with card check recognition. Larger bargaining units were organized under secret balloting, with an average size of 63.1 workers. Union success rates were higher when combining card check agreements with neutrality agreements. The study in the United States found that union success rates are higher when combining card check recognition with a neutrality agreement. Unions had a 78.2% success rate with this combination compared to 62.5% with just a card check agreement. Card check recognition may lead to higher success rates due to less employer opposition and lower costs compared to secret ballot elections. Requiring card check certification may increase union success rates by reducing employer opposition and costs compared to secret ballot elections. However, the impact on reversing the decline in private sector unionization in the United States is uncertain, as shrinking employment in unionized firms and decertifications could offset any membership gains. Additionally, employer opposition may rise during the collection of authorization cards. According to polls, Americans generally support unions, with 59% approving and 31% disapproving. 53% favor a law making it easier for unions to organize, while 39% oppose it. 33% believe Congress should change laws to facilitate union formation, 40% disagree, and 27% are unsure. 61% agree that a secret ballot should be required for union formation. According to a survey, 32% of respondents questioned the fairness of requiring a secret ballot for union formation. Another survey showed that 75% of participants believed a secret ballot election is the most fair and democratic method. According to a March 2006 survey by the Center for Union Facts, 75% of respondents prefer a secret ballot election for union formation, while only 12% support card check recognition. The NLRA grants private sector workers the right to organize and collectively bargain. The NLRA grants private sector workers the right to organize and collectively bargain. Governments may intervene in labor markets to improve competition and efficiency in resource allocation. In labor markets, workers are paid based on their contribution to output. The theory of compensating wage differentials acknowledges that individuals have varying preferences for working conditions. Increasing workers' bargaining power can lead to higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. Unionization in labor markets can potentially raise wages, improve benefits, and enhance working conditions. However, in competitive labor markets, increasing employees' bargaining power may lead to a misallocation of resources, reducing total economic output and consumer satisfaction. Higher union wages in competitive markets could also result in lower employment for union workers and decrease the relative wages of nonunion workers. Identifying the competitiveness of labor markets can be challenging. Governments may intervene in labor markets to reduce earnings inequality through means like unionization. Some economists argue that greater earnings equality during a recession can boost aggregate demand and reduce unemployment. Labor markets can be local, regional, national, or international, making it difficult to determine competitiveness. Labor markets may change over time due to various factors. Some economists argue that unions provide workers with a \"voice\" in the workplace, allowing them to communicate with management through dispute resolution or formal grievance procedures. Collective bargaining by unionized workers may lead to higher wages, improved benefits, and better working conditions compared to individual bargaining. The economic impact of requiring card check certification or secret ballot elections depends on policymakers' objectives and the competitiveness of labor markets. Collective bargaining can improve or harm resource allocation and economic efficiency depending on labor market competitiveness. Increasing workers' bargaining power may reduce economic output but increase equality in competitive markets. In non-competitive markets, it can improve resource allocation and equality. Requiring card check certification may increase organizing campaigns and union success, while secret ballot elections may decrease them. Secret ballot elections may lower unionization levels, while card check certification may raise them. Requiring secret ballot elections may lower unionization levels, while card check certification may raise them. Depending on labor market competitiveness, card check certification may improve or harm economic efficiency. Earnings inequality may increase if fewer workers are unionized with secret ballot elections, while card check certification may reduce inequality. The effects of these changes may be difficult to predict or measure."
