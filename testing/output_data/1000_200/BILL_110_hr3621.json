    "content": "The Act titled \"Safety, Accountability, and Funding Efficiency for Transportation Act of 2007\" emphasizes the importance of conducting cost-benefit analysis before procuring transportation services from private contractors to ensure quality and cost-effectiveness. The Act defines \"architectural, engineering, and related services\" as various services related to construction projects. It also defines \"private contract\" as an agreement between a government agency and a private contractor, and \"government agency\" as any entity receiving Federal funds for transportation projects. The term \"government agency\" refers to any entity receiving Federal funds for surface transportation projects, while the term \"Secretary\" specifically denotes the Secretary of Transportation. A \"surface transportation project\" encompasses projects eligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code, capital projects defined in section 5302 of title 49, United States Code, and other projects related to surface transportation as determined appropriate by the Secretary. SEC. 4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. For fiscal year 2009 and beyond, Federal funds for surface transportation projects can be used by government agencies for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services, but only after conducting a cost-benefit analysis as required. The analysis must include a description of services, cost estimates, and negotiation expenses. The cost-benefit analysis for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services must include the price of the contract, negotiation and inspection costs, estimate of government agency performing the services, and determination of procurement speed. The cost-benefit analysis for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services should include determining if the government agency will provide equipment and materials, estimating unemployment compensation for displaced employees, and estimating the cost of the government agency resuming service under the private contract. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\nGovernment agencies must disclose the results of cost-benefit analyses for private contracts deemed in the public interest. Results must be submitted to the Secretary for review, provided to registered individuals or entities, and made available for public inspection, including online publication.\n\nSEC. 6. COMMENTS. SEC. 6. COMMENTS.\n\nInterested parties can submit written comments refuting the accuracy of cost-benefit analysis results for private contracts. Government agency employees can also bid to provide the services under the contract. The Secretary may waive the application of this Act for private contracts at the request of a government agency if the work is of an emergency, specialty, or intermittent nature and cannot be performed by government employees to avoid underutilization."
