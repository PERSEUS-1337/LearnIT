Children eligible for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act, despite exceeding income limits, can still qualify if they meet disability criteria under section 1614(a)(3)(C) and surpass requirements for supplemental security income benefits. Payments to States with approved waivers under section 2105(a) of the Social Security Act are prioritized for specific expenditures in a set order. Payments under subsection (d)(1) of this section are prioritized for specific expenditures in a set order, including items described in section 2105(a) of the Social Security Act."
