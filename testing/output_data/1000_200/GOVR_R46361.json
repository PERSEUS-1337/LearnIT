    "content": "The report provides an overview of the FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93) and summarizes the budgetary context of the legislation. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion for national defense activities, with $718.3 billion allocated to the Department of Defense. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $689.5 billion for the Department of Defense, with an additional $1.1 billion for certain intelligence community expenses. This bill does not include funding for military construction, family housing, or TRICARE for Life program. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act provides $687.8 billion for the Department of Defense, $2.86 billion less than requested by President Trump. Since 2001, DOD has organized its budget requests to designate funding for activities related to post-9/11 attacks or distinct from regular costs, known as the \"base budget.\" Non-base budget funds have been designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) since 2009. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act provides $687.8 billion for the Department of Defense, with $97.9 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding to avoid exceeding the defense spending cap set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act provided $687.8 billion for the Department of Defense, with $97.9 billion designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding to avoid exceeding the defense spending cap. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the defense spending cap for FY2020 to $666.5 billion, rendering the issue of OCO funding for base budget activities moot. The House and Senate reported separate versions of the FY2020 defense appropriations bill, with the House passing H.R. 2740 incorporating H.R. 2968, and the Senate taking no action on S. 2474. A compromise version of the defense bill was agreed upon by both chambers. The committee reported its version of the bill (S. 2474) on September 12, 2019, but the Senate took no action. A compromise defense bill was incorporated into H.R. 1158, passed by both chambers. The President's FY2020 budget request for DOD reflects a shift in strategic emphasis based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy, focusing on increased investment to counter threats from China and Russia. The shift in U.S. national security policy marks a renewed emphasis on competition between nuclear-armed powers, moving away from the focus on countering terrorism and regional aggressors. This change reflects a shift in strategic emphasis based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy, with increased investment to counter threats from China and Russia. After the 9/11 attacks, U.S. national security policy focused on countering terrorism and insurgencies in the Middle East, while also addressing North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of the South China Sea raised concerns about aggressive regimes in Moscow and Beijing. These events highlighted the need for a shift in U.S. national security policy towards competition with nuclear-armed powers like Russia and China. The U.S. national security agenda involves competing with great powers like Russia and China, who use military force to achieve their objectives. Challenges from the end of the Cold War, such as fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation, continue to threaten U.S. interests. Adversaries may collaborate to advance shared goals, using social and economic tools. Some states work with non-state proxies to blur the lines between conventional and irregular conflict. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy focus on great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need to bolster the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. The security environment is complex, with various threats including militias, criminal networks, and hackers blurring the lines between civilian and military activities. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) emphasizes the need to strengthen the competitive advantage of U.S. forces against Chinese and Russian threats. It identifies China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups as significant threats to U.S. interests. The NDS prioritizes maintaining a strategic edge over China and Russia over countering violent extremist organizations. The NDS prioritizes retaining the U.S. strategic competitive edge over China and Russia as a \"2+3\" strategy, focusing on countering two primary challenges and three additional challenges. Federal spending has increased significantly over the past four decades, with mandatory spending for entitlement programs growing rapidly. Congressional budgeting has been influenced by the Budget Control Act of 2011 to control federal spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) established annual limits to reduce federal discretionary spending by $1.0 trillion through FY2021. Sequestration enforces these limits by automatically canceling previous appropriations if spending exceeds the caps. The caps on defense-related spending apply to discretionary funding for DOD and defense-related activities, but not to emergency or Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established annual limits to reduce federal discretionary spending. The caps do not apply to emergency or Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. Congress has raised the spending caps multiple times. The national defense spending cap for FY2020 was $576 billion, $71 billion lower than the revised cap for FY2019. The Administration's FY2020 base budget request adhered to the defense cap, but also included $165 billion in OCO funding, with $98 billion intended for base budget purposes. The House and Senate Committees considered all funding for base budget purposes as part of the base budget request. P.L. 116-93 funds a modest increase in active-duty military personnel across all armed forces, with a reduction of 7,500 in the Army's end-strength. The act also supports a decrease in the end-strength of the Selected Reserve. Additionally, it includes a 3.1% increase in military basic pay that took effect on January 1, 2020. P.L. 116-93 authorizes a 3.1% increase in military basic pay effective January 1, 2020. It allocates funds for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office and the Special Victims' Counsel program. Additionally, it provides funding for a pilot program for treating military personnel with PTSD related to sexual trauma and adds $110 million to the childcare program. P.L. 116-93 added $110 million to DOD's childcare program, the largest in the US, serving 23,000 employees and nearly 200,000 children. It requires a detailed report on childcare system plans and supports modernization of nuclear weapons as a top priority. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget prioritized modernizing the nuclear triad with hypersonic long-range missiles capable of striking distant targets with conventional warheads. These weapons can maneuver throughout their flight trajectory, in response to China and Russia's development of similar technology. The DOD has prioritized hypersonic weapons development due to China and Russia's advancements. Congress has provided funding to accelerate the U.S. hypersonic program and develop defenses against hypersonic missiles. A Joint Hypersonics Transition Office was created to coordinate R&D programs across DOD. The enacted FY2020 defense bill added $100 million for a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office to coordinate hypersonic R&D programs. Concerns were raised about duplication of effort and increased costs in hypersonic weapons development. P.L. 116-93 supported strengthening defenses against ballistic missile attacks, reflecting the Administration's proposals from the Missile Defense Review. In January 2019, P.L. 116-93 reallocated funds for the defense system against ICBMs due to the cancellation of the Replacement Kill Vehicle program. The bill provides $515.0 million for developing an improved interceptor missile, $285 million for additional GBI missiles, and $180 million for R&D to enhance GBI reliability. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act reallocated funds for defense systems against ICBMs, providing $285 million for additional GBI missiles and $180 million for R&D to improve GBI reliability. Congress approved $40 million for the newly created Space Force, significantly less than requested due to insufficient justification provided by DOD. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act reallocated funds for defense systems against ICBMs, providing $285 million for additional GBI missiles and $180 million for R&D to improve GBI reliability. The act also supported the Army's plan to upgrade ground-combat vehicles, including providing 30% more funding than requested to increase the firepower of the Stryker troop-carrier with a 30 mm cannon. The act sends a mixed message regarding congressional support for the Army's strategy for developing new combat capabilities. The Army's new plan reallocates funds from older upgrade programs to invest in new systems sooner. The Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters are among the programs affected, with less funding for Bradley upgrades but triple the amount requested for Chinook upgrades. The enacted bill labels the cut funds for Bradley upgrades as \"excess to need.\" The Army's new plan reallocates funds from older upgrade programs to invest in new systems sooner. The bill appropriated $46.2 million for the Chinook upgrade, exceeding the $18.2 million requested. Additionally, the bill provided $205.6 million for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program out of the $378.4 million requested, challenging the Army's proposal for a streamlined acquisition process. The Army's plan to reallocate funds from older upgrade programs to invest in new systems was challenged by Congress, leading to the cancellation of the OMFV contracting plan. P.L. 116-93 supports major aviation programs but insists on continuing the planned upgrade of the CH-47 Chinook helicopter. This decision indicates potential future disagreements between Congress and the Army regarding modernization strategies. The Army decided to cut funding for the procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s in order to allocate funds for its modernization strategy. The FY2020 defense bill provided $46.2 million for the program, while $985.5 million was allocated for F-15s to address Air Force fighter strength issues. Some funds were shifted to the Air Force's Research and Development account. The FY2020 defense bill shifted funds for F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and F-15s to address Air Force fighter strength issues. The bill supports Navy's shipbuilding budget request to increase fleet size to 355 ships, including funds for unmanned surface and subsurface ships. The FY2020 defense bill supports funds for unmanned surface and subsurface ships to increase fleet size to 355 ships. It denied $3.2 billion budgeted for one Virginia-class submarine but added $1.4 billion for the other two subs to incorporate the Virginia Payload Module. Additionally, $1.2 billion was provided for specialized ships and a landing craft to support Marine Corps amphibious landings. The FY2020 defense bill allocated $1.2 billion for specialized ships and a landing craft to support Marine Corps amphibious landings. The Appendix lists various CRS reports related to Navy programs.
