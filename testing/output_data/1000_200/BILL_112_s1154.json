    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Honoring Promises to Service-Disabled Veterans Act of 2011\". Congress acknowledges that federal agencies must comply with the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999, which set a goal for awarding contracts to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. Progress in meeting this goal has been slow, and prime contractors working with the government are also responsible for helping achieve it. The government has an obligation to meet the Government-wide goal for service-disabled veterans, and the public has the right to know if Executive departments and prime contractors are meeting this goal. SEC. 3. Transparency in contracting goals for small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. Section 15 of the Small Business Act is amended to include transparency in contracting goals for small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. This requires covered contractors to submit subcontracting plans to Executive departments, with reports to the Administrator on the percentage of total contract value. The head of each Executive department must submit a report to the Administrator detailing the percentage of prime contracts awarded to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, the names of contractors receiving contracts, and the subcontracting goals for these small businesses. The report must include the percentage of prime contracts awarded to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans and the subcontracting goals for these businesses, as well as the percentage of subcontracts awarded to small business concerns owned by service-disabled veterans. The report must include the percentage of prime contracts awarded to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans and the subcontracting goals for these businesses. Additionally, it should detail the percentage of subcontracts awarded to small business concerns owned by service-disabled veterans by the Executive department. The Administrator will rank Executive departments based on these criteria annually. The Administrator will rank Executive departments and covered contractors based on the percentage of contracts awarded to small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. The Administrator will publish a report on a website containing information submitted by Executive departments and covered contractors regarding contracts awarded to small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. The Administrator will update a website quarterly with rankings made by Executive departments, with an exception for national security concerns. Additionally, an annual report on progress towards meeting small business contract goals will be submitted to Congress. The Administrator will submit an annual report to Congress on the progress of Executive departments towards meeting Government-wide contracting goals. The report will include whether the website contains the latest data and a recommendation for a prime contractor excelling in contracting with small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. The Administrator will submit an annual report to Congress on the progress of Executive departments towards meeting Government-wide contracting goals, including contracting with small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. This subsection does not affect any other reporting requirement under Federal law."
