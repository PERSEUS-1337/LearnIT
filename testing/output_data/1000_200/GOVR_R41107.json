    "content": "Negotiating parties of the proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have until May 1, 2013, to sign the agreement. The ACTA would enter into force after the sixth instrument of ratification is deposited. Mexico signed the ACTA on July 11, 2012, requiring ratification in the Mexican Congress. The European Parliament voted against the ACTA on July 4, 2012, preventing the EU and its member states from joining. Several EU member states suspended or did not adopt the ACTA due to protests for Internet free speech. The European Commission halted the ratification process and sent the agreement to the European Court of Justice for review. On January 25, 2012, the EU and 22 member states signed the ACTA, while five did not sign due to procedural issues. On October 1, 2011, several countries including Australia, Canada, Japan, and the US signed the ACTA. The ACTA was signed by governments of Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States in 2011. The European Union, Mexico, and Switzerland expressed support for the Agreement. The final version of the agreement text was released in May 2011 after nearly three years of negotiations. The ACTA is aimed at combating intellectual property rights infringement. The ACTA, signed by several countries in 2011, aims to combat intellectual property rights infringement, focusing on trademarks and copyrights enforcement. It builds on the standards set by the WTO TRIPS Agreement and addresses emerging IPR issues, particularly in the digital environment. The agreement establishes a legal framework for IPR enforcement, including civil enforcement, border measures, and criminal enforcement for willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy. The ACTA negotiation concluded in October 2010, with countries having until May 1, 2013, to sign the agreement. All negotiating parties, except Mexico and Switzerland, have signed the agreement. The ACTA aims to combat intellectual property rights infringement, focusing on trademarks and copyrights enforcement, with provisions for civil, border, and criminal enforcement. The idea of negotiating the ACTA was conceived in 2006 by the United States and Japan. A group of interested parties held preliminary talks about the proposed ACTA in 2006 and 2007. Formal negotiations were launched in June 2008 with more countries joining. The United States aimed to conclude the agreement by the end of that year. The ACTA negotiations began in 2008 with countries like South Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, and Singapore. After 11 rounds of negotiations, the final round in Japan in October 2010 resolved most issues. On October 1, 2011, Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States signed the ACTA, with the EU, Mexico, and Switzerland expressing support to sign soon. The ACTA negotiations began in 2008 with various countries participating. On January 25, 2012, the European Union and 22 member states signed the agreement, followed by Mexico on July 11, 2012. The signatories aim to ratify the agreement promptly for it to enter into force after the sixth instrument of approval is deposited. Currently, no country has completed this step, and each country is going through its domestic approval processes. The ACTA negotiations involve different domestic approval processes across countries. The USTR negotiated the ACTA as an executive agreement for the U.S., not requiring congressional approval unless statutory changes are needed. The European Parliament and all EU member states must sign and ratify the ACTA for it to enter into force in the EU. The European Parliament voted against the ACTA on July 4, 2012, preventing the EU and its member states from joining. Several EU countries suspended or did not initiate domestic adoption of the ACTA amid protests for Internet free speech. The European Commission put the ratification process on hold and sent the agreement to the European Court of Justice for review. There is a possibility of the ACTA being revived after the court ruling. Certain participants, including the United States, EU, and Switzerland, claim that implementing the ACTA will not require changes to their laws. Following the European Parliament's rejection of the ACTA in 2012, certain countries like the United States, EU, and Switzerland believe that implementing the agreement will not necessitate changes to their legal systems. However, other nations may need to enact new laws to comply with the enforcement standards of the ACTA, such as granting customs officials the authority to investigate trademark infringement and copyright piracy. Canada, for instance, incorporated the digital enforcement standards of the ACTA into its domestic law through the WIPO Internet treaties. Canada finalized passage of copyright bill C-11 in 2012, incorporating WIPO Internet treaties into domestic law. Countries involved in ACTA negotiation are economically advanced and value IPR-based industries. ACTA establishes legal framework for IPR. The ACTA establishes a legal framework for IPR enforcement, international cooperation, and enhanced measures. Key provisions include the nature and scope of the agreement, relationship to existing agreements, flexibility for Parties to implement more extensive IPR enforcement, and determine appropriate methods of implementation. The ACTA allows Parties to implement more extensive IPR enforcement, with flexibility in how provisions are implemented. It notes that TRIPS Agreement principles apply, and does not require obligations for intellectual property not protected under domestic laws. The legal framework chapter includes obligations for enforcement, civil, border, criminal, and digital environment enforcement, emphasizing effective action without trade barriers. The obligations section of the ACTA commits Parties to effective IPR enforcement action, ensuring expeditious and deterrent remedies while avoiding trade barriers. It also requires proportionality in enforcement measures and penalties. Civil enforcement provisions mandate the availability of judicial procedures for IPR enforcement, including injunctions and damages for right holders. The civil enforcement section of the ACTA mandates judicial procedures for IPR enforcement, including injunctions, damages, recovery of costs, and attorney's fees. It also allows for the destruction of infringing goods and provisional measures like seizures to prevent infringement. Parties may exclude patents and undisclosed information from this section. The border measures section of the ACTA focuses on effective enforcement of intellectual property rights at borders without hindering legitimate trade. It includes provisions for customs authorities to suspend the release of suspect goods and allows right holders to request such actions. The ACTA allows authorities to suspend the release of suspect goods and detain them, with right holders able to request such actions. It also mandates procedures for determining IPR infringement, authorizes the destruction of infringing goods, and imposes penalties. Criminal enforcement is required for willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale. The ACTA mandates penalties, including imprisonment and fines, for willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale. It requires authorities to seize suspected counterfeit goods, order forfeiture or destruction of infringing goods and related materials, and seize assets derived from infringing activities. The ACTA mandates penalties for trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy on a commercial scale, including imprisonment and fines. It also allows authorities to seize counterfeit goods, order forfeiture of infringing goods, and seize assets derived from infringing activities. The digital enforcement section discusses obligations for enforcement of copyrights and related rights over digital networks, ensuring effective enforcement action against IPR infringement in the digital environment. The ACTA mandates penalties for trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy on a commercial scale, including imprisonment and fines. It also allows authorities to seize counterfeit goods, order forfeiture of infringing goods, and seize assets derived from infringing activities. The digital enforcement section focuses on enforcement procedures for copyright and related rights over digital networks, ensuring effective action against infringement while preserving freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy. Parties may disclose identifying information related to alleged infringement and provide legal protection against circumvention of technological measures. The enforcement practices chapter of ACTA focuses on methods used by Parties to apply IPR enforcement laws, promoting development of expertise, data collection, and sharing information to combat infringement risks at the border. The international cooperation chapter of ACTA emphasizes promoting transparency in IPR enforcement systems, raising public awareness on respecting IPR, and considering environmental factors in the destruction of infringing goods. It also encourages cooperation among competent authorities to address challenges in cross-border trade of counterfeit and pirated products. The institutional arrangement chapter of ACTA establishes an ACTA Committee to review implementation, proposed amendments, and terms of accession. The committee makes decisions by consensus and establishes a consultation mechanism for implementation issues. The ACTA Committee makes decisions by consensus and establishes a consultation mechanism for implementation issues. The agreement remains open for signature until May 1, 2013, and enters into force after the sixth instrument of ratification. The United States conducted the negotiation through the USTR, which leads U.S. trade agreements in international forums. The USTR crafts U.S. trade policy through an interagency process involving various departments and consults with advisory groups, congressional committees, and stakeholder groups. The ACTA was negotiated as an executive agreement by the Bush and Obama administrations, with the USTR stating it is consistent with existing U.S. law and does not require changes for implementation. The USTR maintains that ACTA does not require new legislation from Congress as it aligns with existing U.S. laws on copyright, patent, and trademark. The congressional role in ACTA is rooted in the U.S. Constitution, giving Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce and intellectual property rights. The USTR maintains that ACTA aligns with existing U.S. laws on copyright, patent, and trademark. Congress has a consultative and oversight role in the ACTA negotiation process, although it has not established a consultative role in statute. The use of an executive agreement for ACTA negotiations may be a departure from past practices in pursuing international IPR goals. The United States has traditionally pursued international IPR goals through congressional-executive trade agreements or treaties, with concerns about rising global IPR infringement. High costs of research and development in IPR-based industries contrast with low risks and high profits of infringement, especially in easily duplicated technologies like digital media. Internet usage has fueled piracy, and some countries lack sufficient penalties for counterfeiting and piracy. The United States emphasizes the economic, health, and security reasons for negotiating the ACTA to combat counterfeiting and piracy, which are fueled by growing Internet usage. Inadequate penalties in some countries contribute to the problem. Protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights (IPR) is crucial for promoting innovation and safeguarding the U.S. economy from the negative impacts of piracy and counterfeiting. The United States emphasizes the importance of protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights (IPR) to combat counterfeiting and piracy, which have adverse impacts on the economy. Advocates claim that these illicit activities result in billions of dollars of revenue and trade losses annually. However, quantifying these losses is challenging due to the secretive nature of IPR infringement. The difficulty in tracking production and trade of counterfeit goods, especially digital media, is exacerbated by the internet. Companies may withhold information on IPR infringement to protect their brand. Some question the commercial rationale for the ACTA, doubting the accuracy of industry-generated loss estimates and the direct impact of pirated goods on legitimate firms' revenue. Some argue that sales of pirated goods may not directly result in revenue losses for legitimate firms, as some consumers may not purchase the legitimate version at market price. Critics suggest that IPR protection favors private rights over economic and social welfare, potentially stifling the free flow of information. Additionally, there are concerns that government discussions on ACTA may not fully consider the benefits of exceptions like \"fair use\" in copyright law. Some argue that while IPR protection can promote innovation, unbalanced rules may hinder information flow. U.S. participation in ACTA is also driven by health and safety concerns related to counterfeiting. Critics warn of potential threats from counterfeit products, but there is debate on the conflation of counterfeiting with health risks. Increasing IPR protection may have unintended consequences on health and safety. Some express concerns about the impact of increasing IPR protection on public health and access to affordable medicines. Security concerns related to counterfeiting and piracy are also a rationale for U.S. involvement in the ACTA, with links to organized crime activities such as drug smuggling and money laundering. The United States pursues IPR objectives through various trade policy mechanisms, including multilaterally through the WTO, regionally and bilaterally through FTAs, and domestically through U.S. trade laws. The ACTA aims to enhance the TRIPS Agreement by addressing gaps in international rules on IPR protection and enforcement. The United States supports the negotiation of the ACTA to address gaps in international rules on IPR protection and enforcement, particularly in dealing with IPR infringement issues related to new technologies and digital piracy. There are ongoing debates about the legitimacy and fairness of the TRIPS Agreement in balancing private rights and public obligations for social and cultural development. The U.S. pursues international IPR protection through regional and bilateral FTAs. The United States pursues international IPR protection through regional and bilateral FTAs, seeking levels of protection exceeding the TRIPS Agreement. Some IPR provisions in U.S. FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia were revised after the Bipartisan Trade Agreement in 2007. U.S. FTAs have influenced the ACTA, with interest in modeling it on enforcement provisions from agreements with Australia, Morocco, Singapore, and South Korea. The ACTA focuses on IPR enforcement provisions from U.S. FTAs with Australia, Morocco, Singapore, and South Korea. It aims to expand stronger IPR commitments to more countries through a plurilateral agreement. Unlike traditional FTAs, the ACTA is narrowly focused on IPR issues. The ACTA is a plurilateral agreement focused on IPR enforcement provisions, sparking debates among stakeholders on transparency and inclusiveness. U.S. business sectors like entertainment and pharmaceuticals support the ACTA for stronger international IPR protection, while other groups, such as Internet service providers, have concerns about digital enforcement provisions. Civil society groups also have varying opinions on the proposed agreement. Various groups, including Internet service providers and civil society organizations, have expressed concerns about the digital enforcement provisions of the proposed ACTA agreement. Some question the need for a new agreement to combat counterfeiting and piracy when existing international agreements on IPR already exist. The ACTA focuses on combating counterfeit goods, specifically trademark infringement of physical goods. The ACTA agreement broadened its scope from combating trademark infringement of physical goods to include piracy, which refers to copyright infringement. Negotiating parties differed on the range of intellectual property to be covered, with the European Union advocating for the inclusion of patents in civil enforcement. The European Union pushed for patents to be included in the civil enforcement section of the ACTA, while the United States opposed this inclusion due to concerns about contradicting U.S. patent law. The final ACTA text allows parties to exclude patents from the civil enforcement section, with the U.S. stating it will do so. It remains to be seen which countries will exclude patents from their civil enforcement. The EU supported including trademarks in the digital enforcement section of the ACTA, citing concerns about infringement on European trademarks. In contrast, the US opposed including trademarks, possibly due to conflicting with US law like the DMCA. The final ACTA text mostly excludes trademark counterfeiting. The final ACTA text largely focuses on copyright infringement over digital networks, with provisions for online service providers to disclose information to identify subscribers involved in trademark or copyright infringement. Debates have arisen regarding the transparency of the negotiation process, with some groups criticizing the lack of public input. Critics argue that the ACTA negotiation lacked transparency and meaningful public input, with close consultation with right holders but limited engagement with consumer and public interest groups. Observers note unprecedented secrecy compared to other trade negotiations, calling for enhanced transparency. Members of Congress and stakeholders urge USTR to allow public review and comment on substantive proposals. During the ACTA negotiations, USTR faced criticism for lack of transparency. Senators Sanders and Brown called for public review of ACTA proposals. USTR defended the secrecy, stating it allows for confidential exchanges to facilitate negotiation. USTR shared draft text with cleared advisors and industry representatives. USTR increased transparency during the ACTA negotiation process by sharing draft texts with cleared advisors and industry representatives, releasing summaries of key elements, draft texts, consolidated texts, and finalized texts at various stages of the negotiations. This was in response to criticism for lack of transparency from Senators Sanders and Brown. USTR increased transparency during the ACTA negotiation process by sharing draft texts with advisors and industry representatives, releasing summaries of key elements, draft texts, and finalized texts. They consulted with Congress and stakeholders to ensure the ACTA reflected their perspectives. During the ACTA negotiation process, USTR consulted with various stakeholders, including right holders, Internet intermediaries, and non-government organizations. The absence of developing country participation in the plurilateral agreement was a point of controversy, with concerns raised about the negotiation not considering the interests of developing countries. Some developing country advocates are concerned that the ACTA negotiation did not consider their interests and needs. China and India have expressed worries that the ACTA could weaken rights, obligations, and flexibilities negotiated in WTO agreements, create trade barriers, limit flexibility in the TRIPS Agreement for public health and generic medicines, and restrict government's freedom to allocate resources for IPR enforcement. Other developing countries share similar views. The selection of participants in the ACTA has also been debated. The ACTA negotiation has sparked debate over the selection of participating countries, with some questioning why countries like Canada, Mexico, Finland, and Romania are involved despite being on the USTR's Special 301 report for inadequate IPR protection. There are concerns about the effectiveness of the agreement without major sources of counterfeiting like China and Russia included. Discussions have also touched on expanding the ACTA to include other interested countries. The ACTA negotiation parties have discussed expanding the agreement to include other countries in the future. The final text includes terms for accession, allowing any WTO member to apply after the signatory period. The USTR hopes for more countries to join, but critics fear developing countries may only be invited once the agreement is set in stone. The ACTA negotiation has sparked debate about the impact of increased IPR protection on trade and consumer activities. IPR-based industries support the ACTA for economic growth, while some groups fear developing countries may feel pressured to adhere to it for trade benefits. Critics argue that ACTA provisions could interfere with legitimate trade and consumer rights. The ACTA negotiation has sparked debate about the impact of increased IPR protection on trade and consumer activities. Critics argue that ACTA provisions may interfere with trade in legitimate goods and consumer activity, while negotiating parties maintain that the agreement respects public health and civil liberties, with safeguards to protect against barriers to legitimate trade. USTR released a statement affirming that ACTA will not infringe on fundamental rights and liberties, will be consistent with the TRIPS Agreement, and will not hinder the cross-border transit of generic medicines. Patents will not be covered in the Section on Border Measures. The ACTA negotiation has sparked debate about the impact of increased IPR protection on trade and consumer activities. Critics argue that ACTA provisions may interfere with trade in legitimate goods and consumer activity, while negotiating parties maintain that the agreement respects public health and civil liberties, with safeguards to protect against barriers to legitimate trade. The agreement will not oblige border authorities to search travelers' baggage or electronic devices for infringing materials. Critics are concerned about the potential impact on consumer privacy and the free flow of information, particularly regarding digital enforcement provisions that could lead to ISPs terminating customers' Internet accounts after repeated allegations of copyright infringement. This has been controversial in the European Union, where some view Internet access as a fundamental human right that should only be terminated by judges. Parliament views Internet access as a human right that should only be terminated by judges. Some argue for increased ISP involvement in IPR enforcement to combat online piracy, while critics believe requiring ISPs to filter communication burdens them. Civil liberties groups are concerned about the low threshold for terminating Internet access, advocating for proof of piracy, not just allegations. Recent legislation like the PROTECT IP Act and SOPA have heightened the debate on ISP obligations regarding IPR infringement. The PROTECT IP Act and SOPA were introduced to address online piracy, similar to ACTA. However, due to opposition, congressional consideration of these bills has been postponed. Concerns have been raised about the impact on U.S. \"fair use\" practices under an agreement. Speculation surrounds potential ACTA provisions on remedies against circumvention of technological protection measures. The final ACTA text does not include a \"three-strikes\" rule or \"notice-and-takedown\" rules. The final ACTA text requires participants to give authorities the power to order ISPs to disclose information to identify subscribers involved in infringement. It also includes provisions on TPM, emphasizing the importance of avoiding barriers to legitimate activities and preserving fundamental principles like freedom of expression and privacy. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on trade in legitimate goods due to border enforcement provisions in the ACTA. Border enforcement provisions in the ACTA allow governments to grant customs officials ex-officio authority to seize goods suspected of infringing IPR. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection can seize goods violating copyrights and trademarks but not patents, which are enforced by the U.S. International Trade Commission. Granting customs officials this authority is seen as crucial in preventing counterfeit and pirated goods from entering the market. Some business groups argue for ex-officio authority for customs officials to combat counterfeit goods. Critics fear delays and increased trade costs. ACTA negotiations raised concerns about patents affecting generic medicines and public health. The ACTA raised concerns about patents impacting generic medicines and public health, with worries that customs authorities could hinder legitimate trade. However, the final text of the ACTA excludes patents from border enforcement, focusing instead on trademarks and copyrights. The ACTA was negotiated as a stand-alone agreement outside of existing multilateral institutions involved in international IPR protection and enforcement. This approach has sparked debate, with some advocating for its efficiency and flexibility, while others express concerns about access to medicines, particularly generic medicines. The border enforcement section of the ACTA applies to trademarks and copyrights, excluding patents. Trade negotiations in multilateral venues, such as the WTO Doha Round, have stalled in recent years. The advancement of trade negotiations in multilateral venues has stalled in recent years, with the WTO Doha Round at a standstill over country differences. WIPO members have not reached an agreement on new elements for discussion on the global patent agenda. ACTA negotiating parties claim it is an innovative agreement outside current frameworks. Critics argue negotiations were held outside existing multilateral frameworks to bypass them. Some critics argue that ACTA negotiations were held outside existing multilateral frameworks to bypass concerns of developing countries. There is speculation on whether ACTA will be incorporated into the WTO in the future, with Japanese trade officials expressing hope for it to become a model for international rules within the WTO framework. The ACTA aims to enhance IPR protection and enforcement, filling gaps in current frameworks, especially in the digital environment. Supporters believe it sends a strong message about the importance of global IPR protection. The ACTA aims to enhance global IPR protection and enforcement, addressing gaps in current frameworks, especially in the digital environment. Critics question the need for new trade agreements like ACTA, suggesting overlap with existing international treaties and questioning the effectiveness of directing more resources towards new agreements. Some critics question the effectiveness of pursuing new trade agreements like ACTA, suggesting that existing mechanisms are not being utilized effectively. They debate the impact of an executive government-to-government agreement on IPR protection and enforcement, emphasizing the need for increased legal protections. The ACTA is seen as a potential solution to address gaps in IPR enforcement globally, potentially influencing other countries to change or enforce their laws. The ACTA may prompt Canada to enforce IPR in the digital realm, raising questions for the 112th Congress about its role in the approval process and potential constitutional issues. Congress may need to consider how the ACTA could impact its actions in areas covered by the agreement. The ACTA raises questions about its impact on congressional action, national priorities, and allocation of federal funds. Key concerns include IPR infringement, commercial losses, health and safety risks, and the future of U.S. trade policy. The proposed ACTA raises questions about its implications for U.S. trade policy, future IPR protection efforts, and potential conflicts with Congress's trade objectives. It also raises concerns about whether accession to the ACTA would be required for future U.S. FTAs and how it may impact USTR determinations. Additionally, the rejection of the ACTA by the European Parliament raises doubts about its prospects for entering into force."
