The United States Weather Research Program, established under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, improving weather forecasts, quick progress in impactful areas, and collaborative scientific efforts. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, and improving weather forecasts through collaborative scientific efforts and research grants to universities and research institutions. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, and improving weather forecasts through collaborative scientific efforts and research grants to universities and research institutions. The program research priorities are outlined in Section 3. The United States Weather Research Program's research priorities include improving hurricane forecasts for landfall location and strength, enhancing forecasts for heavy precipitation events like winter storms and rain storms, improving flood forecasting by integrating precipitation forecasts with hydrologic prediction, and enhancing short to medium-range weather predictions for high-impact events. The United States Weather Research Program aims to improve weather predictions and warnings for high-impact events, fill observational gaps in the Northern Hemisphere, and test advanced data assimilation techniques in global models. Additionally, they focus on assessing societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, improving weather communications, and identifying useful weather information for decision makers. The United States Weather Research Program aims to improve weather predictions and warnings for high-impact events, assess societal and economic impacts of adverse weather, improve weather communications, and identify useful weather information for decision makers. They also test research concepts at test bed centers to enable technology transfer to operational meteorologists. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the United States Weather Research Program and collaborates with other federal agencies and entities to develop a five-year plan focusing on teaming with universities, addressing social, economic, and military weather needs, disseminating weather information, and transferring research results to forecasting operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will provide annual reports to Congress on the five-year plan, funding, changes, and achievements. Authorization of appropriations is also included. The Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized to receive appropriations for fiscal years 2004-2006, with specified amounts allocated for competitive grants to institutions of higher education. The Education Act of 1965 authorizes $16,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, with at least 50% allocated for competitive grants to institutions of higher education."
