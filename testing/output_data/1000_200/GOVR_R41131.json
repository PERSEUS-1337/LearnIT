    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Despite successive Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued to fund it until it was finally eliminated in FY2011. In FY2011, General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended development of the F136 engine, terminating the F-35 engine competition. The Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine as the winner of the JSF competition. Congress required an alternate engine for the F-35, leading to the development of the F136 engine. The F135 and F136 engines were designed to be used interchangeably without modifying the F-35 airframe. In FY2011, the alternate engine program for the F-35 was terminated by DOD after Congress rejected funding for it. The Administration's proposal to terminate the program argued that developing a second engine would significantly increase costs for the F-35 program. Developing a second engine for the F-35 would greatly increase costs, potentially reducing the number of F-35s that can be procured and forcing cuts in future capabilities. It could also raise maintenance costs and pose challenges for aircraft carriers. Despite this, having a second engine is not necessary to maintain international interest in the F-35. Having a second engine for the F-35 is not necessary to sustain international interest, as potential buyers are already committed due to the aircraft's capabilities and cost. Congress accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets, including engines, and the same risk logic should apply to F-35 engines. The F-35 no longer needs a backup engine program as fixes for test failures have been identified and implemented. Opponents argue that terminating the alternate engine program does not comply with a defense authorization act. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for the development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter to avoid reliance on a single engine type. This would allow for competition in engine procurement, reducing risks for the F-35 fleet. Having a second engine in production for the F-35 would allow for competition in procurement, reducing costs and improving performance. It would also enable quicker production surges and maintain competition in future tactical aircraft engines. The F-35 program could benefit from having a second engine in production to sustain international interest and maximize exports. The alternate engine program was terminated in 2011, with over $200 million worth of hardware located in various facilities. The alternate engine program for the F-35 was terminated in 2011, with over $200 million worth of hardware located in various facilities. General Electric and Rolls-Royce ended their self-funded development of the F136 engine. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for the F-35 program, including work on the F135 engine. The F135 SDD contract cost increased from $4.8 billion to $6.7 billion by 2009, with $0.8 billion in cost growth and $1.1 billion for expanded work scope. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce team received $2.4 billion for the F136 engine, including $1.7 billion for SDD work. The F136 contract had fewer test hours and ground test engines compared to the F135 contract. Technical issues are discussed in the \"Engine Development Issues\" section of the report. Between FY2011 and the enactment of the final FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act on April 15, 2011, the government operated under continuing resolutions. Some members of Congress questioned the status of the alternate engine program due to the Administration's opposition to further funding. CRs prohibited spending on new starts or procurement rates above FY2010 levels. P.L. 111-242 set DOD spending at a \"rate of operations\" consistent with the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act for the base budget and military construction levels. The FY2010 Omnibus set military construction levels with reductions for BRAC funding not requested in FY2011, plus war funding provided in the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act and FY2010 Supplemental. The alternate engine program was funded at the FY2010 level until March 24, 2011, when DOD issued a stop-work order. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified about the program's costs. Robert Gates testified that Congress has added $1.8 billion for the program, with an estimated additional cost of $2.9 billion over the next five years. He emphasized that having a second engine for the F135 program would provide little advantage to taxpayers, as most customers, including the Marine Corps and Navy, would only purchase one engine due to logistical constraints. The F135 engine program has been successful, completing 13,000 hours of testing out of 14,700, while the need for a second engine remains questionable. The F135 engine program for the Air Force is doing well, completing 13,000 hours of testing out of 14,700. The F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing, and there are doubts about its development. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed concerns about the benefits of investing in a second engine due to unclear future savings. The Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz testified against the need for an alternate engine for the F-35, citing advancements in engine technology and the potential impact on the number of F-35s produced. He also mentioned the reliability of single-engine aircraft like the F-22 and F-18E/F. General Schwartz expressed skepticism about funding for the alternate engine. General Schwartz and other military officials expressed skepticism about funding for the alternate engine for the F-35, questioning the need for it and suggesting that the money could be better spent on other priorities like unmanned aerial systems. The need for an alternate engine for the F-35 is questioned by military officials, who believe the money could be better spent elsewhere. Developing a second engine would require significant upfront costs for infrastructure and tooling, with uncertain returns in terms of lower prices through competition. An Office of Management and Budget document suggested that the alternative engine program may no longer be necessary as a hedge against the failure of the main Joint Strike Fighter. The Administration stated that the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter may no longer be needed as a financial hedge. The Office of Management and Budget projected over a billion dollars in near-term savings from the cancellation. GAO testified that competitive pressures could offset costs over the program's life, but continuing the alternate engine program would require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. The GAO estimated that continuing the JSF alternate engine program would require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent. They highlighted the benefits of a competitive strategy, citing the \"Great Engine War\" of the 1980s which resulted in significant cost savings and nonfinancial benefits like better performance and increased reliability. The benefits of competition in the alternate engine debate include better performance, increased reliability, and improved contractor responsiveness. Cost growth in the F135 engine has been a significant issue, with proponents of the alternate engine pointing to the need for a competitor to control costs. In July 2009, Pratt & Whitney reported a 24% cost increase in the F135 engine. Secretary Gates acknowledged cost growth in developmental aircraft but stated that it is manageable with additional budget allocation for program risk reduction. The Administration believes the benefits of a second engine do not justify the costs. In July 2009, the DOD created a Joint Assessment Team (JAT) to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure for the F135 engine. The JAT's charter included understanding production costs and developing a plan to address cost and affordability issues. Adding a second engine to the F-35 Lightning II program was found to cost the same as sticking to a single-source plan, according to a Pentagon study. Adding a second engine to the F-35 Lightning II program would cost the same as sticking to a single-source plan, according to a new Pentagon study. The estimated costs of a competitive engine acquisition strategy are projected to be approximately equivalent to a sole-source scenario, as per a Pentagon memo sent to lawmakers. Despite reduced development costs for the F136 engine, the conclusion remains that two competing F-35 engine programs do not provide a compelling business case. The Pentagon study concluded that adding a second engine to the F-35 program would cost the same as sticking to a single-source plan. Despite reduced development costs for the F136 engine, two competing F-35 engine programs do not provide a compelling business case. Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act directed three cost analyses of the F-35 engine program, with differing conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program. Non-financial benefits of an engine competition were highlighted, including fleet readiness improvements and stronger international relations. The CAIG study examined engine competition for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs, as well as the sole-source procurement of the F-22 engine. The study assumed favorable cost performance for dual sourcing and predicted a 5% price decrease with competition in 2014. The CAIG study estimated that an F-35 engine competition would need to achieve a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs in constant FY2002 dollars over the lifetime of the program to break even. On a net-present-value (NPV) basis, the study found the procurement-cost reduction required for break-even would be 25.6%. The study concluded that DOD would be unable to recoup its initial investment in the alternate engine development program through procurement savings alone. The CAIG study found that DOD would need to compete engine O&S contracts to achieve a 25.6% savings by 2040, doubting the feasibility of reaching this goal. It also highlighted the need for engine growth potential in the F-35 due to weight increases, requiring a corresponding increase in engine thrust. The CAIG study highlighted the need for engine growth potential in the F-35 due to weight increases, requiring a corresponding increase in engine thrust. The IDA study estimated that an F-35 engine competition would result in a gross savings of 11% to 18% and an alternate engine program would incur direct and indirect investment costs of $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars. The IDA study estimated that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would incur investment costs of $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars. To break even on an NPV basis, a 40% procurement-cost savings would be needed, which could decrease to 18% if engine O&S contracts were also competed. The study highlighted the lack of historical data linking procurement and O&S costs in a single competition. The primary motivation for the Great Engine War was contractor responsiveness. The Great Engine War was primarily motivated by contractor responsiveness. An alternate engine for the F-35 could mitigate the risk of fleet grounding due to engine issues. The study suggested that industry competition for engine upgrades could improve fleet readiness and generate cost savings. The GAO study indicated that a 10.3% to 12.3% procurement-cost savings would be needed for the alternate engine program to break even, with potential savings of up to 20% from past engine competitions. Michael Sullivan from GAO believed that competing the engine could recoup investment costs. The alternate engine program for the F-35 is expected to reach its break-even point by the late 2020s, according to Michael Sullivan from GAO. Despite marginal financial benefits, the program was recommended to continue for its non-financial benefits. The size of the F-35 production run will impact the potential for reaching a break-even point, with smaller production runs posing challenges. Foreign governments' decisions on F-35 procurement will also influence production run size. The size of the F-35 production run will be influenced by U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on procurement, as well as the type of engine used. These decisions can change over time due to international security and budget fluctuations, making it hard to predict the final production size. Offers were made by GE/Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney to build F136 and F135 engines at fixed or reduced prices after initial lots, respectively. The F135 price proposal for a cost-plus contract was declined by DOD, leading to a fixed-price offer by GE/Rolls-Royce for FY2012-FY2014. Pratt & Whitney and DOD agreed on a fixed-price contract for F135s for F-35s in LRIP IV, with costs 16% lower than LRIP III. An MOU signed in 2006 outlines the production, sustainment, and development of the JSF. The 2006 MOU outlines the production work for the JSF Air System, including the development of primary and alternate propulsion systems. The provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remains valid, subject to the availability of funds. The Department will continue to fulfill its obligations under the MOU. The PSFD MOU provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remains valid, with consultations ongoing regarding the exclusion of F136 from RDT&E funding requests. The JSF SDD and PSFD MOU obligations will be upheld, regardless of the U.S. FY10 authorization and appropriation process. Partner nations may reconsider the need for the second engine based on economic interests. British Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox communicated with Senator Carl Levin regarding these matters. On September 3, 2010, British Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox wrote to Senator Carl Levin in support of the F136 engine for the JSF program, expressing concerns about the long-term costs of canceling the second engine. Both F135 and F136 engines faced development challenges, with failures during ground testing attributed to high-cycle fatigue. The second engine failure was a result of ongoing testing to determine the causes of the first failure. The second engine failure in the F135 program delayed the first flight of the F-35B aircraft and contributed to a cost overrun of up to $850 million. Pratt & Whitney attributed the damage to a worn bushing that led to damage to fan blades. The F136 engine also encountered three test incidents. The F136 engine encountered three test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor, impact damage to turbine blades, and damage to fan and compressor. Pratt & Whitney confirmed that some F135 engines were replaced due to a possible misassembly issue. Pratt & Whitney confirms a misassembly issue in a ground-test engine at Arnold Engineering Development Center in Tennessee. A 'small number' of F135 test and production engines have been replaced with spares since March due to the issue. Marine Corps Brigadier General David Heinz criticized Pratt & Whitney for quality control deficiencies leading to increased F135 costs in July 2009. Pratt & Whitney responds to concerns about scrap and rework rates, stating that they are running at a 97 percent rate for the total engine. They refute claims of a 50 percent scrap rate, with only a few parts having a high scrap rate. General Electric F136 achieves 115% of required thrust in testing. Pratt & Whitney plans to test a higher-thrust F135 in January 2011. Pratt & Whitney plans to start tests of a higher-thrust F135 in January 2011. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposes terminating the alternate engine program, raising questions for Congress on whether to continue or end the program. Congressional appropriations for the program have drawn funds from various sources, including existing F-35 program funds and additional funds from within the DOD topline. The source of funds may impact other DOD programs if allocated within the existing F-35 budget lines. The allocation of funds for the alternate engine program within the existing F-35 budget lines may impact other DOD programs. This could result in curtailment of other F-35 activities or the need to transfer funds from other defense programs to F-35. Congress may need to decide whether to continue the alternate engine program, which could lead to reducing the number of F-35s procured, causing delays in the program, or reducing other defense capabilities. The DOD's Joint Assessment Team found that fielding and supporting two F-35 engines would cost about the same as one engine due to past appropriations. An additional $2.9 billion over six years is needed to develop the F136 engine for competition. The accuracy of this cost estimate is questioned by the Government Accountability Office. The figure for developing the F136 engine is not precise and could vary based on different assumptions. The upfront cost may impact the current budget, while the lifetime cost is also a factor. Supporters argue that competition could offset development costs, but studies disagree on this point. Congress must decide which assumptions to trust, with competition seen as a way to control cost growth. Congress must decide on the procurement of a second engine for the F-35, weighing the risk of fleet-grounding with a single engine type against the benefits of competition in controlling cost growth. Supporters of an alternate engine argue that having a single engine type poses a greater risk, as any issues could ground all F-35s. The F-35 is set to be the main U.S. fighter, but using a single engine type poses a risk of grounding all F-35s in case of engine problems. Past groundings of military aircraft due to engine issues highlight the importance of having an alternate engine. The DOD argues that advancements in technology reduce the need for a second engine for the F-35. The DOD argues that advancements in technology, such as computational fluid design and advanced software for prognostic health monitoring, reduce the operational risks of relying on a single engine for the F-35 aircraft. Advanced software can diagnose engine conditions and provide warnings of impending failures, allowing for timely landings and cost-effective maintenance. However, logistical issues may complicate the use of multiple engines, as the Navy has limited facilities to support them. The Navy has limited facilities to support multiple engines for the F-35 aircraft. The Air Force Chief of Staff expressed concerns about the practicality of having an alternate engine solely for the Air Force. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for one service or the entire F-35 fleet. General Electric's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engines, assuming domestically owned and sourced competition is desirable, is a potential issue for policy makers. The engine debate revolves around whether the Pentagon should pay GE up to $3 billion to compete with Pratt, as they are the only two U.S. manufacturers of fighter aircraft engines. General Electric has a significant market share for commercial aircraft engines and supports various military aircraft engines for both domestic and international clients. General Electric's strong position in the commercial engine market was noted in CAIG and IDA studies of 2007. They produce F400 series engines for Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, as well as F110 series engines for domestic and international clients. The studies highlighted that General Electric's military engine business accounts for 15% of their overall business, compared to Pratt & Whitney's 50%. The question remains on the impact of terminating the F136 program on General Electric's ability to design and produce fighter engines. About 200 General Electric military jet engineers could be affected. General Electric's ability to design and produce fighter engines could be impacted if the F136 program is terminated. Ending the program may reduce the number of suppliers for F-35 engine spare parts, increasing vulnerability to disruptions. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 engines could create uncertainty for suppliers. The potential termination of the F136 program could impact General Electric's fighter engine production. Maintaining competition between F135 and F136 engines may create uncertainty for suppliers, with concerns raised about relying solely on a firm with a weak commercial presence for fighter engine production. The IDA study of 2007 found that the termination of the F136 program would not cause suppliers to exit the domestic industrial base. Competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney in the Great Engine War improved both companies and future engine development. Congress may need to consider non-monetary industrial policy implications when choosing between one or two engines. The House passed H.R. 1540, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language barring funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine unless developed and procured competitively. The competitive procurement language aims to ensure an appropriate financial cost and benefits of competition for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 prohibits funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine without competitive development and production. Performance improvement refers to increasing airflow volume or thrust for better aircraft takeoff performance. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 prohibits funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine without competitive development and production. The asset-preservation language states the Secretary of Defense shall develop a plan for the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system, ensuring restart capability, long-term sustainment, and repair, at government or contractor facilities. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 prohibits funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine without competitive development and production. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system, ensuring restart capability, long-term sustainment, and repair at government or contractor facilities. This includes identifying costs, providing support for research and development activities, and determining any necessary contract modifications, additional facilities, or funding. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 prohibits funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine without competitive development and production. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system, ensuring restart capability, long-term sustainment, and repair at government or contractor facilities. Additionally, the Secretary must submit a report to the congressional defense committees within 45 days detailing the plan. The report also emphasizes incentivizing competition and supporting the contractor in continuing development and testing of the F136 propulsion system at no cost to the government. The committee praises the contractor for continuing development and testing of the F136 propulsion system despite the Department of Defense's attempts to cancel the program. They believe competition for the F136 is crucial for the success of the Joint Strike Fighter program, leading to better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a stronger industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The Administration objects to limiting funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine without competitive development and production. The Administration objects to limiting funds for performance improvements to the F-35's engine without competitive development and production, as it could lead to the continued development of an extra engine that adds significant costs and destabilizes the program. Section 215 would delay the main engine's development and impact the viability of the short takeoff and vertical landing variant. If the final bill includes funding for an extra engine program, a veto would be recommended. Additionally, the Administration strongly opposes section 252. The Administration strongly opposes section 252, which requires the storage and preservation of property from the terminated F136 engine program, citing unnecessary costs and logistical challenges. The Senate passed S. 1867, barring funds for the F136 engine's research and development. SEC. 211 prohibits the use of funds for research, development, test, and evaluation on the F136 engine. No expenditures on the F136 engine by the contractor can be charged to future government contracts. SEC. 223 requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan for the disposition of property related to the F136 propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract, ensuring long-term sustainment, repair, and potential future use within government programs or contractor-funded activities. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract, identifying necessary contract modifications, facilities, or funding. No funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program can be used for destroying or disposing of the property until a report is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to the congressional defense committees within 120 days detailing the plan for the F136 propulsion system. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not include funding for the F-35 alternate engine in the 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. The 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, part of H.R. 2055, did not allocate funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. The legislative history appendix covers FY1996-FY2010, focusing on final bill and report language, excluding earlier bill versions and reports recommending additional funding without discussing the program. The F-35 program was initially known as the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program in FY1996 and FY1997. The F-35 program, previously known as the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program, was authorized funds in FY1996 Defense Authorization Act. The act required a report on the program and limited the obligation of funds until the report is submitted. $7 million was allocated for competitive engine concepts. The conference report discussed these provisions in detail. The conference report on the F-35 program discussed the need for engine competition and appropriate scale of demonstrator aircraft. The Senate directed the Department to include two approaches in the program to reduce risk and evaluate at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies. The conferees directed the Under Secretary of Defense to ensure adequate engine competition and consistent scale of the proposed aircraft. The conferees directed the Department to ensure engine competition and appropriate scale of demonstrator aircraft in the JAST program. They recommended funds for competitive engine concepts and emphasized the importance of reducing risk through competitive propulsion programs. The FY1996 defense authorization bill emphasized the importance of competitive propulsion programs in the JAST program to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The House Appropriations Committee report also highlighted the challenges in developing new fighter engine propulsion plants and directed the evaluation of at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for full scale aircraft demonstrators. The history of recent fighter engine development shows challenges faced by the Navy and Air Force with engine performance and cost. The Air Force spent over a billion dollars to introduce competition between two engine manufacturers for future fighter aircraft. The new engine for the F-22 is undergoing a redesign due to technical issues. The JAST program aims to build a common aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, but has selected a single power plant design based on the F-22 engine. The JAST program aims to satisfy the needs of the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps for fighter aircraft in the next century. However, selecting a single power plant design based on the F-22 engine, which has yet to be proven, is deemed unwise. The Committee believes it is crucial for the program to actively pursue an engine design from a second manufacturer to ensure cost-effectiveness. Additional funding of $20,000,000 has been provided for this purpose. The JAST program, discussed in bills S. 1745 and H.R. 3230, emphasizes the importance of engine competition for future benefits. The DOD Appropriation Act H.R. 3610 included funding for the program, with a recommendation to accelerate development of an alternate engine for cost-effectiveness. The Navy is seeking to accelerate the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act requires a report on the production and fielding sequence of the fighter variants, including funding for the alternate engine development program. The House Armed Services Committee report on the Joint Strike Fighter Program highlighted concerns about insufficient funding for the development of an alternate fighter engine. The report directed the Secretary of Defense to provide a certification that the program has enough funding for the alternate engine development, including flight qualification. The House Armed Services Committee report on the Joint Strike Fighter Program raised concerns about funding for an alternate fighter engine. The committee directed the Secretary of Defense to provide a report detailing the funding level for the full development and flight test of the alternative engine by February 15, 1998. The Senate Armed Services Committee also emphasized the need for an alternative engine for the JSF program and recommended an increase in the budget for its development. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a $28.0 million increase in the budget request to accelerate the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), with the expectation that the Department will provide funding for the accelerated program in fiscal year 1999 and beyond. This recommendation was discussed in the FY1999 Defense Authorization Act and emphasized the need for sufficient funding to carry out the alternate engine program. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a $28.0 million increase in the budget request to accelerate the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The committee noted the timely submission and clear presentation of the Department of Defense priorities and plans, but expressed concerns about the continuous delays in demonstrating the alternate engine in a JSF airframe. If not completed in time for the short takeoff/vertical landing variant, the initiative may lose its effectiveness. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a $28.0 million increase in the budget request to accelerate the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The House Armed Services Committee also supports the development of an alternate engine to ensure sustainment of critical industrial base capabilities and control engine cost growth for the planned fleet of 3,000 JSF aircraft. The committee is concerned about the funding levels for the development of an alternative engine for the JSF aircraft. They note an increase in funding for other jet engine development efforts but prioritize the need for a new state-of-the-art engine for the JSF. The committee recommends $130.2 million in PE 27268F and $265.4 million in PE 63800F for the development of a new state-of-the-art alternative engine for the JSF aircraft. The increase in funding for the JSF program should be used solely for accelerating the alternate engine development. The committee recommends $250.4 million for the development of the joint strike fighter (JSF), including $33.0 million for the alternate engine program. An additional $15.0 million is recommended to reduce risk and accelerate development of the alternate engine. The FY2001 Defense Authorization Act discussed the JSF program and expressed concerns about additional contractor funding needed. The conferees on H.R. 4205 discussed concerns about additional contractor funding required for the JSF program, emphasizing the need for DEMVAL funding to support project execution. They expect risk mitigation projects, including the alternate engine, to be funded as per the budget request. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 4205 discussed the JSF program and supported the continuation of the JSF alternate engine program to ensure the health of the fighter aircraft engine industrial base. The House Armed Services Committee supports the JSF alternate engine program to maintain the fighter aircraft engine industrial base. The committee recommends funding to accelerate the development of the alternative engine for compatibility with the JSF airframe. The Senate Appropriations Committee report supports the JSF Alternate Engine Program (AEP) and expects no impact on the current AEP schedule. The FY2002 Defense Authorization Act conference report expresses concerns about technical risks with the JSF aircraft engine and urges integration of the alternate engine within the EMD program. The conferees are concerned about technical risks with the JSF aircraft engine and urge the Department to integrate the JSF alternate engine within the EMD program. They recommend executing the alternate engine program with the goal of integration before full rate production. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 2586 discusses the need for funds to reduce development schedule risk of the alternate engine common hardware components in the JSF program. The JSF program aims to develop aircraft for the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and allies with common components to minimize costs. The committee supports collaboration between engine manufacturers for interchangeable propulsion systems. Increased funding is recommended to reduce development schedule risks for common hardware components. Increased funding of $779.5 million in fiscal year 2002 is recommended to reduce development schedule risks for common hardware components of the JSF alternate engine. Additionally, an extra $29,750,000 is allocated for the Joint Strike Fighter Interchangeable Engine Program to maintain two competing engine programs. The FY2004 Defense Authorization Act suggests $56 million for this purpose. The Senate Armed Services Committee report recommends an additional $56 million in funding for the JSF program, specifically for the interchangeable engine development. The committee believes the interchangeable engine should be available for competitive procurement as soon as possible to avoid a two-year delay. The Department of Defense is urged to make necessary financial adjustments to maintain the original engine schedule. The Senate Appropriations Committee report expressed concern over a $56 million reduction in funding for the F136 Interchangeable Engine in the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Committee recommended restoring the funding to maintain the original engine schedule. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern over a $56 million cut to the Joint Strike Fighter program, recommending a total cut of $56 million to be taken equally from the Navy and Air Force programs, excluding the F136 engine program. The Committee also recommended restoring the FY2004 cut to the F136 Interchangeable Engine program and adding $20 million for risk reduction. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed maintaining competition for the engine for the JSF program. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 4200 and H.R. 1815 discussed the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, emphasizing the need for competition for the engine and interchangeability between engines. They directed the JSF Joint Program Office to plan for engine common hardware competition while maintaining PW F135 and GE F136 engine interchangeability. The report also mentioned the preparation of the fiscal year 2006 budget request. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 1815 discussed the JSF program, emphasizing the need for competition for the engine and interchangeability between engines. The committee believes a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF would be the most cost-effective solution. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act ensured funding for the engine program. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 5122 / P.L. 109-364) mandates the development and procurement of two interchangeable propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft by two separate contractors throughout its life cycle. Modifications to the acquisition program that deviate from this requirement are prohibited. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act mandates the development and procurement of two interchangeable propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft by two separate contractors. Modifications to the acquisition program that deviate from this requirement are prohibited, unless specific conditions are met. Independent cost analyses of the Joint Strike Fighter engine program are required to be performed by the Comptroller General, a federally funded research and development center selected by the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Defense. The Comptroller General, a federally funded research and development center chosen by the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Defense through the Cost Analysis Improvement Group are required to conduct independent cost analyses of the Joint Strike Fighter engine program. The analyses will cover various alternatives including using the F135 engine only, a firm-fixed price contract for a selected propulsion system, and competitive engine selection. The Secretary of Defense, Comptroller General, and CEO of the research center must submit reports on cost analysis for the Joint Strike Fighter engine program by March 15, 2007. Reports should include key assumptions, methodology, and comparisons of life-cycle costs for different alternatives. The reports on the Joint Strike Fighter engine program must include a comparison of life-cycle costs for different alternatives, estimates of manpower and flight hours required, and an evaluation of benefits provided by competition. Additionally, the reports should describe past acquisition strategies and experiences with cost, schedule, and performance under previous engine programs. The report on past acquisition programs for engines for tactical fighter aircraft, including the F\u201315, F\u201316, F\u201318, and F\u201322 aircraft, should include acquisition strategies, cost, schedule, and performance experiences. It should also compare sole-source programs with performance, savings, maintainability, reliability, and technical innovation. The impact of canceling the F136 competitive engine on the military engine industrial base and the Department of Defense's ability to make competitive engine choices for future combat aircraft systems should be assessed. Conclusions and recommendations should be provided in the report. The Comptroller General and the chief executive officer of the federally funded research and development center must submit a certification along with the required report, confirming if the Secretary of Defense provided sufficient information for informed judgments. The term \"lifecycle costs\" in this section includes elements for a life-cycle cost analysis for defense acquisition programs, such as engine procurement and routine engine costs. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program and the budget request for the development of the joint strike fighter (JSF), including the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The JSF alternate engine program is developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the currently-planned F135 engine. The committee expressed the need for a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF for cost and operational effectiveness. The budget request did not include funds for an alternate JSF engine beyond fiscal year 2006. The Under Secretary of Defense testified that the benefits of a second supplier are not worth the financial cost. The committee requested the Government Accountability Office to review the Department of Defense's analysis on terminating the JSF alternate engine program. The GAO found that the analysis only focused on potential savings for engine acquisition and did not fully consider savings from competition in maintenance and operations. The committee agrees with the GAO and believes the program should continue until potential costs and savings from competition are fully analyzed. The committee recommends continuing the JSF alternate engine program until potential costs and savings from competition are fully analyzed. An increase of $408.0 million is recommended for fiscal year 2007 for this program. Additionally, provisions are suggested to ensure funding for the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports the Department of Defense's modernization and transformation efforts, including authorizing funds for ship construction and promoting joint development of unmanned systems.

The committee included provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 to evaluate two propulsion concepts and allocated $400.8 million for the development of the interchangeable engine in fiscal year 2007. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended continuing the development of the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems or entering into a firm-fixed-price contract for a single propulsion system throughout the life of the aircraft. The committee allocated funds for the development of the interchangeable engine in fiscal year 2007. The firm-fixed-price contract for a selected propulsion system for the life cycle of the aircraft was established following the initial service release of the JSF F135 propulsion system in fiscal year 2008. Pratt & Whitney was the sole source provider of engines for the F\u201314, F\u201315, and F\u201316 aircraft in the 1970s and early 1980s. Congress directed the Department of Defense to develop and produce an engine to compete with Pratt & Whitney engines due to persistent engine problems. This competition led to improved performance, reduced risk, increased readiness, lower cost of ownership, improved contractor responsiveness, and over $4.0 billion in cost savings. Congress once again directed the Department to provide for an engine competition for the JSF in 1996. The Department was directed to provide an engine competition for the JSF in 1996 due to concerns about lack of competition. Congress has consistently supported a competitive engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter for the past 10 years. The committee is concerned about relying on a sole engine supplier for a single-engine aircraft, which presents operational and financial risks. Total JSF deliveries may exceed 4,000 aircraft worldwide, with significant propulsion business opportunities. The committee is concerned about the Department's incomplete analysis on the termination of the F136 engine, which only accounted for 30 percent of the engine costs over the aircraft's life cycle. They believe that a full life cycle analysis would show significant cost savings through a competitive engine strategy, offsetting the cost of completing the F136 engine development. This is crucial for Congress to have a complete understanding of the full life cycle costs. The committee recommends conducting independent life cycle cost analyses for the Joint Strike Fighter engine program to show potential cost savings through a competitive engine strategy, offsetting the F136 engine development costs. This provision aims to provide Congress with a complete understanding of the full life cycle costs. The committee recommends conducting independent life cycle cost analyses for the Joint Strike Fighter engine program to demonstrate potential cost savings through a competitive engine strategy. This provision would require certification that sufficient information was available to make informed judgments on the life cycle costs of the two propulsion systems. The Department of Defense analysis for terminating the F136 engine did not consider all costs over the aircraft's life cycle. The committee recommends increased funding for the development of competitive propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter, including the F136 interchangeable engine. This is to reduce operational risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The Secretary of Defense, along with the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force, are expected to remain committed to this development. The committee suggests an increase of $200.4 million in funding for the F136 engine. The conference report on H.R. 5631 discussed additional funding for the F-136 engine in the Joint Strike Fighter program. The conferees recommended $170 million each for the Air Force and Navy for development. They also directed a comprehensive cost analysis by the Under Secretary of Defense, potentially by the Institute for Defense Analyses. The conferees recommended additional funding for the F-136 engine in the Joint Strike Fighter program, including a comprehensive cost analysis by the Under Secretary of Defense.

The amount authorized for aircraft procurement for the Navy is increased by $282.9 million for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft. Additionally, $78 million each is allocated for management reserves in the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter programs. The Air Force's budget for research, development, test, and evaluation is increased by $78 million, allocated to the Joint Strike Fighter program for management reserves. Additionally, $438.9 million is decreased from the aircraft procurement budget for the Air Force, specifically from the HC/MC-130 recapitalization program. S.Amdt. 1627 aims to remove restrictions on obligating F-35 research and development funds. The text of S.Amdt. 1627 aims to limit the use of funds for an alternative propulsion system for the F-35, ensuring that development of the competitive propulsion system continues in FY2010. It prohibits the obligation or expenditure of FY2010 funding on an alternate engine program until certain cost-effectiveness certifications are made by the Secretary of Defense. Additionally, it eliminates additional research and development funding for the alternate engine program and restores reductions to other programs to offset the funding added for the alternate engine program. SEC. 211 of S.Amdt. 1627 limits funds for an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 program until cost-effectiveness certifications are provided by the Secretary of Defense. It also reallocates funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z aircraft and management reserves for the F-35 program. The development and procurement of an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program aims to reduce costs and improve fleet readiness without disrupting the program or reducing aircraft procurement. Additionally, funding is increased for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft and management reserves are restored for the F-35 program. The amount authorized for the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter programs is increased by $78,000,000 for management reserves. This funding is allocated to research, development, test, and evaluation. The Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter programs are increased by $78,000,000 for management reserves in the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3326). The bill also decreases funding for F136 development by $219,450,000 for both Navy and Air Force research, development, test, and evaluation. The explanatory statement released by the Appropriations Committee on December 15, 2009, explained the effects of Division A of H.R. 3326, which allocated $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement in fiscal year 2010. This included a $35 million increase over the Administration request, with additional funds designated for the F-35 alternate engine program. The explanatory statement detailed increased funding for Air Force and Navy research and development in the Joint Strike Fighter program, with additional funds allocated for the F-35 alternate engine program. Concerns were raised about the progress of the F-35 program, leading to the establishment of a Joint Estimating Team to evaluate its costs. The Department of Defense established a Joint Estimating Team (JET) to evaluate the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, reporting cost growth and schedule issues. Despite this, the Department maintains that the program is on track. $6,840,478,000 is allocated for the JSF procurement program, designated as a congressional special interest item. The Secretary of Defense is directed to ensure all 30 aircraft are procured as requested. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics is to provide the JET findings and recent test program studies. The House Appropriations Committee recommends a net increase of $18.6 million in Air Force procurement funding for the F-35 program, with reductions in non-recurring engineering costs and increases for the alternate engine. Additionally, there are proposed increases in Navy and Air Force research and development funding for the F-35 alternate engine. Administration proposals to terminate programs, including the F-35, are also mentioned. The House Appropriations Committee recommends an increase of $215 million in Air Force research and development funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The Committee supports realistic budgeting that matches available funding to overall programs and believes that terminating certain programs prematurely may not yield significant benefits. The Committee specifically mentions concerns about the proposed termination of the presidential helicopter program, stating that continuing certain efforts could result in significant payback. The Committee supports funding for the F-35 alternate engine, believing in the potential payback from certain defense activities. The F-35 program is crucial for the nation's tactical aviation future, with plans to procure over 2,500 stealthy aircraft. The Department originally planned for two engine variants but abandoned the alternate engine program due to cost growth in other areas. The Committee is concerned about the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, as all three variants of the F-35 aircraft will be powered by the same propulsion engine. This could pose logistical and operational challenges in the future, potentially grounding the entire fleet of aircraft in case of technical issues. The Committee emphasizes the need for engine competition to ensure cost savings and operational flexibility, especially with over 2,500 aircraft planned for the program. The Committee is concerned about the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, emphasizing the need for engine competition to ensure cost savings and operational flexibility for the program with over 2,500 aircraft planned. The Department's decision to not fund the alternate engine despite the sunk development costs puzzles the Committee, as a dual source strategy is deemed the most cost-effective method moving forward. The recommendation adds $560 million for the alternate engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter, emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of a dual-source engine strategy. The Secretary of Defense is directed to include funding for the alternate engine program in future budget requests. The Administration strongly opposes adding $130 million for the F-35 alternate engine, which was recommended for termination. The current engine is performing well, and funding the alternate engine diverts resources from the overall program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the alternate engine development. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act included $485 million for development of an alternate F-35 engine, with a provision limiting DOD spending on the F-35 program until all alternate engine funds are obligated. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act allocated funds for the development of an alternate F-35 engine, with a provision restricting DOD spending on the F-35 program until all alternate engine funds are obligated.

The F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs were designated as major subprograms. The Secretary of Defense designated the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs as major subprograms of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft, increasing oversight and reporting requirements. The original baseline for reporting purposes will be the Milestone B decision for each subprogram. The Secretary will use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for each subprogram. Actions following critical cost growth will be subject to restructuring the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program and reassessment of the F135 and F136 engine programs. Meeting the requirements of major subprograms designated under subsection (a) will be considered fulfilled. Actions taken in accordance with paragraph (1) shall be considered to meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, with respect to a major subprogram designated under subsection (a) only to the extent that designation as a major subprogram would require the Secretary of Defense to conduct a reassessment and take actions pursuant to such section 2433a for such a subprogram upon enactment of this Act. The requirements of such section 2433a shall not be considered to be met with respect to such a subprogram in the event that additional programmatic changes, following the date of the enactment of this Act, cause the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost of such a subprogram to increase by a percentage equal to or greater than the critical cost growth threshold for the subprogram. The report accompanying H.R. 5136 includes language on the F-35 alternate engine program, with a budget request for development and procurement of F-35 aircraft. The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, noting that funds have been appropriated by Congress for this purpose. However, the Department of Defense has chosen not to comply with the law requiring the development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 for the fifth consecutive year. The committee report highlighted cost increases in the F135 development program and procurement of F135 engines. The Government Accountability Office noted a 50% increase in F135 engine development costs, with negotiated prices for F-35 engines exceeding budget estimates. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics addressed these cost increases in fiscal year 2009. The F135 engine cost was 42 percent higher than budgeted, leading to a review by the Joint Assessment Team (JAT) which found credible improvement plans but requiring additional investment for cost reduction initiatives. A $2.9 billion investment over six years was deemed necessary for the F136 engine development to prepare for competitive procurement of F-35 engines in 2017. The committee recommends a competitive F-35 engine acquisition strategy due to long-term cost considerations and non-financial benefits like better engine performance and increased reliability. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program in the F-35 program due to improved operational readiness and increased engine reliability. Despite previous failures to meet cost and schedule expectations, additional reviews were conducted to assess the program's development and production. The JET 2 and IMRT reviewed the F-35 development program, with JET 2 predicting a 30-month delay and $3.0 billion cost increase. The IMRT found high production risk and proposed adjustments to reduce risk, including procuring additional aircraft, setting up a simulation facility, and adjusting production profiles. These actions are expected to delay completion by 13 months compared to last year. The F-35 development program is facing delays and increased costs, with projections indicating a 13-month delay and $2.8 billion more in expenses compared to the previous year's plan. The program is expected to exceed unit cost thresholds by more than 50 percent, with concerns raised about the unprecedented concurrency of development, test, and production activities. The Office of the Secretary of Defense's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation highlighted issues with the Joint Strike Fighter program, including late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic system development and test plans. The Department of Defense plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015, with a total request of 550 aircraft by spring 2015. The committee is concerned about the Department's procurement plans for the F-35 aircraft, with 550 requested before completing developmental testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. Despite findings of risks and required design changes, the request for 43 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 remains unchanged since fiscal year 2009. The committee worries about potential costly retrofitting of already produced aircraft. The committee recommends authorization of the budget request for 42 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, subject to completion of certain milestones by the Department. Certification is required before procurement of more than 30 aircraft can proceed. The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $485 million for the extra engine program for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, with associated provisions limiting overall JSF development funding until funds for FY 2011 are obligated for the extra engine program. Secretary Gates has noted that even with additional funding from Congress, the extra engine would still require further funding. The Department does not believe the $2.4 billion investment in an extra engine for the JSF program will ever be recovered or should be diverted from defense needs. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If funding for an extra engine program is included in the final bill, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto. A certification requirement is needed before further funding for the alternate engine can be expended. The committee recommends a provision that would require the Secretary of Defense to certify that the development of the alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program will reduce costs, improve fleet readiness, and not disrupt the program or result in fewer aircraft procurement. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram. The Secretary of Defense must designate an engine development and procurement program as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. The Milestone B decision will serve as the original baseline for reporting requirements. Subsequent restructuring of the program will follow reassessment and actions required by specific sections of the United States Code. The Secretary of Defense must designate an engine development and procurement program as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft within 30 days. Actions taken in accordance with this designation will meet the requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine, added by a vote of 11-5 in the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee markup. The program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost of a subprogram should not increase by a percentage equal to or greater than the critical cost growth threshold after the enactment of this Act. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine, approved by a vote of 11-5. The House and Senate passed a continuing resolution maintaining spending at FY2010 levels, funding the alternate engine program until March 24, 2011, when DOD issued a stop-work order. The Senate version of the Act did not include funds for the alternate engine program, but the committee's report commented favorably on it. The House approved an amendment to eliminate $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine program in FY2011. The FY2011 DOD Appropriations Act provided funding for the remainder of the year with no funds allocated for the alternate engine program. Congress's interest in the F-35 alternate engine program may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994. In 1994, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric entered a partnership to produce and maintain engines for Air Force F-16 fighters. The Air Force sought an alternate engine due to frustrations with Pratt & Whitney's management in the 1970s. Congress funded General Electric's development of the F110 engine as an alternative to the F100 for the F-16. Over $376 million was spent on the F110's development to compete with the F100. The development of the F101 engine (later the F110) as an alternate engine for the F-16 was funded by the DOD with over $376 million. Annual competitions for engine procurement were controversial but believed to result in better engines and contract terms. Contractor responsiveness was seen as the primary benefit of the competition. The Great Engine War between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for annual production and O&S work benefited the DOD with better contract terms, warranties, and engine improvements. The competition was managed by requiring cost projections for six years before the first contract award. The DOD benefited from the Great Engine War between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney by securing better contract terms, warranties, and engine improvements. Contractors were required to provide cost projections for six years before the first contract award, a practice that was unprecedented at the time. Additionally, contractors were mandated to provide plans for dual sourcing critical parts to prevent disruptions in production and protect against price gouging. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team has decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the JSF Program schedules. The decision was made jointly by GE and Rolls-Royce leadership, with the development almost 80 percent complete before the U.S. Department of Defense terminated the program. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team has decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. The program was terminated by the U.S. Department of Defense despite being almost 80 percent complete. The FET had offered to continue funding until 2012 but will now end its development work. The F136 program had achieved significant testing milestones and received high marks for cost and schedule performance. GE and Rolls-Royce were highly praised by the DoD for their successful joint venture on the F136 program, delivering on cost and schedule. They advocated for defense acquisition reform and emphasized the importance of competition in the JSF program."
