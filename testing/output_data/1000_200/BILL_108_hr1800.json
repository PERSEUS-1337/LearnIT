    "content": "The United States aims to end animal suffering caused by steel-jawed leghold traps by prohibiting their import, export, and interstate shipment, along with fur from animals trapped in such traps. Penalties are in place for violating these prohibitions. It is illegal to import, export, or transport fur or steel-jawed leghold traps in interstate commerce if derived from trapped animals. Penalties are imposed for violations. Penalties for knowingly violating the prohibition on importing, exporting, or transporting fur or steel-jawed leghold traps include imprisonment for up to 5 days or a fine under title 18, United States Code, for the first offense, and imprisonment for up to two years or a fine for subsequent violations. SEC. 3. REWARDS. The Secretary will pay half of the fine to individuals providing information leading to a conviction under this Act. Exceptions apply to government officials. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. The Secretary enforces this Act and its rules, utilizing personnel and facilities from other agencies. Import violations are treated as customs law violations, while export violations are enforced using the Export Administration Act of 1979. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is used to enforce provisions related to the export of articles in violation of the Act. Enforcement authorities can detain, search, and seize packages suspected of containing violating articles without a warrant. Enforcement authorities can make arrests without a warrant for violations of the Export Administration Act of 1979 committed in their presence or with probable cause. They can also execute warrants issued by a judge for enforcement purposes. Forfeiture of fur articles or steel-jawed leghold traps in violation of the Act results in seizure and forfeiture to the United States, following procedures similar to customs law violations. The forfeiture of property for violations of the customs laws of the United States, including disposition, remission, mitigation, and compromise of claims, applies to seizures and forfeitures under this subsection. Enforcement duties may be carried out by the Secretary or authorized officers and employees. States may be performed with respect to seizures and forfeitures of property under this subsection by the Secretary or authorized officers and employees. The Attorney General may seek injunctions against violators of the Act. Cooperation among relevant departments is required for effective enforcement. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"article of fur\" refers to furskins or articles made from furskins. The term \"conventional steel-jawed leghold trap\" describes a device designed to capture animals by snapping closed on their limb. The term \"customs laws of the United States\" refers to any law or regulation enforced by customs authorities.
