    "content": "The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 reformed patent and drug laws to balance innovation and competition in the pharmaceutical industry. Congressional focus has shifted to the settlement of pharmaceutical patent litigation, where brand-name companies must litigate to enforce their patents against generic competitors. Brand-name drug companies must litigate in federal courts to enforce their patents against generic competitors, leading to judgments of infringement or invalidity. Settlements may involve cash payments from the brand-name company to the generic firm in exchange for not challenging the patents or selling generic versions of the drug. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation have been termed as \"exclusion\" or \"exit\" payments, or \"pay-for-delay\" agreements. Views on these settlements vary, with some attributing them to specialized patent litigation procedures while others see them as anti-competitive. Congress has mandated notification of such settlements to antitrust authorities since 2003, but has not set substantive standards for assessing their validity under antitrust laws. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. on June 17, 2013, established that reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach. This ruling clarified the legality of such agreements, which had previously led to conflicting decisions in lower courts. Going forward, lower courts will need to apply the rule of reason to assess the validity of reverse payment settlements. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. established that reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach. Legislation before the 113th Congress also addresses reverse payment settlements, with the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act creating a rebuttable presumption of illegality and the FAIR Generics Act introducing reforms to reduce incentives for settlements. This report analyzes innovation and competition policy issues related to pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements, including the concept of reverse payment settlements. The report discusses pharmaceutical patent litigation procedures under the Hatch-Waxman Act, including reverse payment settlements and their status under antitrust laws. It also covers the process of submitting patent applications to the USPTO and the criteria for obtaining a patent. When submitting a patent application to the USPTO, the examiner will assess if the invention meets patentability criteria such as novelty and nonobviousness. Novelty requires the invention to not be fully anticipated by prior knowledge, known as \"prior art.\" Nonobviousness means the invention must not have been obvious to a skilled artisan based on prior teachings. If granted, the patent owner gains exclusive rights to the invention. The grant of a patent allows the owner to exclude others from using the invention for twenty years. This exclusivity period enables inventors to profit from their discovery by charging higher prices. Patent owners must monitor competitors to prevent unauthorized use of their invention. A patent owner must monitor competitors to prevent unauthorized use of their invention and may need to litigate in federal district courts. While a patent grants exclusivity for twenty years, it does not allow distribution of the product without FDA approval, which requires demonstrating safety and effectiveness through preclinical and clinical investigations. The FDA evaluates test data in a New Drug Application before issuing marketing approval. Prior to the Hatch-Waxman Act, generic drug manufacturers had to file their own New Drug Application (NDA) to sell their products, sometimes needing additional studies for safety and efficacy. The FDA sometimes required additional studies for generic drugs, leading to costly and time-consuming processes. The Hatch-Waxman Act aimed to streamline approval for generic drugs by creating a compromise between brand-name and generic pharmaceutical companies. The Hatch-Waxman Act created an expedited pathway for generic drug approval through Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs), allowing generic manufacturers to market bioequivalent drugs without extensive clinical data. This balanced the interests of brand-name and generic firms, also providing patent proprietors with a means for restoration. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows generic drug approval through Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) to market bioequivalent drugs. Patent proprietors can restore lost patent term with a maximum extension of five years, compensating brand-name firms for pre-clinical and clinical data expenses. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes in generic drug marketing. NDA applicants must file a list of patents they believe would be infringed by generic drugs. These patents are listed in the \"Orange Book\" by the FDA. Generic drug manufacturers must go through a certification process regarding Orange Book-listed patents before marketing their products. This process involves stating views on each patent, including whether it has expired, the generic company agrees not to market until expiration, or if the patent is invalid. Certifications are categorized as paragraph I, II, III, or IV. An ANDA certified under paragraphs I or II is approved immediately. The Hatch-Waxman Act requires generic drug manufacturers to go through a certification process regarding Orange Book-listed patents before marketing their products. Certifications are categorized as paragraph I, II, III, or IV. An ANDA certified under paragraphs I or II is approved immediately, while a paragraph III certification requires waiting for the brand-name drug's patent to expire. A paragraph IV certification constitutes an act of patent infringement, requiring the generic applicant to notify the patent owner and potentially face litigation. The Act aims to encourage challenges of pharmaceutical patents. The Hatch-Waxman Act incentivizes challenges to pharmaceutical patents by granting a 180-day exclusivity period to the first generic applicant filing a paragraph IV certification. This provision aims to stimulate patent challenges and potentially lead to higher profits for the first applicant. Amendments made in 2003 may impact the entitlement to this exclusivity period. Following 2003 amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act, a first paragraph IV ANDA applicant may lose its entitlement to the 180-day generic exclusivity period due to forfeiture events outlined in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA). These events include failure to promptly market the product, obtain FDA approval in a timely manner, or expiration of all certified patents. The purpose of these forfeiture events is to prevent the practice of delaying market entry and encourage prompt generic drug marketing. Following the Hatch-Waxman Act amendments in 2003, a generic firm's filing of a paragraph IV ANDA may lead to a patent infringement suit by a brand-name drug company. If the NDA holder proves patent violation, an injunction may prevent the generic company from marketing the product until the NDA holder's patents expire. The generic firm may amend their ANDAs to replace paragraph IV certifications with paragraph III certifications. Alternatively, the court may rule in favor of the generic firm if the proposed product does not infringe patents or if the patents are deemed invalid or unenforceable. The generic firm may launch its product once the FDA approves its ANDA, following a final judgment in favor of either the brand-name drug company or generic firm. Pharmaceutical patent litigation can also be resolved through settlements, where the generic firm agrees not to challenge the patent or produce a generic version of the drug in exchange for compensation from the NDA holder. Reverse payment settlements involve the NDA holder compensating the ANDA applicant to not challenge the patent or produce a generic version of the drug. Opinions on the impact of these settlements on social welfare vary, with some seeing them as anticompetitive and others viewing them as promoting settlement. Reverse payment settlements involve compensating parties to avoid litigation expenses, achieve timely resolution, and preserve judicial resources. Settlements between rational actors involve an exchange of benefits and obligations, as explained by Judge Richard Posner. Certain reverse payment settlements have implications for patent settlements. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation may involve dividing the remaining patent term between brand-name and generic firms, allowing for early generic competition. These agreements could benefit consumers compared to a judgment upholding the patent. The Hatch-Waxman Act's dispute settlement procedures may also encourage the use of reverse payment settlements. In pharmaceutical patent litigation, the accused infringer may compensate the patent proprietor to avoid injunction and damages. The Hatch-Waxman Act alters the balance of risks, allowing generic manufacturers to challenge validity without risking commercial sales. The unique procedures of the Hatch-Waxman Act have led to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. Congressional action on these settlements has been limited, with the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act mandating the DOJ and FTC to receive copies of certain patent settlement agreements. The 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act requires the DOJ and FTC to receive copies of certain patent settlement agreements in the pharmaceutical field. The filing requirement applies to agreements executed on or after January 7, 2004, between an ANDA applicant and either the NDA holder or an owner of an Orange Book-listed patent. Agreements trigger the notification requirement if they relate to the manufacture, marketing, or sale of the brand-name drug, the generic drug for which the ANDA was submitted, or the 180-day generic exclusivity period. Certain agreements are exempt from this filing requirement. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act mandates the submission of certain patent settlement agreements to the DOJ and FTC. Exempt from this requirement are agreements solely involving raw materials, equipment contracts, employment or consulting contracts, and packaging contracts. The FTC received 140 final resolutions of patent disputes in FY2012, with 40 settlements potentially involving pay-for-delay payments. The legislation did not establish substantive standards for the validity of these agreements. The report discusses how courts have addressed reverse payment settlements in antitrust cases, applying general principles of antitrust law to varying results. The primary legal mechanism for addressing anti-competitive conduct like reverse payment settlements is through the antitrust laws, which include the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act. The antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act, prohibit anticompetitive economic conduct. Section 1 of the Sherman Act declares certain contracts or conspiracies in restraint of trade to be illegal, interpreted under the \"rule of reason\" to determine unreasonable restraints of trade. The rule of reason in antitrust law involves balancing anticompetitive consequences against business justifications. Some restraints are deemed unlawful per se, based on past experience predicting condemnation without detailed inquiry. The per se illegality standard in antitrust law presumes certain practices to be illegal without detailed inquiry, such as price fixing and group boycotts. Courts may also apply a \"quick look\" approach between per se illegality and the rule of reason, requiring defendants to justify anticompetitive practices. Antitrust approaches to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation vary among courts. The courts have differed in their antitrust approaches to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. The Sixth Circuit opinion in In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation held that a reverse payment settlement agreement between Hoescht Marion Roussel Inc. and Andrx Pharmaceuticals was per se invalid due to being classified as a horizontal agreement, a restraint of trade involving businesses at the same level of competition. The Court of Appeals explained that reverse payment settlements were not always classified as antitrust violations per se. In the case of Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, agreements between Abbott Laboratories and generic firms were initially deemed illegal, but the Eleventh Circuit later reversed this decision, stating that per se illegality was premature. The matter was remanded for further evaluation. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision on reverse payment settlements, deeming the standard of per se illegality premature. They remanded the matter for a determination of whether the agreement exceeded patent protections, allowing such settlements as long as they stay within the patent scope and are not based on fraudulent claims. The Third Circuit rejected the scope of the patent test, stating it improperly restricts antitrust law application. The Third Circuit in K-Dur Antitrust Litigation rejected the scope of the patent test, stating it restricts antitrust law application and goes against the policies of the Hatch-Waxman Act. The court emphasized that the presumption of validity for patents is procedural, not a substantive right, and should not prevent the invalidation of improvidently granted patents through litigation. The Third Circuit rejected the scope of the patent test in K-Dur Antitrust Litigation, stating it hindered antitrust law application and conflicted with the Hatch-Waxman Act. The court adopted a \"quick rule of reason\" test for reverse payment settlements, allowing for antitrust review. The Supreme Court in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. held that the legality of such settlements should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach. In Solvay Pharmaceuticals v. Actavis and Paddock Laboratories, the parties settled a patent infringement case regarding the drug ANDROGEL\u00ae. The generic firms received money to delay launching their products, leading to FTC charges of unlawfully sharing in monopoly profits and abandoning patent challenges. The FTC accused Solvay and generic firms of unlawfully sharing monopoly profits and delaying generic products to compete with AndroGel. The Eleventh Circuit initially rejected the claims, citing the \"scope of the patent\" standard. However, the Supreme Court later reversed the decision, ruling that the agreement fell within the scope of the patent. Justice Breyer, writing for the majority, ruled that while the agreement between Solvay and generic firms fell within the scope of its patent, this did not exempt it from antitrust scrutiny. The Supreme Court emphasized that in cases involving the Hatch-Waxman Act, where patent validity or infringement is challenged, agreements may have significant negative effects on competition. Therefore, antitrust legality should not be determined solely based on patent law policy. The Supreme Court reasoned that antitrust legality should not be determined solely based on patent law policy. Instead, it should be measured against procompetitive antitrust policies as well. Traditional antitrust factors such as likely anticompetitive effects, redeeming virtues, market power, and potentially offsetting legal considerations should be considered. The Court also highlighted the importance of the structure of the Hatch-Waxman Act in such cases. The Supreme Court emphasized that antitrust legality should not be based solely on patent law policy but should also consider procompetitive antitrust policies. Justice Breyer outlined five considerations supporting the scrutiny of reverse payment settlements for anticompetitive effects, market power, and lack of justification. The Supreme Court emphasized that antitrust legality should consider procompetitive antitrust policies. Justice Breyer outlined considerations supporting scrutiny of reverse payment settlements for anticompetitive effects, market power, and lack of justification. The court may assess anticompetitive effects and justifications of patent settlements without litigating patent validity. Settlements should not receive near-automatic antitrust immunity, and reverse payment settlements should not be presumptively unlawful. The Supreme Court emphasized that antitrust legality should consider procompetitive antitrust policies. Justice Breyer outlined considerations supporting scrutiny of reverse payment settlements for anticompetitive effects, market power, and lack of justification. The Court concluded that the FTC must establish antitrust liability using the traditional rule of reason analysis, rather than relying on a presumption of illegality for reverse payment settlements. Chief Justice Roberts contributed a dissent, arguing that a reverse payment settlement violates antitrust law only when it exceeds the scope of the patent, the patents were obtained by fraud, or the patentee engages in sham. The dissent in the Actavis case argued that reverse payment settlements should only be considered antitrust violations if they go beyond the scope of the patent, involve fraud, or sham litigation. They were concerned that the majority's decision could deter generic firms from challenging patents and weaken patent protection for innovators. The Supreme Court's ruling does not prevent pharmaceutical firms from settling under the Hatch-Waxman Act, but parties must carefully structure and explain their agreements. Those unwilling to do so may have to litigate their cases. Lower courts now face the challenge of applying the rule of reason in Hatch-Waxman cases. Justice Breyer supported scrutiny of reverse payment settlements for anticompetitive effects and lack of justification. The lower courts are tasked with interpreting the rule of reason in Hatch-Waxman cases, which may involve complex issues of patent validity and infringement. Congress has options to consider, such as waiting for further judicial developments or regulating pharmaceutical patent settlements. The Actavis decision addressed reverse payment settlements, but how lower courts will apply this remains to be seen. The lower courts are refining case law on reverse payment settlements. Two bills in Congress address this issue, including the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, which aims to regulate such settlements by presuming them anticompetitive unless proven otherwise. The Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act, S. 504, aims to discourage reverse payment settlements by granting generic firms rights to regulatory exclusivity and obligating them to abide by settlement terms with brand-name firms. Brand-name firms would also be required to make enforcement decisions. The Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act, S. 504, aims to discourage reverse payment settlements by granting generic firms rights to regulatory exclusivity and obligating them to abide by settlement terms with brand-name firms. Brand-name firms would also be required to make enforcement decisions within 45 days of being notified of a patent challenge by a generic firm under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements are crucial for public health as they balance the development of new medicines by brand-name companies and increased access through generic firms. Settlements that comply with antitrust principles can promote medical innovation and benefit consumers by distributing the results of such innovation."
