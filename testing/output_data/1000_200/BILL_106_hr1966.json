The Congress finds that asthma affects millions of Americans, with a significant impact on children. Allergies, including allergic asthma, also affect a large portion of the population. Asthma is a common respiratory disease in children, leading to school absenteeism and preventable hospitalizations. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly, especially among preschool children. Women and low-income families are more likely to be affected by asthma. The prevalence of asthma is higher in low-income families, with 79.2 out of 1,000 individuals under 45 in families earning less than $10,000 annually having asthma. In 1997, over 5,000 Americans died from asthma attacks, with African Americans having a higher average death rate than Caucasians. Asthma costs the US over $12 billion annually, and the rising prevalence will lead to even higher costs in the future. African Americans are five times more likely to have asthma compared to other groups. Exercise can improve the well-being of children, including self-esteem, and help manage asthma. African Americans have higher asthma death rates and are more likely to seek emergency care. Asthma costs the US $12 billion annually, with rising prevalence leading to even higher costs in the future. SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR PROJECTS FOR ASTHMA-RELATED ACTIVITIES FOR LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES.
