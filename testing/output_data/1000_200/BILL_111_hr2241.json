    "content": "The Act titled \"Equitable Compensation for American Victims of Torture Act of 2009\" aims to provide justice for victims of torture and terrorism. The Congress finds that during the Gulf War in 1991, Americans serving in the Armed Forces were captured, tortured, and subjected to horrendous acts by Saddam Hussein's regime, along with CBS News reporter Bob Simon and cameraman Roberto Alvarez. Many US citizens detained by Iraq were also mistreated and used as \"human shields.\" During the Gulf War in 1991, American POWs and civilian hostages were subjected to brutal torture and used as \"human shields\" by Iraq, classified as a state sponsor of terrorism. The victims suffered long-term physical, emotional, and mental damage. Upon their return, they were welcomed as heroes by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Congress passed resolutions condemning the treatment during the war. During the 1991 Gulf War, Congress passed resolutions condemning Iraq's brutal treatment of American POWs and demanding adherence to the Geneva Convention. In 1996, an amendment allowed torture victims to seek compensation from terrorist countries like Iraq. In 2002, 17 Gulf War POWs and their families filed claims in court. On April 4, 2002, 17 Gulf War POWs and their families filed claims in the United States District Court seeking compensation for damages related to their torture and abuse by the Government of Iraq. The POWs included Colonel Clifford Acree, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Berryman, Former Staff Sergeant Troy Dunlap, Colonel David Eberly, Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey D. Fox, Chief Warrant Officer 5 Guy Hunter, Sergeant David Lockett, Colonel H. Michael Roberts, Colonel Russell Sanborn, Captain Lawrence Randolph Slade, Major Joseph Small, Staff Sergeant Daniel Stamaris, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Dale Storr, and Lieutenant Colonel Robert Sweet. In 2003, a judge awarded 17 Gulf War POWs a judgment for damages after they were repeatedly tortured by the Government of Iraq. Despite the ruling, the POWs and their families have not received payment and are unable to pursue their claims in US courts due to a waiver granted for Iraq by the President. In December 2001, the United States district court held Iraq liable for taking US citizens hostage after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The court awarded damages to 180 former hostages and their spouses. On March 20, 2003, the President directed payment of the judgments from blocked Iraqi accounts. The President ordered the confiscation of all remaining blocked assets of Iraq to be used for Iraq reconstruction. Over 200 US citizens held hostage by Iraq are seeking compensation in a pending court case. They are unable to enforce any judgment due to a waiver granted to Iraq by the President. The President granted a waiver to Iraq under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The United States is prohibited from absolving Iraq of liability for torture of prisoners of war under the Third Geneva Convention. The US has a moral obligation to protect its citizens from torture and hostage-taking. Congress is committed to holding state sponsors of terrorism accountable. The President granted a waiver to Iraq under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. Unless certain claims are settled within 30 days, the waiver authority will terminate. The cases involved are specified. The President granted a waiver to Iraq under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, with specified cases that need to be settled within 30 days. Adequate settlement in the cases involves payment by the Government of Iraq or a US depository institution to individuals with claims related to hostage taking. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 grants a waiver to Iraq for specified cases related to hostage taking. Individuals with claims related to hostage taking may receive up to $150,000, plus $6,000 for each day held as a hostage, not exceeding $900,000. This applies to those who were subjected to torture while being held hostage and have not obtained a judgment on the claim before the enactment of the Act. The Act grants compensation to individuals who were held hostage in Iraq, with amounts up to $2,500,000 plus $6,000 per day. Spouses or children of qualifying individuals may receive one-third of the compensation. Those who obtained compensatory damages before the Act's enactment may also be eligible for payment. Compensatory damages in a case involving hostages include payment of the unsatisfied judgment amount, capped at $1,000,000 or the award amount, and one-third of any excess over $1,000,000. Definitions include \"hostage\" as an individual in hostage status or seized during hostage taking, and \"hostage status\" as being in a hostage situation. The term \"hostage status\" refers to the definition in a specific law, while \"hostage taking\" is defined in another law. \"Person\" includes the legal representative of a claimant's estate, and \"torture\" is defined in the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991. The term \"United States\" is also defined. The Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 defines terms such as \"United States\" and \"United States depository institution.\" Additionally, Section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 is mentioned. Section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 and Section 1083(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 were not intended to remove jurisdiction over cases brought under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 provision applies to cases under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code, despite any waiver for Iraq."
