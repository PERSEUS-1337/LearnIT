    "content": "Title VI of the Higher Education Act authorizes grants to institutions for enhancing foreign language and area studies. The program has a long history of supporting courses in less commonly taught languages and regions, reflecting federal government's priority on diplomacy and national security. The federal government prioritizes Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) programs for diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. Interest in FLAS has grown due to concerns about terrorism from regions not commonly included in American curricula. Title VI programs may be up for reauthorization by Congress, with appropriations remaining at $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008. This report provides an overview of Title VI programs and reauthorization issues. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized Title VI programs at \"such sums as necessary\" through December 31, 2005. The statutory authorities in the Higher Education Act expired at the end of FY2004 but have been recently extended and currently remain effective. The U.S. Department of Education has discretion in allocating funds among specific activities under Title VI, with constraints including separate authorization levels for Parts A, B, and C. Grants are typically made on a multi-year basis with obligations for future years. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized Title VI programs through December 31, 2005. The last specific authorization was for FY1999, with funds allocated for Part A, Part B, and Part C. Approximately three-fifths of the funds are used for National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. NLAC grant recipients also receive grants for FLAS Fellowships. The Title VI programs, authorized through 2005, allocate funds for National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. These programs emphasize excellence in selection and equitable distribution of grants. The Title VI programs allocate funds for National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships, emphasizing excellence in selection and equitable distribution of grants. Increased funding for Title VI included provisions specifying activities and languages for specialization, with earmarks in appropriations acts. The appropriations legislation for FY2004, P.L. 108-199 and P.L. 108-401, specified world regions and languages for Title VI funds. The guidance aimed to sustain investments in training experts with foreign language proficiency in strategic areas like Central and South Asia, the Middle East, and Russia. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) had no constraints on language emphasis. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) contains no constraints on language emphasis or fund distribution. One percent of the total appropriation is earmarked for program evaluation and $1,500,000 for an independent review of Title VI programs. Funds under the International Research and Studies program can be used for assessing the effects of HEA Title VI programs. The National Foreign Language Center at the University of Maryland is a significant source of evaluations for these programs. The EELIAS project funded by the ED aims to evaluate HEA Title VI programs, develop performance indicators, and assess the need for advanced foreign language and international studies. The EELIAS project funded by the ED aims to evaluate HEA Title VI programs, develop performance indicators, and assess the need for advanced foreign language and international studies. The project will incorporate internal and external evaluations of each program over a five-year period. A 2000 report evaluated the impact of the foreign language components of HEA Title VI and the Fulbright-Hays program, highlighting the critical importance of supporting less commonly taught languages. The authors of a report funded by the ED emphasize the critical importance of HEA Title VI support in maintaining the nation's capacity in less commonly taught languages with strategic importance for the US. IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll a significant percentage of graduate students in these languages. The Higher Education Act may be up for reauthorization during the 110th Congress, with potential debates on related issues. There is a growing interaction between American society and cultures worldwide, leading to national security concerns. It is crucial for the nation to provide education and support for individuals to acquire advanced knowledge of languages and cultures of nations of concern. Ongoing support for instruction in all nations is necessary due to the unpredictable nature of future concerns. Given the growing interaction between American society and cultures worldwide, there is a need for ongoing support for instruction in all major languages and cultures. The question arises whether federal support should focus on colleges, universities, or federally-operated institutions dedicated to providing language instruction. The federal government operates two language schools, the Defense Language Institute in California and the Foreign Service Institute School in Virginia, to meet immediate language needs. Title VI grants to institutions depart from the usual student aid approach, focusing on specific subject areas rather than financial need. Title VI of HEA provides institutional aid for specific subject areas like foreign languages and regions, emphasizing their importance for national security and economic competitiveness. This departure from general HEA strategy is justified by the critical need to maintain research and instructional programs in these areas. Maintaining research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies is a national priority that should be supported in both federally-operated institutions and colleges accessible to the public. Skills in foreign languages and cultures are essential for national defense, diplomacy, international trade, and increasing understanding of foreign nations. Research and improving language instruction are more likely to occur in colleges and universities than in federal institutions dedicated to language instruction. The quality of FLAS programs relies on these institutions. The quality of FLAS programs in foreign language instruction depends on linkages between American and foreign educational institutions, which are easier to establish in colleges and universities than in federal institutions. Other federal agencies also support specific subject areas in higher education on a larger scale than HEA Title VI, such as health care education and training by the National Institutes of Health. The federal government supports specific subject areas in higher education on a larger scale than HEA Title VI, such as health care education and training by the National Institutes of Health. These subject areas are considered of special national interest and worthy of targeted federal support. If federal aid is necessary, it could be limited to covering start-up costs for foreign language and area studies programs. Federal support for foreign language and area studies under Title VI may be limited to start-up costs for programs, not ongoing maintenance. Efforts could be made to utilize language skills of recent immigrants. Colleges, universities, and foundations provide support for FLAS programs. Matching grants from IHEs, foundations, and corporations are common. Offering instruction in rare languages like Pashto or Farsi is challenging for individual IHEs. Proponents argue for the importance of Title VI funding. Title VI funding is crucial for supporting instruction in rare languages like Pashto or Farsi, as individual institutions may not have the incentive to fund such programs. Without federal aid, ongoing support for these languages may be insufficient to meet national needs. The report focuses on the reauthorization of Title VI, which is the largest source of federal support for foreign language and area studies in U.S. colleges and universities. Title VI is the largest federal support for foreign language and area studies in U.S. colleges and universities. There are questions about its coordination with other programs and the possibility of consolidation for efficiency. The goal of Title VI is to coordinate federal programs in foreign language, area studies, and international studies. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities for graduate students and scholars in various fields, administered by the Department of State. These exchanges are not limited to foreign language and area studies, involving professionals as well. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities for graduate students and scholars in various fields, including professionals. The programs administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education support foreign travel-related activities for American graduate students and professors to improve FLAS instruction in American colleges and universities. These activities are only available to U.S. citizens and are smaller in scale compared to HEA Title VI, with a total appropriation level of $12.9 million for FY2003. The NSEP, under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act, provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American undergraduate and graduate students. It includes scholarships for undergraduate students, grants for institutions to establish programs in critical foreign language areas, and fellowships for graduate students in critical foreign language disciplines. The NSEA aims to allocate one-third of annual grant funding to each of these activities, with an initial trust fund of $150 million provided in FY1992. The NSEP provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American students through scholarships, grants for institutions, and fellowships. Recipients are required to seek employment in national security or higher education related to their field of study. Institutional grants focus on establishing programs in less commonly taught languages, increasing minority participation in international programs, and integrating foreign languages into education. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American students through scholarships, grants for institutions, and fellowships. The program focuses on establishing programs in less commonly taught languages, increasing minority participation in international programs, and integrating foreign languages into education. A revised strategy for institutional grants includes a Flagship Language Initiative to support advanced study of critical foreign languages. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) supports international education and foreign language studies for American students through scholarships, grants, and fellowships. NSEP has unique elements such as a service requirement and travel grants for undergraduate students. Administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University, NSEP determines critical nations, disciplines, and subject areas for national security. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is administered by non-governmental organizations like the Institute of International Education (IIE) and the Academy for Educational Development (AED). In FY1995, the program faced potential elimination by the House of Representatives but was ultimately reduced to a $75 million trust fund under a compromise with the Senate (P.L. 104-6). The National Security Education Program (NSEP) trust fund was cut in half to $75 million under a compromise with the Senate (P.L. 104-6). The program is focused on meeting national security-related skill needs, financed through a trust fund, and supports international travel for undergraduate students. Administered by the Department of Defense (DOD), NSEP is smaller in scale compared to HEA Title VI. The program is authorized by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000, with an annual appropriation of $1.5 million for scholarships up to $5,000 for U.S. students. The International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000 authorizes scholarships of up to $5,000 for U.S. citizen undergraduate students, funded by an annual appropriation of $1.5 million. Recipients must be Pell Grant recipients from low-income families, with preference given to first-time study abroad students. There are no restrictions on subjects or regions, except for Cuba or countries under travel warnings. The Gilman program, administered by the Department of State, provides study abroad opportunities for students who may not otherwise be able to participate. In the 2002-2003 academic year, 179 students received Gilman Scholarships. The program aims to support innovative approaches to U.S. postsecondary education through the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE), authorized by Title VII, Part B of the HEA. While some FIPSE grants have supported international education programs, the primary focus is on activities related to postsecondary education. The Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) provides targeted support for international education programs under three specific programs: the Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education, the U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and the European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program in Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training. These programs offer multi-year grants to U.S. institutions to collaborate with foreign institutions on activities such as student and staff exchange and curriculum development. Funding levels for FY2002 are $2,043,000 for the North American Mobility program, $1,495,000 for the U.S.-Brazil Consortia program, and $2,254,000 for the European Cooperation program. The funding levels for the Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education, U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program are $2,043,000, $1,495,000, and $2,254,000 respectively. There is a question of whether these programs should be consolidated under a coordinated national strategy for efficiency. Coordination or consolidation may be less important due to the smaller scale of these programs compared to Title VI. The Fulbright-Hays, FIPSE, and NSEP institutional grant programs are similar to HEA Title VI, all administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education Programs. Coordination and efficiency could be improved by consolidating or placing them under a single advisory board. NSEP's emphasis on national security needs and service requirement for aid recipients set it apart. Coordination with NSEP may align better with its purposes than consolidation with Title VI and related programs. The NSEP maintains its unique characteristics, with coordination being more consistent with its purposes than consolidation with Title VI and related programs, especially for scholarship and fellowship programs. Despite operating separately, questions arise about its long-term viability due to a reduction in its trust fund. The Gilman International Scholarship Program, while providing funding for undergraduate students to travel abroad, lacks the national security focus and service requirements of the NSEP. The Gilman International Scholarship Program provides funding for undergraduate students to travel abroad, but lacks the national security focus and service requirements of the NSEP. Consider transferring the Gilman program to the Department of Education and incorporating it under the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs of HEA Title VI. Proposals could also include establishing a multi-agency board or independent federal entity to coordinate all federal programs related to foreign language and international studies. The Foreign Language Assistance Program authorized by ESEA focuses on long-range planning to meet federal and national needs for FLAS specialists. There is a question of increased coordination between IHEs funded by HEA Title VI and federal agencies offering language instruction, including targeting fellowships and grants to align with government language needs. HEA Title VI grants cover a wide range of languages and regions. Currently, HEA Title VI grants support training institutions and IHEs across various languages and regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia. While funding priorities may change over time, it is important to maintain a balance in funding allocations. The decision on targeting Title VI funding for less commonly taught languages or regions raises questions on who should make these decisions, whether it be the Department of Education, an interagency advisory body, a new entity, or Congress. Matching federal funds with non-federal resources is a requirement for several HEA Title VI programs. The HEA Title VI programs require federal funds to be matched with non-federal resources, attracting additional funding from various sources. However, there are concerns about whether the current scale of the program is sufficient to meet national needs. Opponents argue against increased targeting of grants for critical languages and regions, citing the difficulty in predicting future needs. It is uncertain to predict future languages and regions for Title VI grants. It is suggested to rely on IHEs for proposals and support a wide range of languages and regions. Quantifying national needs is challenging, with efforts like the annual Federal Language Needs survey. The NSEP is linked to scholarships, fellowships, and grants. A study identified foreign languages and regions of national security interest. The GAO report highlighted the increasing need for federal employees with foreign language skills. The increasing need for federal employees with foreign language skills, due to the changing security environment and globalization of the U.S. economy, has led to shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists. These shortages have negatively impacted agency operations and hindered various U.S. efforts in military, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and diplomacy."
