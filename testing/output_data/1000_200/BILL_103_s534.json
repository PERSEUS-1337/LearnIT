    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Crop Insurance Fairness Act\" allows for coverage levels exceeding 75% of recorded or appraised average yield. The Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(a)) is amended to allow the Corporation to insure agricultural commodities against various unavoidable causes like drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, and more, as determined by the Board. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows the Corporation to insure agricultural commodities against infestation, plant disease, and other unavoidable causes determined by the Board. Insurance coverage does not extend beyond the period the commodity is in the field, with standard yield coverage offering protection for 75 percent of the average yield on the insured farm. The Corporation offers insurance coverage for agricultural commodities based on average yields, with adjustments made for fairness. Producers can choose lesser levels of coverage, including 50 percent of the average yield. Adjustments are made by the Board to ensure fairness for farms in the same area with similar conditions. The Corporation provides insurance coverage for agricultural commodities based on average yields, with adjustments made by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. Additional insurance can be obtained for a premium based on adjusted yields established by the Service. The Corporation offers additional insurance coverage for agricultural commodities at rates determined by the Board to accurately reflect increased risk and cover potential losses. Coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of average yield may be available to producers in specific growing areas. The Corporation may offer producers on a farm in certain growing areas coverage exceeding 75 percent of the average yield, if normal yield variations have not led to loss claims. The maximum coverage level available is 75 percent, except in specific circumstances. One price election option must approximate the projected market price for the commodity, determined by the Board. The Board determines the market price for commodities in elections, with insurance not covering losses due to neglect, failure to reseed, or not following good farming practices. Insurance risks can lead to limitations or refusals, and no insurance is provided in counties for certain agricultural commodities. The Corporation shall report annually to Congress the results of its operations for each insured commodity, and establish a minimum price level for each commodity offered for insurance starting from the 1992 crop year. Insurance coverage for commodities must not be less than the projected market price determined by the Board. Producers can choose coverage based on a price election set by the Board, quoted in dollars per acre. SEC. 3. LATE PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include late planting coverage, allowing producers to plant after the final planting date for up to 25 days with reduced yield guarantee. Late planting coverage is included in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, allowing producers to plant after the final planting date for up to 25 days with reduced yield guarantee. Producers have the option to waive this coverage, and if it significantly raises premiums, it can be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage applies if planting is prevented due to excess moisture, drought, or other natural disasters, with eligible coverage equal to 50 percent of the guaranteed level. Producers also have the option to plant a substitute crop instead of an insured crop. The Federal Crop Insurance Act now includes prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm, allowing them to plant a substitute crop instead of an insured crop. The substitute crop's value will offset the remaining guaranteed coverage for the insured crop. Producers are presumed to have prevented planting coverage unless they opt out, and if offering prevented planting coverage would significantly increase premiums, it will be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF PENALTY FOR DE MINIMIS YIELDS. The Corporation will establish a procedure where producers with disaster losses won't have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of actual production is less than harvesting costs. SEC. 6. YIELD AVERAGES. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include provisions for yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 crop years. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters. Transitional yield data may only be used for establishing yields. Transitional yield data can only be used to establish yields for producers on a farm if they have not established actual production history for the first 4 crop years. After that, yield coverage will be based solely on actual production history. Producers on a farm can choose to use previous yield history or transitional yield data for crop insurance purposes. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to account for yield declines due to natural disasters. Transitional yield is defined for this purpose. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to account for yield declines due to natural disasters, using transitional yield data when actual production records are unavailable."
