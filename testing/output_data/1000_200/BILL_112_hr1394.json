    "content": "The Act titled \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with a high mortality rate and increasing incidence projected for the future. It causes more deaths annually than several other major types of cancer combined. Lung cancer has a low 5-year survival rate of 15%, while breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of 89%, prostate cancer 99%, and colon cancer 65%. Despite causing more deaths annually than other major cancers combined, lung cancer receives the least research funding. The National Cancer Institute highlighted the inadequate funding for lung cancer research in 2001 and called for a comprehensive research program, which has not been developed yet. The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer, along with 15 other environmental contaminants. Hormonal and genetic factors may also influence the onset of lung cancer. Nearly 20% of lung cancer patients have never smoked, and 60% are former smokers who quit decades ago. Lung cancer is stigmatized and often blamed on patients, regardless of smoking history. (9) Nearly 20% of lung cancer patients never smoked. Sixty percent are former smokers who quit years ago.\n(10) Lung cancer in non-smokers is the sixth leading cause of cancer death, with two-thirds of cases in women.\n(11) Lung cancer is the top cause of cancer death across all ethnic groups, disproportionately affecting African-American males.\n(12) Military personnel and workers exposed to carcinogens like Agent Orange are at risk for lung cancer. Military personnel, veterans, and munitions workers exposed to carcinogens like Agent Orange, silica, arsenic, uranium, beryllium, and battlefield fuel emissions have an increased risk for lung cancer. Only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed early, with no specific targets for early detection or treatment in health initiatives. Studies suggest that early detection of lung cancer could save over 70,000 lives annually in the United States. Early detection of lung cancer could save over 70,000 lives annually in the United States. A National Cancer Institute study in 2009 projected that a 4% annual decline in lung cancer mortality could reduce the value of life lost to lung cancer by more than half by 2020. The National Lung Screening Trial in 2010 found 20% fewer lung cancer deaths among participants screened with low-dose helical computed tomography compared to standard chest x-rays. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This program aims to address all aspects of lung cancer and reduce mortality among current smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020, involving various government agencies and stakeholders. The program under the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. It includes a strategic review and prioritization of research grants by the National Cancer Institute, funding for the Airway Biology and Disease Branch to expand research on lung cancer predispositions, interrelationships with other diseases, and diagnosis and treatment. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 focuses on reducing lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. It includes funding for research on the interrelationship between lung cancer and other pulmonary and cardiac diseases, as well as the development of screening, diagnostic, and treatment innovations to reduce mortality. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. It includes funding for research programs on lung cancer incidence and collaboration on prevention, detection, and disease management research for minority populations. Funding is also provided for the Food and Drug Administration to establish quality standards for healthcare facilities. The Radiologic Health is tasked with establishing quality standards and guidelines for facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer, updating standards as needed, and conducting annual compliance surveys. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will receive funds to establish a Lung Cancer Early Detection Program. Prevention measures for lung cancer include funding for early detection programs for high-risk populations, research on workplace contaminants linked to lung cancer, and inclusion of lung cancer mortality reduction measures in state cancer control plans. The Comprehensive Cancer Control Program aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by reviewing early detection methods, treatment protocols, and issuing updated guidelines. It also focuses on addressing the burden of lung cancer on women, minorities, rural, and underserved populations through cooperation with tobacco control and cessation programs. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program emphasizes cooperation and coordination of tobacco control and cessation programs within the Department of Health and Human Services to reduce lung cancer mortality, with a focus on underserved populations. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program, implement a demonstration project for military personnel and veterans at risk for lung cancer, and establish coordinated care programs for those diagnosed with lung cancer. (a) Sense of the Congress is to conduct a national computed tomography lung cancer screening demonstration project promptly to assess public health needs and develop an effective process. (b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with various agencies, is required to initiate a demonstration project within one year to maximize public health benefits of screening. The Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project, established by the Lung Cancer Advisory Board, aims to identify optimal risk populations for screening, develop effective and cost-efficient screening processes, ensure quality control, and integrate health information technology into the healthcare system. The Secretary will select various healthcare centers to carry out a demonstration project for lung cancer screening. Quality standards and guidelines will be established for licensing different types of facilities. The Secretary will conduct a 5-year demonstration project for lung cancer screening at various healthcare facilities. Quality assurance and control programs will be required to ensure equipment reliability and interpretation accuracy. Reports on project cost and progress will be submitted to Congress. The Secretary will conduct a 5-year lung cancer screening demonstration project at healthcare facilities, with quality assurance programs in place. Annual reports on project cost and progress will be submitted to Congress. SEC. 7. LUNG CANCER ADVISORY BOARD. The Lung Cancer Advisory Board, established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, monitors programs under the Act, provides annual reports to Congress, and includes members from various government agencies and experts in lung cancer. The Lung Cancer Advisory Board, established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, includes representatives from various fields such as clinical medicine, lung cancer research, radiology, drug development, minority health advocacy, veterans service organizations, and occupational medicine. SEC. 8. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to carry out the Act and its amendments."
