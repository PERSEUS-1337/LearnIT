FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that HIV/AIDS is predicted to become the worst infectious disease epidemic in history, surpassing past pandemics like the bubonic plague and the 1918 influenza outbreak. Disparities in HIV transmission from mother to child between rich and poor countries are increasing, potentially leading to a significant rise in child mortality by 2010. The National Intelligence Council predicts a significant increase in AIDS-related child mortality by 2010, with the number of AIDS orphans potentially tripling in the next decade. This could lead to economic decay, social fragmentation, and political destabilization in vulnerable societies. The economic costs of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, are already substantial and could further impact global economies. The economic costs of infectious diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, could reduce GDP by 20% or more in some sub-Saharan African nations by 2010. Despite discouraging statistics, countries like Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand have implemented successful prevention programs. US financial support for global medical research and disease containment has significant benefits. Contributing to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria is crucial given the high cost of combating infectious diseases worldwide. The proposed Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, endorsed by the international community in September 1997, has not been implemented due to lack of Congressional authorization. Accepted by 109 out of 110 IMF members, this amendment aims to allocate Special Drawing Rights to combat global infectious diseases. The International Monetary Fund has 110 members, representing 72.18% of total voting power. Approval of the Fourth Amendment by the United States would enable the allocation of Special Drawing Rights. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria leverages resources from donor nations to combat the HIV/AIDS crisis. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act is amended to accept the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, allowing for the contribution of Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The United States Governor of the Fund accepts the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to seek agreement for the Global Fund to hold Special Drawing Rights. Upon achieving the agreement, the Secretary of the Treasury will provide contributions. The Secretary of the Treasury will contribute 1/3 of Special Drawing Rights to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in fiscal years 2004 through 2006. Negotiations will be pursued to encourage other Fund members to make similar contributions."
