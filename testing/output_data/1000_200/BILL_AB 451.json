    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code allows cities or counties to declare privately owned offstreet parking facilities open for public use, with regulations on unauthorized parking. If a city or county allows public use of privately owned offstreet parking facilities, the owner must provide instructions on contesting parking fees and cannot involve the Department of Motor Vehicles in collecting unpaid fees. An ordinance or resolution enacted for offstreet parking facilities must have a notice posted at each entrance warning of public moving vehicle laws and potential parking invoice fees. A public hearing and written notice to the owner and operator are required before enacting such ordinances. Section 22507.8 can be enforced without the need for an ordinance or resolution, and the department is not obligated to patrol privately owned offstreet parking facilities. Cities or counties authorizing private parking regulation must include dispute resolution procedures in their ordinance. Procedures of dispute resolution in accordance with Section 40215 include a written policy with specified timeframes, an administrative hearing process with options for in-person or mail hearings, and a prohibition against incentives based on the number of disputed invoices. The curr_chunk discusses regulations for private parking regulators, including a prohibition on incentives based on invoices, a cap on parking fees, and measures to prevent misrepresentation as a government agency."
