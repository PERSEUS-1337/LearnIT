    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and by the government's own accounts, including federal trust funds like Social Security and Medicare. Changes in debt held by the public are determined by the government's surpluses or deficits, while debt held in government accounts is influenced by net financial flows. Legal requirements and government accounting practices also impact levels of debt held by government accounts. Since the late 1950s, the federal government has increased borrowing from the public, except in FY1969 and FY1998-FY2001. Budget deficits have led to more debt issuance. The accumulation of trust funds, especially after 1983, has increased government-held debt. Congress has periodically raised the debt limit due to growth in federal debt held by the public and in intergovernmental accounts. Issues with the debt limit since the Budget Control Act of 2011 are discussed in more detail in CRS Report R43389. The federal government has increased borrowing since the late 1950s, except in a few years. Trust funds accumulation has raised government-held debt, leading Congress to periodically raise the debt limit. Treasury's ability to finance activities can be hindered when debt nears its legal limit, impacting cash management systems. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow is crucial for managing fluctuations in federal revenues and outlays. If the debt limit restricts borrowing, the government may struggle to meet its legal obligations on time, leading to cash flow issues and potential inability to pay bills or invest surpluses as required by law. This poses a challenge for Treasury's financial management systems. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow is crucial for managing federal revenues and outlays. The debt limit may hinder the government from meeting legal obligations on time, leading to cash flow issues and potential default. Delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs. Default on interest payments could trigger repercussions for economies and financial markets worldwide. Delaying other federal payments may be a way to avoid default in such situations. Delaying federal payments can help avoid default situations, but it may incur interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and Internal Revenue Code. Concerns have been raised by credit ratings agencies and investment banks about the financial system and economy if the U.S. Treasury cannot fund obligations, leading to potential risks associated with Treasury securities. The U.S. Treasury may face funding issues, leading to potential risks for global capital markets. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies to manage debt during debt ceiling constraints, including suspending debt sales and withholding certain receipts. Congress has authorized the Treasury Secretary to use these strategies, such as invoking a \"debt issuance suspension period\" using specific government trust funds. Some responses to the credit crunch in 2007 created balance sheet items. The U.S. Treasury responded to the credit crunch by selling off mortgage-backed securities to minimize market disruptions. However, the Treasury's portfolio of MBSs has been eliminated as of March 2012. Proceeds from potential asset sales are unlikely to sustain smooth debt management operations without an increase in the debt limit. The U.S. Treasury has sold off mortgage-backed securities to address the credit crunch, but the portfolio has been eliminated. Other asset sales are not seen as a viable solution to ease debt limit constraints. Some suggest using the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass the debt limit, but this has been rejected by President Obama and legal analysts. The debt limit can impede the Treasury's ability to manage finances, leading to extraordinary measures to meet obligations when near the limit. The federal debt near its limit requires Treasury to take extraordinary measures to meet obligations, causing inconvenience and uncertainty. The debt limit allows Congress to control spending and imposes fiscal accountability. Some advocate for eliminating the debt limit. Some budget experts argue for eliminating the debt limit, stating that modern budget controls make it redundant. The Obama Administration proposed allowing debt limit increases with congressional disapproval. Committees on Appropriations handle discretionary spending, while authorizing committees manage mandatory program spending decisions. Committees on the Budget draft an overall budget framework for federal spending and taxation, while authorizing committees handle mandatory program spending decisions. Measures involving the debt limit provide individual Members with a separate tool to influence fiscal policy. Congress historically imposed restrictions on federal debt to assert its constitutional powers. Before World War I, Congress imposed restrictions on federal debt, specifying borrowing purposes and financial instruments for Treasury. Concerns were raised about the Treasury Secretary's authority to issue debt affecting monetary policies, but these concerns became irrelevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management. It granted the Treasury Secretary authority to issue $100 million in short-term certificates and $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds. This act aimed to fund Spanish-American War costs and involved large investors, banks, and smaller investors through public subscription. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 allowed smaller investors to participate in public subscriptions for financing World War I. It granted the Treasury Secretary administrative leeway and expanded borrowing capacity from previous acts. Certain limits on bond maturity and redemption were dropped, while separate limits for previous debt issues were retained. Subsequent borrowing measures were introduced as amendments to the Second Liberty Bond Act. In the 1920s and 1930s, Congress made changes to federal borrowing policies, allowing the Treasury more flexibility in managing debt. This included issuing notes and savings certificates for small investors, as well as setting aggregate constraints on borrowing. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 played a key role in these developments, with subsequent borrowing measures being introduced as amendments to the Act. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds to manage federal finances. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the need for the Treasury to have complete freedom in determining the type of securities to be issued. In 1935, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau proposed replacing a limit on bond issuance with a more flexible limit on outstanding bonds, highlighting the role of Treasury bonds in financial management. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds to manage federal finances. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the need for the Treasury to have complete freedom in determining the type of securities to be issued. In 1935, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau proposed replacing a limit on bond issuance with a more flexible limit on outstanding bonds. Congress established a $20 billion limit on shorter-term debt and a $25 billion limit on outstanding bonds. President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau asked Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other types of debt. The law created the first aggregate limit of $45 billion covering nearly all public debt. The law (P.L. 76-201) created the first aggregate limit of $45 billion on public debt in July 20. This allowed the Treasury to manage federal debt more freely by combining a $30 billion limit on bonds with a $15 billion limit on shorter-term debt. The Treasury could issue debt instruments with maturities to reduce interest costs and minimize financial risks. Legislation in 1941 increased the aggregate limit to $65 billion, giving the Treasury greater independence on the eve of World War II. On the eve of World War II, the debt limit was raised to accommodate increasing costs, reaching $300 billion by 1945. After the war, the limit was reduced to $275 billion and remained unchanged until 1954 due to the Korean War being financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Eisenhower Administration requested an increase in 1953, but Congress did not act on it. In 1954, the debt limit remained at $275 billion until the Eisenhower Administration requested an increase. Congress declined until 1957, citing the need for better management of money and manpower in the defense program. The debt limit reached $300 billion in 1962, and since then, Congress has enacted 78 measures altering the limit. Recent increases in the debt limit have been significant, such as a $1.9 trillion increase. Since FY1996, federal debt has fluctuated due to various factors. Debt held by intergovernmental accounts increased during surpluses in FY1998-FY2001, while debt held by the public decreased. However, since FY2001, debt held by the public has grown due to budget deficits. Debt held in government accounts has also increased, partly due to excess Social Security payroll taxes. The components of federal debt as a percentage of GDP have been tracked since FY1996, with projections up to FY2019. Since FY1996, federal debt has fluctuated due to various factors. Debt held by intergovernmental accounts increased during surpluses in FY1998-FY2001, while debt held by the public decreased. However, since FY2001, debt held by the public has grown due to budget deficits. Debt held in government accounts has also increased, partly due to excess Social Security payroll taxes. The components of federal debt as a percentage of GDP have been tracked since FY1996, with projections up to FY2019. Federal debt held by government accounts has grown steadily since 1982, in part due to increases in Social Security taxes passed following recommendations of the 1983 Greenspan Commission, and reflecting the transition of the baby boom generation into its peak earnings years. Debt held by the public, which changes in response to total surpluses or deficits, grew as a share of GDP through the mid-1990s. After FY1992, deficits shrank, and from FY1998 through FY2001 the federal government ran surpluses. Those surpluses, along with rapid GDP growth, reduced debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP. When large deficits returned and GDP growth slowed in the early 2000s, debt held by the public as a share of GDP again increased. Since FY1996, federal debt has fluctuated due to various factors. Debt held by intergovernmental accounts increased during surpluses in FY1998-FY2001, while debt held by the public decreased. However, since FY2001, debt held by the public has grown due to budget deficits. Accumulating debt in government accounts produced pressure on the debt limit in early 2002. Deficits reemerged in FY2002, leading to increases in debt held by the public. By the end of May 2002, debt subject to limit had increased by $217 billion, divided between debt held by government accounts and debt held by the public. The debt subject to limit increased by $217 billion, with $117 billion held by government accounts and $100 billion held by the public, nearing the $5,950 billion limit. The Administration requested a $750 billion increase in the debt limit to $6,700 billion in December 2001 due to a deteriorating budget outlook. As the debt approached the limit in FY2002, the Administration repeatedly asked Congress to raise the limit to avoid adverse financial consequences. On April 4, 2002, the Treasury temporarily held debt below the limit by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund. The Treasury avoided reaching the debt limit by suspending reinvestment in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan. Debt subject to limit stood just $25 million below the limit on April 15, but increased to within $15 million of the limit by mid-May 2002. The Treasury used its statutory authority for the second time in 2002 to prevent a breach of the limit. The Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit or make statutory changes to issue new debt, as they were close to reaching the statutory limit. This would allow the Treasury to suspend or redeem investments in trust funds to fund government operations during a debt issuance suspension period. The Treasury reduced federal debt held by government accounts by replacing it with non-interest-bearing instruments to meet obligations. Without a debt limit increase by June 28, 2002, the Treasury would need to take actions to avoid breaching the ceiling, potentially leading to a default. Congress took steps to increase the debt limit during May and June 2002. In May and June 2002, Congress took steps to increase the debt limit to avoid default. The Senate adopted a bill to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion, providing enough borrowing authority for government operations. The House passed a $450 billion debt limit increase by a single vote on June 27, 2002, to avoid default. The President signed the bill into law on June 28, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. In late February 2003, the Treasury requested an increase in the debt limit as the $6,400 billion limit would be reached. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to repeated requests from the Treasury to raise the debt limit to avoid financial problems. The Treasury requested a debt limit increase to avoid financial problems. By February 20, 2003, the Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings and avoid reaching the debt limit. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" to raise the debt limit. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" to raise the debt limit. The Senate received the debt-limit legislation on April 11, but did not act until May 23, after further Treasury warnings of imminent default. The legislation raised the debt limit to $7,384 billion (P.L. 108-24, 117 Stat. 710). In January 2004, CBO estimated that the debt limit would be reached the following summer. In June 2004, the Treasury asked Congress to raise the debt limit to avoid disruptions to government finances. By October 14, the debt subject to limit reached $7,383,975 million, just $25 million below the existing limit. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow informed Congress that measures to avoid breaching the debt limit would be exhausted by mid-November, risking the government's ability to meet obligations and impacting the U.S. government's reputation in capital markets. Without a budget resolution passed by Congress, no resolution to raise the debt limit could be deemed passed by the House automatically under the Gephardt rule. Consequently, no measure was available to send to the Senate. As the debt approached the limit through the summer and into the fall, no legislation was moved to raise the debt limit. Earlier, in September 2004, the House had added an amendment to the FY2005 Transportation-Treasury appropriations ( H.R. 5025 ) in an effort to remove the Treasury's flexibility in financing the government as federal debt approached and reached the existing limit. The House added an amendment to appropriations bill H.R. 5025 to limit Treasury's flexibility in financing as federal debt neared the existing limit. Senator Frist later introduced legislation to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, which was approved by the Senate and House, and signed into law on November 19, 2004. The new limit was expected to be reached between August and December 2005. In 2005, the debt limit increase was less dramatic than in previous years. Congress included reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution to raise the debt limit to $8,965 billion. Treasury rescheduled a debt auction and canceled a \"debt limit suspension period\" after the increase in mid-November. In 2005, Congress included reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution to raise the debt limit to $8,965 billion. The adoption of the conference report triggered the Gephardt rule, producing a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 47) to raise the debt limit by $781 billion. The Senate had not considered H.J.Res. 47 by the end of the first session of the 109th Congress. Treasury Secretary Snow informed Congress in December 2005 that the debt limit would likely be reached in mid-February 2006. In December 2005, Treasury Secretary Snow informed Congress that the debt limit would be reached in mid-February 2006 and requested an increase. Despite taking measures to avoid reaching the limit, by mid-March 2006, the Treasury was close to being unable to meet its obligations. The Senate passed a debt limit increase on March 16, 2006, and the President signed it into law on March 20, 2006 (P.L. 109-182). In March 2006, the Senate passed a debt limit increase (P.L. 109-182) after rejecting amendments. The debt limit was raised to $8,965 billion. In May 2007, Congress passed the FY2008 budget resolution. The House's Gephardt rule triggered the automatic engrossment of a joint resolution raising the debt limit by $850 billion to $9,815 billion. Treasury requested another increase in July 2007, projecting reaching the limit in October or November. In late October or early November, projections indicated the debt limit would be reached. The Senate Finance Committee approved a House resolution without changes on September 12, 2007. The Senate passed the measure on September 27, signed by the President on September 29, 2007. Financial markets showed turmoil in mid-2007, leading to a serious crisis in 2008 and a recession lasting until 2009. Federal actions were taken to stabilize housing and financial markets amidst a rapid deceleration of housing prices and rising interest rate spreads. The recession led to a rise in interest rate spreads and reduced federal revenues, resulting in large deficits and debt limit increases. Federal deficit spending spiked to 9.8% of GDP, impacting the economic recovery. Falling asset prices reduced capital gains and corporate tax revenues, while individual income taxes also decreased. The recession caused deficits to increase due to reduced federal revenues from capital gains taxes and corporate taxes. Individual income taxes may also decrease if job cuts lead to higher unemployment. \"Automatic stabilizers\" like unemployment insurance increase federal spending as unemployment rises. Deficit spending can stimulate the economy if output levels are below potential, but can lead to inflation if output levels are already high. The CBO estimated deficits of $396 billion in FY2008 and $342 billion in FY2009 under the President's budget. The President's budget led to larger deficits than estimated by the CBO, reaching $455 billion in FY2008. The federal debt limit was raised multiple times in 2008 and 2009 due to economic conditions. The House and Senate Concurrent Resolutions recommended policies resulting in a total debt of over $10 trillion in FY2009, requiring an increase in the federal debt limit. The budget conference report in FY2009 recommended spending levels that would lead to a debt subject to limit of $10,207 billion, requiring an increase in the statutory debt limit. The House passed legislation to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion, but the Senate did not take it up, so the limit remained at $9,815 billion. The House passed an amended version of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (H.R. 3221) increasing the debt limit to $10,615 billion. The Senate and President also approved the bill, which included provisions for mortgage guarantee agencies and created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship, giving full control to FHFA. The government acted to stabilize financial markets after the deprivatization of the two firms. Treasury Secretary was authorized to intervene with a proposal submitted to Congress on September 20, 2008. The federal government took action to stabilize financial markets by proposing to buy mortgage-related assets and raising the debt limit. Despite initial rejection by the House, a different version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act was passed by the Senate and eventually signed into law. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was passed to address current economic conditions, containing tax cuts and spending increases that would raise the deficit. It included a provision to raise the debt limit to $12,140 billion, signed into law on February 17, 2009. The final conference agreement on ARRA was passed by the House and Senate on February 13, 2009, and signed by the President on February 17, 2009. It included a provision increasing the debt limit to $12,104 billion. The budget resolution recommended policies leading to a debt subject to limit of $13,233 billion in FY2010, triggering the Gephardt rule in April 2009. This resulted in a House Joint Resolution raising the debt limit to $13,029 billion. In November 2009, the U.S. Treasury announced measures to delay reaching the debt limit, including reducing loans available through the Supplemental Financing Program. The Obama Administration also considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program to lower federal debt. The Obama Administration considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program to lower federal debt and extend the U.S. Treasury's ability to operate within the debt limit. Repayments of TARP funds by financial institutions could also reduce the debt subject to the limit. Additionally, issuing nonmarketable securities and making interest payments could challenge Treasury's debt management activities without a debt limit increase. In mid-December, senior Members of the House passed H.R. 4314 to raise the debt limit to $12,394 billion. The Senate later passed an amended version to raise the debt ceiling to $14,294 billion, along with imposing PAYGO restrictions. The Senate passed an amendment to raise the debt ceiling to $14,294 billion and impose PAYGO restrictions. Some Members of Congress proposed a national commission to address federal debt, but a Bipartisan Task Force amendment was not approved. President Obama charged a Fiscal Commission to improve the fiscal situation, which issued a report in December 2010. The Fiscal Commission issued a report on December 1, 2010, and the House approved H.J.Res. 45 on February 4, forwarding it to the President, who signed the measure (P.L. 111-139) on February 12, 2010. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which reinstated caps on discretionary spending and other means of constraining federal spending. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced a debt issuance suspension period on May 16, 2011, due to reaching the statutory debt limit. The U.S. Treasury announced a debt issuance suspension period due to reaching the statutory debt limit, allowing extraordinary measures to extend borrowing capacity until August 2, 2011. With a projected federal deficit of $1,399 billion, cutting spending to slow debt growth was suggested to avoid increasing the debt limit. The U.S. Treasury announced a debt issuance suspension period to extend borrowing capacity until August 2, 2011. Cutting spending to slow debt growth was suggested to avoid increasing the debt limit. Funding federal operations could become complicated without a debt limit increase. An independent analysis of Treasury cash flows projects a significant shortfall in cash inflows compared to outflows from August 3 to the end of the month. Estimates on when the debt limit would bind and the duration of extraordinary measures have shifted since January 6, 2011. Higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities have temporarily increased headroom between federal debt and its limit. Estimates show a potential shortfall in cash inflows compared to outflows in August. Treasury's debt limit could be reached soon, with measures to extend borrowing capacity until early August. Treasury Secretary may declare a debt issuance suspension period on May 16 if Congress doesn't act. Measures like the draw-down of the Supplementary Financing Program have already been taken. The Treasury Secretary took measures to extend borrowing capacity until early August 2011, including drawing down the Supplementary Financing Program from $200 billion to $5 billion. New issuances of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities were suspended on May 6, 2011. Secretary Geithner requested an increase in the debt limit in January 2011, predicting reaching the limit between March 31 and May 16, 2011. The Treasury had projected reaching its borrowing capacity using extraordinary measures. The U.S. Treasury projected reaching its borrowing capacity between April 15 and May 31, 2011. A bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was introduced on May 24 but was defeated in a House vote on May 31. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, but was tabled by the Senate on July 22. Legislation called the Budget Control Act of 2011 was introduced by House Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Reid on July 25. The Budget Control Act of 2011, signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011, aimed at deficit reduction and included provisions for increasing the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion. It imposed discretionary spending caps and established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed at deficit reduction by implementing spending caps, establishing a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and allowing for the debt ceiling to be raised in three steps. The first increase was $400 billion on August 2, 2011, followed by a $500 billion increase on September 22, 2011. The second debt limit increase in 2011 was subject to a joint resolution of disapproval, which was challenging to block due to the possibility of a veto. The Senate rejected a disapproval measure, while the House passed one that the Senate did not act on. In late December 2011, the debt limit was close to its statutory limit, triggering a provision for a third increase of $1.2 trillion, which was also subject to a joint resolution of disapproval. The third debt limit increase in 2011 was potentially triggered in two other ways. One option was a $1.5 trillion increase if states ratified a balanced budget amendment, which failed to reach the required threshold in the House. The other option was a $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion increase if recommendations from the Super Committee were passed, but they were unable to agree on a set of recommendations. The debt limit increase in 2011 was set at $1.2 trillion, matching budget reductions through sequestration. Treasury Secretary Geithner used extraordinary measures until mid-February to mid-March 2013. The House passed H.R. 325 to suspend the debt limit. Geithner used extraordinary measures until mid-March 2013. The House passed H.R. 325 to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013. The Senate passed the measure on January 31, and it was signed into law on February 4. The U.S. Treasury reset the debt limit at $16,699 billion on May 20, 2013. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew notified Congress of the new debt limit. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period (DISP) due to the debt being $25 million below the limit. He sent notices to Congress with updated forecasts, pushing back the expected exhaustion date to no later than October 17, 2013. Congress passed a continuing resolution the evening before the projected exhaustion date. On October 17, 2013, Congress passed a resolution to end the government shutdown and suspend the debt limit until February 8, 2014. The debt limit was reset to $17,212 billion, and extraordinary measures were used. A new measure was approved on February 11, 2014, to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015, which was signed into law on February 15, 2014. After the debt limit suspension expired on March 16, 2015, the limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion. Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary measures to meet financial obligations until July 30, 2015. Additional measures were invoked until the end of October, allowing the Treasury to meet obligations for a brief period after that. By October 15, 2015, Secretary Lew stated that these measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015. After the debt limit suspension expired on March 16, 2015, Treasury Secretary Lew used extraordinary measures to meet financial obligations until July 30, 2015. Additional measures were in place until the end of October, providing a brief period of time for the Treasury to meet obligations. Secretary Lew projected that these measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a small cash reserve of less than $30 billion on hand. Projections for meeting federal obligations varied, with estimates ranging from November to early December 2015. The Bipartisan Budget Agreement released on October 26, 2015, addressed fiscal issues, including the debt limit. The Bipartisan Budget Agreement released on October 26, 2015 addressed fiscal issues, including the debt limit. The agreement reset the debt limit on March 16, 2017, and increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The House concurred with Senate amendments to H.R. 1314 on October 28, 2015, resulting in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) being signed into law. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was signed into law on November 2, 2015. The federal government ran budget surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001, reducing its debt. However, deficits increased due to higher military and security spending post-9/11, rising nondefense outlays, and tax reductions in 2001 and 2003. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent recession led to large federal deficits, necessitating debt limit increases. Fiscal costs of a crisis are overshadowed by reduced tax revenues and increased social safety net benefits. Concerns over fiscal sustainability peaked in the 2011 debt limit episode but have since diminished as federal deficits have decreased with economic recovery. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 led to large federal deficits, necessitating debt limit increases. Federal deficits have since decreased as economic recovery progressed, but without major policy changes, growing deficits could substantially increase federal debt. CBO warns that current borrowing trajectory is unsustainable and could lead to slower economic growth in the long run. Congress may need to raise the debt limit repeatedly to accommodate the growing federal debt. Since September 2001, federal debt subject to limit has increased significantly, with total federal debt rising by $12,380 billion, debt held in government accounts increasing by $2,566 billion, and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. This growth in debt has been ongoing since the last year of a federal budget surplus in FY2001. Since September 2001, federal debt has increased by $12,380 billion, with debt held in government accounts rising by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public increasing by $9,813 billion. Debt measures experienced periodic reductions, influenced by uneven federal receipts and outlays over the fiscal year."
