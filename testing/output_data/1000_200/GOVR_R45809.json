    "content": "Critical infrastructure (CI) encompasses machinery, facilities, and information crucial for governance, public health, and the economy. Adverse events can result from loss or disruption of CI systems, whether due to natural disasters or deliberate attacks. This report outlines key policy concerns for Congress, including defining and identifying CI, assessing CI risk, federal organization for CI, and the role of the private sector. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection, focusing on national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 addressed national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks by defining critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government. It set goals to eliminate vulnerability to non-traditional cyber or physical attacks, but establishing consistent criteria for criticality has proven challenging. The criticality of specific assets and systems is complex due to the perspectives, values, and priorities of those assessing them. The U.S. and global economies' scale and interconnectedness make it challenging to identify critical assets. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as systems and assets essential for national mobilization against catastrophic risks. The USA PATRIOT Act defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets essential for national security, economic security, public health, and safety. Critical infrastructure policy has evolved to include essential services and conveniences for the public, with a focus on addressing threats from state and non-state adversaries. The intelligence community continues to monitor asymmetric threats to critical infrastructure. In the early post-9/11 period, the intelligence community focuses on asymmetric threats to critical infrastructure posed by state and non-state adversaries. Asymmetric attacks may use physical or cyber means to disrupt domestic CI systems and assets, causing mass civilian casualties. Natural disasters and other causes of disruption have also become significant in critical infrastructure policy. The definition of critical infrastructure under the USA PATRIOT Act remains law, but policymakers have broadened the threshold to include events with disruptive effects. CI policymakers have expanded the definition of critical infrastructure to include events with disruptive effects, emphasizing infrastructure as vital for prosperity, safety, and civic life. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan defines critical infrastructure as assets supporting American society, considering impacts of various hazards at different levels. This shift in policy reflects a focus on infrastructure's role beyond national security, the economy, and public health. Successive Administrations since 1998 have expanded CI policy to focus on society-centric resilience at the system level, including U.S. election systems designated as critical infrastructure by DHS in January 2017. This includes physical locations and technology infrastructure essential for managing elections and validating results. The critical infrastructure sectors, as outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 21, play a vital role in supporting the nation's civic life. These sectors include facilities, systems, and assets such as voter registration databases and voting systems. The federal government utilizes these sectors as an organizing framework for voluntary public-private partnerships, with DHS overseeing coordination and other federal agencies serving as Sector-Specific Agencies. The critical infrastructure sectors, outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 21, involve various federal agencies as Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs). These sectors encompass a wide range of national economic and social activities, each with unique characteristics. Formal coordination bodies represent each designated sector, including private sector stakeholders and SLTT government representatives. As sectors evolve, new public and private sector communities of interest emerge. The definition of critical infrastructure varies among different stakeholders, including governments, industry, and non-profit groups. There is no single, consistently applied definition, as diverse interests and perspectives shape the identification and prioritization of critical systems and assets. This multiplicity of definitions reflects the evolving nature of critical infrastructure and the efforts of various constituencies to negotiate boundaries. Critical infrastructure policy has two orientations: Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) focuses on identifying and protecting infrastructure assets based on the consequences of asset loss or system disruption. Loss or disruption of service would have system-level impacts on essential functions of society, the economy, or government. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) emphasizes investments in hazard mitigation and preparedness during steady-state periods, and adaptation during emergencies, to ensure availability of critical infrastructure functions enabling essential services. National CI policy reflects a hybrid approach containing elements of both CIP and CIR, favoring system resilience over asset protection. The national CI policy reflects a hybrid approach that combines elements of both CIP and CIR, focusing on system resilience over asset protection. Legislation and government directives have often required the identification of critical systems and assets for enhanced protection against threats, leading to complexities in practice. The national CI policy emphasizes system resilience over asset protection, requiring the identification of critical systems and assets for enhanced protection against threats. Inventory requirements are a key step in broader risk management strategies for critical infrastructure protection. The definitional criteria of criticality remain a subject of debate, but list/no-list decisions help define specific critical assets in practice. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in February 2003, is an early example of a CIP-based inventory requirement. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in February 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities and build a comprehensive database. This was followed by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in December 2003, which laid the foundation for critical infrastructure policy development until it was replaced by PPD-21 in 2013. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) in 2003 directed federal departments to coordinate protection of critical infrastructure to prevent deliberate destruction. A 2006 DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in compiling a national database of critical assets, which grew rapidly to include diverse assets like nuclear power plants and petting zoos. The 2006 DHS Inspector General report found that the National Asset Database grew rapidly from 2003 to 2006, including a wide range of assets from nuclear power plants to petting zoos. The report highlighted issues with the database, such as listing unusual assets without clear criticality and inconsistent data collection procedures. Congress later included provisions for the database in the 9-11 Commission Act, requiring compilation of vital assets and a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure. The legislation mandates the creation of a national database of vital systems and a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure. The Secretary determines assets that could cause catastrophic effects if disrupted. Quality control procedures are required to ensure asset nominations meet criticality thresholds. The 2013 GAO report noted improvements in critical asset identification processes but raised concerns about reporting criteria and methodology. The 2013 GAO report highlighted ongoing concerns with the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP), including changes in nomination and adjudication criteria. Methodological adjustments were made to assess criticality based on potential adverse consequences, such as fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. Unique characteristics of critical infrastructure were taken into account, like the potential second-order effects of a collapse in the U.S. financial system. The report also mentioned the importance of assessing election infrastructure used in federal elections. The report highlighted concerns with the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) and recommended an independent peer review for asset nomination vetting methods. Being listed as a prioritized asset in the NCIPP elevates its national significance, impacting various government activities. The exact number of nominated assets is classified. The 2013 GAO report found that some state governments were opting not to participate in DHS data calls for the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. States cited a lack of expertise in developing scenarios and modeling complex infrastructure systems, leading to an incomplete national inventory of critical systems and assets. DHS was also unable to provide documentation showing compliance with statutory reporting requirements in recent years. The GAO found that DHS was unable to provide documentation for compliance with statutory reporting requirements in recent years. The complexities of CI inventory suggest persistent difficulties in ensuring the completeness and quality of centralized inventories of CI assets. The Critical Infrastructure Resilience prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities for continuity of service during stress on infrastructure systems. This approach expands data collection to include all assets within a sector for emergency planning, regardless of their inclusion on a specific list. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) is a major CI interagency database used to identify alternative means of maintaining critical functions and providing essential services if usual systems are compromised. It is compiled by lead agencies like DHS, DOD, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and U.S. Geological Survey, with data from public and private sector partners available to eligible organizations. HIFLD consists of numerous data layers curated by designated partner agencies, encompassing various asset categories relevant to homeland security functions. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database contains various asset categories relevant to homeland security functions, curated by designated partner agencies. It includes critical assets supporting lifeline CI functions like energy, communications, transportation, and water systems. Additionally, HIFLD includes non-critical asset categories that may become critical in specific emergencies or CI policy decisions. For example, during the 2017 hurricane season, the Department of Health and Human Services used HIFLD to locate day care centers in impacted areas, which may not be defined as critical under common statutory definitions of critical infrastructure. The HIFLD partnership model enables relevant agencies to access infrastructure data for real-world use cases, such as locating day care centers in disaster zones to ensure children's safety. Unlike the NCIPP list, HIFLD does not elevate specific systems and assets to support federal oversight, but it is widely used for preparedness and incident management. The HIFLD partnership model provides infrastructure data for real-world use cases, such as locating day care centers in disaster zones for children's safety. It is widely used for preparedness and incident management by federal and SLTT agencies. CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant, as seen in provisions of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act related to national preparedness against electromagnetic threats. Chemical manufacturing facilities posing high risks are subject to DHS inspection and regulatory enforcement under Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. Chemical manufacturing facilities at high risk for malicious exploitation are regulated under the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) by DHS. Congress may need to consider the impact of shifting towards system-level resilience on legacy programs like NCIPP. Stakeholder participation in NCIPP may require additional funding for data gathering and analysis. Updates to the National Asset Database requirements should also be considered by Congress. Efforts to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems and assets are part of a national initiative to understand homeland security risks. Congress may need to update National Asset Database requirements to align with emerging CISA programs and other authorized programs. Risk assessments inform resource allocation decisions for congressional appropriations, emergency preparedness, regulatory oversight, grant funding, and security measures by infrastructure owner-operators. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents, events, or occurrences, determined by likelihood and consequences. Risk components include threat, vulnerability, and consequence, with threat defined as potential harm to life, information, operations, environment, or property. Threat assessments consider human adversaries or natural hazards like extreme weather events. Vulnerability assessments provide information on characteristics that make assets or systems susceptible to exploitation or damage from threats or hazards, including human adversaries or natural hazards like extreme weather events. Likelihood and severity of event occurrence are estimated using past data and predictive modeling. Assessments identify vulnerabilities in assets or systems that could be exploited or damaged. Recommendations for resilience measures are provided to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Consequence is defined as the impact of an event. Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events on infrastructure systems. Various technical and non-technical methods are used for these assessments, developed by research centers, universities, and industry groups. Modeling methodologies inform security investments and activities of federal agencies and SLTT jurisdictions. Since 2007, DHS has utilized risk elements of threat, vulnerability, and consequence in planning, programs, and budget activities. Critics question the formula's accuracy in assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks and the independence of its terms. DHS recognized the need for a complete systemic risk picture for critical infrastructure in 2018 and proposed updates to risk assessment approaches. Legislative and executive branch initiatives in 2018-2019 established the basis for significant changes, including the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to take over functions related to CI risk assessment. The CISA Act of 2018 established the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within DHS to manage national critical infrastructure (CI) risk. CISA created the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to focus on cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented approaches to CI risk management. Congress can request information on CISA's efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods. The Homeland Security Act specifies how the Secretary of Homeland Security may leverage organizational resources for infrastructure risk assessment methodology. Federal organization to address CI issues has evolved in response to threats, with three distinct periods of development outlined. Congress can establish funding priorities and program guidance for organizations supporting national CI security goals. The evolution of federal organization to address critical infrastructure (CI) issues has occurred in response to evolving threats. Three distinct periods of development are covered: initial policy development in the late 1990s, post-9/11 reorganization to counter terrorist threats, and the ongoing transition to an all-hazards resilience framework for infrastructure security. Federal attention to CI policy increased in the 1990s due to concerns about cyber threats to infrastructure, leading to the establishment of the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996 and the issuance of PDD-63 two years later. The Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection focused on emerging cyber threats and led to the issuance of PDD-63, which required the government to eliminate vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures. The directives in PDD-63 aimed to increase interagency coordination, with the creation of the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-Terrorism. A blue ribbon commission was later chartered by Congress to assess terrorist threats and the implementation of PDD-63. The Gilmore Commission, chartered by Congress in 1999, found that the implementation of PDD-63 was incomplete and the CIP enterprise had developed slowly since 1998. The ISACs, created to increase risk awareness, were still in early stages. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism lacked program and budget authority, and there was no overall national CIP strategy in place. The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) lacked program and budget authority, with no overall national CIP strategy in place. The 9/11 attacks spurred urgent policy initiatives for homeland security and critical infrastructure protection, leading to legislative actions to reestablish the Office of Homeland Security with additional responsibilities and oversight. The first option proposed reestablishing the Office of Homeland Security with added budget authorities and oversight, focusing on interagency coordination for better protection against terrorist attacks. The second option suggested consolidating all counterterrorism functions under a new agency called the National Homeland Security Agency, following recommendations from the Hart-Rudman Commission. Key supporters in Congress believed in centralizing homeland security functions for more effective protection. The Hart-Rudman Commission, chartered by DOD in 1998, advocated for consolidation of homeland security functions to enhance executive authority and interagency coordination. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, reflecting the Commission's approach, transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS from various sectors. The creation of DHS was designated as high risk by GAO. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003 incorporated nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates, prioritizing homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism. This represented a shift in infrastructure policy, as the White House had previously viewed Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) as only tangentially related to homeland security. The White House's view on Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) changed post-9/11, with CIP being seen as separate but related to counterterrorism efforts. Infrastructure risks were deemed diverse, including terrorism, equipment failure, human error, weather, natural disasters, and criminal activity. CIP funding overlapping with counterterrorism was minimal. After 9/11, the White House increased funding for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) to align with counterterrorism efforts. The budget for FY2004 saw a significant increase to $12.1 billion, a 450% rise from pre-9/11 levels, reflecting the newfound importance of counterterrorism priorities across federal departments and agencies. The 2003 OMB report highlighted infrastructure programs' direct impact on combating terrorism, leading to increased funding for various federal entities. The FY2004 budget for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) increased to $12.1 billion, a 450% rise from pre-9/11 levels. The creation of DHS redefined CIP as a counterterrorism mission, consolidating funding under unified leadership. Independent agencies transferred to DHS retained operational independence. Despite significant changes, Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) remains a highly distributed enterprise competing for limited resources across the federal government. Counterterrorism continued to be a focal point for CIP policy, but public perception of the terrorist threat had softened considerably by the time Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005. Public concern about terrorism in the United States significantly decreased after the 9/11 attacks, with only periodic upticks due to high-profile incidents. By 2019, terrorism was no longer listed as a top category of public concern in Gallup surveys. The failure of critical systems during Hurricane Katrina highlighted vulnerabilities to various hazards beyond terrorism, leading to renewed policy concerns about equipment failure, human error, weather disasters, and criminal activity. In 2006, the Critical Infrastructure Task Force of the Homeland Security Advisory Council raised concerns about the government's focus on protecting assets from terrorist attacks rather than improving resilience against various threats. The House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings in 2008 addressing resilience, with DHS officials arguing that government policies did promote resilience alongside protection. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) highlighted the diversity of missions and stakeholders in the expansive enterprise of DHS. It emphasized the importance of preventing terrorist attacks while also addressing threats such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational crime, and contagious diseases. The 2010 QHSR emphasized DHS's leadership in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other homeland security missions. It highlighted the decentralized nature of homeland security, involving diverse stakeholders in the public and private sector. PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7 in 2013, focusing on all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience over physical asset protection against terrorist threats. The 2013 NIPP placed less emphasis on physical infrastructure protection against terrorist threats compared to HSPD-7. It emphasized all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience as part of national disaster preparedness. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include factors like aging and neglect of systems. DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017, leaving no current departmental-level strategic direction statement. The 2017 QHSR was not submitted to Congress as required, leaving no current departmental-level statement on DHS strategic direction and priorities for infrastructure security. Negotiations continue on critical infrastructure security responsibilities and definitions among various stakeholders. Congress authorized the transfer of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center back to USDA in 2018. In 2018, Congress authorized the transfer of a replacement facility back to USDA from DHS, emphasizing an all-hazards approach to critical infrastructure security. The federal government's critical infrastructure security has evolved into a distributed enterprise model structured by partnerships and policy frameworks. Congress may need to determine which aspects of critical infrastructure security belong to homeland security and which are related to commerce, trade, and public utilities regulation. The evolving landscape of critical infrastructure security involves a distributed enterprise model based on partnerships and policy frameworks. Congress may need to clarify the boundaries between homeland security and other infrastructure-related responsibilities. DHS has not provided a top-level strategy to Congress since 2014, raising the need for a current strategy to define Departmental goals and activities related to critical infrastructure security. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) passed the House of Representatives unanimously and was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The proposed act aims to enhance DHS's strategy by linking it more directly with budgeting, program management, and prioritization, among other provisions. Congress has periodically acted to define organizational relationships within DHS. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has evolved from a centralized directorate structure to a more federated one, emphasizing the operational role of its components. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS in 2018. Congress may consider the centralization or federation of DHS to best support critical infrastructure security. The management of privately owned critical infrastructure is crucial to national security. The management of critical infrastructure security is a key national security concern. The federated partnership model, outlined in PDD-63, emphasizes voluntary collaboration between public and private sectors to address infrastructure risk. CI owner-operators hold responsibility for assessing and mitigating risk at the enterprise level, while executive branch agencies manage risk at the national level. This collaborative approach guides investment in critical infrastructure security. Infrastructure risk management is a collaborative effort between public and private sectors, relying on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments in security. The responsibility for investments in critical infrastructure security lies with private individuals or entities, but serious risks are shared collectively by the public and business community. The partnership structure involves government and private-sector representatives determining necessary security investments to manage infrastructure risk at the societal level. The challenge lies in determining who should bear the upfront costs of investment. The responsibility for investments in critical infrastructure security lies with private individuals or entities, but the federal government relies on the private sector to voluntarily develop CI risk management strategies and mitigation investments. Government efforts to encourage voluntary investments in infrastructure resilience through public-private partnerships have varied in extent and effectiveness. Government efforts to encourage voluntary investments in infrastructure resilience through public-private partnerships have varied in extent and effectiveness, particularly for low-probability/high-consequence events like terrorist attacks or earthquakes. Industry participation is driven by improved access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence critical infrastructure policy. Congress has taken steps to facilitate information sharing between sectors through the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. The OECD report in 2019 highlighted that voluntary information sharing partnerships may not provide enough incentive for investments in resilience. Regulatory mandates are often used in critical infrastructure sectors with potentially catastrophic incident impacts, such as nuclear meltdowns or gas pipeline explosions. Regulatory mandates are favored for critical infrastructure sectors with potentially catastrophic incident impacts, such as nuclear meltdowns or gas pipeline explosions. Collaborative approaches apply as risks become more privatized, and policymakers aim to limit government regulation within the CI security enterprise. The Homeland Security Act established DHS with broad responsibilities but narrow regulatory mandates. The Homeland Security Act established DHS with broad responsibilities, including oversight of oil and gas pipeline security by TSA, port security by the Coast Guard, and regulation of chemical facilities by CISA to prevent terrorist exploitation. Other agencies like the NRC regulate civilian nuclear facilities with safety and reporting requirements. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates civilian nuclear facilities, enforcing safety requirements traceable to the Three Mile Island incident in 1979. Infrastructure security relevant to homeland security, such as protection against deliberate attacks, is overseen by the NRC, not DHS. Lessons learned from past experiences have led to the separation of regulatory and partnership roles in agencies like NIPC. DHS focuses on enhancing voluntary collaboration in its infrastructure security programs. The DHS infrastructure security programs focus on enhancing voluntary collaboration with partners through information sharing, analysis, training, and coordination capabilities. Current CI partnership structures are organized under the authority of PPD-21 and implemented through sector and cross-sector partnership structures described in the 2013 NIPP. The 2013 NIPP emphasizes distributed responsibility among stakeholders committed to common national resilience goals. NIPP partnerships at the federal level are administered by CISA in partnership with other DHS components. The NIPP partnerships at the federal level are administered by CISA in collaboration with other DHS components and federal departments. Each of the 16 CI sectors has its own Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) to enable coordination on infrastructure issues. DHS leads or co-leads 10 of the 16 GCCs as the Sector-Specific Agency (SSA), with other agencies like EPA, GSA, and various departments also serving as SSAs. The Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) work with Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) to develop infrastructure protection plans tailored to each Critical Infrastructure (CI) sector. These plans analyze sector risks, interdependencies, and stakeholders to establish resilience goals. SCCs consist of private-sector organizations recognized by Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) as representative of their sector. Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are self-organized and self-governed groups recognized by Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) as representative of their sector. They have advisory relationships with the federal government, facilitate information sharing between government and private-sector stakeholders, and support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) specific to their sector. The National Council of ISACs currently lists 24 member organizations. Reliable data on private-sector participation in SCC activities across Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors is limited. Private-sector participation in Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) activities varies across Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups with broad interests. The State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal Government Coordinating Council (SLTTGCC) enhances infrastructure resilience partnerships. The Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council coordinates issues among private-sector stakeholders. The Regional Consortium Coordinating Council promotes sharing best practices among regional CI resilience coalitions. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) oversees cross-sector councils, coordinates CI risk management strategies, and collaborates with international partners. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) organizes certain discussions among NIPP partnership councils. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) facilitates discussions on sensitive infrastructure security topics, providing legal exemptions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations. CIPAC engages government and private-sector stakeholders to develop policy advice for DHS. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) advises the Secretary of Homeland Security on security matters. Members are appointed by the Secretary and include leaders from various sectors. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) advises the Secretary of Homeland Security on security matters, with members appointed by the Secretary from various sectors. The committee may establish subcommittees to focus on specific homeland security issues, such as cybersecurity and emerging technologies. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council consists of senior industry leaders who advise the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy, serving as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council was established in 2001 to facilitate consultation between public and private sector representatives at the highest levels of government. It monitors critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils and encourages risk management practices. The partnership structure is flat and includes various activities like symposia, research collaborations, and emergency preparedness. Participation involves governmental and non-governmental stakeholders from multiple sectors to address interdependencies in complex infrastructure systems. The partnership structure for critical infrastructure involves various non-governmental stakeholders from multiple sectors, emphasizing system resilience. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) within DHS serves as a centralized hub for information sharing, threat analysis, training, and decision support for private sector partners. Additionally, the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) plays a key role in cybersecurity operations. The Operations Center is the principal hub for the Department of Homeland Security, while the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) monitors cybersecurity incidents. CISA oversees both the NICC and the NCCIC, aiming to promote information sharing and trust between the public and private sectors for system-level resilience. The partnership system encourages private sector collaboration and participation in federal initiatives. The current partnership system encourages private sector collaboration in federal initiatives to reduce public risk. Legislative remedies may be needed for more effective investments in risk reduction across diverse critical infrastructure sectors. Empirical analyses on collaboration effectiveness within the voluntary framework are limited. The private sector plays a key role in critical infrastructure protection through strong communities of interest and partnerships with the government. Challenges include barriers to information sharing, sharing assessment results, and evaluating partnership performance. The private sector is crucial in critical infrastructure protection, with challenges in sharing information, assessing results, and evaluating partnership performance. DHS lacks systematic data collection on industry participation in security surveys and effectiveness of security improvements. GAO highlighted the need for measures to assess partnership effectiveness in meeting resilience goals. Congress may need to review DHS's progress in implementing corrective measures. The effectiveness of industry information sharing and investments in risk reduction for critical infrastructure resilience needs to be systematically assessed. Congress should review the progress of DHS in implementing data gathering and analysis initiatives recommended by GAO to better understand the impact of partnership programs. Reliable data on public-private partnership programs is lacking, hindering the evaluation of their effectiveness in promoting bidirectional information sharing and private investments in national resilience. Congress should address this gap by introducing appropriate reporting measures. Congress may address gaps in program effectiveness by introducing appropriate reporting requirements and enhancing regulatory authorities of federal departments and agencies to meet national critical infrastructure resilience goals. For example, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 expands jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting the trade system. Congress should also exercise oversight where regulatory authorities related to infrastructure security exist but are not utilized, such as in the case of TSA. CISA plans to maintain sector-specific public-private partnerships for information sharing and policy coordination. Congress may need to consider adjusting these structures to align with the federal risk management approach emphasizing inter-sectoral analysis and resilience."
