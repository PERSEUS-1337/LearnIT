    "content": "The transatlantic partnership between the United States and Europe is based on common values, interests, and goals. Both sides are interdependent in terms of security, prosperity, and addressing global challenges such as economic concerns, terrorism, and armed conflict. Supporters argue that close cooperation is necessary as neither side can tackle these issues alone. The relationship also includes a significant trade and investment partnership. The United States and Europe have a strong partnership based on common values and interests. They share a significant trade and investment relationship. The U.S. Congress frequently engages with European legislators on various economic, security, and diplomatic issues. Members of Congress assess the benefits and challenges of transatlantic cooperation in their legislative activities. Many lawmakers support a close relationship with the European Union. Many Members of Congress support a close transatlantic relationship with the European Union and NATO to advance U.S. interests. Concerns arise when U.S. and European policy positions conflict, but overall, NATO and the EU have been successful in promoting prosperity. The EU has become increasingly important for the US as a key partner in decision-making and policy formulation across various areas, including economic, social, law enforcement, and judicial matters. The strong support for NATO and the EU by the US Congress and Administrations has been instrumental in fostering democratic states, reliable military allies, and strong trading partners in Europe. The EU and NATO play crucial roles in decision-making and policy formulation across various areas. The EU focuses on economic, social, law enforcement, and judicial matters, while NATO remains the primary security institution in the Euro-Atlantic community. The US Congress maintains a significant interest in NATO, which has added 12 new member states since the end of the Cold War. Discussions about NATO's future role and capabilities continue, especially in light of recent conflicts like the one in Ukraine. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions. EU-wide elections selected MEPs for a new term, with Martin Schulz reelected as President of the European Parliament. Jens Stoltenberg became the new Secretary General of NATO, and Jean-Claude Juncker took over as President of the European Commission. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions. Martin Schulz was reelected as President of the European Parliament, Jens Stoltenberg became the new Secretary General of NATO, and Jean-Claude Juncker took over as President of the European Commission for a term of five years. Federica Mogherini replaced Catherine Ashton as the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Donald Tusk became the new President of the European Council. Polls show favorable European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under the Obama Administration compared to the George W. Bush Administration, with constructive transatlantic relations and common approaches to global challenges. The challenges faced by the United States and Europe have led to a push for common approaches, but both sides have encountered frustrations and reality checks. The crisis in Ukraine has caused U.S. policymakers to rethink assumptions about European security, with the U.S. continuing to play a leading role in NATO and managing relations with Russia. There are expectations for Europe to share the burden in addressing global challenges, as the U.S. focuses on Asia and the Middle East. Despite positive examples of transatlantic cooperation, U.S. officials are concerned about Europe's economic difficulties, declining defense spending, and questions about its ability to deliver a coherent foreign policy. The partnership faces challenges due to changing political dynamics within the EU and its member states. The European financial crisis post-2008 global downturn exposed unresolved issues in EU integration, leading to tensions among member states. Anti-establishment sentiment is rising as traditional parties struggle to address economic and social problems, with populist parties gaining strength across Europe. The rise of anti-establishment sentiment in Europe has led to the growth of populist parties advocating far-right and far-left policies, many of which are anti-EU. These parties won a significant portion of votes in the 2014 European Parliament election and the trend will be further tested in upcoming national elections in various European countries. The rise of anti-establishment sentiment in Europe has led to the growth of populist parties advocating far-right and far-left policies, many of which are anti-EU. These parties won a significant portion of votes in the 2014 European Parliament election and will be further tested in upcoming national elections in Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Portugal, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The UK elections, in particular, are expected to have major implications related to a possible national referendum on the EU membership. The deterioration of U.S. and European relations with Russia became a predominant issue in 2014, transforming Russia from a \"strategic partner\" to a \"strategic problem.\" The rise of anti-establishment sentiment in Europe has led to the growth of populist parties advocating far-right and far-left policies, many of which are anti-EU. These parties won a significant portion of votes in the 2014 European Parliament election and will be further tested in upcoming national elections in Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Portugal, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The UK elections, in particular, are expected to have major implications related to a possible national referendum on the EU membership. The deterioration of U.S. and European relations with Russia has transformed Russia from a \"strategic partner\" to a \"strategic problem\" of uncertain dimensions. Relations between Russia and the West have been marked by tension for over a decade, with resentment towards NATO enlargement and U.S.-European support for Kosovo's independence. The 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia further strained relations. The Obama Administration sought to improve relations through a \"reset\" initiative, leading to cooperation on Afghanistan and Iran, the signing of the New START treaty, and temporary easing of tensions on missile defense plans. The U.S. and European objections towards Russia persisted due to various issues, including Russia's recognition of Georgia's Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions as independent countries and its suspension of obligations under the CFE Treaty. Tensions escalated as criticism of Russia's 2011-2012 elections triggered backlash from Moscow, especially with the adoption of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012. Russia's relationship with the U.S. and Europe deteriorated as Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency. The political crisis in Ukraine in late 2013 led to a chain of events that strained relations between the U.S., Europe, and Russia. Russia pressured Ukrainian President Yanukovych to reject an EU agreement, leading to his ousting in 2014. This marked a low point in U.S. and European relations with Russia. In February 2014, Ukrainian President Yanukovych was ousted after protests against turning away from the EU. Russian forces then seized Crimea, justifying the annexation by historical ties and protecting the population's will to join Russia. The annexation of Crimea by Russian forces in 2014, following the ousting of Ukrainian President Yanukovych, was not recognized by the international community. The conflict in eastern Ukraine, involving self-proclaimed republics and Ukrainian military, has resulted in over 4,300 deaths despite a ceasefire agreement. Western governments accuse Russia of involvement with clear evidence of Russian military units. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has resulted in over 4,300 deaths despite a ceasefire agreement. Western governments accuse Russia of direct involvement in the conflict, including providing heavy weapons and small arms to separatists. The U.S. and European coordination in responding to the situation has been strong, with aligned analyses and mutual sanctions. Russia denies providing more than political and humanitarian support to the separatists. The EU expanded sanctions on Russia after the shooting down of MH17 in 2014, leading to debates over the economic and political implications due to strong trade relationships. US policymakers express frustration with the EU's decision-making process. The EU expanded sanctions on Russia after the shooting down of MH17 in 2014, leading to debates over economic and political implications. US policymakers express frustration with EU decision-making process. Despite skepticism, all 28 EU member states unanimously adopted sanctions on Russia, believing it was necessary to send a strong message to Russia's leadership. Sanctions are reviewed monthly and require unanimous consensus for renewal. Russia's economy has entered recession in recent months. In July 2015, sectoral sanctions on Russia will need unanimous renewal. The country's economy is in recession due to a weakened ruble and high inflation, partly blamed on low oil prices and Western sanctions. Uncertainty surrounds Russia's foreign policy amid speculation on its next moves in eastern Ukraine, from maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" to seeking de-escalation. Analysts consider a major Russian invasion unlikely but not impossible. Analysts believe a significant Russian invasion to expand separatist territory or connect to Crimea is improbable but not impossible. In January 2015, EU proposed easing sanctions if Russia complies with ceasefire agreement. With Putin likely to remain in power, U.S. and European relations with Russia will continue to be a key focus. Members of the 114th Congress are closely monitoring Russia's foreign policy intentions, particularly in relation to Ukraine. They may consider implementing additional sanctions and cooperating with European counterparts. Congress is also interested in supporting Ukraine, as seen with the $291 million in aid provided in 2014. Additional assistance of $139 million is planned for Ukraine in the FY2015 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The FY2015 Omnibus Appropriations Act includes $139 million in bilateral assistance for Ukraine, along with funds from other accounts. The Ukraine Freedom Support Act authorizes $350 million in military assistance, including lethal weapons, but the Administration has not provided lethal aid yet. The EU has pledged over \u20ac11 billion in development assistance and loans to Ukraine between 2014 and 2020. Both the US and the EU support IMF and World Bank assistance programs for Ukraine. Developments in Ukraine have reinvigorated debates about the future of NATO and altered the trajectory of the U.S. outlook on European defense issues. Russia's actions in Ukraine have driven calls for NATO to focus on collective territorial defense. European countries are pledging increases in defense spending and seeking to develop military capabilities in response to Russian aggression. The Obama Administration has reassured European allies of the U.S. commitment to collective defense. The Obama Administration has implemented the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) in response to Russian aggression, providing $810 million for troop rotations and military equipment in Eastern Europe. The U.S. military presence in Europe under ERI is rotational, with plans to close 15 bases in January 2015. The United States has no plans to permanently increase military personnel in Europe, despite closing 15 bases in 2015 as part of cost-cutting measures. Concerns exist about declining European defense budgets and a growing transatlantic military capabilities gap, potentially undermining NATO unity. European militaries lack important capabilities like strategic air- and sealift. European militaries have limited capabilities such as strategic air- and sealift, aerial refueling, helicopters, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Efforts like NATO's \"Smart Defense\" initiative aim to pool resources for shared capabilities, but results have been modest. NATO's relevance is debated between focusing on out-of-area operations or collective territorial defense. The 2010 NATO summit's Strategic Concept reflects both perspectives. The 2010 NATO summit's Strategic Concept emphasizes collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. It calls for developing capabilities for expeditionary operations and addressing unconventional security challenges like terrorism, cybersecurity, and energy security. However, concerns exist about public opposition to combat operations, political will, and resource shortages in Europe. Some European countries may be less willing to engage in large-scale missions overseas due to public opposition, lack of political will, and resource shortages. The security outlook in Europe has shifted towards concerns about the threat posed by Russia, leading to calls for permanent basing of U.S. and NATO forces in countries like Poland and the Baltic states. The European Reassurance Initiative involves rotating forces, increased exercises, and pre-positioning of assets to enhance security in the region, such as tripling the number of fighter aircraft in the Baltic Air Policing mission. At NATO's 2014 Summit in Wales, member countries agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" for collective defense, including measures in Central and Eastern Europe like enhanced infrastructure and a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) of 4,000 soldiers capable of deploying within days to respond to threats. At NATO's 2014 Summit in Wales, member countries agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" for collective defense, including a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) of 4,000 soldiers capable of deploying within days to respond to threats. Allied leaders also pledged to increase defense spending to 2% of national GDP within a decade. Tensions between the EU and Russia have raised concerns about European energy security due to the region's heavy dependence on Russian gas imports. Russia's use of energy supplies as a tool of foreign policy has raised concerns about European energy security. Moscow has pursued bilateral energy deals with European countries and acquired significant ownership of European energy infrastructure. Analysts criticize Russia for not adhering to Western standards of transparency and market reciprocity. The possibility of gas cutoffs, as seen in past disputes with Ukraine, is a major worry for countries reliant on Russian gas supplies. Many U.S. officials and Members of Congress view European energy security as a critical issue. Europe faces challenges in diversifying its energy supply away from Russian natural gas, with North Africa seen as a potential alternative but hindered by political and economic instability. Central Asia has also been considered for increased supply, but progress has been limited. The EU faces challenges in diversifying its energy supply away from Russian natural gas. Political and economic instability in North Africa and Central Asia have hindered the expansion of alternative energy sources. European leaders are working on a common energy strategy and initiatives to liberalize the internal energy market. Recent events in Ukraine and Crimea have added urgency to these efforts. The EU is working to integrate the internal European energy market by expanding grids and pipelines. Recent events in Ukraine and Crimea have increased the urgency for such efforts. Some European countries have built LNG terminals and improved pipeline interconnectivity to mitigate the impact of a crisis. There is a proposal for an EU \"energy union\" to centralize natural gas purchases for all members and provide solidarity mechanisms in case of supply disruptions. Legislation for more competition in the energy market had already been adopted before the Ukraine crisis. Before recent events in Ukraine, the EU had adopted legislation to introduce competition and transparency in the energy sector by unbundling gas production ownership and requiring an independent operator of transit systems. Russia canceled the South Stream project, a pipeline bypassing Ukraine, due to EU bureaucratic obstacles and criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. Russia canceled the South Stream pipeline project due to frustration with EU bureaucratic obstacles and criticism over actions in Ukraine. Russia is diversifying its gas markets by partnering with China and Turkey. The US and Europe are working together to combat the Islamic State through military action and financial targeting. NATO member countries are actively involved in these efforts. European countries, including NATO members Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, have participated in coalition airstrikes against IS in Iraq. They have also provided trainers, advisers, weapons, non-lethal equipment, and humanitarian aid to Kurdish forces in Iraq. European military action against IS has been limited to Iraq due to political and legal challenges in Syria. The EU, alongside the United States, has condemned the Assad government and sought to stop the civil war in Syria. Since 2011, over 191,000 people have died in Syria. The EU, along with the United States, has condemned the Assad government and imposed sanctions. In 2012, the EU recognized the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. European support for opposition forces has mainly been non-lethal aid and training. Concerns about terrorism in Europe were heightened after the 2015 attacks in Paris. The 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris by individuals claiming allegiance to al Qaeda and the Islamic State raised concerns about Europe's vulnerability to terrorism. Authorities conducted raids to dismantle an Islamic State-linked terrorist cell in Belgium. Analysts and European governments are worried about \"foreign fighters,\" European citizens or residents of Muslim background joining conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Estimates suggest 3,000 to 5,000 individuals from Europe and other Western countries are involved, with significant EU countries of origin including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The conflict in Syria has attracted fighters from countries with large Muslim populations in the Balkans, as well as from Russia. Authorities are concerned that these fighters may return home with extremist views, enhanced training, and the intention of carrying out terrorist attacks in Europe. European governments are addressing security concerns by increasing surveillance and combating terrorist recruitment. Arrests have been made in EU countries of individuals suspected of planning to travel to Syria or recruiting others to do so. European governments are taking measures to combat terrorist recruitment and prevent travel to conflict zones like Syria. This includes arresting suspects, confiscating passports, detaining returning fighters, and setting up hotlines for concerned family members. However, challenges remain in tracking European fighters and coordinating a unified EU approach due to differing views on issues like intelligence-sharing and civil liberties. The Paris attacks have sparked new debates within EU institutions on enhancing security and surveillance powers, including the proposal for an EU airline passenger name record system. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong since 9/11, with regular dialogues between U.S. and European officials on homeland security and counterterrorism. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism between the U.S. and EU has been robust, with agreements on extradition, mutual legal assistance, container security, and airline passenger data sharing. Both parties actively collaborate on tracking and countering terrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force and the U.S.-EU \"SWIFT agreement.\" The U.S. and EU have strong counterterrorism cooperation, including agreements on extradition, legal assistance, and data sharing. However, tensions exist over data privacy concerns in information-sharing arrangements. The EU values data privacy as a basic right and has strict regulations protecting personal data, leading to complications and delays in adopting certain agreements. The EU delayed adopting the SWIFT deal and sharing airline passenger data with the US. The US and EU have aligned their lists of terrorist organizations, with the EU adding Hezbollah's military wing in 2013. Critics argue that listing only the military wing is insufficient. In 2014, the EU General Court ruled that Hamas should be removed from the EU's list. In December 2014, the EU General Court ruled that Hamas should be removed from the EU's list of designated terrorist organizations due to procedural grounds. The EU External Action Service stated that this ruling was not a political decision and sanctions against Hamas will remain in place. The US and Israel urged the EU to maintain sanctions against Hamas, while Congress has been interested in international efforts to ensure Iran's nuclear program is used for peaceful purposes. Europe has played a key role in these efforts, with close transatlantic cooperation on Iran's nuclear program. Iran's nuclear program for peaceful purposes has seen close transatlantic cooperation, with the EU playing a central role. The EU, along with the US, Russia, and China, formed the P5+1 group for negotiations with Iran. From 2006 to 2010, the EU-3 and the US pushed for UN sanctions on Iran, and since 2010, the EU has imposed independent sanctions. This shift by the EU has aligned US and European sanctions policies on Iran, including an embargo on Iranian oil in 2012. European sanctions policy on Iran aligned with the US, including an embargo on Iranian oil in 2012. The EU imposed restrictions on nuclear technology, natural gas, arms, financial transactions, and business activities with Iran. Sanctions also included enhanced inspection requirements for Iranian vessels and aircraft, visa bans, and asset freezes on individuals and entities involved in Iran's nuclear program. Following the election of Hassan Rouhani as Iran's president in June 2013, tensions eased, leading to the P5+1 and Iran agreeing to a Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in November 2013. The JPA aims to reach a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program, requiring Iran to freeze some activities and cooperate with monitoring by the IAEA in exchange for limited sanctions relief. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) between the P5+1 and Iran, agreed upon in November 2013, involves Iran freezing some nuclear activities and allowing monitoring by the IAEA in exchange for limited sanctions relief. Relief measures include financial benefits and suspensions on certain trade restrictions. The terms of the JPA have been extended twice, with negotiations ongoing for a final agreement amidst remaining differences and concerns about Iran's nuclear capabilities. The EU-3 foreign ministers and EU High Representative oppose new U.S. sanctions during negotiations with Iran, fearing it could disrupt talks. The U.S., EU, Russia, and UN are part of a quartet mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, advocating for a two-state solution. The EU supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing the need for a sustainable Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel. European officials have urged greater U.S. engagement in peace talks, but recent conflicts and unilateral actions have hindered progress. Israeli concerns about international isolation have grown due to diverging European views on the issue. In January 2015, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman highlighted European support for Palestinians as a top diplomatic challenge. Several European countries and the European Parliament passed resolutions in support of recognizing a Palestinian state. Israel is worried about reduced economic cooperation with the EU, its largest trading partner, due to debates on Palestinian statehood recognition. The EU's concerns about Palestinian statehood recognition and potential actions against Israeli settlements have raised worries in Israel about economic cooperation with its largest trading partner. Some analysts believe these measures may not pose a significant economic threat, as no European government supports boycotting Israel, and the EU is unlikely to take actions that would substantially harm Israel's economy. The EU is unlikely to sanction Israel, focusing instead on motivating peace talks. Financial incentives and an upgrade in ties may be offered to both Israel and the Palestinians in case of a successful peace agreement. The US and EU have a significant trade relationship, generating $5 trillion annually and providing millions of jobs. The economic relationship between the United States and Europe is significant, with trade totaling $787 billion in 2013. U.S. and European companies are major investors in each other's markets, with U.S. global investment heavily focused on Europe. The transatlantic economic relationship shapes global standards and regulations, with the U.S. and EU comprising 50% of global GDP and 40% of purchasing power parity. This partnership has historically driven efforts to liberalize world trade. The U.S. and EU are negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) to boost jobs and growth by reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Harmonizing regulations and standards could help define global standards and increase GDP. The TTIP is crucial for the U.S.-EU political relationship as it aims to define global standards and boost the transatlantic relationship. However, there is a risk of fallout if negotiations fail to address contentious differences or meet expectations. European opposition to TTIP has grown, particularly regarding investor-state dispute settlement provisions. Critics fear obstacles to finalizing a draft agreement by the end of 2015. The TTIP faces skepticism over investor-state dispute settlement provisions, which critics fear could limit the EU's regulatory abilities. Concerns also exist about the impact on data privacy, food labeling, and geographic protections. In the U.S., Congress is considering reauthorizing Trade Promotion Authority. President Obama requested reauthorization of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in July 2013, which Congress uses to set trade negotiating objectives and expedite certain trade agreements. The Eurozone crisis dominated European politics from 2010 to 2012, raising doubts about the sustainability of the monetary union without fiscal union. Observers predicted potential exits from the euro, leading to prolonged debates and disagreements among EU member states. The Eurozone crisis from 2010 to 2012 led to unprecedented steps by EU countries to address the crisis, including tightening fiscal rules, strengthening the banking sector, and creating sovereign rescue funds. Market confidence has improved since 2013, but analysts doubt the crisis is definitively over, suggesting that response measures have only temporarily stabilized the situation. Many analysts doubt that the Eurozone crisis is definitively over, as response measures have only temporarily stabilized the situation. Economic growth forecasts for 2015 are low, with high unemployment rates expected. Concerns also arise from a potential stand-off between the EU and the Syriza-led government in Greece over austerity terms. Some analysts warn of long-term economic stagnation in Europe. In January 2015, the ECB announced a massive stimulus program to purchase \u20ac1.1 trillion of bonds over 19 months. Concerns about Eurozone crisis affecting U.S. growth have been alleviated. Congress may still worry about Europe's economic impact on U.S. interests. NSA surveillance tensions strained transatlantic relations in 2013. In 2013, NSA surveillance tensions strained transatlantic relations due to reports of U.S. spying on EU offices and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. Concerns arose about the extent of U.S. surveillance operations and the balance between security and privacy rights. The NSA surveillance allegations in 2013 strained transatlantic relations, raising concerns about the balance between security and privacy rights. European leaders and citizens were dismayed by reports of potential privacy violations and security compromises. Criticism was particularly strong in Germany due to historical contexts of government surveillance. The fallout from these reports could impact U.S.-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy. The fallout from NSA surveillance allegations in 2013 strained transatlantic relations, impacting U.S.-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy. Reports exacerbated objections to agreements like SWIFT and PNR, leading to calls for suspension of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor agreement. Concerns were raised about U.S. surveillance activities affecting economic relations, including negotiations on the proposed TTIP. The fallout from NSA surveillance allegations in 2013 strained transatlantic relations, impacting U.S.-European cooperation on counterterrorism and data privacy. Reports exacerbated objections to agreements like SWIFT and PNR, leading to calls for suspension of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor agreement. The purported U.S. surveillance activities may have a wider effect on economic relations, including negotiations on the proposed TTIP. Some analysts believe tensions are manageable and do not pose a sustained threat to the overall transatlantic relationship, suggesting that much of the outrage expressed by European leaders is for domestic consumption. Officials highlight the cooperation between European security services and U.S. intelligence agencies in preventing terrorist attacks and serious crimes in Europe. The cooperation between U.S. and European intelligence and security services continues despite political tensions. The melting Arctic ice is leading to increased human activities in the region, impacting fisheries, tourism, research, and resource exploration. This may necessitate new shipping regulations and search and rescue capabilities. The United States will take over the chairmanship of the Arctic Council in May 2015. The Council, established in 1996, is a key forum for cooperation among the eight Arctic countries on issues such as regional development, the environment, emergency response, climate change, and natural resource extraction. The Arctic Council does not address security matters, but the region is seen as increasingly important. The Arctic Council, consisting of Norway, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Sweden, and Iceland, does not address security issues but is seen as geopolitically significant. Coastal states are willing to establish military presence in the region, with conflicting views on military roles. Russia is expanding its Arctic presence to protect its interests, causing concerns of spillover from tensions over Ukraine. NATO members within the Arctic Council have not reached a consensus on NATO's role in the region. China, along with other observer countries, has shown interest in the Arctic region. In 2014, the U.S. appointed Admiral Robert J. Papp, Jr. as the first Special Representative for the Arctic. The EU was denied full observer status due to objections by Canadian Inuits. Admiral Robert J. Papp, Jr., former Commandant of the Coast Guard, was appointed as the first U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic. He led the 2015-2017 U.S. chairmanship of the Arctic Council with a focus on stewardship of the Arctic Ocean, climate change, and economic issues."
