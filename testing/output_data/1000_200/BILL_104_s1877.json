The Act \"Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act\" defines key terms related to timber sales contracts in the Tongass National Forest, including board feet, contract, contracting officer, mid-market criteria, proportionality, and purchaser Ketchikan Pulp Company. Congress finds that a contract was signed in 1951 to harvest timber from the forest, with provisions for future timber supply for the purchaser's facilities. The legislation aims to ensure a sustainable timber supply for the purchaser's operations in the Tongass National Forest. A pulp mill is essential for creating jobs, utilizing low-grade wood, and maintaining the regional economy. The purchaser plans to enhance environmental practices at the mill. The purchaser plans to invest $200,000,000 in environmental improvements at the wastewater treatment facilities in Ketchikan, Alaska. The contract extension for 15 years is necessary for amortization of these projects, crucial for the city's economy and job base. Maintaining a long-term commitment to Ketchikan and southeast Alaska is among the purchaser's goals. The purchaser's goals include a commitment to Ketchikan and southeast Alaska, participation in land management planning, and adherence to sustainable forest resource principles. The purchaser's goals in southeast Alaska include sustainable contract volumes, protection of forest uses, compliance with environmental laws, exploration of new technology, and proper stewardship of Tongass National Forest assets in the national interest. The contract in the Tongass National Forest is extended by 15 years to achieve proper stewardship of assets, fair return for public timber, and balance among multiple interests for economic growth in southeast Alaska and the United States. The goal is to enhance forest health, sustainable harvest, and national economic benefits through fostering domestic forest product markets. The contract in the Tongass National Forest is extended by 15 years from June 30, 2004. The contract includes a sale offering plan detailing timber volume, location, and schedule. Volume requirements are provided in 5-year increments of 962,500,000 board feet for the purchaser to harvest. The Forest Service will provide the purchaser with timber until the next 5-year increment is due. The Forest Service will provide the purchaser with at least 192,500,000 board feet of timber per year to ensure a consistent supply for harvesting. The contracting officer will require the construction of roads by the purchaser in advance of the 5-year operating period to facilitate orderly harvest, and timber selected must meet mid-market criteria. The contracting officer will perform appraisals and designate rates for timber increments, ensuring they do not disadvantage the purchaser. The Forest Service will measure proportionality by management areas and acres. The Forest Service will measure proportionality by management areas and acres, allowing the purchaser to convert or replace their pulp mill with another facility. The unilateral termination clause is eliminated, and any contract modifications require mutual agreement. Effective Date for Contract Modification is specified. The Forest Service and purchaser can modify the contract without further Act of Congress. The modifications will take effect 45 days after the enactment of this Act. The contracting officer must make necessary changes to the contract to implement the modifications.
