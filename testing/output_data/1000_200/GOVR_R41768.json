    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws establish coverage terms that must be equal between mental health services and medical services, including limits, treatment restrictions, financial requirements, and covered benefits. The health reform law did not alter these requirements. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 did not change federal mental health parity requirements, which ensure equal coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services compared to medical and surgical services. The ACA expanded the applicability of federal parity law to additional plan types. The ACA expands federal parity law to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. QHPs offered through Exchanges must comply with federal parity law. The ACA expands federal parity law to include QHPs, individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. Medicaid managed care plans must partially comply with federal parity law for mental health and substance use disorder services. Federal parity law applies to Medicaid managed care plans, ensuring equal treatment for mental health and substance use disorder services compared to medical and surgical services. Small fully insured and self-insured plans are exempt from compliance. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid and Medicare are also not covered. The small employer exemption under the ACA remains in effect for employers with 2 to 50 employees, including \"groups of one.\" Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare, but copayments for Medicare Part B outpatient mental health services must be 20% of the Medicare-approved amount by 2014. The federal parity law aims to address disparities in coverage terms between mental health and substance use disorder services and medical services. While the ACA did not change the fundamental approach of the parity law, it did include provisions for mental health services to be 20% of the Medicare-approved amount by 2014. The ACA included broader changes for coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services through the establishment of Exchanges and Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP). The Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) under the ACA includes 10 categories of services, including mental health and substance use disorder services. Benefits must be of \"equal scope\" to those offered in a typical employer plan. The Department of Labor conducted a survey to determine these benefits. The Department of Labor released a report on employer-sponsored coverage to the HHS Secretary, finding that most health plans offer mental health and substance use disorder treatment. The ACA does not specify which services must be included in the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP), leaving it to the rulemaking process. The HHS Secretary has discretion to add benefits beyond the 10 required categories. In December 2011, HHS released an informational bulletin outlining a proposal for states to define Essential Health Benefits (EHB) using benchmark health insurance plans. States can choose from four options: the largest HMO, one of the three largest federal employee health plans, one of the three largest state employee health plans, or one of the three largest small group plans. The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to study the determination of Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The IOM released a report on the criteria and methods for determining the EHB, which does not recommend specific services. Plans are required to offer either the EHBP or the EHB under the ACA. The ACA mandates coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) for certain types of plans, including QHPs, new plans in the individual and small group markets, and Medicaid benchmark plans. The report by the Institute of Medicine on EHB criteria does not recommend specific services. The ACA requires QHPs, new plans in small and individual markets, and Medicaid benchmark plans to cover Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by January 1, 2014. Grandfathered and large group plans outside of Exchanges are exempt. Health reform law changes will expand coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, aligning them with medical and surgical services. Some coverage arrangements may not be required to include these services. The ACA requires plans to cover Essential Health Benefits, including mental health and substance use disorder services, aligning them with medical and surgical services. Some coverage arrangements may not be required to include these services, but broader requirements may lead to plans voluntarily offering them to be more competitive in the market."
