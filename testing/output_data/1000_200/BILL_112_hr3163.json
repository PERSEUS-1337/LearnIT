This new section, SEC. 303A, outlines the requirements for states permitting early voting. The \"Easy Voting Act of 2011\" requires states to provide a 14-day early voting period for federal elections starting January 1, 2012. This new section, SEC. 303A, sets out the guidelines for states allowing early voting. SEC. 303B prohibits states from requiring state-issued identification for voting or registering to vote. SEC. 303B prohibits election officials from mandating State-issued identification for voting or voter registration for Federal elections, effective January 1, 2012. SEC. 303C requires states to offer same-day voter registration and change of address services on election day. SEC. 303C mandates states to allow same-day voter registration and address changes on election day, bypassing certain requirements of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. States must allow individuals who move to a new address within the state to update their information at the polling place and cast a regular ballot for federal elections, bypassing the need for provisional ballots. This exception does not apply to states without voter registration requirements. States must allow individuals to update their information at the polling place for federal elections without the need for provisional ballots. Starting January 1, 2012, there is no voter registration requirement for individuals in the State with respect to elections for Federal office. The table of contents of the Act is amended to include a new item after section 303B. Section 303A of the Act is amended to allow for Election Day registration and change of address services at early voting sites in states that permit voting prior to a Federal election."
