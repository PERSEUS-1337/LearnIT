Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is defined as the maximum amount of administrative costs that can be paid from the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund. It is set at 5% of property tax allocated for the period January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2012, and up to 3% for each fiscal year ending on June 30, 2016. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the successor agency. Starting July 1, 2016, the administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of the property tax distributed by the county auditor-controller in the previous fiscal year. The allowance cannot be less than $250,000 unless reduced by the oversight board or by agreement with the successor agency. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies regardless of whether the costs are paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but excludes costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The administrative cost allowance is the sole funding source for legal expenses related to civil actions. Employee costs for project implementation activities are not considered administrative costs. \"Designated local authority\" refers to a public entity formed under specific sections.

Legal expenses for civil actions contesting the validity of relevant parts are payable from the administrative cost allowance starting January 1, 2016. A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for legal expenses related to civil actions challenging the validity of certain parts. If the successor agency wins the case, the funds are repayable, but if not, they are considered a grant.
