    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. They proposed creating a public-private partnership for a nationwide broadband network by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. The FCC decided to set aside 10 MHz of public safety frequency bands to create a shared network with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum, forming a nationwide broadband network. This decision was based on the benefits of national coverage, robust communication capabilities, and interoperability. The FCC structured the network for collaboration between adjacent spectrum license-holders to support the broadband network. The FCC assigned a national license for 10 MHz to a not-for-profit corporation formed to represent public safety interests. This public safety license was created from the 24 MHz originally assigned to public safety through regional, state, and local negotiations for spectrum assignments. The FCC designated 10 MHz from commercial frequencies to be paired with public safety's 10 MHz to create a shared network. The D Block commercial license attracted only one bidder at Auction 73, Qualcomm, Inc., with an opening bid of $472 million. The D Block license attracted only one bidder at Auction 73, Qualcomm, Inc., with an opening bid of $472 million. The FCC decided not to proceed with the re-auction due to the lack of bidders meeting the reserve price of $1.3 billion. Instead, they initiated a review of rules regarding licensing and partnership structures, seeking comments on options for disposing of the D Block. The FCC prepared new auction rules for the D Block after receiving comments on disposal options. The rules include a nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and options for commercial licenses. Public safety associations want local networks to manage access to the spectrum, while the national licensee would ensure interoperability. Congressional policy is a key issue in the discussions. The FCC and DHS are pursuing separate paths for public safety communications support. Congress is considering funding solutions for the program, with the FCC proposing levies on commercial partners or performance requirements. Public sector funding may also be explored. The FCC has proposed resolving public safety communication needs through levies on commercial partners or performance requirements. Public sector funding may also be considered, especially in the current economic situation. An economic stimulus program could include funding for critical infrastructure improvements, including public safety networks. The federal government could temporarily act as the commercial partner to ensure network construction and later sell the business to the private sector. Sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users is seen as beneficial for public safety, providing new funding sources, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The report discusses the benefits of sharing spectrum and network facilities between public and private sectors for public safety. It highlights the need for sufficient spectrum and a source of funds to support the creation of a national public safety license. The report emphasizes the importance of a national public safety license, including rebanding costs and spectrum license administration. It outlines key elements for a public-private partnership and the need for incentives to meet public safety standards. Commercial partners are expected to use the shared network for consumer services. Incentives are needed to build a network meeting higher public safety standards, despite significant demand from businesses for secure mobile data access. The debate surrounds why the D Block license wasn't auctioned successfully and potential solutions for an interoperable public safety broadband network. Flaws in the auction structure and rules discouraging bidders are part of the discussion. The debate on the D Block license auction includes modifying rules to attract bidders and considering alternatives for an interoperable public safety broadband network. Suggestions include eliminating FCC requirements that deter bidders, removing network sharing mandates, and auctioning the license without public safety obligations. This assumes a viable business case for the public-private partnership and sufficient spectrum capacity for successful collaboration. The course of action for building a public safety network involves using federal funds, requiring congressional authorization for expenditures, and potentially implementing a different organizational structure. Various proposals combine different elements to achieve nationwide public safety interoperability. The FCC seeks comments on options for re-auctioning the D Block to provide a commercial partner for public safety. Commissioners support rule changes for the auction to increase oversight in the public-private partnership. Options include modifying requirements for the winning bidder. Options for re-auctioning the D Block include modifying requirements for the winning bidder, such as lowering the reserve price or eliminating penalties for failure to negotiate a Network Sharing Agreement. Other proposals suggest re-auctioning the D Block without encumbrances, like expensive build-out requirements or the network sharing agreement. Some recommend offering the D Block as a commercial license under terms similar to other blocks assigned in Auction 73. Additionally, there are suggestions to rework the network sharing agreement to accommodate strong bidders. Many suggest re-auctioning the D Block without encumbrances and using surplus funds from Auction 73 to build a public safety network. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and Commissioner Michael J. Copps prefer using federal funds for a nationwide, interoperable network. They referenced the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act as a potential funding mechanism. The FCC seeks to create a nationwide interoperable network using private sector funds due to lack of federal support. Recommendations for funding through spectrum proceeds lack details on distribution. A cooperative organization involving multiple public safety partners would build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for regional and local networks to connect during emergencies, requiring less financial commitment from commercial partners. The commercial network would collaborate with state and local agencies to build an interoperable network for public safety during emergencies. Multiple commercial partners would be involved, with licenses assigned for local markets and rural coverage. Public safety partners would lead in designing the network and technology choices. The public safety partner would lead in designing the network and choosing technology standards for commercial partners. The FCC could potentially set standards through rule-making. Federal funds could be used to build parts of the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz. The federal government's role in structuring the agreement would be minimized, with greater support through funding. Federal programs could participate as network customers to ensure economic viability. The federal government could ensure economic viability of the public safety network by identifying federal programs as network customers. A federally chartered corporation or not-for-profit organization could hire professionals to operate the network, with funding coming from appropriations or other sources. The Public Safety Broadband License could remain with the current holder or be reassigned, with corporate laws and congressional oversight replacing FCC regulations. The FCC seeks opinions and information on a wide range of questions regarding the creation of a broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz using the existing Public Safety Broadband License and the D Block, with the assistance of Congress. Without additional authority from Congress, the FCC is limited to directing the outcome through modifications to spectrum band plans, auction rules, service rules, and the network sharing agreement. The FCC is seeking opinions and information on various topics related to the creation of a broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz. This includes provisions for using the Public Safety Broadband License, negotiation of the Network Sharing Agreement, structuring the new auction of the D Block, relocation costs, service rules, and opportunities for providing broadband wireless access for public safety. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust would have borrowed $197 million for capital expenditures, secured by projected revenue from its D Block partner in spectrum access fees. The FCC is also seeking comments on the obligations of the D Block to build the shared network. The FCC is seeking opinions on funding sources for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, including the Universal Service Fund and the Telecommunications Development Fund. Amendments by Congress may be necessary to utilize these funds. The Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF) was created with the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to provide capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry. The FCC has consistently provided auction rules since 1994, allowing it to establish financial requirements for bidders and set aside licenses for specific classes. The FCC sets rules for auctions and enforces service rules for license use. Service rules for advanced wireless services include requirements for license use within a specific timeframe and can specify technologies, uses, or users. For Auction 73, the FCC expanded service rules to mandate spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees, creating a public-private partnership structure. The FCC established service rules for a public-private partnership in preparation for the auction of licenses in the 700 MHz band. The regulatory framework includes requirements for a Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a Commercial partner, and a Network Sharing Agreement to build and manage a shared network. The FCC established service rules for a public-private partnership in preparation for the auction of licenses in the 700 MHz band. The winning bidder for the D Block, a national license for 10 MHz of spectrum at 700 MHz, would need to create a Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) with another licensee. The FCC would approve contracts and legal agreements, oversee compliance, and resolve disputes. The Second Report and Order highlights issues for policy makers regarding public safety communications. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use during the transition from analog to digital television. Planning for public safety use began in 1997 and concluded in 2003 with the submission of the final report by the Public Safety National Coordination Committee. Governance for these channels is managed by 55 Regional Planning Committees coordinated through the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use. Planning Committees coordinated through the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council revised the band plan to create two licensing approaches for narrowband and broadband applications. Channels were reassigned to support narrowband operations in 12 MHz of paired spectrum. RPCs with approved band plans are required to submit amended plans. The FCC rule requires RPCs with approved band plans to submit amended plans for financing networks on narrowband frequencies. Spectrum will be allocated for broadband communications in 10 MHz frequencies at 763 - 768 MHz and 793 - 798 MHz. Public Safety Broadband Licensee will administer two guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz to prevent interference. Some public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan, with costs potentially covered by the commercial D Block. The FCC rule requires RPCs with approved band plans to submit amended plans for financing networks on narrowband frequencies. Public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan, with costs potentially covered by the commercial D Block licensee. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee will administer guard bands to prevent interference. The national network using the spectrum held by the broadband licensee would be built at the cost of its commercial partner. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on criteria such as not-for-profit status and broad representation of public safety entities. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation was formed in anticipation of receiving the license and hired Cyren Call Communications Corporation as its advisor. The PSST was awarded the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License, with representation on the Board of Directors consisting of members from named organizations representing public safety. The FCC provided a list of 11 organizations designated to appoint board members and allowed for two at-large members in the Second Report and Order. In the Second Report and Order, the FCC designated 11 organizations to appoint board members for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, with the board initially consisting of 13 members. However, in a later Order on Reconsideration, the board composition was changed to include three representatives from named organizations and four at-large members. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (NPSTC) was eliminated as a named member due to membership overlap. PSST, as the selected licensee, would need to submit quarterly financial reports to the FCC. The FCC designated associations to appoint board members for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. PSST, as the selected licensee, must submit quarterly financial reports to the FCC and meet criteria for its articles of incorporation and bylaws. The FCC will provide oversight to ensure corporate governance stipulations are met. Suggestions were considered to ensure the public safety license holder receives necessary services for emergency communications. The FCC has reserved the right to re-assign the commercial license if necessary and revoke the public safety license if obligations are not met. The public safety license is valid for ten years and renewable, with additional tasks set by the FCC. The public safety licensee, selected after meeting initial qualifications, has various responsibilities including negotiating a Network Sharing Agreement, administering network access for public safety users, representing their interests, and approving equipment and applications on the network. They have the authority to determine equipment acceptability and must approve purchase agreements with vendors for cost savings. The public safety licensee has the authority to approve equipment and applications on the network, including coordinating stations accessing narrowband and broadband frequencies. They oversee the relocation of users required by rebanding and decide on allowing federal public safety agencies access. They also review requests for wideband networks and facilitate negotiations for network sites on public land. The FCC ruled that eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 would be entitled to a bidding credit for small businesses. The D Block designates frequencies at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz, totaling 10 MHz, offered as a single, nationwide license in the auction. The FCC directed the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to set reserve prices for each block of licenses to be auctioned. The FCC set reserve prices for each block of licenses to be auctioned, with the D Block having a suggested reserve price of $1.33 billion. The winning bidder would need to meet specific requirements, including completing a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Negotiations for the NSA were to begin after the winning bidder filed its long form application, with the FCC requiring completion within six months. The FCC required the completion of a Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) within six months of the long form application for each license won at auction. The agreement granted the Public Safety Broadband Licensee the right of first refusal and the option to purchase network assets at fair market value if the D Block license is cancelled. The winning bidder for the D Block had to certify good faith negotiations within ten days and provide a timetable for the first 30 days of negotiation meetings. Detailed monthly reports were required after three months. The FCC required detailed monthly reports on negotiations after three months. Two FCC staff members would be neutral observers during negotiations. Separate legal entities must be formed to hold the D Block license, own network assets, and operate the company. These entities must be \"bankruptcy remote\" as confirmed by bankruptcy counsel. The corporate structure for the D Block license winner must be \"bankruptcy remote,\" approved by the FCC, and comprised of quasi-independent companies with designated functions to implement the public-private partnership. These entities are responsible for building out the shared network as specified by the FCC. The D Block license winner's corporate structure must be \"bankruptcy remote\" and comprised of quasi-independent companies with designated functions to implement the public-private partnership. The parties would have the responsibility to build out the shared network as specified in the Network Sharing Agreement and FCC rules. Failure to meet obligations could lead to license revocation and a penalty of 10% of the auction price. The D Block license would be valid for ten years unless revoked, with the option for renewal if FCC rules are followed. The 700 MHz band must end, with license renewal eligibility based on FCC compliance. A commercial corporation would be responsible for building the public safety network using spectrum from the public safety licensee and D Block license holder. FCC-established benchmarks require reaching 75% of the population within four years, 95% within seven years, and 99.3% within ten years. The national D Block license aims to provide coverage to 95% of the population by 2016 and 99.3% by 2019, based on U.S. Census data. The FCC requires a build-out schedule for highways, interstates, and communities over 3,000 people, with benchmarks to be met by the licensee. Failure to meet deadlines could result in license cancellation. Additionally, the licensee must offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for public safety in rural areas. The D Block licensee must provide robust signal coverage to meet population requirements and offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for public safety in rural areas. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) sets rules for service to public safety users and network reliability, with FCC restrictions on discontinuing service without approval. Adherence to the NSA is a regulatory condition for both licensees in the public-private partnership. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) is crucial for the public-private partnership, serving as the contractual foundation for both licensees. The FCC reviews and approves all components of the NSA, setting requirements such as network coverage and minimum standards for the network. The NSA includes specifications for a platform that offers broadband mobile voice, video, and data for public safety and commercial users. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) is essential for the public-private partnership, providing broadband mobile voice, video, and data for public safety and commercial users. It includes specifications for communications interoperability, signal coverage, reliability, robustness, capacity, and spectrum efficient technologies. The FCC expects the network to use spectrum efficient technologies and state-of-the-art security measures. Public safety communications are prioritized in real-time, with the highest priorities given to safety and homeland security. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control over the network to ensure public safety requirements are met. They also have the right to approve public safety equipment specifications used on the network. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has the right to approve public safety equipment specifications used on the network and purchase its own subscriber equipment. The D Block Licensee must provide an integrated handset for public safety use on 700 MHz and satellite frequencies. A common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability is required for all public safety users. FCC rules stipulate guidelines and obligations for the Network Sharing Agreement, including fee structures and duration. Service fees must be specified in the agreement. The FCC ruled that service fees must be specified in the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA), including fees for normal network service and priority access to commercial spectrum capacity during emergencies. Licensees are expected to negotiate \"reasonable rates\" in good faith, with financial incentives for commercial licensees based on the number of public safety subscribers. Priority access fees should protect public safety participants from unexpected payment obligations, with rates priced affordably compared to commercial services. The D Block licensee is expected to negotiate fees in line with these guidelines. The FCC expects the D Block licensee to negotiate affordable rates with public safety partners in line with public safety goals. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) will be in effect for up to ten years, renewable with the D Block license. Any modifications to the NSA or agreements must be approved by the FCC. The FCC requires approval for modifications to the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) or other agreements in the public-private partnership structure. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease access to frequencies exclusively to the D Block licensee on a secondary basis. Commercial users can transmit on public safety band frequencies only when there is no demand from primary users, yielding to public safety immediately when needed. The D Block licensee is granted secondary access to spectrum in a public-private partnership with the requirement to yield to public safety users immediately. The licensee must lease spectrum from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and build a network for public safety use. The FCC mandates a spectrum manager leasing arrangement for the ten-year license term, placing compliance responsibility on the D Block licensee to prevent interference or service degradation for public safety users. The D Block licensee must ensure public safety users are not affected by commercial operations in the public safety spectrum band. The network should prioritize first responders with immediate preemption or exclusion from commercial users. Public safety has the right to real-time emergency access to the D Block spectrum. The definition of an emergency would be part of the Network Sharing Agreement. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety networks in the 700 MHz band to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. This allowed for a shared spectrum agreement between public safety and the private sector. Other spectrum management issues were also resolved by the FCC. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety networks in the 700 MHz band to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. Safety networks in the 700 MHz band will require technical adjustments and cost reimbursement by the D Block licensee. New operations of narrowband systems will be prohibited on relocated networks. Wideband network building and use will be limited. The band plan includes paired spectrum blocks for narrowband and broadband communications. Some states have started building on the unencumbered 700 MHz band for public safety use. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety networks in the 700 MHz band to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. Some states have begun building narrowband networks on the unencumbered 700 MHz band. Motorola provided a cost estimate for a rebanding plan proposed by the NPSTC, with a projected cost of $9.45 million to cover all installations by July 2008. The FCC set a cap of $10 million for reimbursements for rebanding costs, with a cut-off date of August 30, 2007. By limiting the number of systems and radios to be reprogrammed, the estimated cost was around $6 million, providing leeway to stay under the cap. Motorola estimated the cost of rebanding at $9.45 million to cover all installations by July 2008. The FCC set a $10 million cap for rebanding reimbursements, with a deadline of August 30, 2007. To control costs, new operations on affected frequencies were prohibited after that date. Public safety and commercial licensees had to agree on relocation plans and costs within 30 days to be eligible for reimbursement. Displaced public safety network operators must provide accurate information by August 30, 2007, including details on mobile and portable handsets, base stations, contact information, and geographical areas of operation. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing only necessary changes, not unrelated improvements. The FCC does not require the licensee to cover costs related to reassigning channels or Regional Planning Committee plans. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing necessary changes related to the rebanding program, with a cap of $10 million. The agreed-upon costs must be submitted to the FCC as part of the relocation plan and paid into a trust account by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee must pay funds into a trust account for the Network Sharing Agreement. Payments can only be made after the D Block license is awarded to the winning bidder. Public safety network operators need a waiver to operate wideband systems, with specific requirements outlined by the FCC. In the Second Report and Order, the FCC outlined conditions for wideband operations within narrowband frequencies, including interoperability with the broadband network, five-year licenses, and no reimbursement for transition costs. The FCC also positioned itself as the protector of public safety interests and nationwide emergency communications. The FCC plays a key role in overseeing public safety interests, emergency communications, and interoperable networks. It regulates the actions of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and companies managing the D Block license obligations. Congressional oversight is within the jurisdiction of telecommunications committees. The FCC has authority to write service rules for auctions and oversee a network with a potential asset value in the tens of billions of dollars. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee controls a significant part of this asset under FCC regulations. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee is governed by its Board of Directors, with four members appointed by the FCC. The FCC plans to enforce rules through litigation, license revocation, or other means supported by the Communications Act. Congress may provide guidance to FCC commissioners. Two bills in the 110th Congress aim to address issues in creating a shared network. The Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 (H.R. 6055, Harman) proposes funding for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and sets limits on its activities. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 (S. 3465, Wicker) aims to create a First Responders Interoperable Device. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 (S. 3465, Wicker) aims to establish a Trust Fund for purchasing interoperable radios for first responders. It would allocate proceeds from the D Block Auction and future auctions for this purpose, extending auction authority for the FCC."
