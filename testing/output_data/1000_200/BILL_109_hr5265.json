    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program Act\". The Congress finds that the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in Southeast Asia resulted in over 230,000 deaths. There is a 10 to 15 percent chance of a major seismic event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone on the west coast of the United States in the next 50 years, which could cause significant damage. Many coastal communities are not prepared for such an event. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) aims to provide one-year grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program's primary goal is to assist departments in tsunami hazard preparedness, mitigation, and response, especially those lacking necessary resources. Improving warning systems for coastal communities will enhance overall hazard capabilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to areas at risk of tsunamis, prioritizing those with a 10% or greater likelihood within 50 years. Grants will be awarded competitively based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with emergency services providers. An emergency management department receiving a grant under this Act can use funds for warning systems, rescue equipment, reinforcing buildings, post-tsunami shelters, and outreach programs for resident education. The grant funds can be used for warning systems, rescue equipment, reinforcing buildings, post-tsunami shelters, and outreach programs for educating residents and tourists about different types of tsunamis and how to react to them. SEC. 6. MATCHING FUNDS. Emergency management departments serving areas with different population sizes are required to provide a percentage of the total project cost with non-Federal funds to be eligible for grants under this Act. The percentages vary based on the population size: over 50,000 (20%), between 20,001 and 50,000 (10%), and under 20,000 (5%). Emergency management departments with a population under 20,000 must contribute 5% of the project cost with non-Federal funds to qualify for grants under this Act. In-kind contributions from the department can also be considered, up to 50% of their non-Federal funds contribution. SEC. 7. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\n\nThe Director will assess if emergency management departments meet tsunami readiness standards and evaluate program effectiveness within 180 days of grant awards. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation.\n\nSEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDirector refers to the head of FEMA. Emergency Management Department is an agency responsible for planning and managing emergencies. State includes all 50 states, DC, and US territories.\n\nSEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
