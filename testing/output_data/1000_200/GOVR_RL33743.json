    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. Other trade negotiations in progress that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows Congress to vote on trade legislation without amendment if the President meets negotiating objectives and consultation requirements. TPA gives the President leverage in trade negotiations by assuring timely consideration by Congress. Renewal of TPA has become more controversial due to increased complexity in trade negotiations and partisan debates. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has become more controversial as oversight and consultation requirements have increased, leading to a more partisan trade debate in Congress. The expiration of TPA raises questions about its renewal in terms of timing and form. TPA is the result of decades of cooperation and compromise between Congress and the executive branch, based on their constitutional powers and the need for flexibility in negotiating trade agreements. The partnership between Congress and the President on trade policymaking can be strengthened or strained depending on political and economic conditions. The U.S. Constitution assigns authority over foreign trade to Congress, giving them power to regulate commerce and collect taxes. The President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and agreements, with both branches involved in developing and executing trade agreements. Congress historically set tariff rates for imported products as the main trade policy instrument. In the first 150 years of the United States, Congress controlled foreign trade by setting tariff rates on imported products, which was the main trade policy and revenue source. Early trade debates divided Members from manufacturing and commodity exporting regions. The President's role was to negotiate treaties with MFN treatment. Two events in the 1930s transformed U.S. trade policy. In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act set high tariff rates, leading to retaliatory tariffs and worsening the Great Depression. In response, the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal trade agreements. The RTAA of 1934 authorized the President to enter reciprocal trade agreements reducing tariffs within pre-approved levels on an MFN basis. Congress delegated expanded trade authority to the President to lessen political pressure from special interests. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was the last general tariff legislation, now only applied to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status. The RTAA of 1934 authorized the President to enter reciprocal trade agreements reducing tariffs on an MFN basis. Congress delegated trade authority to the President to lessen political pressure from special interests. Tariffs now only apply to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status, referred to as normal trade relations status (NTR) in U.S. trade laws. Congress insured against executive branch overreach by subjecting trade agreements authority to periodic review and renewal. General tariff levels declined with the establishment of GATT in 1947, shifting trade negotiations from bilateral to multilateral forums. Trade negotiations expanded beyond tariffs. Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Congress granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and expanded its role in the process. The act allowed the President to conclude the GATT Kennedy Round, focusing on tariff reduction and nontariff barriers agreements. The GATT member countries reached agreements in the Kennedy Round related to nontariff barriers (NTBs), including customs valuation and antidumping practices. Congress believed the President exceeded his authority by negotiating these agreements, leading to a resolution in 1966 against \"nontariff commitments.\" The Kennedy Round agreements on nontariff barriers led to a debate in Congress over presidential authority in trade negotiations. Congress sought a legislative remedy to address concerns of encroachment on its authority, leading to the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 expired in 1967, and it took seven years for Congress to renew the authority. The Nixon Administration gained new negotiation authority for the Tokyo Round in the GATT through the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the Nixon Administration new authority to negotiate the Tokyo Round in the GATT, allowing the President to enter into trade agreements that reduced tariffs. Implementing legislation for nontariff barrier agreements required approval from Congress, sparking debate over the delegation of trade agreement authority and the potential impact on trade policymaking. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to negotiate trade agreements to reduce tariffs. Congress recognized the need for agreements to be voted on without unlimited debate and amendment to ensure cooperation from trading partners. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President fast track trade negotiating authority, allowing for expedited treatment of trade agreements by Congress. This included limited time for committees to consider implementing bills, time-limited debate with no amendments, and consultation with relevant committees during negotiations. Additionally, 10 Members of Congress were accredited as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President fast track trade negotiating authority, leading to agreements on NTBs during the Tokyo Round of the GATT. The resulting Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first implementing bill passed under this authority, with expedited legislative procedures that have remained unchanged since 1974. Congress has revised these provisions over the years, although they are not subject to sunset provisions. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President fast track trade negotiating authority, leading to agreements on NTBs during the Tokyo Round of the GATT. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988, but did not extend tariff modification authority. Congress has revised these provisions over the years, with no sunset provisions in place. The Trade Act of 1979 extended presidential authority on nontariff barriers but did not extend tariff modification authority. It amended the Trade Act of 1974 to include trade agreements authority for negotiating and implementing bilateral free trade agreements. Congress considered U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The legislation waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress 60 days prior to negotiations with other countries. Expedited procedures could be denied if either committee disapproved within 60 days. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter trade agreements before June 1, 1993, with expedited procedures for agreements before June 1, 1991. Agreements after June 1, 1991, required congressional approval via implementing legislation. The President requested an extension for agreements before June 1, 1993, which survived proposed resolutions of disapproval. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter trade agreements before June 1, 1993, with expedited procedures for agreements before June 1, 1991. Congress could withhold fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval if USTR failed to consult adequately. Congress expanded trade negotiation objectives and passed NAFTA implementing legislation in 1993. H.R. 1876 extended the authority and implementing procedures until April 16, 1994. Congress passed H.R. 1876, signed by the President on July 2, 1993 (P.L. 103-49), extending the trade agreements authority until April 16, 1994 for the Uruguay Round. The authority was not renewed until the Trade Act of 2002 (H.R. 3009; P.L. 107-210) after a long hiatus. In 1997 and 1998, there were unsuccessful attempts to renew the fast track authority. In 1998, the House failed to pass fast track authority legislation, with reasons including disagreements on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues between the Republican leadership and the Clinton Administration. The WTO's failure to launch new negotiations also contributed to the lack of support for renewing trade agreements authority. In 2001, President George W. Bush requested a renewal of fast track authority, renamed as \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. The new authority included labor and environmental provisions as principal negotiating objectives, but did not mandate enforceable labor standards, leading to opposition from labor groups and some Members of Congress. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 did not mandate minimal enforceable labor standards in trade agreements, leading to opposition from labor groups and some Members of Congress. It also established the Congressional Oversight Group for congressional consultation. The legislation passed in the House by one vote and was combined in the Senate with other trade-related acts before being adopted as the Trade Act of 2002. The Trade Act of 2002, including the Trade Promotion Authority Act, passed in Congress with support for Free Trade Agreements with various countries. The proposed Bipartisan Congressional Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2015 was introduced but not acted upon. The Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2015, known as TPA-2015, was reported by Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. It passed on May 22 with updated negotiating objectives on trade, including provisions on labor, environment, currency manipulation, and human rights. The Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2015, known as TPA-2015, includes provisions on labor, the environment, currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. It may be used for agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), and Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA). TPA-2015 will expire on July 1, 2021, unless an extension disapproval resolution is passed by July 1, 2018. The Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) is a plurilateral agreement being negotiated at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reduce or eliminate barriers on goods to promote the environment. Through TPA/fast track, Congress aims to define trade policy priorities, ensure adherence to objectives, establish terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's authority over trade. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to define trade policy priorities, establish terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm Congress's authority over trade. Initially, trade agreements were implemented by presidential proclamation, but with the inclusion of nontariff barriers (NTBs), Congress tightened its control by establishing \"fast track trade negotiating authority.\" The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) was established by Congress to tighten control over trade agreements negotiation and implementation. This authority includes expedited procedures for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress, with certain conditions that must be met for a bill to qualify. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) requires trade agreements to meet negotiating objectives, notification and consultation requirements, and contain necessary provisions in the implementing bill. Congress has the power to change rules at any time regarding expedited procedures for trade agreements approval and implementation. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants Congress the authority to control the approval and implementation of trade agreements. The President can enter into force an agreement by presidential proclamation after ensuring the partner country has complied with the agreement's provisions. Congress must be notified 90 days before signing the agreement and provided with a list of provisions within 60 days of signing. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants Congress control over approving and implementing trade agreements. The President must notify Congress 90 days before signing an agreement and provide a list of required changes within 60 days of signing. After entering into the agreement, the President must transmit the final legal text, a draft implementing bill, and supporting statements to Congress. If Congress is satisfied with the requirements, the implementing bill is enacted into law. The Trade Promotion Authority grants Congress control over approving and implementing trade agreements. Congress must follow expedited legislative procedures if certain requirements are met, including mandatory introduction of the implementing bill in both houses, limited floor debate, and no amendments allowed. Congress exercises its trade policy role through the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, defining trade negotiation objectives. These objectives highlight the importance of trade for the U.S. economy and global benefits. Congress sets the goals for the President in trade negotiations, expecting the Administration to honor them for trade agreement implementing legislation consideration. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation defines trade negotiation objectives that the Administration must honor for expedited consideration of trade agreement implementing legislation. Congress establishes objectives in three categories: overall, principal, and other priorities, focusing on enhancing economies, reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and promoting fair regulatory practices. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation sets out trade negotiation objectives, including enhancing economies, reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and promoting fair regulatory practices. These objectives are crucial for future trade agreements and can be contentious, as seen in the 2002 renewal controversy. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation sets trade negotiation objectives, which can be contentious when specific trade agreements are brought before Congress for approval. The labor provisions have been a key point of debate, especially regarding the lack of minimal enforceable standards in TPA. This issue was evident during the 2005 debate on the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). The structure of trade agreements mirrors TPA objectives, and disputes over FTAs based on those objectives have survived challenges from opponents. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation sets trade negotiation objectives, which can be contentious when specific trade agreements are brought before Congress for approval. The vote on renewing TPA/fast track authority is critical, and the President must consult regularly with Congress, including the Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG) in both chambers. Notification and consultation requirements have been revised in each renewal of authority. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the President to conduct notifications and consultations before negotiations and agreements, including notifying Congress, consulting with relevant committees and Congressional Advisory Groups (CAGs), and providing special consultations on specific issues like agriculture and tariffs. The President must also notify Congress and consult with relevant parties before entering into agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation mandates various steps before entering into trade agreements, including notifying Congress and relevant committees, consulting with Congressional Advisory Groups (CAGs), providing reports to Congress and the President, and releasing the agreement text 60 days prior to finalization. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires steps before trade agreements, including notifying Congress, consulting with Congressional Advisory Groups (CAGs), providing reports, and releasing the agreement text 60 days prior. The consultation process with Congress has been evaluated by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and found to be extensive from 2002 to 2007. The consultation process with Congress for trade agreements under TPA was found to be lacking in sufficient time for input and last-minute changes, raising concerns about the need for greater and earlier congressional involvement in drafting FTAs. Similar issues have been raised regarding consultation on TPP and other trade negotiations. Congress adopted TPA procedures as self-limiting conditions to prevent trade. Congress adopted Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures to prevent delays in trade implementing bills and protect fragile consensus between trade partners. TPA includes provisions to limit expedited procedures and ensure congressional authority over trade matters. Each renewal of TPA provides expedited procedures for a limited time to facilitate trade agreement implementing bills. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) provides expedited procedures for trade agreement implementing bills for a limited time to ensure congressional oversight. TPA-2015 extends these procedures until July 1, 2021, without a deadline for submitting implementing legislation for agreements entered into before the expiration of the authority. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the President to request an extension of authority after a certain period. The extension is granted unless either House of Congress adopts a disapproval resolution, which must be reported out of the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees. This process serves as a reminder to the executive branch that expedited legislative procedures are a congressional prerogative that can be denied if Congress is dissatisfied with trade agreement negotiations conducted by the President. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the President to fulfill consultation and reporting obligations to preserve the congressional role in trade agreements. Congress can deny the implementing bill under TPA rules if the President fails to meet these requirements, through a joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution. The new CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for an implementing bill if there is a failure to notify or consult with Congress on a trade agreement. The Trade Act of 1974 allows Congress to withdraw expedited procedures for trade implementing bills with a vote by either house. The success of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) depends on cooperation between the legislative and executive branches. The success of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) relies on cooperation between the legislative and executive branches, as well as between political parties. Bipartisan agreement on TPA has been lacking since 1993, leading to strains in the trade legislative process. Congress has integrated certain procedures into the approval of trade agreements, in addition to the expedited procedures defined in TPA. Congress has integrated certain procedures into the approval of trade agreements, including reviewing the agreement before introducing the implementing bill. This involves hearings and informal markup sessions to test congressional response. The informal draft trade agreement implementing bill allows committee members to raise concerns, offer amendments, and signal changes they would like to see in the final bill. The revenue committees may reconcile differences in their markups to reinforce congressional positions. The Administration has discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress. The Administration has discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress regarding trade agreements. Congress has at times encouraged or insisted on additions or clarifications to agreements, leading to side agreements or side letters. Side agreements and side letters are additional obligations or clarifications added to trade agreements after they have been signed. Side agreements, like the environment and labor side agreements of NAFTA, may not always be subject to fast track procedures. Side letters, on the other hand, clarify specific issues and are common in bilateral FTAs to address congressional concerns. They are typically exchanged between top trade representatives and require official signatures from all negotiating parties to take effect. The CAFTA-DR implementing bill under the Bush Administration made accommodations to sugar, textile, and labor interests to secure congressional support. TPA expired on July 1, 2007, and it has been common practice for the President to request renewed TPA from Congress. Some Members of Congress criticized President Obama for delaying such a request. The President requested renewed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) from Congress, which some Members criticized him for delaying. TPA may need to be revamped due to outdated laws and emerging policy debates. Some argue that TPA is not always necessary if consensus can be built on passing Free Trade Agreements (FTA). Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) goes beyond expedited legislative procedures, helping to build consensus on trade policy, signal congressional support for FTAs, and define negotiating objectives. The timing of TPA renewal is debated, with some suggesting waiting until FTA negotiations are near completion for congressional action. The debate over Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal centers on the timing, with some suggesting waiting until FTA negotiations are close to completion for congressional action. The scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives has evolved with the changing structure of trade, leading to the inclusion of new objectives in TPA-2015. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal debate focuses on new negotiating objectives in TPA-2015, including issues like state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, trade effects on SMEs, and FTA implications on global supply chains. Democrats were dissatisfied with the Trade Act of 2002, leading to a partisan vote. Congress may need to consider these new objectives for TPA renewal. The Trade Act of 2002 led to a largely partisan vote on passage, with approval of FTAs withheld until a bipartisan agreement was reached in 2007. The \"May 10th Agreement\" included significant changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. These changes have been accepted as a baseline for future trade agreements by many Republicans and Democrats. Congress may consider including these commitments in TPA negotiating objectives. Some Democrats and Republicans have differing views on including the May 10th Understanding commitments in formal trade negotiating objectives in TPA-2015. There are concerns about the execution of the trade negotiation consultation process required under TPA, especially in the context of TPP negotiations. Key issues include dissatisfaction with the quality of consultation. Key issues with the trade negotiation consultation process under TPA include dissatisfaction with the quality of consultation and limited access to draft texts for Congress members compared to business and NGO representatives. Congress may seek to clarify negotiation and consultation procedures to ensure early influence on FTAs. Members emphasize the importance of being kept current on trade agreement negotiations to influence the text and participate meaningfully in drafting implementing bills. There is bipartisan interest in enforcing trade agreement commitments, with separate legislative efforts and the creation of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center. Congress may need to consider including language on trade agreement enforcement in TPA. Technical issues from the 112th Congress's use of TPA expedited procedures may need reevaluation, such as the strict interpretation of using TPA only for necessary provisions in implementing bills. Congress has emphasized the importance of strict interpretation of using TPA only for necessary provisions in implementing bills. TPA-2015 goes further by requiring provisions to be strictly necessary or appropriate. Some Members want to define the language more precisely, while others argue for flexibility. Delays in introducing FTA implementing bills have been seen, with congressional leveraging for policy changes in trade. Delays in introducing FTA implementing bills have been observed, with congressional leveraging for policy changes in trade partner countries. Some argue that text changes in the U.S.-South Korea FTA after negotiations had concluded were contrary to TPA, raising the issue of whether Congress should consider a time limit for introducing implementing bills after negotiations conclude. The power of fast track (TPA) lies in the political compact between Congress and the President rather than its statutory guarantees. The real power of fast track (TPA) lies in the political compact between Congress and the President, rather than its statutory guarantees. Congress seeks bipartisan consensus on trade policy, with TPA being a key element. Congress has options for renewing TPA, including renewing and revising TPA authority or extending a targeted TPA. The TPA-2015 legislation offers new authority with revisions to its structure, extending TPA for specific agreements like the TPP. Congress could also grant permanent TPA authority in a two-tier procedure, or face delays in trade agreements without TPA renewal. The lack of TPA renewal could delay action on future trade agreements, but trade policy can still move forward through other means like TIFAs and AGOA. Some Members oppose TPA due to concerns about congressional authority. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 renewed TPA for four years with a possible three-year extension. The legislation reauthorizes TPA for four years with a potential three-year extension, maintaining the basic structure of previous TPA/fast-track authorizing legislation. It includes new objectives reflecting current trade policy issues. The legislation reauthorizes TPA for four years with a potential three-year extension, maintaining the basic structure of previous TPA/fast-track authorizing legislation. It includes new objectives reflecting current trade policy issues such as digital trade, state-owned enterprises, localization barriers, currency, and human rights. Before the formal TPA expedited procedures, House and Senate committees hold \"mock markups\" on draft legislation. The President then sends the final legal draft of the trade agreement and implementing bill to Congress. The draft bill is sent to Congress on a session day, may include committee amendments. Identical bills must be introduced in both houses, referred to relevant committees. Committees have 45 days to report the bill or it goes on the calendar. If it's a revenue bill, the Senate must act on the House bill. Senate Finance Committee has a deadline for action on the bill. After the implementing bill is reported or discharged in each house, a non-debatable motion can be made to consider it. Debate is limited to 20 hours, and the measure cannot be amended. If floor action is not completed within 15 days, any Member may bring it to a vote. The bill passes by a simple majority, with the second house taking a final vote on the bill received from the first house to ensure both houses act on the same measure. The implementing bill is signed by the President after both houses vote on the same measure, ensuring its entry into force. The USTR confirms partner countries' compliance, and the President proclaims the agreement's implementation."
