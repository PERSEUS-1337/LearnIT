    "content": "Children in foster care have higher rates of mental health care needs and are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications. These medications are used to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is closely monitoring how states regulate the use of psychotropic medications for foster children, as federal law requires states to oversee prescription drug use in this population. The report discusses oversight of prescription drug use, including psychotropic medications, for children in foster care. It covers congressional and state monitoring efforts, as well as the involvement of child welfare agencies in cases of abuse or neglect. Children in foster care are placed in settings like foster family homes or group homes due to neglect or abuse by parents. The judge determines removal from the home is necessary for the child's welfare, giving responsibility to the state child welfare agency. Foster care is temporary until reunification with parents or alternative permanent placement. During FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 exiting the system. Nearly 428,000 children remained in care by the end of the fiscal year. The national foster care caseload has been decreasing over the past decade, with about 77,000 fewer children in care by the end of FY2015 compared to FY2006. States focus on finding permanent homes for children in foster care while ensuring their safety and well-being. Children in foster care have higher mental health service needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care, impacting their socialization and behavior. In a national survey, 43%-46% of children placed in foster homes following abuse or neglect investigation showed signs of mental health issues. In 2008 and 2009, a high percentage of children placed in foster care homes or institutions following abuse or neglect investigations were found to be at risk of behavioral or emotional problems, requiring mental health services. Rates were significantly higher than those in the general population, with children in foster care showing increased likelihood of mental health diagnoses such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, and depression. Children in foster care are likely to receive mental health diagnoses, including attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Medicaid provides health care services for nearly all children in foster care. From 2002 to 2007, the percentage of children in foster care diagnosed with mental health disorders increased, with older children more likely to receive diagnoses. In 2007, children ages 3 to 5 were most commonly diagnosed with conduct disorder and attention disorders, while children ages 6 to 11 had varying diagnoses. In 2007, children in foster care were diagnosed with conduct disorders and attention disorders at varying rates based on age groups. Rates of major mental health diagnoses increased from 2002 to 2007 for children in foster care, except for depression among children ages 6 to 11 and schizophrenia among both age groups. National standards recommend mental health screenings for all children entering foster care. National standards recommend mental health screenings for all children entering foster care, followed by a comprehensive assessment within a month. Medicaid provides diagnostic and treatment services for children in foster care, with each state designing its own plan for medical assistance. This plan must meet federal requirements and entitles the state to federal reimbursement. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, receiving necessary services through the EPSDT program, including health screenings, assessments, immunizations, and dental services at regular intervals. Under EPSDT, states must provide treatment to meet children's identified health needs, including mental health needs. Medicaid financing can be used for services like case management, psychiatrists, psychologists, and prescription drugs for children with behavioral health needs. Psychosocial treatment, such as counseling and case management, is beneficial for children with mental health challenges. There is evidence supporting the use of psychosocial treatment interventions for mental disorders in children. There is a growing body of evidence on practices for responding to mental disorders in children through the use of psychosocial treatment. Certain interventions like behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) have been found to be moderately effective for children with antisocial-related behaviors. Additionally, CBT activities like anger management and social skills training are effective for children who have experienced trauma. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. However, medication may be used without accompanying psychosocial therapies due to a lack of resources and support. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have noted that over-reliance on medication may indicate a lack of access to effective behavioral health care for children in care. There is a need for evidence-based psychosocial therapies for children in foster care. Children in foster care may receive psychosocial therapies rated by SAMHSA for effectiveness. Data shows they are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to children with mental health needs who remain at home. Research on Medicaid claims also indicates increased use of psychosocial interventions for children in foster care taking antipsychotic medication. Children in foster care eligible for Medicaid show increased use of psychosocial mental health interventions while on antipsychotic medication, compared to non-foster children. Studies indicate that children in foster care with mental health needs may not always receive necessary services, with a significant portion not receiving specialty mental health services or psychotropics. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in out-of-home care vary between 16% and 33%. Children in foster care, especially those eligible for Medicaid, have significantly higher rates of psychotropic medication use compared to children not in foster care. Rates range from 16% to 33%, with some receiving medication at three to nine times the rate of other children on Medicaid. This high rate of medication use is comparable to older children with diagnosed mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. Additionally, research shows that children in foster care may not always receive necessary mental health services. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care vary by state and over time, with some receiving medication at higher rates than children not in foster care. Research from the early 2000s found great variation in prescription of psychotropic medication for children in the child welfare system. The researchers found variation in psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with an increase in antipsychotic medication use over time. State practices in prescribing medication were identified as a key factor influencing these differences. The study found an increase in antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care from 2002 to 2007, with varying rates across states. Medicaid claims data showed a slight increase in antipsychotic use from 2005 to 2008, followed by a decrease by 2010. Non-foster care children and privately insured children had lower levels of antipsychotic use. Children with Medicaid coverage and those with private insurance had lower levels of antipsychotic use. Among privately insured children, the percentage using antipsychotics increased from 0.62% in 2005 to 0.77% in 2009, remaining steady at 0.75% through 2013. Data from the second National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) was used to examine psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. NSCAW II focused on 5,872 children who had contact with the child welfare system due to abuse or neglect, including their prescription of psychotropic medications. The NSCAW II Survey examined psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, including those who remained in their homes or were placed in foster care. The children's ages ranged from 2 months to 20 years at different follow-up periods. They may have entered and re-entered care during the 18- or 36-month period. The NSCAW II data show that children living with their own parents after an investigation of child abuse or neglect were less likely to be using psychotropic medication than those in foster care. Children in foster care, especially in congregate care and school age, had a higher chance of taking psychotropic medications. There was no significant difference in medication use between children placed in foster care and those who remained at home after the investigation. At 4-6 months post-investigation, children in foster care had higher psychotropic medication use (15.9% vs. 11.6% at home). By 18 months, foster care children had significantly higher medication rates (23.1% vs. 10.9% at home). At 36 months, 32.8% of foster care children were on medication compared to 12.9% at home. Medication use was higher in group foster care settings (48.2%) than in family homes or kin care. At 18 months post-investigation, children in group foster care had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use (67.4%), compared to other foster care settings (15.9% to 23.8%), children in their own homes (10.9%), and informal kin care (11.9%). This trend persisted at 36 months post-investigation. At 36 months post-investigation, children in group foster care had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use (52%), followed by other foster care settings (16.5% to 36.1%), children in their own homes (12.5%), and informal kin care (16.5%). Children in group settings were most likely to be taking more than one psychotropic medication, with 48.6% taking two or more drugs. At 36 months post-investigation, children in group foster care had the highest rate of psychotropic medication use, with about 4 out of 10 children taking two or more drugs. Children in foster care were more likely to use psychotropic medication if they were of elementary and secondary school age. Children in group settings were significantly more likely to be using three or more psychotropic medications compared to children in other settings. Children in foster care, particularly those of elementary and secondary school age, showed a higher likelihood of using psychotropic medication. Youth ages 11 to 17 were the most frequent users, followed by ages 6 to 10, 18 and older, and 1.5 to 5 years. The oldest youth, ages 18 and older, were less likely to be on psychotropics compared to children ages 6 through 17. Research has identified a trend of overprescribing psychotropic drugs to foster children, with concerns of \"too many, too much, and too young\" usage patterns. Claims data from 2002 through 2007 found that polypharmacy among children in foster care was consistent at about 5.2% to 5.9% annually. In 2011, polypharmacy with three or more antipsychotic drugs was comparable for children with foster care status (2.8%) and non-foster care status (3.1%). Data from the NSCAW II study showed that children in foster care prescribed psychotropics had an average of 1.9 medications per child. Figure 3 illustrates the percentage of children prescribed different numbers of psychotropic medications. Concerns have been raised about the use of multiple psychotropic medications, particularly antipsychotics, in children, with a focus on those in foster care. Polypharmacy with three or more antipsychotic drugs has shown greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. There are worries about dosages exceeding recommendations and very young children being prescribed psychotropics, as limited research exists on their safety and efficacy for this population. Limited research on safety and efficacy of psychotropic medications for young children, with concerns about overprescription in foster care. Studies show increased prescribing rates for ADHD and antipsychotic medications with age among children in foster care. Children in foster care, especially those with greater mental health needs, may receive psychotropic medications due to limited psychosocial services available. Concerns have been raised about the use of these drugs in infants and young children, as they may not always be effective and can lead to serious health effects. The use of antipsychotic medication in children in foster care has been steadily increasing, with a slight decrease in recent years. This trend may be influenced by limited research on the efficacy of these drugs in children and pharmaceutical companies marketing them to prescribers. The use of psychotropic medications in children, including those in foster care, has raised concerns due to limited research on their efficacy and the influence of pharmaceutical companies. Research on antipsychotics in children shows insufficient evidence of their safety and effectiveness, especially among foster youth. The analysis highlighted concerns about the safety and efficacy of psychotropic medications in children, including those in foster care. Limited evidence was available for certain mental health disorders, and studies had a high risk of bias. Antipsychotics were associated with harmful health outcomes in some children. Despite these concerns, some children in foster care may still benefit from these medications. Some children in foster care may benefit from psychotropic medication for managing mental health and behavior concerns stemming from exposure to trauma. Stimulants, particularly for ADHD, have been found to effectively reduce core symptoms. Children in foster care are more likely to have a mental health diagnosis than children generally. Children in foster care may have higher levels of impulsivity, inattention, and aggression, leading to a greater prevalence of mental health diagnoses compared to children generally. State officials and child psychiatrists suggest that psychotropic medication use may be more common in this population due to the severity of their mental health conditions. Congress has shown interest in overseeing prescription medication use in foster care, including concerns about enrollment in clinical drug trials. In 2005, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources examined the enrollment of foster children in clinical drug trials. Congress later required state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for children in foster care's health and treatment. The oversight of psychotropic medication use for these children was briefly discussed in a 2007 congressional hearing on health care oversight. The oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care was discussed in congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals and develop oversight plans for children in foster care's health care, including mental health services. The 2008 law expanded requirements for states to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for children in foster care. In 2011, the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act further stipulated protocols for the use of psychotropic medication for these children. The Government Accountability Office reviewed state policies on prescribing psychotropic medications in six states. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed state policies for oversight of prescribing psychotropic medications in six states. The study compared state policies against best practice guidelines developed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) with support from HHS's SAMHSA. GAO found that each state fell short of providing comprehensive oversight, with only one state (Texas) fully implementing consent procedures as recommended by AACAP. States not incorporating these procedures may increase the risk of caregivers not fully understanding the risks and benefits of using psychotropic medications. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that states lacking consent procedures similar to AACAP's guidelines may increase the risk of caregivers not fully understanding the risks and benefits of using psychotropic medications. GAO recommended that HHS endorse guidance to state Medicaid and child welfare agencies on monitoring psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Witnesses discussed the need for increased cooperation and communication between HHS and state Medicaid programs to provide guidance on best practices for psychotropic medication oversight. A former foster youth shared his experience with multiple mental health diagnoses and side effects from prescribed psychotropic medications. In April 2013, the Senate Finance Committee held a roundtable discussion with child welfare stakeholders to address issues related to psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Current and former foster youth shared their experiences with these medications, with some noting that therapy helped them transition away from them. The importance of having an invested caregiver or knowledgeable support system was highlighted in the youths' stories. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care and the efforts of states and the federal government to ensure appropriate usage. Witnesses discussed the prevalence of medication use, promoting alternatives, tools for prescription decisions, and the roles of schools, mental health systems, and foster parents in the process. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing in May 2014 on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses included officials from HHS, GAO, a researcher, and Dr. Phil McGraw. GAO focused on their work from 2011 to 2014 related to psychotropic medication prescription among children in care, examining prescribing rates and documentation in five states. Experts found varying quality in documentation supporting the use of psychotropics among children in foster care. GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states regarding oversight of medication administered by third-party managed care organizations for children in foster care. The GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care, including monitoring by third-party managed care organizations. State agencies have developed practices to support appropriate mental health treatment for foster children, such as initial screenings and monitoring after medication is prescribed. State agencies in seven states have developed guidelines for prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting the use of psychosocial services for children in foster care. Strong collaboration among child welfare, Medicaid, and other agencies, along with outreach to stakeholders, was crucial for implementing oversight practices. The effectiveness of these state practices was not examined by the GAO. State officials use various measures to monitor psychotropic medication use for children in care, including physician prescribing practices, state oversight practices, and monitoring child outcomes. HHS has not convened meetings with stakeholders for oversight since 2014. GAO recommended cost-effective ways for HHS to collaborate with state stakeholders on this issue. HHS has implemented federal requirements for monitoring psychotropic medication use in states. The Obama Administration proposed expanding funding for oversight of psychotropic medications for children, including those in foster care. Federal agencies have collaborated to understand and promote best practices for monitoring psychotropic medication use among children. Interagency cooperation has led to the development of successful state strategies for oversight and alternative approaches for children with mental health needs. Under the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program, states must develop a coordinated strategy with Medicaid for health care access for children in foster care, including mental health and dental care. This strategy must include health screenings and address emotional trauma from maltreatment. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of health screenings, monitoring and treating health needs, updating medical information, ensuring continuity of health care services, oversight of prescription medicines, consulting with medical professionals, and ensuring appropriate medical treatment for children in foster care. The federal child welfare law requires state agencies to have a written plan for each child in foster care, including health-related records like immunizations, medication, and provider information. These records must be updated and provided to foster care parents or providers at each placement, and to the youth upon leaving care. The federal child welfare law mandates that state agencies maintain health-related records for children in foster care, including medication information. These records must be updated and given to foster care parents or providers at each placement, and to the youth upon leaving care. States report their policies on oversight of psychotropic medications to HHS through the Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Reports. This reporting requirement was established in 2011 under the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act. The APSR instructions under the Improvement and Innovation Act require state oversight protocols to address screening, evaluation, consent to treatment, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. Subsequent program instructions have been less detailed. HHS convened a working group in 2011 to address research on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. The working group led by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is focused on expanding evidence-based screening, diagnosis, and interventions for children in foster care regarding psychotropic medication use. It includes representatives from other HHS agencies like CMS and SAMHSA to strengthen oversight and monitoring of medications and psychosocial treatments. Medicaid and SAMHSA provide funding and support for services like screenings, therapy, and prescription drugs for children with trauma needs. In 2011, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS collaborated to address prescription medication management for children in foster care. Medicaid and mental health agencies play a crucial role in providing continuous support. The collaboration between ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS in 2011 addressed prescription medication management for children in foster care. State agencies were urged to collaborate on improving health, including medication use and monitoring structures. Webinars and information memoranda were provided to raise awareness about psychotropic use among children in foster care. In 2012, ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS continued collaboration on oversight of psychotropics through webinars and information sessions for child welfare stakeholders. They also organized question and answer discussions for state leaders to enhance monitoring practices. In August, a summit called \"Because Minds Matter\" was held to address psychotropic medication use and mental health needs of children in foster care. The \"Because Minds Matter\" summit aimed to improve collaboration among state leaders on psychotropic medication oversight for children who have experienced trauma. States were tasked with identifying areas for improvement, outlining activities to meet goals, and addressing anticipated challenges. Presentations from HHS staff and state teams covered various oversight topics. Following the summit, ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring psychotropic medication use. In April 2012, ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on monitoring the use of psychotropic medication for children in foster care. The guidance emphasized coordinated planning, shared decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. Additionally, ACF issued separate guidance on improving behavioral and social-emotional outcomes for children who have experienced abuse or neglect. ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on improving behavioral and social-emotional outcomes for children who have experienced abuse or neglect. The guidance discussed the impact of maltreatment on brain development and social-emotional development. ACF also published guides on tools for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications and on mental health issues for child welfare staff and foster parents. Additionally, ACF awarded funds to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs using evidence-based intervention models. ACF awarded funds to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs using evidence-based intervention models. SAMHSA provided partial funding to AACAP for developing guidelines on prescribing medications for children and youth. SAMHSA also funds a medical director position through a contract with the University of Maryland's School of Social Work to address issues regarding psychotropic medications. The medical director collaborates with child and adolescent psychiatrists in state and county governments to address psychotropic medication issues. They use a community listerv and webinars to share best practices, focusing on children on Medicaid. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs to oversee medication prescribing for Medicaid beneficiaries, with examples of oversight methods provided. Some states use review processes to oversee psychotropic medication use, such as automated edit checks and multidisciplinary teams. In 2015, CMS assisted state Medicaid agencies in improving the appropriate use of antipsychotic medications for children on Medicaid. Additionally, a new measure was added to core measures to help states improve healthcare delivery for children on Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The new measure applies to children receiving Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, emphasizing the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced complex trauma. The guidance highlights the need for proper screening, assessment, and treatment for children in foster care who may be prescribed psychotropic medication. The guidance emphasizes the importance of proper screening, assessment, and treatment for children in foster care who may not be prescribed psychotropics properly. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a joint initiative to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being. This would involve using functional assessments, trauma screening, mental health assessment, and outcome measurement to track progress. The initiative aims to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care by providing incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies. This includes performance-based payments totaling $500 million over five years and competitive grant funding of $250 million under the Title IV-E Foster Care program. States can apply for funding to improve care coordination and deliver evidence-based psychosocial interventions to Medicaid-eligible children served by child welfare agencies. ACF aims to build state capacity for implementing alternative psychosocial interventions for children in care, focusing on ensuring fidelity to evidence-based models and evaluating the work. Research has examined states' oversight of psychotropic medication use in foster care, including consent procedures and monitoring policies. Surveys have been conducted to understand states' policies on psychotropic medication oversight. Surveys conducted in 2009 and 2010 assessed states' policies and guidelines for overseeing psychotropic medication use in foster care. More than half of the states rated this issue as a high concern. At the time of the survey, 26 out of 48 states had policies or guidelines on psychotropic medication use, with some using \"red flag\" markers to identify safety issues. States were found to be implementing various approaches with little evidence. Researchers found that states had diverse approaches to psychotropic medication use in foster care, with concerns about the lack of systematic implementation and study of effective strategies. A 2014 study on 16 states revealed underdeveloped policies on oversight of psychotropic drug use, lacking essential criteria for monitoring. States have taken steps to address oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, with policies being underdeveloped in some studies. Some states have convened working groups and collaborated to improve oversight, such as the Psychotropic Medication Quality Improvement Collaborative involving representatives from child welfare and mental health agencies. The Psychotropic Medication Quality Improvement Collaborative involved representatives from state child welfare, mental health, and Medicaid agencies to define common terms and measures on psychotropic medication utilization among foster youth. They developed best practices in oversight and monitoring, with states implementing protocols in four key areas. The Center for Health Care Strategies is providing technical assistance to states on oversight of psychotropic medications. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II examined psychotropic medication use among children involved in child welfare due to abuse or neglect. Data was collected in 2008-2009, with follow-up surveys conducted 18 months later. A follow-up survey on psychotropic medication use among children involved in child welfare due to abuse or neglect was conducted at 18 and 36 months after the initial investigation. The study looked at children in foster care settings versus those in home settings. The follow-up survey found statistically significant differences in psychotropic medication use between children in foster care and those in home settings, with children in foster care more likely to be using medication at 18 and 36 months. No significant differences were found for children under age 6, but for children ages 6 to 10, the 18-month follow-up showed a significant difference. The 18-month follow-up survey showed statistically significant differences in psychotropic medication use between children in foster care and those in home settings, with children in foster care more likely to be using medication. For children ages 6 to 10, significant differences were found between the in-home and foster care groups at the 18-month follow-up, but not at the initial survey or 36-month follow-up. For children ages 11 through 17, significant differences were found at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up, but not at the initial survey."
