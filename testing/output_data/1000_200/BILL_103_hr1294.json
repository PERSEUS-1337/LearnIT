    "content": "Designation of military installations and certain communities as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas. Each military installation selected for closure or substantial realignment under a base closure law shall be designated as an enterprise zone by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The designated enterprise zone shall include the local community within the jurisdiction of the military installation. Additionally, the Secretary of Commerce shall designate the military installation as a redevelopment area. The Secretary of Commerce designates a military installation for closure or realignment as a redevelopment area within the local community's jurisdiction. This designation must occur within 60 days of the installation being recommended for closure or realignment in a base closure report to Congress. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 allows for the designation of enterprise zones in addition to existing ones authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. The course of action required for designated enterprise zones is outlined in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. Under subsection (a), funding for enterprise zones under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 can come from programs administered by the Secretary of Defense or Commerce for economic adjustment or community planning in relation to military base closures. The designation of a military installation as a redevelopment area remains valid for 5 years, with annual reviews conducted by the Secretary of Commerce to ensure compliance with designation requirements. The base closure law allows for the termination or modification of designated areas that do not meet requirements. Definitions include the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and substantial realignment as a significant reduction in military installation operations affecting 50% or more of personnel. 50% or more of personnel at a military installation may be reassigned or transferred to another base. Priority for commercial use of property on military installations designated as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas is emphasized. The amendment to Section 501(a) of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act prohibits the use of buildings on military installations designated as enterprise zones for homeless assistance until certified that they are no longer considered for commercial use. The amendment to Section 501(a) of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act prohibits the use of buildings on military installations designated as enterprise zones for homeless assistance until certified that they are no longer considered for redevelopment uses."
