Its foreign investment policy aims to benefit both the U.S. and foreign investors, with exceptions for national security risks. The Trump Administration has not formally outlined its foreign investment policy, but has expressed openness to foreign investment in line with its \"America First\" policy. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross stated at a June 2017 SelectUSA investment summit that the Administration welcomes foreign investment into the U.S. economy. The United States has a significant inward foreign direct investment position, totaling around $6.4 trillion in 2016, according to the United Nations. This is much higher than other countries like Hong Kong, China, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Switzerland. The Commerce Department uses three measures to publish data on U.S. direct investment position: historical cost, current cost, and market value, which align closely with UN calculations. In 2016, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States increased by $876 billion at market value, $390 billion at historical cost, and $390 billion at current cost. The total cumulative FDI reached $7.4 trillion at market value, $4.0 trillion at current cost, and $3.5 trillion at historical cost.

They have larger plant sizes, which may be due to age effects and startup costs that disappear over time.
