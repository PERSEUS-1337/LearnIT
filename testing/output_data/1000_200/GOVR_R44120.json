    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the two versions are resolved by a conference committee. This report highlights personnel-related issues of high interest to Congress and constituents, comparing House and Senate versions of the bills. The report summarizes key differences between the House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016 NDAA), which was signed into law as P.L. 114-92. The President vetoed an earlier version of the bill due to concerns about exceeding defense spending caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The President vetoed an earlier version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016 NDAA) due to concerns about exceeding defense spending caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74) raised the spending caps for both defense and nondefense spending, leading to the revised FY2016 NDAA being passed by the House and Senate. The amended version of S. 1356 (revised FY2016 NDAA) was passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President. The Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for these bills on various dates in 2015. Related CRS products provide detailed background information and analysis. Some issues discussed in the report were previously addressed in the FY2015 NDAA. Personnel issues were addressed in the FY2016 NDAA, with changes in authorized active duty end-strengths for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force over the past decade in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel but began reversing these increases due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints. Air Force and Navy end-strengths have generally declined since 2001. The FY2016 NDAA addressed personnel issues, with changes in authorized active duty end-strengths for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Budget constraints led to reductions in end-strengths for the Army and Marine Corps, while the Navy and Air Force end-strengths have been declining since 2001. The Army plans to reduce its active personnel strength to between 420,000 and 450,000 by FY2017, and the Marine Corps plans to reduce its active personnel strength to between 175,000 and 182,000 in the FY2017-2019 timeframe. The Administration's request proposed a reduction in Army strength but essentially level or increasing strengths for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force compared to FY2015. The FY2016 NDAA addressed personnel issues, with changes in authorized active duty end-strengths for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The end-strengths authorized in the final bill are identical to the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which is 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill would have repealed 10 U.S.C. 691, allowing the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel numbers. The FY2016 NDAA allowed for reductions in personnel numbers in the National Guard, Reserve, and active duty components, with adjustments to minimum end-strengths and expanded authority for the Secretary of Defense. This was in response to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the final bill aligning closely with the Administration's request. The FY2016 NDAA allowed reductions in personnel numbers in the National Guard, Reserve, and active duty components, with adjustments to minimum end-strengths. The Selected Reserves' authorized end strength has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. The authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves for FY2001 were: Army National Guard (350,526), Army Reserve (205,300), Navy Reserve (88,900), Marine Corps Reserve (39,558), Air National Guard (108,022), Air Force Reserve (74,358), and Coast Guard Reserve (8,000). The largest shifts in authorized end strength between FY2001 and FY2015 were in the Navy Reserve (-31,600 or -35.5%), Air Force Reserve (-7,258 or -9.8%), and Coast Guard Reserve (-1,000 or -12.5%). For FY2016, the Administration proposed changes in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for various reserve components. The proposed reductions were: Army National Guard (-8,200), Army Reserve (-4,000), and Marine Corps Reserve (-300). The proposed increases were: Navy Reserve (+100), Air National Guard (+500), Air Force Reserve (+2,100). The Coast Guard Reserve saw no proposed changes. The end-strengths authorized in the enacted bill were identical to the Administration's request. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%. This is in keeping with increasing concern with the overall cost of military personnel and congressional interest in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel for the all-volunteer military. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%, in line with Department of Defense plans to limit pay increases through FY2020. The DOD Budget Request Overview estimated a 2.3% increase in ECI annually for the next four years, with planned pay raises of 1.3% in FY 2017, 1.5% in FY 2018 and FY 2019, and 1.8% in FY 2020. The initial House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay, but emphasized the importance of robust compensation programs for maintaining a high-quality, all-volunteer, combat-ready force. The committee supports a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to maintain a high-quality, combat-ready force. The initial Senate version proposed a 1.3% pay increase for lower-ranking servicemembers and maintained the pay cap for higher-ranking officers. President Obama sent a statement on August 28 regarding the pay raise. President Obama invoked 37 U.S.C. 1009(e) to set the 2016 military pay raise at 1.3%, with no increase for general or flag officers. The final bill froze generals and admirals' pay at 2014 levels, as specified in P.L. 114-92. The military retirement system is a defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity to servicemembers after 20 years of service. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) provided recommendations to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services, which were included in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013. Congress has enacted changes proposed by the Commission in P.L. 114-92. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) will change the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service as a retention incentive. Existing servicemembers and those entering before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) changes the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service as a retention incentive. Existing servicemembers and those entering before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system, and those with less than 12 YOS on December 31, 2017 will be given the option to elect the new system. Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) adjustments enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 are repealed by this Act. The issue of sexual assault in the military has received significant attention from Congress and the media in recent years. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military revealed that 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014. Social retaliation was reported by 53% of those who experienced unwanted sexual contact, including adverse administrative action, professional retaliation, and punishment for reporting the assault. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified a need for the DOD to improve care for male sexual assault victims. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and male victims of sexual assault by enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifying requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. On January 24, 2013, the Department of Defense rescinded the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women in combat roles. By December 3, 2015, all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Contact [author name scrubbed] for more information. On December 3, 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced that all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress established gender-neutral occupational performance standards in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 and subsequent years directed the Department of Defense on their development and application. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for developing performance standards related to combat unit readiness. The FY2016 NDAA introduced new criteria for developing combat unit readiness performance standards. Changes in the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) shortened the waiting period for Congress to review and act on proposed changes regarding assignment policies for females in the military. This could provide a more definitive timeline for implementation for the Department of Defense and reduce the amount of in-session time needed for Congress to review changes. Enhancing personal financial management training programs for military servicemembers could have initial costs, but the Department of Defense estimates it would be beneficial. This was a finding of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission, highlighting weaknesses in existing financial literacy programs for servicemembers. Congressional reports have also addressed issues related to women in combat. Enhancing personal financial management training programs for military servicemembers could save the Department of Defense between $13 million and $137 million annually and reduce troops involuntarily separated due to financial distress. The enacted bill includes provisions for financial literacy training at various career points and life changes. The statutory requirements for enlistment in the active component differ slightly from those in the reserve components. Under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7504, an individual must be a U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or meet specific criteria outlined in the Compact of Free Association. Exceptions can be made if enlistment is deemed vital to national interest. Title 10, United States Code allows exceptions for enlistment in the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program if deemed vital to national interest. Enlistees must be U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have previous military service. The enacted bill did not link eligibility requirements for reserve and active components. In 2004, Congress established the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) to provide enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service in response to a war or national emergency. The Post\u20109/11 GI Bill, approved four years later, offered more generous benefits, leading to a recommendation to terminate REAP. The Senate-passed bill proposed a sunset date for REAP four years after the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The Modernization Commission established a sunset date for REAP four years after the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Only those using REAP in the enrollment period prior to the enactment date could continue using the program. The enacted bill contained the Senate provision. The Senate passed bill (H.R. 1735) proposes a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" for veterans leaving the Armed Forces, allowing them to verify their military service. The card would include the veteran's name and photo, and the Secretary of Defense could negotiate discounts for veterans with national retail chains. The Act authorizes the Secretary of Defense to negotiate discounts for veterans with national retail chains. Veterans can also use state-issued ID cards or obtain an ID card through the DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide identification cards to veterans who demonstrate their military service. Congress is interested in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel for the armed forces, using bonuses and incentives to attract qualified applicants. Section 531 of the House-passed bill (H.R. 1735) would authorize service secretaries to provide additional recruitment incentives. Section 531 of H.R. 1735 authorizes service secretaries to develop recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel, subject to congressional review. The enacted bill incorporated this provision. More information on recruitment and retention can be found in CRS Report RL32965. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 provides reservists with the right to reemployment after military service, with exceptions for certain types of duty. Congress created new mobilization authorities for reservists in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. In 2011, Congress established new mobilization authorities for reservists in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (P.L. 112-81), allowing 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. These activations are not currently exempt from the five-year cumulative limit. Section 565 of H.R. 1735 would exempt military duty under these authorities from counting towards the limit for reemployment protection under USERRA. The definition of a veteran for VA benefits requires active military, naval, or air service under conditions other than dishonorable. Full-time service in specified branches qualifies as active service. Active service for VA benefits includes full-time service in specified branches such as Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, as well as commissioned officers of the Public Health Service or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Additional circumstances of service are outlined in law. Members of the National Guard and reserves who are never activated for active duty military service do not meet the statutory definition of active service. Members of the National Guard and reserves who do not complete active duty military service do not meet the statutory definition of veteran, even if they qualify for reserve retirement after 20 years of service. The House bill proposed honoring these reservists as veterans without additional benefits, but this provision was not included in the enacted bill. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include the House provision to honor National Guard and reserve members as veterans without additional benefits. For more information on veterans' eligibility and benefits, refer to CRS reports R42324 and R41386. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for work/life balance or career development. The program aims to retain high-performing individuals by providing career flexibility. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) was initiated to provide career flexibility for high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. Participants accept additional active duty service obligations, with DOD required to report to Congress by March 1, 2016. The enacted bill removes restrictions on program participation and the limit on annual participants. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) aims to provide career flexibility for high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. Section 523 removes restrictions on program participation, allowing more officers and enlisted members to participate. Congress is focused on improving recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce, including providing incentives for high-performing military personnel in acquisition roles. Military acquisition professionals oversee significant funding for defense programs, and there is a need for qualified personnel in these roles. The Goldwater-Nichols Act incentivizes officers to be educated and experienced in joint matters for promotions. The NDAA extends joint duty credit to include acquisition-related assignments and allows officers to pursue a dual career track. NDAA also encourages including acquisition matters in joint professional military education curriculum. Phase II joint professional military education includes acquisition matters to ensure successful performance in acquisition or acquisition-related fields. DOD policies limit the carrying of government-issued firearms on military installations to personnel engaged in assigned duties, prohibiting military servicemembers from carrying personal firearms on bases. The bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would give more flexibility to commanders of military installations to establish protocols for servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection measures following recent active shooter incidents. The bill aims to provide flexibility to military commanders to establish protocols for servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection measures. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members killed or wounded in action, including by friendly fire or terrorist attacks. On April 19, 1995, a domestic terrorist bomb attack in Oklahoma City killed 168 people and injured over 650, including servicemembers. Debate surrounds their eligibility for the Purple Heart due to the nature of the attack. The NDAA for FY2015 expanded Purple Heart eligibility to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX. This was due to concerns over whether the attacks should be considered acts of terrorism. The law redefined what constitutes an attack by a \"foreign terrorist organization\" for Purple Heart eligibility. The law redefined criteria for Purple Heart eligibility to include attacks inspired by foreign terrorist organizations. However, servicemembers affected by the Oklahoma City bombing are not eligible. Military working dogs have also been a topic of congressional and media interest. The issue of military working dogs (MWDs) has received congressional and media attention over the years. Congress enacted laws related to the transfer and adoption of MWDs, including \"Robby's Law\" to prevent euthanizing MWDs and facilitate their adoption by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to adopt MWDs to include handlers, their family members, and wounded or retired handlers. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to adopt Military Working Dogs (MWDs) to include handlers, their family members, and wounded or retired handlers. The NDAA for FY2013 allowed retiring MWDs to be transferred for adoption, with a provision for transferring them to Lackland, Texas. The current law does not require DOD to transfer retired MWDs overseas back to the United States. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires DOD to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas to the United States for adoption priority to former handlers. The language change from \"may\" to \"shall\" mandates that all military working dogs be retired only after being returned to the US, facilitating domestic transfer to qualified adopters. However, opponents argue that the lack of appropriated funds for this transfer will be costly. The FY2015 NDAA added $100 million to the Defense Commissary System budget to reverse the proposed $1 billion cuts over three years. Congress has been focused on improving the system, but no legislated changes have been made. The FY2015 NDAA added $100 million to the commissary budget to reverse proposed cuts. The President's FY2016 budget proposed cutting $300 million in subsidies, potentially affecting operating hours and costs for patrons. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retirees, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians overseas. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report by March 1, 2016, detailing a plan to achieve budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system by October 1, 2018. The plan must include benchmarks for customer service satisfaction, product quality, and discount savings for eligible patrons. Potential modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, including privatization or closure of redundant facilities, will be analyzed. The Defense Secretary is required to submit a report by March 1, 2016, outlining a plan to achieve budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system by October 1, 2018. The plan will analyze potential modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, such as privatization, closure of redundant facilities, and different pricing structures to enhance benefits. The report will also consider Section 634 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, which includes options like using variable pricing and offering more private label products in commissary stores. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days. This is part of a program to increase private label products in commissary stores and convert the defense commissary system to a non-appropriated fund instrumentality. TRICARE is a health care program for uniformed servicemembers, retirees, and their dependents. The Administration proposed changes in the FY2016 budget to consolidate health plan options, increase pharmaceutical copays, and establish a new enrollment fee for TRICARE-for-Life. The Administration proposed changes in the FY2016 budget for TRICARE, including consolidating health plan options, increasing pharmaceutical copays, and establishing a new enrollment fee for TRICARE-for-Life. However, none of these proposals were adopted in the final report of the Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission or in the House- or Senate-passed versions of H.R. 1735. Congress may consider major changes to the TRICARE benefit in the future, but a deliberate approach is recommended. The committee recommends a deliberate approach to enacting TRICARE reform legislation to understand implications and unintended consequences. Provisions in the Act aim to improve access to care, health outcomes, beneficiary experience, and control costs, laying the foundation for future comprehensive TRICARE modernization. The joint explanatory statement commits to working with the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2017 to begin reforming the military healthcare system. The committee recommends a deliberate approach to enacting TRICARE reform legislation to understand implications and unintended consequences. The joint explanatory statement commits to working with the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2017 to begin reforming the military healthcare system, aiming to improve access, quality, and the experience of care for all beneficiaries. Modernizing the military healthcare system is necessary to meet future needs and ensure cost effectiveness. Increases to fees and co-pays will be necessary for comprehensive reform efforts. The Senate pharmacy provision for TRICARE beneficiaries includes access to military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, and TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy copayments at military pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. Non-formulary medicines are generally not available at military pharmacies. The 2015 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy copays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed annual copayment increases from 2016 to 2025. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) contains smaller copayment increases than initially proposed. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes a one-time increase in pharmacy copayments for prescriptions filled at retail and mail-order pharmacies. The copay for generic drugs at retail pharmacies increases from $8 to $10, and for formulary brand name drugs from $20 to $24. Mail-order copays increase from $16 to $20 for formulary drugs and from $46 to $49 for non-formulary drugs, resulting in an estimated $1.5 billion reduction in direct spending over 10 years. Personnel Issues: Recent news articles highlighted concerns about the quality of healthcare in the military health system. A 90-day review led to an action plan by former Secretary of Defense Hagel. Some Members of Congress are interested in the plan's implementation. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include the demanding provisions of the initial Senate bill, resulting in potentially lower costs. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include the demanding provisions of the initial Senate bill, resulting in potentially lower costs. TRICARE covers various forms of birth control when prescribed by a TRICARE-authorized provider, as reported by the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for contraception and counseling for DOD health care providers. It also mandates comprehensive counseling on contraception for all women in the Armed Forces. TRICARE does not cover condoms or nonprescription spermicidal products."
