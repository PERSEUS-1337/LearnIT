    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on public education campaigns, patient informed consent, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. The Act also contains findings related to cord blood education and awareness. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are responsible for a significant number of deaths in the United States, particularly among children and young adults. Many leukemia patients requiring bone marrow transplants do not have a matched donor, highlighting the importance of umbilical cord blood stem cells as a potential solution. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have been effectively used in treating various blood diseases, with over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years. They are a rich source of stem cells for transplantation, especially for children, resulting in a lower rate of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow. Cord blood cells have also been successful in treating nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders such as aplastic anemia and sickle cell anemia. Umbilical cord blood cells have been used effectively to treat various nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders such as aplastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, severe combined immunodeficiencies, and leukodystrophies. These cells contain different types of stem cells that can differentiate into various cell types in the human body, reduce inflammation, and promote tissue repair. Clinical research is ongoing to explore their potential in treating type 1 diabetes, brain injury, and cerebral palsy. Research is underway to study the use of autologous cord blood cells to treat various conditions such as type 1 diabetes, brain injury, and cerebral palsy. Preclinical research also shows promise in treating hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and congenital heart valve defects. Over 90% of cord blood cells from more than 4,000,000 births in the US are discarded annually. Only a quarter of states require expectant parents to receive information about banking cord blood. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine recommended establishing a national hematopoietic stem cell bank program. The Institute of Medicine recommended establishing a national hematopoietic stem cell bank program in 2005. They suggested that donors should be provided with clear information about their options for banking cord blood cells and that informed consent should be obtained before labor and delivery. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN.\" is a condensed version of the previous information about establishing a national hematopoietic stem cell bank program and providing clear information to donors about their options for banking cord blood cells. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must develop a publication on umbilical cord blood within a year of this Act, explaining its value, uses, differences between autologous and allogeneic use, and public vs. private cord blood banking. The publication on umbilical cord blood must explain the differences between public and private cord blood banking, as well as the options available to mothers for stem cell storage after delivery. This includes donating to a public bank, storing in a private family bank, or using a family donor banking program. The publication on umbilical cord blood should cover the differences between public and private cord blood banking, options for stem cell storage after delivery, medical processes for collection, family history criteria, ownership options, and cost of banking. It should also include information on public and private cord blood bank availability. The publication should include information on public and private cord blood banking, including a list of public and accredited private cord blood banks in the US, availability of free family banking and sibling donor programs, and which racial and ethnic groups are in need of publicly donated cord blood samples. The Secretary will develop a patient informed consent document on cord blood disposition, to be signed by expectant women before delivery. The document will include information on cord blood banking options, the medical value of cord blood stem cells, and a declaration of the chosen disposition option. SEC. 5. Duty of certain professionals to disclose information to, and obtain informed consent from, pregnant patients. Physicians providing ambulatory prenatal care must disclose information on umbilical cord blood banking options to pregnant women before the third trimester. Written informed consent regarding cord blood stem cells must be obtained or documented at least 2 weeks before the woman's estimated delivery date. Physicians must disclose cord blood banking options to pregnant women before the third trimester and obtain informed consent at least 2 weeks before delivery. Medicaid regulations require healthcare professionals providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women to ensure consent for cord blood stem cell disposition. Physicians providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women must comply with Medicaid regulations regarding cord blood banking options and informed consent. Non-compliance may result in payment reductions to the State. Additionally, CHIP regulations also require healthcare professionals to adhere to similar requirements. Employer group health plans under ERISA must inform pregnant women about blood cord banking, as mandated by new subsections added to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. This requirement aligns with Medicaid regulations for ambulatory prenatal care. The insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage must ensure that physicians providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women comply with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. This aligns with Medicaid regulations for prenatal care. The amendments made by this subsection apply to physicians and other health care professionals for agreements and arrangements entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary will create educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for healthcare providers offering prenatal services. Additionally, targeted education grants will be provided. The Secretary may make grants for targeted education on umbilical cord blood stem cells to healthcare providers, minorities, families with genetic diseases, and populations affected by conditions treated with cord blood stem cells. Authorization of appropriations is provided. Authorization of appropriations totaling $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 annually from 2011 to 2014 is provided to carry out the Act."
