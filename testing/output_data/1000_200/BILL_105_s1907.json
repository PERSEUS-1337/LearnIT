    "content": "REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR WETLAND RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION EXPENSES: Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on wetland restoration and conservation expenses. The wetland restoration credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit against their tax for the taxable year, including wetland restoration, conservation, and easement credits. The wetland restoration credit is based on expenditures for restoring farmed or converted wetlands to their natural state, following an approved restoration plan.

The wetland restoration credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for restoring farmed or converted wetlands to their natural state.

The wetland restoration credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for restoring farmed or converted wetlands to their natural state. The credit is based on the applicable percentage of the soil-specific Conservation Reserve Program rental rate and any certification fees paid for compliance with a qualified conservation agreement related to the wetland. The applicable percentage varies based on the term of the conservation agreement, ranging from 50% to 70% for different durations. Taxpayers can also elect for a wetland easement credit, which is based on the fair market value of qualified wetlands subject to a conservation easement. The wetland easement credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit based on the fair market value of qualified wetlands subject to a conservation easement. The value is determined by a certified appraisal of the wetland in agricultural use during the taxable year. An election under this subsection applies to the taxable year for which it is made. The wetland easement credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit for qualified wetlands under a conservation easement. Qualified wetlands include wetlands being restored to full functionality through wetland restoration expenditures. The wetland restoration expenditures aim to convert wetlands to fully functioning condition, including surrounding nonwetland areas for water quality or wildlife habitat values, with limitations on nonwetland acreage. The term 'wetland', 'farmed wetland', and 'prior converted wetland' are defined by the Food Security Act of 1985. A 'qualified conservation agreement' is an agreement with a governmental unit for a minimum of 10 years. A qualified conservation agreement with a governmental unit must be for a term of 10-30 years, with the taxpayer agreeing to comply with conservation requirements and obtain certification every 5 years. Compliance includes not using the wetland for prohibited activities. The taxpayer complies with conservation requirements by not using the wetland for agricultural production and avoiding any activities that would enable such use. This includes not draining, dredging, filling, or manipulating the wetland in a way that impairs its natural state. The term 'qualified conservation easement' refers to an easement granted in perpetuity by the taxpayer to restrict the use of a wetland for conservation purposes. No credit is allowed for expenses that receive deductions or funds from other programs. The section discusses expenses that are not eligible for credit if funds are received from other programs. Married couples must file joint returns for the section to apply. Conforming amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1998."
