    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pre-K for USA Act.\" Congress finds that the United States ranks 25th in early learning enrollment, with studies showing that access to high-quality prekindergarten programs leads to academic success and reduces the likelihood of negative outcomes such as grade repetition, dropout, and criminal behavior. Public investment in prekindergarten programs yields a significant return, with every dollar spent resulting in $7 saved on other services. Children who attend prekindergarten have higher GPAs, are more likely to attend college, and are less likely to have drug problems or commit felonies. However, many school districts do not offer prekindergarten programs, with some only providing part-day programs. Texas missed out on millions in federal funding to expand prekindergarten programs due to budget cuts in education funding. Certain local governments funded full-day prekindergarten programs in response to education funding cuts in Texas. Localities, including local governments and educational agencies, would benefit from direct application for Federal program funding for prekindergarten. SEC. 3. PREKINDERGARTEN DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will award competitive grants to increase capacity for high-quality prekindergarten programs. Grants will be awarded for up to 3 years and applications must be submitted by Governors or chief executive officers of eligible entities. The Secretary may require specific information for grant applications. States must consult with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care when applying for grants. To be eligible for a grant, a State or local entity must contribute at least 20% in non-Federal matching funds. To meet the matching funds requirement, a State or local entity can use non-Federal funds or in-kind contributions. The Secretary can waive or reduce the matching funds for entities facing financial hardship. The Secretary can waive or reduce matching funds for entities facing financial hardship when applying for a grant. Grant recipients can use funds to award subgrants to carry out activities, with subgrantees required to comply with grant requirements. The Secretary cannot award a subgrant to a local entity for a program in a fiscal year if the State has already done so. Authorization of Appropriations: $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2016 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2017 through 2025 are authorized for programs under this section. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
