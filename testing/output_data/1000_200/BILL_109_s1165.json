    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge to promote the recovery of 4 endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. They lease 240 acres of wetland habitat and have a contract to purchase the land to protect the habitat and improve Refuge management. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has identified approximately 800 acres of high-value wildlife habitat owned by the estate of James Campbell for inclusion in the Refuge. The land features coastal dunes, wetlands, and coastal strand that support various threatened and endangered species, including Hawaiian waterbirds, migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, seabirds, native plant species, monk seals, and green sea turtles. Expanding the Refuge will provide increased opportunities for wildlife-dependent public uses, including wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education. Acquisition of the land will create a single, large, ecologically-intact unit with buffer land to reduce impacts on the Refuge and prevent flood damage in the town of Kahuku. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
