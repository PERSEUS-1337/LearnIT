    "content": "For the first 100 years of the electric power industry, electricity generation was centralized in large power plants. In response to the 1970s energy crisis, Congress promoted distributed generation, including customer-sited generation. One policy to encourage this is net metering, defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 as allowing customers to offset energy provided by the utility with energy generated on-site. State net metering policies, particularly regarding solar photovoltaic energy, play a significant role in discussions about renewable energy sources in the nation's electricity system. These policies interact with federal and state incentives, renewable portfolio standards, and carbon pricing to determine the deployment of distributed solar energy sources. Recent state policy changes are expected to expand the use of net metering and impact stakeholders. Some states have modified their net metering policies recently, affecting stakeholders and solar energy development. Congress could choose to restrict, encourage, or require state policy changes related to net metering. This report discusses background information and current issues on net metering policies, which determine compensation for electricity delivered to the grid by customers with distributed generation. Net metering compensates customers for electricity delivered to the grid on a one-to-one basis with electricity purchased. Different policy options include buy-all, sell-all, and net billing. This report focuses on net metering policies and their impact on solar energy development. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place that require utilities to offer net metering to customers, with some policies including alternatives to net energy metering. Almost 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in the United States in 2018, accounting for about 1% of electricity customers. In 2018, almost 2 million electricity customers in the United States participated in net metering, accounting for about 1% of all customers. Participation increased from 2013 to 2018, with varying levels by state. Hawaii had the highest participation rate at over 15%. In many states, less than 0.1% of electricity customers participate in net metering, with Hawaii having the highest participation rate at over 15%. Factors influencing participation rates include state policies, electricity prices, and solar resource quality. Electricity ratemaking involves allocating total costs to customers, with various complexities and local factors at play. Ratemaking is the process of allocating total costs to customers for electricity production and delivery by utilities. State regulators approve rates for investor-owned utilities to recover costs through customer bill payments, including building and operating power plants and complying with regulations. The costs of building and operating power plants, maintaining transmission systems, utility operating costs, programmatic costs, and return on investments are factors considered in setting rates. Volumetric rates are commonly used, where customers pay a rate per kilowatt-hour. Bills vary monthly based on electricity consumption. Customers' bills vary monthly based on electricity consumption. Regulators estimate a volumetric rate to cover utility costs shared among all customers. Customer charges, like fixed values for services, are separate from volumetric charges on bills. The customer's bill includes volumetric charges based on kWh consumed and a fixed customer charge. Some customer classes, like large industrial facilities, may have special system modifications and pay demand charges in addition to volumetric charges. States with net metering have different compensation approaches, impacting distributed generation markets. Net metering policies impact distributed generation markets by influencing the value proposition for customers. States commonly compensate net metering customers at the utility's retail rate of electricity, known as net energy metering (NEM). Initially, policymakers viewed the retail rate as a suitable proxy for rate setting, considering NEM as a simple approach during uneconomic market conditions for solar PV and other distributed generation technologies. Retail rates provide high compensation for net metering generation, reflecting the total costs incurred by the utility for delivering electricity. This approach was acceptable during uneconomic market conditions for solar PV and other distributed generation technologies. The initial decisions about NEM assumed the retail rate was a close proxy for the value of solar or DG, with a small number of participating customers and kilowatt hours credited at the retail price. Retail rates for electric utility customers reflect total costs incurred for delivering electricity, including generating electricity and maintaining the grid. Net metering participation may be encouraged due to quicker recovery of upfront costs for a DG system. Compensating net metering customers at retail rates could lead to increased costs for non-net metering customers, known as a cost shift or cross-subsidy. This arises from the allocation of total utility costs among all customers, as net metering customers reduce utility-provided electricity needs but not necessarily other utility services. Net metering customers may not reduce the utility's costs for maintaining the grid, leading to potential cost increases for non-net metering customers. Concerns over equity arise as net metering customers tend to have higher incomes, raising questions about cross-subsidies. Studies vary on the extent of cross-subsidization between net metering and non-net metering customers. Studies have conflicting views on the extent of cross-subsidies between net metering and non-net metering customers, with methodological differences contributing to the lack of consensus. Local factors like DG penetration and electricity demand growth can also impact observed cross-subsidies. Estimates from around 2015 suggest net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per net metering customer annually, prompting debate on the threshold for policy intervention. Net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per customer annually. Observers may disagree on the need for policy action. A 2017 study assessed various factors affecting electricity rates, finding that DG would likely cause rate increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to up to 3.6 cents/kWh from other factors. The presence of a cost shift does not necessarily mean money is being transferred between customers. Non-net metering customers may transfer money to net metering customers, depending on participation rates and regulatory decisions. Addressing cost shifts through ratemaking processes could be delayed due to inherent time lags. Cost shifts are not unique to distributed generation (DG), and states are exploring more precise allocations of system costs and benefits to net metering customers. Some states are considering adding fixed charges to address concerns about potential cross-subsidies from retail rate compensation. States are considering adding fixed charges to net metering customers' bills to address concerns about potential cross-subsidies from retail rate compensation. This approach allows utilities to recover costs for grid maintenance while maintaining some advantages for net metering customers. Utilities and advocates for low-income customers support this approach, claiming it reduces cost shifting. Opponents of adding fixed charges to net metering customers' bills include the solar industry and environmental advocates, who argue that net metering promotes competition and societal benefits. Determining the value of fixed charges accurately reflecting customers' grid use has been complex and controversial. Some states have adopted alternative compensation rates to represent energy costs utilities avoid when customers supply their own energy. The avoided cost rate, also known as an energy rate or wholesale rate, represents the energy costs utilities save when net metering customers generate their own energy. This rate primarily reflects energy production costs and may involve network upgrades for reliable integration of distributed generation like solar PV. It is usually lower than retail rates and can be estimated by regulators or through wholesale electricity markets. The value of solar (VOS) rate for net metering customers with solar PV reflects societal benefits like reduced air emissions. Solar advocates support including societal benefits in net metering policy. VOS rates are typically higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates, with the potential for states to set VOS rates higher than retail rates based on solar benefits. New York is one state implementing a related compensation rate for distributed energy resources (DERs), not just solar, reflecting grid and societal benefits. Debates on compensation approaches include considering costs and benefits, quantifying them, and addressing time- and location-specific challenges. States vary in their approaches to setting rates for net metering arrangements. States vary in their approach to evaluating net metering, with differences in compensation, program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership affecting distributed generation deployment. Program caps, also known as aggregate capacity limits, set restrictions on customer participation and generation capacity in distributed generation programs. These caps can be expressed in various units and are crucial in influencing the promotion of DG under a state's net metering policy. They serve to mitigate risks to the electricity system, prevent cross-subsidies, and minimize financial impacts on utilities, but they can also hinder the achievement of other policy objectives. States set program caps to limit customer participation in distributed generation programs, which can impact achieving renewable energy goals. Generation sources for net metering are specified based on capacity limits and technology type, with solar energy being dominant. Factors like cost, customer type, and location influence participation of non-solar projects, such as combined heat and power facilities for large commercial and industrial customers. Net metering customers, especially those with surplus generation, can deliver excess electricity to the grid and receive compensation based on state policies. Credits for surplus generation can be carried over to the next billing period, with varying retention policies across states. Net metering customers can reduce their electricity costs to $0 by carrying over credits to the next bill. Different provisions exist for credit retention policies, allowing for various arrangements such as single generator setups or shared net metering for farms, municipalities, and community solar projects. Virtual net metering applies to shared projects located onsite, like multi-family dwellings. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation addressing aspects of states' net metering policies, including proposals that would influence state policies directly. For example, S.Amdt. 3120 in the 114th Congress aimed to limit state regulators' ability to reduce compensation rates for net metering customers or add fixed charges to their bills. Another proposal, S.Amdt. 3053, would have required state regulators to consider the presence of cross-subsidies in their net metering policies. H.R. 4175 in the 116th Congress also addressed net metering policies. In the 114th and 116th Congress, legislation was introduced to address net metering policies. S.Amdt. 3053 required state regulators to consider cross-subsidies in net metering policies. H.R. 4175 in the 116th Congress proposed net billing policies for community solar. Other bills called for studies on the costs and benefits of net metering, including a DOE report requested by Congress in 2017. Additionally, S. 346 and H.R. 1009 in the 116th Congress aimed to study various aspects of net metering."
