The bill funds mandatory retirement accounts in Title VI and occasionally addresses financial regulation issues in additional titles. Financial regulatory agencies are funded outside of the appropriations process. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, except for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. President Trump submitted his FY2018 budget request on May 23, 2017. The CFTC funding is part of the total funding for FSGG independent agencies. President Trump's FY2018 budget requested $3.1 billion for independent agencies, including $330 million for the CFTC. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a bill with $253 million for FSGG agencies and $248 million for the CFTC in the Agriculture appropriations bill. This total of $501 million was significantly lower than the President's request, with the main difference in funding for the General Services Administration. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3354, which included most of the text from H.R. 3280, with amendments totaling $488 million for FSGG independent agencies.

FY2018 enacted appropriations in both P.L. 115-141 and P.L. 115-123 totaled $4.7 billion for the FSGG agencies, $1.6 billion above the original request, with much of this difference resulting from the emergency funding for the SBA.
