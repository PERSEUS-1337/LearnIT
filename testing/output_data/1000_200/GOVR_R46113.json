    "content": "This report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020, comparing enacted FY2019 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request, and the enacted appropriations measures. It also provides additional informational resources on DHS appropriations and lists CRS policy experts for consultation. The CRS reports on homeland security appropriations track legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. The report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. It explains budgetary concepts and terms related to appropriations legislation, such as budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, and adjustments to discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act. Additional resources for understanding the appropriations process are also provided. The data used in this report for FY2019 annual appropriations are derived from the conference report accompanying P.L. 116-6, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. Amounts in narrative discussions may be rounded to the nearest million, unless noted otherwise. FY2019 supplemental appropriations data are drawn directly from two enacted measures: P.L. 116-20. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) includes funding from various enacted measures for natural disasters, security, and humanitarian needs at the U.S.-Mexico border. Data for FY2020 levels are drawn from different accompanying reports and enacted levels. The FY2020 funding levels for the Department of Homeland Security are based on data from S.Rept. 116-125 and P.L. 116-93. The scoring methodology is consistent and does not compare with OMB data due to technical differences. Previous reports included OMB data on mandatory spending, but it is no longer included for consistency. The Trump Administration released a detailed budget request for FY2020 for the Department of Homeland Security, requesting $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The full budget proposal was delayed due to a lapse in FY2019 annual appropriations. The overall budget estimated by the Office of Management and Budget was $92.08 billion. The Trump Administration requested $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security in FY2020, with an overall budget estimated at $92.08 billion. This included a $2.27 billion increase from the previous year's appropriations. Additional funding was also requested for FEMA and Overseas Contingency in the Department of Defense budget. The House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 3931, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, which included $52.80 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. This was $1.12 billion above the Administration's request and $3.39 billion above the enacted level for FY2019. The bill also included $14.08 billion in disaster relief-designated funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up S. 2582, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, including $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, exceeding the Administration's request by $1.50 billion and the FY2019 enacted level by $3.77 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up S. 2582, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, with $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, exceeding the Administration's request by $1.50 billion and the FY2019 enacted level by $3.77 billion. The increase in funding was mainly due to $5 billion allocated for border barrier construction, compared to $1.38 billion in FY2019. Both House and Senate committees allocated more discretionary funding for various agencies, including the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and FEMA. Additionally, the Senate committee bill included $17.35 billion for disaster relief and $190 million for the Coast Guard. Congress passed a continuing resolution on September 27, 2019, to extend funding at the FY2019 rate through November 21. On September 27, 2019, Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) (P.L. 116-59), extending funding at the FY2019 rate through November 21, later extended through December 20. P.L. 116-59 included provisions for Secret Service expenses, Disaster Relief Fund, National Flood Insurance Program, and DHS management activities restructuring. Section 101(6) extended immigration provisions linked to appropriations cycle. On December 16, 2019, the House Rules Committee released two consolidated appropriations bills, with one including the FY2020 DHS annual appropriations measure. The bill included $50.47 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.22 billion below the Administration's request and $1.06 billion above the FY2019 level. $17.35 billion was allocated for FEMA in disaster relief funding. The FY2020 DHS annual appropriations bill included $17.35 billion for FEMA in disaster relief funding and $190 million for the Coast Guard. It was passed by the House and Senate with strong bipartisan support and signed into law on December 20, 2019. The bill provides funding for all DHS departments and components, with discretionary appropriations making up the majority of the budget. The DHS budget consists of a mix of funding sources, including fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles, with the first four grouping components thematically and the fifth providing general direction to the department. When DHS was established in 2003, existing account structures were used for resource allocation. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure to standardize appropriations format across components. In 2014, DHS started working on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format. The CAS aimed to streamline over 70 different appropriations and over 100 Programs, Projects, and Activities to improve transparency and decision-making. By FY2017, DHS implemented the CAS, converting legacy appropriations structures into four categories. The Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) was implemented by DHS in FY2017 to standardize appropriations format. It converted legacy appropriations structures into four categories: Operating Salaries and Expenses, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance. These categories provide funding for various missions and activities within DHS components. The Federal Protective Service and USCG's Retired Pay are two appropriations not included in the CAS structure. The FPS account allows funds to be spent as needed, while USCG's Retired Pay supports retired personnel entitlements. The Retired Pay appropriation for retired USCG personnel and their dependents is categorized as appropriated mandatory spending, with no permanent statutory mechanism in place to provide funds. FEMA receives separate appropriations for its disaster relief activities, allowing for more consistent tracking of spending over time. The National Flood Insurance Program is funded through a mix of mandatory and discretionary appropriations, including operating expenses, salaries, commissions, taxes, interest on borrowings, and flood mitigation actions. Appropriations language is required to allow fees collected by the government to be spent on certain program functions. Prior to FY2017, appropriations included specific conditions on how budget authority could be used. In the FY2017 act, provisions within appropriations and general provisions were grouped as \"administrative provisions\" at the ends of titles. This report tracks changes in these provisions compared to the prior year's measure, noting additions, modifications, and removals for various reasons. The report discusses adjustments needed for provisions in appropriations due to various reasons, including changes in priorities between chambers. It categorizes the 15 components of DHS into Law Enforcement Operational Components, Incident Response and Recovery Operational Components, and Support Components. The report categorizes the 15 components of DHS into Law Enforcement Operational Components, Incident Response and Recovery Operational Components, and Support Components. Each group's role is briefly described, along with their FY2019 enacted and FY2020 appropriations. Funding for law enforcement operational components is generally provided in Title II of the annual DHS appropriations act. Funding for law enforcement operational components in DHS is typically provided in Title II of the annual appropriations act. This title includes agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, and U.S. Coast Guard, each with specific responsibilities related to security and enforcement. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) protects the President, Vice-President, and investigates financial crimes. Budgetary resources for these components are controlled through appropriations legislation. The House Appropriations Committee's H.R. 3931 had 31 administrative provisions for Title II, dropping eight provisions from the FY2019 act related to ICE, TSA, and USCG operations.

Funding for operational components focused on incident response and recovery is generally found in Title III of the annual DHS appropriations act, including funding for FEMA and the National Flood Insurance Program. Title III of P.L. 116-93 includes funding for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the Stafford Act. CISA, formerly known as the National Protection and Programs Directorate, focuses on information sharing for cybersecurity and infrastructure resilience. FEMA leads efforts to protect the US from natural disasters and other hazards. FEMA leads federal efforts to protect the US from all hazards, including natural disasters and terrorism, through a comprehensive emergency management system. Table 4 breaks down budget resources for FEMA, including appropriations from outside Title III in FY2019. H.R. 3931 had eight administrative provisions. H.R. 3931 and S. 2582 had administrative provisions related to FEMA funding.

The Departmental Management Directorate offers mission support services. Analysis and Operations cover intelligence sharing and operations coordination. The Office of Inspector General is also included. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent body that reports on DHS efficiency and effectiveness, preventing waste, fraud, and abuse. Table 8 breaks down budgetary resources for DHS components controlled through appropriations legislation, including the Management Directorate. Funding for headquarters components in the annual DHS appropriations act is traditionally in Title I. The table shows the annual appropriation for DHS headquarters components in H.R. 3931 (Title I), with changes in administrative provisions. The House bill dropped two provisions and added one for an Immigration Detention Ombudsman. The Senate bill retained all six provisions without modifications. The Senate Appropriations Committee retained all six administrative provisions in Title I without changes, while P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included seven administrative provisions with minor modifications. The annual DHS appropriations act typically includes general provisions that provide guidance or structure to DHS appropriations, with little more than updates to dates or amounts. The FY2019 DHS appropriations act and H.R. 3931 included general provisions providing policy direction, with some modifications and new additions. Several provisions from the FY2019 act were not retained in the House committee version of H.R. 3931, including restrictions on detainee transfers from Guantanamo Bay and the use of funds to hire unauthorized workers. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill, S. 2582, included provisions such as reductions in administrative spending, restrictions on implementing the Arms Trade Treaty, and required spending cuts as alternatives to proposed fee increases. Additionally, modifications were made to provisions from the FY2019 act, including reductions in DHS budget authority and rescissions of prior-year appropriations. The FY2019 DHS Appropriations Act included provisions for DHS financial systems modernization, grants for local law enforcement costs for Presidential protection, and restrictions on using funds for a Principal Federal Official during a declared disaster. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, included 40 general provisions in Title V, with two provisions dropped from the FY2019 act. The last four general provisions in the FY2019 DHS Appropriations Act rescinded various amounts of funding from different sources within DHS, including emergency appropriations for CBP and unobligated balances. New policy-related provisions were also introduced. These provisions directly impacted the funding in the bill, including the Financial Systems Modernization initiative and a grant program for Presidential Residence Protection costs. In the FY2019 DHS Appropriations Act, Financial Systems Modernization and Presidential Residence Protection Cost grants were managed by different components within DHS. H.R. 3931 included funding for the grants but not for the modernization initiative. S. 2582 did not provide additional appropriations for DHS activities. P.L. 116-93, Div. D, allocated $41 million for the grants. Rescissions of prior-year appropriations were also included in the bill.

The budget process involves budget authority enacted by Congress, funds obligated by federal agencies, and payments made to liquidate those obligations. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than authorized. Budget authority can be indefinite in amount. Budget authority enacted by Congress may be indefinite in amount and available on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Obligations are incurred when federal agencies engage in transactions, creating a legal requirement for the government to pay. Outlays are the funds actually spent during the fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending not mandated by existing law. Outlays are the funds actually spent during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. The federal budget authority includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated yearly by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs require annual appropriations. An example within DHS is Coast Guard retirement pay, which is a form of appropriated mandatory spending. Coast Guard retirement pay within DHS is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the federal government through business-type transactions, not considered federal revenue but counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Mandatory spending elements are entitlement programs where eligible entities receive payments as established by law. The DHS budget includes entitlement programs for individuals, businesses, or government units meeting qualifications for certain payments. Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, there are Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress but contribute to the gross budget authority. The President's budget determines the gross budget authority using 302(a) and 302(b) allocations. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual budget resolution, which are then allocated to congressional committees. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary funds available for enactment in annual appropriations bills, while the appropriations committees further allocate these funds among their subcommittees for each bill. The appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds among subcommittees for appropriations bills, known as 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments can be made during the year by the appropriations committee. Table A-1 shows 302(b) allocation figures for FY2020. The House full committee markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill exceeded its discretionary allocation by $3.066 billion, later revised to $1.9 billion. These provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS annual appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending, with adjustments made through subsequent legislation. Most of the budget for DHS is considered nondefense spending. The Budget Control Act allows for adjustments to statutory caps for DHS funding, including nondefense spending. Adjustments cover overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and other specific purposes. Justifications outlined in the Act have influenced DHS appropriations, with varying limitations on different categories. The Budget Control Act allows for adjustments to statutory caps for disaster relief funding. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula for determining the allowable adjustment, increasing it by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020 estimating the allowable adjustment at $17.5 billion. In August 2019, OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020 estimating the allowable adjustment at $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history. This estimate includes the 10-year average, 5% of Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The final adjustment for FY2020 may still vary from this estimate."
