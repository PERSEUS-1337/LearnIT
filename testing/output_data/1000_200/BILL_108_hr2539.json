    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Violence Against Children Act of 2003\". Congress finds that children under 18 make up a significant portion of crime victims, with high rates of sex crimes and kidnapping. Adolescents aged 12-17 are more likely to be victims of violent crime than adults. Only 28% of crimes against children are reported, with 1,200 children dying from abuse annually and 879,000 being victims. Child abuse has lasting negative effects on children and families, leading to delayed development, depression, substance abuse, and increased risk of domestic violence in adulthood. Local agencies often lack resources to support children and families in need, leading to issues such as delayed development, depression, substance abuse, and increased risk of domestic violence. Failure to pay child support contributes to neglect, resulting in children living in poverty and facing challenges in education, healthcare, and housing.
