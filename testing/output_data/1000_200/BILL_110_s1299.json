The Borrower's Protection Act of 2007, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, defines key terms related to home mortgage loans, mortgage brokers, and mortgage originators. The Borrower's Protection Act of 2007, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, defines key terms related to home mortgage loans, mortgage brokers, and mortgage originators. It includes provisions regarding the acceptance of applications, solicitation, negotiation of terms, and sales of home mortgage loans. The term 'qualifying bond' is defined as a bond equal to at least 1 percent of the aggregate value of all homes appraised by an appraiser in connection with a home mortgage loan in the previous calendar year. The term 'rate spread mortgage transaction' refers to a home mortgage loan with a specific annual percentage rate. The qualifying bond benefits homeowners with claims against the appraiser and creditors who acted in good faith. Assignees or subsequent transferees can also benefit if the originating creditor qualified for such treatment. The term 'rate spread mortgage transaction' defines a home mortgage loan with an annual percentage rate that triggers reporting under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Mortgage brokers have a fiduciary relationship with consumers and must adhere to fiduciary requirements under State or Federal law. Mortgage originators must also act in fair dealing. Each mortgage originator must act with reasonable skill, care, and diligence, as well as in good faith and fair dealing in any transaction. They are required to assess the borrower's ability to repay before facilitating any home mortgage loan, including verifying the ability to pay principal, interest, real estate taxes, and insurance fees. The ability to pay for a home mortgage loan is determined by the maximum possible monthly payment during the first 7 years, based on the maximum interest rate and a repayment schedule for full amortization. Verification documents are required for this assessment. For mortgage originators to determine a borrower's ability to pay, verification documents such as tax returns and bank records are required. This assessment also considers the debt-to-income ratio and residual income of the borrower. The borrower's statement of income and financial resources alone is not sufficient verification for assessing the ability to pay. Rate spread mortgages require monthly payments into an escrow account for taxes, insurance, and flood insurance if applicable. The text discusses exceptions to requiring escrow payments for rate spread mortgages and prohibits steering by mortgage originators in connection with home mortgage loans. A mortgage originator is prohibited from steering consumers towards unfavorable rates, charges, or terms. If unable to offer a beneficial home loan, they must assist the consumer in finding one from another creditor. A mortgage originator must not steer consumers towards unfavorable terms and must assist in finding a beneficial home loan from another creditor if they cannot offer one themselves. In connection with a home mortgage loan, a mortgage originator is prohibited from mischaracterizing credit history, property values, or discouraging consumers from seeking loans elsewhere. In the appraisal process for a home mortgage loan, a mortgage originator must ensure that the appraiser acts in good faith and fair dealing with the consumer. This includes conducting the appraisal accurately and ethically. The appraisal for a home mortgage loan must be conducted accurately and ethically. Issues may arise if the appraiser has a conflict of interest, provides inaccurate information, charges excessive fees without proper coverage, or includes loan amount or property value estimates in the appraisal order. The mortgage originator is prohibited from influencing appraisers to target specific values for home mortgage loans. It is not a defense to claim that another person was used in the appraisal process. The mortgage originator must provide a copy of the appraisal report to the applicant for a home mortgage loan, regardless of the loan outcome. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include provisions for mortgage originators under section 129A."
