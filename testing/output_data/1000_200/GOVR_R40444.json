    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms. These groups include children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults, who may be covered under the CHIP state plan or special waiver authority. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under age 19 without health insurance and not eligible for Medicaid under previous rules. States can set the income level for these children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. States have the authority to expand eligibility for all children under 19, with CMS approval required for certain expansions. CHIPRA expands eligibility for all children under 19 to any level they choose. States seeking CMS approval to expand eligibility will have reduced federal CHIP payments for higher-income CHIP children. States can cover these children under Medicaid or create a separate CHIP program. When states provide coverage to low-income children, they can do so through Medicaid or a separate CHIP program. Federal funds for the program come from CHIP funds, with different rules applying depending on the program. Title XXI does not guarantee benefits but provides federal allotments to states with approved CHIP plans. Targeted low-income children covered under a CHIP-funded Medicaid expansion are entitled to program benefits. States can cover low-income children by expanding Medicaid in various ways, such as creating a new eligibility group or adjusting existing financial rules. Many states opt to cover these children under existing Medicaid pathways rather than establishing a new optional coverage group under Title XXI, reducing administrative burden. Medicaid allows states to cover low-income children through various pathways, including expanding Medicaid or creating a separate CHIP program. States can determine eligibility based on factors like geography, age, income, and disability status. Before CHIPRA, states could also cover adult pregnant women in different ways. Before CHIPRA, states had multiple options to cover adult pregnant women, including through Section 1115 waivers, CHIP state plan amendments, or a family coverage option. As of October 2007, 17 states provided pregnancy-related services to adults using CHIP funds, with 6 states using waivers and 12 states extending coverage through state plan amendments. In FY2008, 12 states offered pregnancy-related services to unborn children under CHIP SPAs, with California having the highest enrollment. CHIPRA introduced a new option for states to cover pregnant women under CHIP through state plan amendments, with specific conditions to meet. Pregnant women must meet income requirements and other eligibility restrictions to receive CHIP coverage during pregnancy and postpartum period. States can provide temporary enrollment for up to two months for presumptive eligibility. Benefits include prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, with infants born to these women eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. CHIPRA allows pregnant women to receive CHIP coverage for prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care. Infants born to these women are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP until age one. States can also offer postpartum services and cover legal immigrants after a five-year bar, taking into account their sponsor's income and resources. The law requires sponsors' income and resources to be considered for immigrants (excluding refugees and asylees) who have signed an affidavit of support. CHIPRA allows states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children lawfully residing in the US. The CHIP state plan option is available for states that elect to provide assistance for pregnant women. The provision allows states to extend coverage under Medicaid and CHIP for pregnant women, ensuring that the cost of care will not count against an individual's sponsor. Eligibility redetermination requires individuals to provide further documentation if their initial legal residence proof is no longer valid. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act grants broad authority to modify CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility. The Social Security Act grants the Secretary of HHS authority to modify CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to populations not typically eligible. Some states used waivers to cover adults with CHIP funds, initially effective for five years and subject to renewal every three years. Waiver renewals for adult coverage have not been approved since 2007 in some states, leading to transitions out of CHIP coverage for adult populations. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to use CHIP funds to extend coverage to certain childless adult populations, and 7 states have such authority to cover parent populations. CHIPRA terminates CHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of calendar year 2009. States with existing childless adult waivers that were in effect during FY2009 are permitted to apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage for these individuals subject to a specified budget neutrality standard. Budget neutrality standards for succeeding fiscal years will be tied to waiver spending in the preceding fiscal year under CHIPRA. Coverage of parents is allowed for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers that were in effect during FY2009. Beginning in FY2012, allowable spending for parents under the waivers will be subject to a set-aside amount from a separate allotment and matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP. States must prove they meet certain coverage benchmarks to receive enhanced FMAP. Even states meeting the benchmarks in FY2013 will receive an amount between the regular and enhanced FMAPs for parents. Waiver spending for parents with family income exceeding eligibility thresholds as of February 4, 2009, is prohibited under CHIPRA. CHIPRA provisions include bonus payments and $100 million in outreach grants for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment. Funds will target underserved populations, rural areas, and address cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. States must describe procedures to reduce barriers as part of the outreach requirements. CHIPRA provisions include outreach grants for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, targeting underserved populations and addressing cultural and linguistic barriers. States must describe procedures to reduce administrative barriers and create a state option to rely on \"Express Lane\" agencies for eligibility determinations. Under CHIPRA, states have the option to use Express Lane eligibility determinations for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, allowing automatic enrollment with family consent. States can rely on reported income from tax records and inform families about potential benefits. CHIPRA also eliminates the need for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP applications. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required proof of citizenship and identity for Medicaid applicants. CHIPRA allows states to use Social Security Numbers for verification. CHIPRA also mandates citizenship documentation for CHIP applicants. Table 1 displays each state's CHIP program type and eligibility data. Table 1 displays each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility limits, and enrollment data. New Jersey has the highest upper income eligibility limit at 350% of the FPL for children in CHIP. CHIP coverage above 250% FPL is available in 11 states, the District of Columbia, and certain children up to age two in California. Enrollment in CHIP reached nearly 7.4 million children in FY2008, with about 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adult populations. In FY2008, enrollment in CHIP reached nearly 7.4 million children, with about 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million targeted low-income children under Medicaid. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adult populations, with 335,000 adults enrolled in FY2008. Most of these adults were parents, while some were childless adults or pregnant women. The number of CHIP-enrolled adults decreased from previous years due to waivers not being renewed or scaled back. Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota reported more adult CHIP enrollees than children in FY2008. In FY2008, states may cover low-income children under Medicaid or create a separate CHIP program. States using Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must provide mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to enroll children in new benchmark benefit plans. States can choose to cover low-income children under Medicaid or create a separate CHIP program with benchmark benefit plans. Children under age 21 in Medicaid eligibility groups must receive benefits through the EPSDT Program, including well-child care and necessary medical services. Separate CHIP programs can offer benchmark benefit packages, equivalent coverage, or other health benefits plans. States that choose to create separate CHIP programs may elect from three benefit options: a benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or any other health benefits plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Benchmark benefit packages include plans from Blue Cross/Blue Shield, state employee health coverage, or the largest HMO in the state. Benchmark-equivalent coverage has the same actuarial value as a benchmark benefit package. Benchmark-equivalent coverage is a package of benefits with the same actuarial value as a benchmark benefit package. It must cover basic benefits like hospital services, physician services, lab services, and well-child care, as well as at least 75% of the actuarial value for additional services like prescription drugs, vision, and hearing services. States are encouraged to cover other services, but abortions are only allowed in specific circumstances. CHIP programs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories do not cover abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. Different states use Medicaid expansions, separate state programs, or a combination approach for their CHIP programs. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under CHIP, ensuring financial requirements for these services are met. Under CHIPRA, state CHIP plans must ensure that financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health or substance abuse benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. Separate cost-sharing or treatment limitations for mental health services are not allowed. CHIP plans covering EPSDT services are considered to meet these requirements. Additionally, dental services are now a required benefit under CHIP programs. Under CHIPRA, dental services are now a required benefit under separate CHIP programs, including services to prevent disease, promote oral health, restore oral structures, and treat emergency conditions. States have the option to provide dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages modeled after other medical plans. The new law also includes provisions for dental education for parents of newborns and services through federally qualified health centers. States must report detailed information in their annual reports for EPSDT reporting purposes. Under CHIPRA, dental services are now a required benefit under separate CHIP programs. States must report detailed information on children receiving various types of dental care. GAO will conduct a study on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for improving access. Prior to CHIPRA, CHIP funds could not be used for children enrolled in employer-sponsored coverage. CHIPRA provided a state option for dental-only supplemental coverage to children enrolled in group or employer coverage who meet CHIP eligibility criteria. States can offer dental coverage consistent with new dental benchmark benefits plans or cost-sharing protections under CHIP, setting the income level up to their separate CHIP programs. Certain conditions must be met, including implementing the highest income eligibility permitted in federal CHIP statute as of January 1, 2009. States may not impose enrollment limitations or waiting lists for children applying for CHIP benefits. They must provide benefits to all eligible children without favoring dental-only supplemental coverage. States have the option to waive eligibility waiting periods for children receiving dental-only coverage. Under CHIP, states can share costs for employer-based health insurance if it is cost-effective and does not replace existing coverage. Premium assistance programs must meet CHIP minimum benefits and cost-sharing requirements. Medicaid allows premium assistance if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective. Enrollment in an employer plan is considered cost-effective if paying the premiums, deductible, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations is less expensive than the state's expected cost of providing Medicaid-covered services. States must provide \"wrap-around\" benefit coverage for services not included in private plans to meet Medicaid requirements. Many employer plans and states find it prohibitive to meet all these requirements, leading to the use of waivers in CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs. CHIPRA introduced a new state plan option for premium assistance and required outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for eligible families. States have the option to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance. Premium assistance may not require CHIP eligible individuals to enroll in an employer's plan, allowing them to choose regular CHIP instead. The premium assistance subsidy for CHIP eligible individuals can be used to cover the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for children in employer plans. A wrap-around is required for employer plans that do not meet CHIP benefit requirements. No cost-effectiveness test is needed for child coverage using premium assistance. CHIPRA establishes a separate test for family coverage, where the subsidy can be used to pay the entire family's premium if it is cost-effective. CHIPRA allows states to establish employer-family premium assistance purchasing pools for eligible individuals. Premium assistance can be used to cover the entire family's premium in states that offer this subsidy. The new premium assistance provisions under Medicaid apply to children in a Medicaid-expansion CHIP program. Coordination between public and private coverage is streamlined, with the loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility considered a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. The provision in CHIPRA allows states to establish employer-family premium assistance purchasing pools for eligible individuals, making the loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Cost-sharing in health insurance plans includes out-of-pocket payments like premiums, deductibles, and copayments. States can impose cost-sharing for some beneficiaries and services under CHIP, following Medicaid's nominal cost-sharing rules for low-income children. The Medicaid program allows for cost-sharing for children in families with income above 100% FPL, with premiums and service-related cost-sharing varying based on income levels. Premiums are allowed for children in families above 150% FPL, with service-related cost-sharing up to 20% of the cost of the item or service rendered. Above 150% FPL, premiums are allowed with service-related cost-sharing up to 20% of the cost. Total cost-sharing cannot exceed 5% of family income. Preventive services for children are exempt. Special rules apply to cost-sharing for prescription drugs and emergency room copayments. States can condition Medicaid eligibility on premium payment. Providers may deny care for non-payment. CHIP may impose premiums based on family income. If a state implements CHIP through a separate state program, premiums or enrollment fees may be imposed based on family income. Premiums for families under 150% FPL in separate state programs are limited by federal Medicaid regulations. Cost-sharing for lower-income families is nominal, while slightly higher for families with income between 100%-150% FPL. Families above 150% FPL may face cost-sharing up to 5% of family income, with no less for higher-income children. States must inform families of these requirements. Cost-sharing for higher-income children in CHIP is subject to a 5% out-of-pocket limit of family income. States must inform families of these limits and provide a way to stop payments once the limit is reached. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families, including newborn visits, physical exams, immunizations, and dental services. CHIPRA 2009 aimed to expand and improve data. CHIPRA 2009 aimed to expand and improve data collection and reporting for diagnostic dental services under CHIP and Medicaid, including developing child health quality measures and reporting formats. Reporting requirements were added to states' annual CHIP reports, such as data on eligibility criteria and access to primary and specialty care. GAO is to conduct a study on children's access to care under Medicaid and CHIP. CHIPRA 2009 established the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) to review policies affecting children's access to benefits. The commission will provide regular reports to Congress with recommendations for improving access and quality of care for children under Medicaid and CHIP. Additionally, the Secretary of HHS is required to conduct a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans to assess their impact on uninsured children. The federal evaluation of CHIP will assess outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, disenrollment factors, and retention issues. Federal financing includes appropriations for states' CHIP allotments, reallocation of funds, and other factors like matching rates and administrative expense caps. BBA 97 allocated around $40 billion for CHIP from FY1998 to FY2007. The funding for CHIP varied annually from FY1998 to FY2007, starting at $4.2 billion and dropping to under $3.2 billion in FY2002-FY2004 before increasing again. The \"CHIP dip\" in funding during FY2002-FY2004 was due to budget constraints. The 110th Congress passed bills to reauthorize CHIP for FY2008-FY2012, but they were vetoed by President George W. Bush. CHIP funding for FY2008 through FY2012 was vetoed by President George W. Bush. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 provided funds for CHIP allotments until March 31, 2009. CHIPRA allocated $68.9 billion for CHIP allotments from FY2009 to FY2013. The annual federal CHIP appropriations increased from $10.562 billion in FY2009 to $17.406 billion in FY2013. The allotment among states is determined by a formula set in law, based on the number of low-income uninsured children in each state. The CHIP allotment process changed to calculate state allotments individually based on a national appropriation. Each state has a separate funding account available for two years, with payments drawn from the earliest active account. FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are the largest of three. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are calculated based on the state's FY2008 federal CHIP spending and allotment, as well as the state's own projections of federal CHIP spending for FY2009. The largest of these three amounts will be increased by 10% to serve as the state's FY2009 federal CHIP allotment, with reductions if the national appropriation is insufficient. For FY2010, the allotment for a state will be calculated based on four amounts multiplied by the growth factor for the year. For FY2010, a state's allotment is calculated based on four amounts multiplied by the growth factor for the year. For FY2011 and FY2013, the allotment will be \"rebased\" using prior year spending. For FY2012, the allotment is calculated based on the previous year's allotment and any Contingency Fund spending. Unspent allotments expire at the end of the period. The FY2011 allotment and Contingency Fund spending are multiplied by the state's growth factor. Unspent allotments are redistributed to other states at the end of the period. BBA 97 stated that states must exhaust allotments within three years to receive unspent funds. In FY2006, additional funds were appropriated to cover projected shortfalls in 12 states. Illinois and Massachusetts had higher CHIP spending than expected, resulting in shortfalls. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent FY2004 allotments was redistributed. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent FY2004 original CHIP allotments was redistributed due to higher spending in Illinois and Massachusetts. A bill was passed to specify how the funds would be redistributed to states facing funding shortfalls for fiscal year 2007, delaying shortfalls until the end of March 2007. In March 2007, the NIHRA redistributed unspent FY2005 original CHIP allotments to delay shortfalls, providing an additional $138 million for shortfall states. P.L. 110-28 was enacted on May 25, 2007, further addressing funding issues. In May 2007, P.L. 110-28 allocated $650 million to cover federal CHIP fund shortfalls in 10 states for FY2007. In FY2008, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2005 allotments and provided up to $1.6 billion for states' shortfalls. Actual funding in FY2008 was just under $1 billion. For FY2009, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2006 allotments to states facing shortfalls before March 31, 2009. For FY2009, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2006 allotments to states with projected shortfalls before March 31, 2009. CHIPRA increased FY2009 allotments to prevent federal funding shortfalls. A Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was created to avoid states experiencing CHIP funding shortfalls. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was created under CHIPRA to prevent states from facing federal funding shortfalls. Payments from the fund can be made to states with CHIP children above target enrollment levels, capped at 20% of the national allotment amount. The federal government matches state spending for CHIP, with the state's share being 30% lower than under the regular FMAP. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. Federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses is limited, with a 10% cap on state non-benefit expenses. Under CHIP, a 10% cap applies to state non-benefit expenses for federal matching purposes. This cap is tied to the dollar amount that a state draws down from its annual allotment to cover benefits and non-benefit costs. Federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach and enrollment activities, funded by an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009."
