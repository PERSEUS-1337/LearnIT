    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% pay adjustment under H.R. 2673, signed into law by President George Bush. The law H.R. 2673, signed by President Bush in January 2004, provided a 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. This adjustment was allocated as an average 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality pay increase. The President issued Executive Order 13332 to implement this adjustment, and OPM published revised salary tables for 2004 on March 4, 2004. Federal white-collar employees are entitled to an annual pay adjustment and locality-based comparability payment under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of 1990 provides a locality-based comparability payment effective in January each year. The annual pay adjustments are not based on the cost of living. In 2003, federal white-collar employees received a combined annual and locality pay adjustment of 4.1%. If granted as specified by FEPCA, the net pay increase would have been 18.56%. The report discusses the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under various schedules. It does not cover salary adjustments for federal officials, judges, or Members of Congress. The President may adjust salaries of administrative law judges, and individuals in senior-level and scientific positions may receive the annual adjustment at the discretion of agency heads. Annual adjustments for contract appeals board members depend on Executive Schedule pay adjustments. The pay adjustment is based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI), reflecting changes in private sector wages and salaries. The ECI indicates a 2.7% across-the-board pay adjustment in January 2004. In 2001 to September 2002, private sector wages and salaries changed by 3.2%, with a subsequent decrease of 0.5%. The President can issue an alternative plan for pay adjustments in case of a national emergency or serious economic conditions. President Bush issued a 1.5% annual pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented through Executive Order 13322. GS employees receive locality-based comparability payments, which may also extend to employees in the Foreign Service and senior-level positions. In 2004, GS employees and certain non-General Schedule employees will receive a locality pay adjustment. OPM clarified limitations on pay caps for non-GS employees in December 2001. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System have a prevailing rate adjustment capped at the average pay adjustment for white-collar employees, but in 2004, their pay adjustment will not be less than that of GS employees in the same location. In 2004, blue-collar workers in Alaska, Hawaii, and non-foreign areas will receive a pay adjustment no less than GS employees in the RUS pay area. Special rate employees get the higher of special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers under Section 403 of FEPCA receive both special rates and locality pay. Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the US get a COLA allowance instead of locality pay. The locality-based comparability payments procedure was established by FEPCA to address pay disparities greater than 5% within each locality for GS employees. FEPCA established locality-based comparability payments to address pay disparities greater than 5% within each locality for GS employees. The President has the authority to set an alternative level of payments in case of a national emergency or serious economic conditions. President Bush issued an alternative plan in August 2003. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, to provide a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal rates of pay in 32 pay areas nationwide, transitioning from the Occupational Compensation Survey Program to the National Compensation Survey program for locality payments starting in January 2004. The National Compensation Survey (NCS) program was not approved for use with locality payments in January 2000-2003, but a phase-in was approved for January 2004. Survey results are submitted to OPM to compare federal and non-federal salaries by grade in each pay area. The goal is to reduce the pay gap to 5% annually, with OPM adjusting the average percentage pay gap to this level, known as the target gap. FEPCA mandates closing a percentage of the pay gap between GS and non-federal salaries each year. The gap closure percentages have been lower than specified, with 44% closed in 2003. OPM recalculates the gap after each adjustment. FEPCA requires closing a percentage of the pay gap between GS and non-federal salaries each year, with 44% closed in 2003. Locality rates recommended by the Pay Agent to the President are based on pay gaps from 22 months prior to the adjustment date. NCS surveys were not used for determining locality payments in previous years but are being phased in for 2004 payments. The gaps for 2003 locality payments were determined using OCSP and NCS survey data from 2000-2001. The Federal Salary Council explained the process for determining pay gaps for the 2004 locality payments. The Federal Salary Council reported that in March 2002, the pay gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries was 32.02%. To reduce this disparity to 5%, a 25.73% increase in locality pay was recommended for 2004. The recommended locality pay raises ranged from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas to close the pay gap. The comparison of 2003 and 2004 locality payments showed increases from 11.90% to 25.23%. The nationwide average net pay increase in 2004 would have been 15.15%. Areas with pay gaps below the RUS pay area were recommended to receive the same adjustment. The Federal Salary Council recommended that areas with pay gaps below the RUS pay area receive the same adjustment in 2004. The council also recommended including pay areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS in the surveys. Locations like Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis were not to be dropped as separate pay areas at that time. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining locations like Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis as separate pay areas for now. The council plans to review commuting patterns and population data before making any changes to locality pay area definitions. The Federal Salary Council recommended maintaining separate pay areas for locations like Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, and St. Louis. The council also discussed criteria for defining new metropolitan areas, with an exception being considered for Barnstable County, MA, which does not currently have 2,000 GS employees but meets other criteria for inclusion in the Boston pay area. The Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 to address an egregious situation. St. Mary's County, MD was recommended to be included in the Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD pay area, while Santa Barbara County, CA and New London, CT were also discussed for inclusion in their respective pay areas despite falling below the employee threshold. The council recommended that New London, CT, and Santa Barbara County, CA continue to be areas of application for their respective pay areas in 2004. They noted upcoming changes in locality pay area definitions due to new census data and plans to review the locality pay program in 2003. The council recommended including Monterey County, CA in the San Francisco pay area in 2004. Rhode Island was designated as an area of application to the Boston pay area but due to its small size, the council recommended adopting \"Full State\" criteria for it. Rhode Island is considered as a single county and meets the criteria for inclusion in the Boston pay area in 2004. Edwards Air Force Base, although no longer meeting employment criteria, is recommended to continue being included in the Los Angeles pay area for commuting reasons. The council recommended including Edwards Air Force Base in the Los Angeles pay area for commuting reasons in 2004. The council also recommended improvements to the BLS National Compensation Survey program, including using three factors to assign federal grade levels to non-federal jobs. OPM and BLS have developed a new evaluation system for occupational families, with BLS phasing it into surveys in December 2003. BLS has created an econometric model to estimate salaries for jobs not randomly selected in surveys. OPM formed an interagency working group to match federal job classifications with the new Standard Occupational Classification System. Additional improvements are expected in the crosswalk, with updated GS employment information provided to BLS annually. BLS and Pay Agent staff have designed a new approach for grading supervisory occupations based on the highest level of work supervised. Final tests of the new approach are scheduled for this fall, with implementation in surveys by December 2003. BLS has also developed methods to exclude non-Federal jobs classified above GS-15 from the data delivered to the Pay Agent. The council recommended excluding non-Federal jobs above GS-15 from data delivered to the Pay Agent and expressed concerns about the reliability of NCS data. They suggested that further use of NCS data should be contingent on BLS implementing improvements and increasing sample sizes in areas with significant pay gaps. The OPM published final regulations in 2003 regarding the definitions of metropolitan areas for locality pay areas, which no longer change automatically. OMB revised definitions for Metropolitan Statistical Areas in 2003, but OPM stated it would not immediately impact the General Schedule locality pay program. The OPM modified GS locality pay regulations in 2003 to align with new statistical area definitions, allowing for review by the Federal Salary Council and President's Pay Agent. Changes included the removal of 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas' and the introduction of 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas'. The Federal Salary Council working group reviewed new OMB definitions and changes to locality pay areas, recommending consideration of using the new MSA definitions for the pay program. Additional study was requested before any decisions were made. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, with additional study needed before making any decisions. If implemented, 83 counties would be added to existing metropolitan locality pay areas, while 10 counties would be excluded. The changes in MSAs are attributed to demographic shifts and criteria modifications. The working group recommended using Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) for pay adjustments in January 2005, expanding pay area definitions, and merging three pay areas with low pay gaps into RUS. The council's recommendations were tentatively approved by the Pay Agent and President. OPM will publish proposed changes in locality pay in 2004 for public comment. In 2004, OPM will publish proposed changes on locality pay in the Federal Register for public comments. An amendment to H.R. 2989 was agreed to by the House of Representatives, stating that funds in the Transportation/Treasury bill cannot be used to disestablish any pay locality. Representative Farr testified before the Federal Salary Council about the pay reduction issue. Ernest Istook agreed to collaborate with Representative Farr on the issue of pay reduction for federal employees in Monterey County, California. Senator Jack Reed introduced an amendment (S.Amdt. 1944) similar to Representative Farr's, which was approved by the Senate. The amendment ensured that no funds from the Transportation/Treasury bill could be used to remove any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This amendment did not apply to RUS. The amendment in H.R. 2673, Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, prevented funds from being used to enforce regulations inconsistent with the Federal Salary Council's recommendations for locality pay areas in FY2004. The Pay Agent submitted a report on 2004 locality payments based on the council's recommendations. The Pay Agent recommended against implementing locality pay increases in January 2004 due to the national emergency and economic slowdown. They expressed concerns about the current pay adjustment process for Federal employees and suggested exploring alternative compensation approaches. The Pay Agent's report recommended against implementing locality pay increases in January 2004 due to the national emergency and economic slowdown. They did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts, in the Boston locality pay area. The cost of the January 2004 locality-based comparability payments would be $8.830 billion according to the Pay Agent. The Pay Agent recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, focusing on issues with random job selection, matching federal and non-federal jobs, and assigning GS grades. They look forward to reviewing the NCS data next year and stated that the last two improvements will affect data delivered in 2005. The Pay Agent recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, focusing on random job selection, matching federal and non-federal jobs, and assigning GS grades. They encouraged expediting the remaining improvements to impact data in 2005. President George W. Bush proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment in the FY2004 budget without specifying allocation between annual and locality adjustments required by FEPCA. The President proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment in the FY2004 budget, without specifying how it would be allocated between annual and locality adjustments required by FEPCA. He issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, calling for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, with 1.5% allocated for annual and 0.5% for locality pay. The President proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment in the FY2004 budget, with 1.5% for annual and 0.5% for locality pay. The cost of the adjustment was estimated at $2 billion. An alternative plan suggested by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003, implemented the pay adjustment along with a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. This fund aimed to reward high-performing employees and was authorized by Section 1129 of P.L. 108-136. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004 (H.R. 1588) was enacted on November 24, 2003, with a recommended appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund in H.R. 2989. Funding was contingent upon the approval of a performance pay plan by the OPM Director. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend an appropriation for the fund, believing that such initiatives should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. Funding was not provided in H.R. 2989 as passed by the Senate, and the bill was later incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The Senate incorporated H.R. 2989 into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, providing $1 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund. The funding required OPM approval and could be transferred to federal agencies for performance pay plans. This provision was enacted in P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The President's alternative plan for pay raises above 2% could lead to hiring freezes in agencies. Federal employee union representatives expressed disappointment with the 2.0% pay adjustment. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule system due to the resources needed to maintain it and the constant tinkering required for equal pay. They proposed a broad-band system with fewer pay grades, allowing managers to set individual pay based on competence and performance. Several agencies are already implementing pay banding systems. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule system and implementing broad pay bands for federal employees. Pay parity provisions were included in P.L. 107-123 and new HRM systems were authorized in P.L. 107-296 and P.L. 108-136 for civilian employees of the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense. Congress annually considers federal white-collar pay adjustments. In January 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003, Congress set overall pay adjustment amounts. Resolutions in 2003 expressed Congress's support for parity between military and civilian pay increases, but these resolutions are nonbinding and do not require the President's signature. The House Committee on the Budget report included language supporting equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military in the FY2004 budget. The budget proposes a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. The Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004 (H.Con.Res. 95) was passed by the House of Representatives on March 21, 2003. The Budget report accompanying the bill stated that civilian employee compensation should be adjusted in the same proportion as military compensation. The Senate version of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget included the same language as the House. The Concurrent Budget Resolution sets the framework for Congress to consider spending legislation. Congressional recommendations on civilian federal pay adjustments are typically included in appropriations bills. The Transportation, Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill includes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, with no specific division between annual and locality pay adjustments. The bill was approved by the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies and the House Committee on Appropriations. The House Committee on Appropriations approved H.R. 2989 on July 11, 2003, with a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The bill was later reported favorably to the House of Representatives and passed on September 9, 2003, despite opposition from the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration opposed a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, proposing a 2.0% raise instead. They argued that civilian and military pay linkage is unnecessary and suggested a Human Capital Performance Fund for higher pay raises for high-performing federal employees. The Administration expressed concerns about unfunded civilian pay increases exceeding inflation rates. The Administration is concerned about unfunded civilian pay raises exceeding inflation rates, costing DOD about $660 million and Government-wide about $2.1 billion. They are disappointed that the bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The 4.1% pay adjustment in the bill exceeds inflation, statutory base pay increase, and average private-sector pay increase. However, it does not address Federal employee turnover issues. The 4.1% pay adjustment in the bill exceeds inflation rates and average private-sector pay increase but does not address Federal employee turnover issues. A recent survey shows that Federal employees are satisfied with their pay rate and have a low quit rate. Providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security could limit their flexibility in designing new personnel and pay systems. S. 1589, the Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, includes a 4.1% pay adjustment. The Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and General Government approved a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. This adjustment was included in the Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill. Section 636 of the amendment provides a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The pay increase would be absorbed within appropriated levels. The Senate passed H.R. 2989 on October 23, 2003, incorporating the pay adjustment recommendation from the Federal Salary Council's methodology working group. H.R. 2989 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, effective from January 1, 2004. The pay raises were required to be funded within appropriated levels, and there was a recommendation to include certain counties in Massachusetts in the Hartford, CT pay area. President Bush signed H.R. 2673 on January 23, 2004, which became P.L. 108-199, providing a 2.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The pay adjustment included 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality increases, costing about $4.1 billion. OPM issued revised salary tables for 2004 the next day, showing recommended locality payments and net pay increases. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355, Federal White-Collar Pay: FY2005 Salary Adjustments. Congress could examine ways to amend FEPCA to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%. The pay gaps for each of the 32 discrete pay areas are adjusted to derive a target pay gap, with the goal of closing a percentage of the target pay gaps each year. However, only a small percentage has been closed annually, resulting in a significant pay disparity between non-federal and federal salaries, averaging 25.73% in 2004. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since the enactment of FEPCA in 1993. The data completeness varies greatly among survey areas, with concerns about the methodology for setting federal pay adjustments. Despite these concerns, no proposals were made to change FEPCA. Previous survey data had to be aged for locality payments in 2000-2003. Congress directed a report on methodological concerns in P.L. 106-554. The Pay Agent reported methodological concerns to Congress in May 2001 and improvements to the survey methodology are underway. A white paper on compensation was issued by the Office of Personnel Management in April 2002, and a study by the Congressional Budget Office in November 2002 compared salaries of federal General Schedule employees with nonfederal employees in similar jobs. The Congressional Budget Office compared salaries of federal General Schedule employees with nonfederal employees in similar jobs. Results showed that federal employees in professional and administrative occupations tended to earn less than private firms, while those in technical and clerical occupations had salaries closer to private levels. This comparison highlighted concerns about the federal pay system. CBO found that the federal pay system lacks variation in pay raises by occupation, leading to disparities where some occupational groups receive above-market salaries while others receive below-market salaries. This undermines the aim of providing federal pay comparable to nonfederal jobs, as envisioned in FEPCA. The implementation of FEPCA raises concerns about pay disparities among federal workers, with some occupational groups receiving above-market salaries and others below-market salaries. The cost of fully implementing FEPCA is estimated to be $8.830 billion, with unions advocating for pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military. The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) and AFGE endorse pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military, criticizing the President's proposal on federal pay as inadequate and disregarding FEPCA. Issues with the Department of Labor's methodology in determining federal pay comparability with the private sector are highlighted, with concerns about the locality and Employment Cost Index components. The Pay Agent's methodology problems have spread to the Employment Cost Index component, affecting recommended locality payments for January 2004. The report suggests adjustments for locality pay increases, considering the national emergency and economic slowdown. The Executive Orders by U.S. President Bush in 2004 delayed locality pay increases due to the national emergency and economic slowdown. The orders provided annual pay adjustments and locality-based comparability payments. The 2004 pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) with the annual adjustment percentage and locality payment. The resulting pay rates are compared with 2003 rates to determine the net increase in pay. Salary tables for 2004 can be found online at http://www.opm.gov. MSA and CMSA refer to different Metropolitan Statistical Areas."
