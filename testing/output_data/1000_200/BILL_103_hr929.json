Additionally, it mentions the coordination of collection of domestic service employment with the collection of income taxes. SEC. 3510 discusses the coordination of collection of domestic service employment taxes with income taxes. The general rule for domestic service employment taxes requires returns to be filed on a calendar year basis by the 15th day of the fourth month following the employer's taxable year. No deposits or installments are required for these taxes. Domestic service employment taxes are subject to estimated tax provisions under section 6654. For domestic service employment taxes, the calendar year is used for tax purposes, with adjustments made as needed. The term includes taxes on remuneration for domestic service in a private home. The IRS imposes taxes on remuneration for domestic service in a private home, excluding certain services. Employers liable for other employment taxes may be exempt from these specific taxes. The Secretary has the authority to create necessary regulations for implementation. The Secretary has the authority to prescribe regulations for domestic service employment taxes and may enter agreements with states to collect state unemployment taxes on remuneration paid for domestic service in a private home of the employer. The Secretary can enter agreements with states to collect state unemployment taxes on remuneration for domestic service employment in a private home of the employer. Any taxes collected will be treated as domestic service employment taxes and transferred to the State's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Amounts collected under the agreement will be considered a tax imposed by chapter 23 for purposes of subtitle F. The term 'State' is defined as per section 3306(j)(1). The amendments in Sec. 3510 coordinate the collection of domestic service employment taxes with income taxes, effective for remuneration paid after 1993."
