    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Huntington's Disease Parity Act of 2011\". Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration. In the US, 30,000 individuals have the disease, with 200,000 at risk. Symptoms include loss of movement control, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. Adult-onset Huntington's Disease typically presents symptoms between ages 30-50, while late-onset occurs after age 50 with a milder course. Juvenile Huntington's Disease affects those under 19 years old and progresses rapidly. Symptoms include personality changes, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior, decreased motivation, and severe depression. Individuals with Huntington's Disease are unable to work and rely on Social Security Disability Insurance. Despite medical advancements, the Social Security Administration has not updated its rules for evaluating neurological disabilities since 1985, using the outdated term \"Huntington's Chorea\" which does not fully capture the disease's cognitive and behavioral impact. The behavioral and cognitive impact of Huntington's Disease is not fully characterized for Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare. Individuals with Huntington's Disease face a 24-month waiting period for Medicare benefits, unlike those with ALS who have the waiting period waived. Individuals with Huntington's Disease, a degenerative neurological condition similar to ALS, face significant cognitive, behavioral, and physical incapacitation. There is an urgent need to revise the outdated Social Security Disability Insurance guidelines for Huntington's Disease and remove the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage, similar to the exemption for ALS patients. Revision of medical and evaluation criteria for evaluating disability caused by adult-onset and juvenile Huntington's Disease. The Commissioner of Social Security will revise medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act in consultation with relevant medical organizations. This includes amending sections 11.00 and 12.00 of the Listing of Impairments to provide criteria for Huntington's Disease and remove references to \"Huntington's Chorea.\" The Commissioner of Social Security will amend the Listing of Impairments to include medical and evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease and Juvenile Huntington's Disease. This will involve revising sections 12.00, 111.00, and 112.00 of the Listing of Impairments. The Social Security Act is amended to waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage for individuals diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. This change applies to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for services provided after the enactment of this Act."
