    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for FY2013. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund account, including the Community Development Block Grant Program. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account administered by HUD. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), provides financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. Grants are allocated to various communities and states to address housing and economic needs as determined by local officials. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 included funding for this program. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for activities funded under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund (CDF) account, representing 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority. The proposed budget would increase funding for CDF activities by 4.5% or $135 million, with $100 million allocated for the Sustainable Communities Initiative. The Administration's FY2013 budget request includes $100 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, transferring funding for the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing program, and maintaining funding for CDBG formula grants at FY2012 levels. The Administration's FY2013 budget includes $882 million for CDBG entitlement communities, $882 million for CDBG state-administered programs, $7 million for insular areas, and $60 million for Indian tribes. Additionally, $100 million is requested for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, which aims to support regional integrated planning grants in up to 25 metropolitan areas. The Sustainable Communities Initiative aims to support regional integrated planning grants in up to 25 metropolitan areas. Grant awards would focus on housing, transportation, economic development, energy, and land use planning. Community Challenge Grants would be competitively awarded to up to 50 communities to promote sustainable growth. $8 million would be set aside for Housing-Transportation Integration Research. The Administration is requesting $8 million for a joint HUD, DOT, and EPA research initiative to evaluate the benefits of regional integration planning grants and community challenge grants. Additionally, $3 million would be set aside for technical support in developing residential energy modeling systems, energy standards for construction, and identifying sources of funds for energy efficiency projects. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. Funds must support job creation and meet CDBG program goals, benefiting low to moderate-income individuals and addressing community needs. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to borrow up to five times their annual allocation for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2013 to help finance large-scale job creation activities. Additionally, the proposal includes charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Administration proposed charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. Congress rejected this proposal in favor of maintaining the status quo. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. This is a 5% increase from the previous year, excluding disaster-related funding. The bill also supports $60 million in funding for Indian tribes and recommends restoring funding for SCI activities. The Senate committee bill recommends $50 million for SCI activities, half of the Administration's request. It also calls for HUD to allocate $12.5 million to SCI in smaller communities. The bill supports converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. Funding for Section 4 activities is recommended at $35 million. The Senate committee bill recommends $35 million for Section 4 activities, but does not support transferring the program from its current account. The House Appropriations Committee bill, H.R. 5972, recommends $3.404 billion for CDF activities, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. H.R. 5972 also supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes. The House bill, H.R. 5972, supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes. It does not include a set-aside of CDBG funds for SCI activities but recommends $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previous SCI awards. The program is unauthorized and lacks support from the House Financial Services Committee. H.R. 5972 also recommends $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million, not supporting the Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure. H.R. 5972 recommends $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million and continues funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. The bill was debated on the House floor with amendments proposing funding reductions for CDBG and Section 108 programs, but none were approved. During the second half of 2011, Congress debated budget recommendations for FY2012. Several amendments proposing funding reductions for various programs were defeated by votes. A point of order was sustained for an amendment seeking to change existing law. During the FY2012 budget debate in the second half of 2011, Congress focused on reducing federal spending to address the deficit while supporting job creation. Supporters of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program highlighted its role in economic development and vowed to defend it against funding cuts. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account in its FY2012 budget, which included reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating funding for certain programs, and transferring others to new accounts. The total funding level recommended was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction. The FY2012 budget recommended $3.804 billion for programs funded under the CDF account, a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 but an 8.6% increase from FY2011. The Administration proposed a funding increase for CDBG states and entitlement communities, as well as specific grants for insular areas, Indian tribes, Rural Innovation Grants, and Guam. The Administration's FY2012 budget did not include funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants, opposing earmarking of funds. It recommended transferring the SCI programs to a new stand-alone account with an appropriation of $150 million to support innovative housing and economic development efforts in rural areas and address community development needs in Guam due to military relocations. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed a $150 million appropriation for SCI programs. This funding would support Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, and Housing-Transportation Integration Research. The budget also suggested doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2012 to help local governments finance job creation activities. A fee-based assessment was suggested to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy, but Congress rejected the proposal. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies approved a draft bill on September 8, 2011, recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities, including $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants. The draft report noted a recommendation to eliminate the program in the FY2012 Budget Resolution. The draft bill recommended shifting funding priorities for community development activities, including reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes and rejecting the proposal to restructure Section 108 loan guarantees. This would increase transparency and accountability for local officials using taxpayer dollars. The bill recommended maintaining the current structure of Section 108 loan guarantees with $6.8 million in credit subsidies to support $275 million in loans. It also suggested lowering the percentage of funds grantees could use for administrative expenses from 20% to 10% of their CDBG allocation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed a substantial reduction in CDF funding to $3.0 billion. The bill recommended a substantial reduction in CDF funding to $3.0 billion, with a proposed $3 billion appropriations level $500 million less than FY2011. The Senate bill also recommended $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, reducing it by 13.7% from FY2011 levels. Additionally, $90 million was recommended for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, $60 million less than requested by the President. The Senate bill recommended a reduction in CDF funding to $3.0 billion, $500 million less than FY2011. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to consolidate appropriations measures into a Minibus, approved on November 1, 2011. Among the approved amendments was one by Senator Coburn to prohibit the use of grants for repaying federal loans, impacting the CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program. The CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program allow CDBG funds to secure and repay Section 108 loan guarantees in case of default. States and communities use CDBG funds to cover revenue shortfalls for bond repayments. H.R. 2112 was approved and signed into law as P.L. 112-55, allocating $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The President signed H.R. 2112 into law as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011, allocating $3.308 billion for CDF activities. The act appropriated funds for core CDBG programs, with $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for formula grants to states and communities. The funding for CDBG formula grants in FY2012 was lower than in previous years, but activities like the Sustainable Communities Initiative could still be carried out using CDBG and Transformation Initiative funds. The funding for CDBG formula grants in FY2012 was lower due to congressional efforts to reduce federal spending. P.L. 112-55 did not include certain provisions from the Senate and House versions of H.R. 2112, but directed the GAO to study the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME block grant programs administered by HUD. The General Accountability Office (GAO) was directed to study the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME block grant programs administered by HUD. The study was required to be completed within 180 days of the enactment of P.L. 112-55. HUD was also required to submit a progress report on grantee accountability within 120 days of the act's passage. Additionally, HUD was directed to analyze the use of CDBG funds for matching fund requirements of other federal programs. The Administration failed to win congressional support for converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program for the third year in a row. P.L. 112-55 maintained the program's current structure and appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies for $240 million in loan guarantee commitments. The act also prohibited states from diverting proceeds from the sale of notes backed by Section 108 loan guarantees to other communities. Additionally, P.L. 112-55 included $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. The CDBG supplemental disaster assistance provided funds for states and local governments to manage recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. The funds were used for disaster relief, housing restoration, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. Grantees had to submit a disaster recovery plan detailing fund usage and contributions to recovery efforts. HUD could waive CDBG fund provisions, except for fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and environmental review. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 appropriated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF), with a mandatory across-the-board rescission of 0.2% and a 1% discretionary transfer to the Department's programs. The act exempted $100 million from discretionary spending limits and required grantees to explain why a waiver of CDBG program requirements was necessary for recovery efforts. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 allocated $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF). This included a 0.2% rescission and a 1% transfer to the Department's Transformation Initiative. The Secretary of HUD was given authority to reduce the CDF appropriation to $3.501 billion, a 16% decrease from FY2010. The CDF, which includes the Community Development Block Grant program, faced significant budget cuts in earlier legislative proposals. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to reduce funding for HUD's Community Development Fund, including the CDBG program, as part of efforts to cut the federal budget deficit. The bill did not receive Senate approval, leading to negotiations to resolve the FY2011 budget impasse. After negotiations, President Obama signed P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, which included $3.508 billion for CDF activities, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 included a 0.2% mandatory rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer of funds from designated HUD funds to HUD's Transformation Initiative. This resulted in a reduction of $7 million in the CDF account to $3.501 billion, with $35 million transferred to the Transformation Initiative. Table 3 shows the adjusted appropriations for CDF activities, including the actual distribution of funds for FY2010, the Administration's budget request for FY2011, and the projected distribution based on H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149. The P.L. 112-10 appropriation for the CDF account is $3.501 billion, which is 21.3% less than FY2010 and 20.1% less than requested for FY2011. The FY2011 appropriation is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. The CDF account includes the CDBG program, with formula-based grants for various entities. P.L. 112-10 reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4%. Additionally, funds for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) are included in the account. The CDF account, including the CDBG program and funds for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI), saw a 16.4% reduction in funding for CDBG formula grants under P.L. 112-10. The House passed H.R. 1, which proposed a 66.3% cut to the CDF account and prohibited funds for earmarks and SCI. The CDBG program allocation among different components was based on specific percentages for entitlement communities, states, insular areas, Indian tribes, and other programs. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to H.R. 1 for Senate consideration, which was ultimately defeated. Senator Inouye submitted S.Amdt. 149, an amendment to H.R. 1, which included a provision for $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion allocated for the CDBG program. The amendment aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level, with insular areas receiving $7 million and Indian tribes $40 million. The Senate bill also proposed funding for the Rural Innovation Fund, University Community Fund, and SCI programs at their FY2010 levels. The FY2011 appropriations for the CDBG program totaled $3.296 billion, a decrease of approximately 16.4% from the previous year. The CDBG program funding for entitlement communities and states decreased by 16.4% from $3.943 billion in FY2010 to $3.296 billion in FY2011. In FY2012, the allocations further declined by 10.7% to $2.942 billion. This led to a 29.1% reduction in the average grant amount for entitlement communities, dropping from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012. The average state allocation also decreased by 25.4% during the same period. The average state allocation for CDBG funding declined by 25.4% from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012, despite an increase in the number of communities qualifying for entitlement status. The proposed 62.5% reduction in funding in H.R. 1 would have significantly impacted long-term community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting economic development, job creation, public facilities, and services. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have undercut resources for non-profit organizations managing CDBG-funded public services, facilities, and activities. Supporters argue that the reduction disproportionately affects low and moderate income households. FY2012 appropriations for the CDBG program are at their lowest in over a decade, leading to delays and reductions in support for entitlement communities. The reduction in funding for entitlement communities will result in delays and reductions in support for projects and activities. Table 5 shows the actual distribution of CDBG formula funds awarded to states and entitlement communities. P.L. 112-10 reduced formula allocations by 16.4% below FY2010 levels. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 reduced formula allocations to states and entitlement communities by 16.4% below FY2010 levels. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2012 decreased CDBG formula allocations by 25.1% below the amounts allocated for FY2011. 70% of CDBG funds are allocated to entitlement communities, while the remaining 30% goes to states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities. CDBG funds are allocated to eligible entitlement communities and states using Formula A or Formula B, based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors. Formula allocations were reduced in FY2011 and FY2012. 70% of funds go to entitlement communities, while 30% go to nonentitlement communities. The second formula, Formula B, allocates funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on population growth lag, poverty share, and housing built before 1940 factors. Formula A and Formula B govern the distribution of CDBG funds to states and communities. The distribution of CDBG funds to states is governed by a two formula system, with Formula A using population, poverty, and housing factors, and Formula B using poverty housing and persons living in poverty data. HUD uses Census Bureau data and American Community Survey estimates for allocations, updating data annually. HUD uses data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates to allocate CDBG funds, updating annually for more accurate demographic changes. Prior to FY2012, HUD used 2000 Census data for poverty, housing conditions, and housing stock. A study in December 2011 analyzed the impact of using 2010 Census and ACS data on CDBG fund allocation. The HUD study analyzed the impact of using 2010 Census and ACS data on CDBG fund allocation. The study assumed constant eligible entities and appropriations from FY2011 to FY2012 to isolate the impact of the data source change. Findings showed that communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions experienced a decline in CDBG allocations, while communities in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions were positively impacted. Communities in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions would see an increase in CDBG allocations due to the change in data sources. Principal cities and urban counties would receive a larger share of funds, while funding for other entitlement cities would decrease. New Mexico and Puerto Rico would experience the largest decline in funding. The report discusses the decline in funding for New Mexico and Puerto Rico, with a 27.4% and 27.3% decrease respectively, due to changes in poverty and housing conditions. It includes a comparison of funding allocations for entitlement communities and a review of the CDF account's funding history from FY2000 to FY2011. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of the primary components of the CDF account since FY2000. Total appropriations for the CDF account are analyzed, excluding special and supplemental appropriations for disasters and economic issues. The CDF account's funding history from FY2000 to FY2011 shows fluctuations in appropriations, with the FY2011 allocation being the lowest in over a decade. The focus of debate has been on the funding level for the CDBG-formula component, with supporters advocating for increased funding due to a decline in appropriations and an increased number of communities gaining entitlement status. The CDBG program has seen a decline in funding for entitlement communities, with critics arguing that increased funding is not justified. From FY2000 to FY2010, the average grant amount allocated to entitlement communities decreased by 26.7%. The total amount appropriated declined annually from FY2001 to FY2008 but has been increasing since FY2009. The average allocation for CDBG entitlement communities declined from $2.1 million in FY2002 to $1.9 million in FY2011, a 34.5% decrease from FY2000. The decline is due to fewer dollars appropriated and an increase in the number of entitlement communities. In FY2011, the number of CDBG entitlement communities receiving direct allocations increased to 1,167. The average annual grant amount awarded to states fluctuated, with a decline in FY2011 to $19.1 million. Program funding declined by 40% in inflation-adjusted constant dollars. The average allocation for CDBG formula grants has decreased over the years, with a 40% decline in program funding from FY2000 to FY2011. The appropriations for CDBG formula grants have fluctuated between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in the last decade. Additionally, the CDF includes other programs with smaller funding levels and specific objectives. The CDF account includes various programs with specific objectives and funding levels. Funding for set-aside programs within the CDF account has fluctuated significantly from FY2000 to FY2011, with Congress appropriating varying amounts for earmarked accounts such as the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI). The appropriations for CDF set-asides have ranged from $647 million in FY2001 to $61 million in FY2007, with Congress eliminating all earmarks in FY2007 and funding for the EDI and NI earmarked accounts in FY2011. In FY2011, Congress eliminated funding for the EDI and NI earmarked accounts within the CDF account, resulting in significant fluctuations in appropriations for set-aside programs. Funding for CDBG-related set-asides and earmarks declined by 59.4% from FY2000 to FY2008, rebounded in FY2009 and FY2010, before declining again in FY2011. In FY2009 and FY2010, congressional earmarked projects funded by the EDI and NI programs were dominant in CDBG-related set aside appropriations, despite fluctuations in funding. Earmarks have been a source of debate in recent Congresses, with new rules governing disclosure of requests since FY2007. In FY2008 and FY2009, EDI and NI earmarks were the main components of CDBG-linked set aside programs, with combined appropriations twice the amount for other activities. Congress has used CDBG program's framework for supplemental appropriations for disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation activities. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) aims to help local and state governments address the issue of abandoned and foreclosed properties caused by the mortgage foreclosure crisis. It also supports job creation in response to the economic recession under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Funding is allocated based on specific criteria, with disaster relief and NSP funds going to states or communities meeting eligibility thresholds. In the case of CDBG disaster funding, only communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration receive funds at the discretion of Congress. Each Congress decides if the disaster warrants supplemental CDBG funds beyond FEMA's typical funds. NSP-1 and NSP-3 allocated funds to states based on mortgage foreclosure rates. Congress established a minimum grant amount for each state. States were required to distribute funds to local governments with high rates of mortgage foreclosures. Congress required states to distribute NSP-1 and NSP-3 funds to local governments with high rates of mortgage foreclosures. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively to various entities. Representative Gary Miller introduced H.R. 861 to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. Representative Gary Miller introduced H.R. 861 to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds appropriated under the Wall Street Reform Act. The House Financial Services Committee conducted a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure mitigation programs, and later considered and approved H.R. 861, which includes an amendment requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website. The notice will direct citizens to contact their representatives and local officials regarding foreclosure impacts on their communities. During the House Financial Services Committee hearing on NSP-3 funds, Representative Miller criticized the program as ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' money, advocating for its funding to be rescinded. He argued that the program primarily benefited banks and speculators. However, other Members defended NSP-3, stating that it has successfully helped communities combat the negative effects of the mortgage foreclosure crisis on neighborhoods, property values, and local revenues. HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, Mercedes M. M\u00e1rquez, supported the program's impact in written testimony. During a House hearing, HUD's Assistant Secretary stated that the NSP program will impact 100,000 properties in hard-hit markets, with 36,000 units under construction. The program is expected to support over 93,000 jobs nationwide and reduce abandoned housing stock. The House passed the measure, but a companion bill has not been introduced in the Senate."
