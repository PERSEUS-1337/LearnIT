    "content": "The \"Worker Protection Warnings Act of 1993\" is referenced in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Congress finds that the absence of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use causes confusion among employers and employees, leading to increased worker exposure to injuries and illnesses. The lack of Federal standards for these warnings results in varying State requirements, prohibitions, and court decisions, creating a burden on interstate commerce. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by clarifying the proper use of personal protective equipment through uniform warnings. It also aims to preempt any conflicting State standards regarding the adequacy of these warnings. Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) is amended to establish uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use within 12 months of enactment. Personal protective equipment includes gear for eyes, face, head, hearing, extremities, or respiratory tract protection in the workplace. The amendment to Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) establishes uniform warnings for personal protective equipment used in the workplace. The warnings must be included in the standards for personal protective equipment and communicated to employers by manufacturers or sellers. The amendment to Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) establishes uniform warnings for personal protective equipment used in the workplace. The standards require employers to communicate these warnings to employees using the equipment, provide training on proper use, application in the workplace, and consequences of not following the warnings. The standards become effective 6 months after publication in the Federal Register and exempt certain warnings from coverage. The Secretary will consider various factors when promulgating standards for warnings on personal protective equipment, including manufacturer experience, communication methods, worker opinions, human factors experts, and input from organizations like the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. The Secretary will consider factors and opinions on the effectiveness of warnings and communication methods for personal protective equipment. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. Section 4 (29 U.S.C. 653) is amended to clarify Congress's intent to regulate warnings for personal protective equipment. Section 18 (29 U.S.C. 667) prohibits states from establishing standards different from those set by the Secretary of Labor for personal protective equipment. The Secretary may not approve a state plan that includes requirements different from those in occupational safety and health standards set by the Secretary under section 6(h)."
