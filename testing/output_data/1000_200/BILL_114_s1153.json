    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" and disclaims any right to land south of the Red River's South Bank boundary line. Previous surveys by the Bureau of Land Management will not determine the current boundary line. The \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" requires a new survey to identify the current South Bank boundary line, conducted by Licensed State Land Surveyors chosen by the Texas General Land Office, to be completed within 2 years. The survey must adhere to the gradient boundary survey method and span the entire affected area. The Secretary will submit the survey to the Texas General Land Office for approval. SEC. 4. APPEAL. Private property owners can appeal public domain claims to an Administrative Law Judge within 1 year of survey approval. SEC. 5. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN. No affected area parcels are treated as Federal land until survey approval and no further appeals. SEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION. States and Indian tribes' rights over lands north of the Red River are unaffected. SEC. 7. SALE OF REMAINING RED RIVER SURFACE RIGHTS. After survey approval and resolution of any appeals, remaining identified Federal lands will be offered for competitive sale at fair market value. Sales are subject to existing tribal, State, and local rights, with proceeds used to offset associated costs. A report must be submitted within 5 years of enactment. The identified Federal lands will be sold at fair market value to offset costs. A report must be submitted within 5 years listing any unsold lands and reasons for not selling them. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, the term \"affected area\" refers to lands along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River between Texas and Oklahoma. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and \"South Bank\" refers to the water-washed elevation along the southerly side of the river. The term \"South Bank boundary line\" refers to the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma identified through the gradient boundary survey method, as specified in a decree from Oklahoma v. Texas in 1923. The gradient boundary survey method is the measurement technique used to locate this boundary line under the methodology established by the United States Supreme Court. The United States Supreme Court established that the boundary line between Texas and Oklahoma along the Red River can change due to erosion and accretion, as outlined in a decree from Oklahoma v. Texas in 1923."
