    "content": "The maritime industry, including commercial vessels like tankers, bulk carriers, and passenger ships, is regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws to prevent pollution and protect marine resources. Enforcement and jurisdiction issues exist, with a focus on the cruise industry due to its visibility and environmental impact concerns. The cruise industry, representing a small fraction of the global shipping fleet, is a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, providing $40 billion in benefits in 2009 and over 357,000 jobs. With an average annual growth rate of 7.4% in the number of passengers since 1990, cruises hosted 14.3 million passengers in 2010. The fleet consists of more than 230 ships, mostly foreign-flagged, with Liberia and Panama being popular flag countries. The cruise industry's fleet comprises over 230 ships, mostly foreign-flagged with Liberia and Panama being popular choices. Six companies own nearly 95% of passenger ships in U.S. waters. New ships are added each year, larger and more luxurious, with an average size increase of 90 feet every five years. The industry focuses on demonstrating safety and health for passengers and visited communities. Cruise ships, often compared to \"floating cities,\" generate large amounts of sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water during voyages. Improper disposal of these wastes can pose risks to human health and the environment. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of laws for managing cruise ship waste, with weak enforcement noted. A 2000 GAO report highlighted issues with cruise ships' compliance with environmental laws, revealing 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters between 1993 and 1998. Most cases involved oil or oil-based products, with some intentional and accidental discharges. These cruise ship cases accounted for 4% of all illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships. The 2000 GAO report revealed that 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases by cruise ships in U.S. waters accounted for 4% of all cases by foreign-flag ships. Environmental groups petitioned the EPA to address cruise ship pollution, leading to investigations and regulatory actions. In response to environmental groups' petition, EPA studied cruise ship discharges and waste management. A 2008 report summarized waste streams, data collection findings, and options to address ship discharges, focusing on pollution issues and relevant laws. The report discusses the various waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships, highlighting the complex legal framework governing pollution from these vessels. It also mentions federal and state legislative efforts in Alaska and other states, as well as the steps taken by cruise companies to prevent illegal waste discharges. Environmental groups have supported legislation to strengthen regulation of cruise ship wastes. Environmental groups have endorsed legislation in Congress to regulate cruise ship waste, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste. These waste streams can pose a threat to human health and aquatic life if not properly treated and disposed of. Cruise ships discharge various waste streams, including sewage, graywater, and solid waste, which can harm human health and aquatic life. While they represent a small portion of the shipping industry, their concentrated activities in specific coastal areas can have a significant local impact. Environmental groups support legislation to regulate cruise ship waste. Cruise ships discharge sewage and graywater, which can contain harmful bacteria, viruses, and nutrients. Untreated sewage can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Excessive algal growth from sewage nutrients can deplete oxygen in the water, leading to fish kills and harm to aquatic life. Large cruise ships can generate significant amounts of sewage daily. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage and graywater, with a large cruise ship producing 15,000 to 30,000 gallons of sewage per day. Graywater from cruise ships can contain various pollutants including fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, oil, grease, metals, and medical waste. EPA and Alaska state sampling found that untreated graywater from cruise ships can have higher levels of pollutants, including fecal coliform bacteria, compared to domestic wastewater. Graywater has the potential to cause environmental harm. Solid waste generated on cruise ships includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics, which can be hazardous. Cruise ships typically manage solid waste through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling, but up to 75% is incinerated on board. The ash is then discharged at sea, potentially becoming marine debris that poses a threat to marine life and coastal communities. Cruise ships manage solid waste through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling. However, up to 75% of solid waste is incinerated on board, with the ash discharged at sea. This waste can harm marine life, including marine mammals, fish, sea turtles, and birds. Each cruise ship passenger generates two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day, resulting in a significant amount of waste on large cruise ships. About 8 tons of solid waste are generated during a one-week cruise on a large ship, contributing to 24% of the solid waste generated by vessels worldwide. Cruise ships produce hazardous wastes from various onboard activities, including photo processing, dry-cleaning, and equipment cleaning. These wastes include chemicals, medical waste, batteries, fluorescent lights, and paints, containing substances like hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and solvents. Port reception facilities may struggle to handle the waste from cruise ships, which can strain their capacity. Hazardous waste on cruise ships includes hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, heavy metals, paint waste, solvents, fluorescent and mercury vapor light bulbs, various batteries, and pharmaceuticals. These wastes, although small in quantity, can be toxic to marine organisms if not managed carefully. Oil leaks from engine spaces mix with water in the bilge, posing threats to marine life and human health. Bilge water may also contain solid wastes and pollutants. Oil in even minute concentrations can kill fish or have various sub-lethal chronic effects. Bilge water may contain solid wastes, pollutants, and chemicals that are highly toxic to marine organisms if discharged. Large vessels generate significant amounts of oily bilge water, posing a threat to marine life and human health. To maintain ship stability and eliminate hazardous conditions, bilge spaces need to be flushed and periodically pumped dry. To prevent oil pollution, bilge spaces on ships need to be flushed and pumped dry periodically. Extracting accumulated oil from bilge water is crucial to avoid discharging untreated oily bilge water into the ocean, which can harm marine life. Cruise ships have faced environmental violations for improper handling of bilge water. Ballast water is also used to stabilize vessels during transport, but can pose a threat if not managed properly. Cruise ships, tankers, and cargo carriers use ballast water to stabilize vessels during transport. This water, taken on in one region and discharged in another, contains biological materials like plants and animals. These non-native species can cause ecological and economic damage, making ballast water discharge a leading source of invasive species in U.S. marine waters. Exotic species in ballast water can cause ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems, with studies estimating a $2.2 billion annual cost from pest mollusks alone. Cruise ships contribute to the problem by discharging ballast water and generating air pollution from diesel engines burning high sulfur fuel. Further research is needed to understand the role of cruise ships in introducing non-native species. Air pollution from cruise ships is caused by diesel engines burning high sulfur fuel, emitting sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter. EPA classifies diesel exhaust as a likely human carcinogen. Marine diesel engine emissions contribute to unhealthy air, visibility degradation, acid deposition, and water pollution. Ocean-going vessels account for a significant portion of nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur dioxide emissions in the US. Emissions from marine diesel engines can be even higher on a port-specific basis. Ships, including cruise ships, are significant sources of air pollutants such as carbon dioxide, black carbon, and nitrogen oxides. These emissions contribute to climate change and regional air quality issues. While a significant portion of vessel emissions occur at sea, they can impact areas far inland. The cruise industry lacks specific data on this issue, but it is known that they comprise only a small fraction of global shipping emissions. Cruise ships emit pollutants that impact climate change and air quality, with emissions affecting regions far inland. The industry lacks specific data on this issue, but shipboard incinerators burn waste, producing ash and toxic emissions. Waste management on cruise ships is governed by various international protocols and U.S. laws, with overlaps, gaps, and differences in jurisdiction. The International Maritime Organization sets standards for emissions control. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards through the MARPOL 73/78 Convention. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must adhere to its requirements, with member nations responsible for their registered vessels. Six Annexes of the Convention address pollution sources from ships, but additional measures are needed to protect the marine environment from waste discharges. The MARPOL 73/78 Convention, enforced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), sets international standards for maritime vessel safety and pollution prevention. The Convention includes six Annexes that address various sources of pollution from ships, such as oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, and garbage disposal. These Annexes provide regulations and criteria to control pollution and emissions from marine vessel operations. However, additional measures are necessary to ensure the protection of the marine environment from waste discharges. The MARPOL 73/78 Convention, enforced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), sets international standards for maritime vessel safety and pollution prevention. Annex VI sets limits on emissions from marine vessel operations and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone-depleting substances. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary and requires ratification by member countries. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI. The flag state is responsible for certifying a ship's compliance with the regulations. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI of the MARPOL 73/78 Convention, with the flag state responsible for certifying compliance. IMO has established various conventions, including the International Safety Management Code. Each signatory nation must enact domestic laws to implement the convention and pledge to comply with related laws. In the US, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships implements MARPOL provisions. The United States ratified Annex VI of MARPOL in April 2006, with Congress approving legislation in July 2008 to implement the standards. The Coast Guard enforces regulations for U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard enforces regulations for foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters under APPS and MARPOL. Implementation challenges arise from the international nature of maritime shipping. The U.S. can take enforcement action against foreign-flagged ships for pollution discharge incidents within its jurisdiction. The United States enforces laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution discharge incidents within its jurisdiction, coordinating with flag states according to MARPOL. However, coordination between agencies is challenging, with the Coast Guard, State Department, and flag states involved. Multiple federal agencies have jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters, with the Coast Guard and EPA having regulatory responsibilities and the Department of Justice prosecuting violations. The Department of State represents the U.S. at international maritime meetings. The Department of Justice prosecutes violations of federal laws, while the Department of State represents the United States at international meetings and treaty negotiations. Other federal agencies like NOAA and APHIS have limited roles in reporting on marine debris and ensuring quarantine inspection and disposal of food-contaminated garbage. States and localities also have responsibilities. U.S. laws and regulations, including the Clean Water Act, apply to cruise ship discharges. The Clean Water Act is the main U.S. law regulating pollutant discharges, including from cruise ships. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program controls discharges from point sources like vessels. Sewage discharges from vessels are exempt from NPDES permits, but Section 312 of the Clean Water Act prohibits untreated sewage dumping into navigable waters. Section 312 of the Clean Water Act prohibits untreated sewage dumping from vessels into U.S. navigable waters within 3 miles of shore. Cruise ships must comply with this regulation, using marine sanitation devices (MSDs) to prevent discharge of untreated sewage. EPA sets performance standards for MSDs, while the Coast Guard oversees design, operation, and compliance certification. MSDs can either hold sewage for shore disposal or treat it before discharge. Raw sewage can be discharged beyond 3 miles, with Coast Guard regulations covering three types of MSDs. The Coast Guard regulations cover three types of Marine Sanitation Devices (MSDs) for sewage disposal on vessels. Large vessels, like cruise ships, use Type II or Type III MSDs. Type II treats waste before discharge, meeting specific limits, while Type III stores waste for later treatment onshore or outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs disinfect sewage with chemicals, mainly found on smaller vessels. EPA sets performance standards for MSDs to prevent untreated sewage discharge within 3 miles of shore. The regulations for Marine Sanitation Devices (MSDs) have not been updated since 1976 and only cover bacterial contaminants and suspended solids. Critics argue that the regulations do not require sampling, monitoring, or reporting on effluent discharges, unlike the NPDES permit program for other sources. NPDES permits regulate a wider range of pollutants such as chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, oil, and grease, and require compliance with sampling, monitoring, and reporting requirements. This regulatory structure affects cruise ships and other large vessels. The Coast Guard has been criticized for poor enforcement of Marine Sanitation Device rules, with inspectors lacking time to properly inspect sewage treatment equipment on cruise ships. Factors like focus on safety, limited time and staff, and lack of surprise inspections contribute to the difficulty in detecting violations of environmental laws. The Coast Guard's responsibilities include homeland security and non-homeland security tasks, with a focus on homeland security post-9/11. This shift has led to fewer resources for vessel inspections for environmental compliance, such as Marine Sanitation Device rules under Annex IV of MARPOL. Annex IV of MARPOL requires cruise ships to have sewage treatment systems or holding tanks. The regulations vary based on the distance from shore, with stricter requirements closer to land. The United States has not ratified Annex IV, so compliance is not mandatory in U.S. waters. In U.S. waters, cruise ships must comply with Clean Water Act regulations, using Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for sewage. AWTs are effective in removing pathogens and pollutants, but less so for dissolved metals and nutrients. The Clean Water Act regulations require cruise ships in U.S. waters to use Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems to remove oil, grease, and particulate metals from sewage. However, these systems are only moderately effective in removing dissolved metals and nutrients. States can establish no-discharge zones (NDZs) to prohibit the discharge of sewage from vessels with installed toilets. To create an NDZ, the state must demonstrate the availability of adequate pumpout facilities for safe sewage removal. As of 2009, 26 states have designated NDZs to protect waters from sewage discharges. As of 2009, 26 states have designated no-discharge zones (NDZs) to protect waters from sewage discharges. NDZs are used to protect environmentally sensitive areas and drinking water intake zones. The EPA identified options to address sewage from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. In the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, the EPA proposed options to address sewage from cruise ships, including revising discharge standards, restricting discharge, requiring testing of wastewater equipment, and imposing uniform requirements on all ships. Graywater is not considered a pollutant under current federal law, and there are no separate effluent standards for graywater discharges. The Clean Water Act includes graywater in its sewage definition for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes. The Clean Water Act regulates graywater discharges for commercial vessels in the Great Lakes and Alaska, with limits on bacterial contaminants and total suspended solids. EPA issued a general permit for large commercial vessels, including cruise ships, with similar restrictions on graywater discharges. NOAA can designate National Marine Sanctuaries to restrict graywater discharges to protect sensitive ecosystems. NOAA can designate National Marine Sanctuaries to restrict graywater discharges from cruise ships and other vessels to protect sensitive ecosystems, such as coral. EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, including establishing standards, geographic restrictions, monitoring, and penalties for non-compliance. Cruise ship solid waste discharges are regulated by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. Title I of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) regulates the disposal of materials at sea for cruise ships and other vessels. EPA issues permits for this purpose, except for dredged material disposal which is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. MPRSA permits are not required for cruise ships to discharge solid waste beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The routine discharge of effluent for propulsion is exempted from dumping regulations. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) also plays a role in regulating discharges. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) and its regulations apply to cruise ships, prohibiting garbage discharge within certain distances from shore. It is enforced by the Coast Guard for all vessels in U.S. waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). EPA has reported solid waste and plastic discharges from cruise ships, prompting the IMO to consider amending MARPOL Annex V. EPA's 2008 Discharge Assessment Report identified potential issues with cruise ship waste disposal. The EPA identified options to address solid waste from cruise ships, including improving on-board garbage handling technologies, implementing stronger waste management plans, prohibiting incinerator ash discharge into U.S. waters, expanding port reception facilities, and enforcing no discharge of solid waste into the marine environment through monitoring and sanctions. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the primary federal law governing hazardous waste management, controlling waste from generation to disposal. It imposes management requirements on generators, transporters, and treatment facilities for hazardous waste. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must have permits and comply with EPA regulations. Cruise ship owners/operators may be subject to RCRA rules as generators/transporters of hazardous waste. Issues for the cruise ship industry include identifying hazardous waste at the point of generation. The cruise ship industry must adhere to RCRA rules for managing hazardous waste generated onboard, including proper identification and offloading for recycling or disposal. Various ship activities produce hazardous wastes subject to RCRA, such as chemical use in cleaning, painting, and passenger services. Compliance with RCRA requirements is necessary for chemicals used in ship maintenance and passenger services to prevent hazardous waste generation. The cruise ship industry must comply with RCRA rules for managing hazardous waste generated onboard, but it is unclear how regulations apply to the disposal of these wastes. There is ambiguity in classifying cruise ships as large or small generators of hazardous waste, with some arguing for a third category with less stringent requirements. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires immediate notification of hazardous substance releases from vessels to the National Response Center. Small-quantity generators have less rigorous requirements for notification and recordkeeping. EPA determines release amounts that may pose a danger to public health or the environment. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) mandates immediate notification of hazardous substance releases from vessels to the National Response Center. EPA has identified 500 wastes as hazardous substances and set rules for reportable quantities, including releases as small as 1 pound. Hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are also regulated under the Clean Water Act to prevent harmful quantities from being discharged into navigable waters. EPA has proposed various options for addressing hazardous wastes in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. In the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, EPA proposed options to address hazardous wastes from cruise ships, including establishing standards or BMPs to reduce contaminants, prohibiting discharge into U.S. waters up to the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone, increasing inspections on cruise ships, and inspecting facilities receiving cruise ship hazardous wastes. Section 311 of the Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances into U.S. navigable waters or the contiguous zone, extending 200 miles offshore. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore unless passed through an oil water separator. Beyond 12 miles, oil can be discharged if the content is less than 100 ppm. Vessels must maintain an Oil Record Book. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships applies to all U.S. and foreign flagged vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) applies to all U.S. and foreign flagged vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters. The Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore, with exceptions under certain conditions. Cruise lines, mostly foreign registered, have limited applicability to APPS regulations due to operating outside U.S. navigable waters. EPA identified options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. EPA identified options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships, including establishing standards, conducting research on alternative lubricants, treating effluents to meet specified standards, and revising inspection practices. Conservation organizations petitioned EPA in 1999 to repeal the exemption for ballast water discharge due to the introduction of invasive species into U.S. waters. In 2003, organizations petitioned EPA to repeal the exemption for ballast water discharge under the Clean Water Act, but EPA rejected the petition citing long-standing policy and ongoing federal activities to control invasive species in ballast water. Since 2004, all vessels with ballast water tanks must comply with regulations. In 2003, organizations petitioned EPA to repeal the exemption for ballast water discharge under the Clean Water Act. After a lawsuit, a federal court ruled in favor of environmental groups, mandating EPA to rescind the exemption by September 30, 2008. This ruling also applies to other types of vessel discharges covered by the regulatory exemption. The court's ruling mandates EPA to rescind the exemption for vessel discharges, including graywater and bilge water. In response, EPA issued the Vessel General Permit (VGP) in December 2008, applicable to large recreational and commercial vessels, including tankers, freighters, and cruise ships. The VGP covers pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length and ballast water discharges from smaller commercial vessels and fishing vessels. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) applies to pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length and ballast water discharges from smaller commercial vessels and fishing vessels. It covers 26 types of waste streams, including aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, grease, metals, and toxic pollutants, controlled by best management practices and existing Coast Guard requirements. The VGP primarily relies on existing Coast Guard requirements for controlling ballast water discharges and provides BMPs for controlling bilge water discharges. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements apply. The VGP does not cover sewage discharges or toxic waste discharges from passenger services on cruise ships. Cruise ships are subject to more detailed requirements for certain discharges under the VGP. The VGP includes detailed requirements for cruise ships, such as graywater and pool water discharges, with BMPs and numeric limits for fecal coliform and chlorine. Operational limits are set for graywater discharges in nutrient-impaired waters. Legislation was considered by the 110th Congress for a national approach to ballast water discharge issues. The Clean Air Act is the main federal law addressing air quality concerns, requiring EPA to set health-based standards for ambient air quality and national emission standards for air pollution sources. Legislation regarding ballast water discharge issues was considered by the 110th Congress but faced opposition due to preempting states from enacting stricter programs and lacking citizen suit provisions. The Clean Air Act mandates standards for ambient air quality and national emission standards for air pollution sources, including regulations for large vessels like cruise ships. EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels in 2003, following a settlement with the environmental group Bluewater Network. These standards align with international agreements on nitrogen oxide emissions. Annex VI of the MARPOL protocol sets nitrogen oxide emissions standards for large marine vessels, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships. EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act also cover emissions from smaller marine diesel engines. EPA plans to establish more stringent standards for very large marine engines and vessels in the future to align with international efforts through the IMO. The EPA plans to establish long-term standards in a future rulemaking to align with international efforts through the IMO. Environmental groups criticized the exclusion of foreign-flagged vessels from marine diesel engine rules, but the rules were upheld in 2004. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI, and the IMO adopted amendments to establish new global nitrogen oxide standards in 2011. EPA may consider including foreign vessels in future rulemaking for more stringent standards. In October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to Annex VI to establish new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards. In December 2009, EPA promulgated changes to the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines, aligning with IMO requirements for emissions standards. The EPA rule applies to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged vessels only. In October 2010, the IMO approved a U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an ECA. A treaty amendment to Annex VI will be circulated among IMO members for approval by July 2011, with ships in the area facing stricter emission limits for sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter from 2014. Various laws and regulations apply to different geographic areas, with the Clean Water Act treating navigable waters, the contiguous zone, and the ocean separately. The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters, the contiguous zone, and the ocean as separate entities. Navigable waters include the territorial seas extending 3 miles seaward from the baseline. President Reagan's proclamation extended the territorial sea to 12 nautical miles, but it did not affect the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction. The contiguous zone is defined as established by the United States under a convention. President Clinton's proclamation in 1999 extended U.S. authorities' enforcement rights at sea to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the traditional 12-mile width of the contiguous zone defined by the Convention of the Territorial Sea. This proclamation did not change statutory definitions, so for the Clean Water Act, the territorial sea remains 3 miles wide, and the contiguous zone extends from 3 to 12 miles. The territorial sea remains 3 miles wide, and the contiguous zone extends from 3 to 12 miles. Under CERCLA, \"navigable waters\" includes territorial seas, incorporating definitions from the Clean Water Act. Limits of jurisdiction define areas where specific laws apply, such as Clean Water Act standards for sewage discharges and NPDES permits for point source discharges. The Clean Water Act and other related regulations address sewage discharges, oil spills, and ocean dumping in navigable waters and the contiguous zone. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also regulates discharges of oil and noxious substances. The MPRSA governs ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline. The Clean Water Act and related regulations address sewage discharges, oil spills, and ocean dumping in navigable waters. The MPRSA governs ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline, with jurisdictional considerations regarding distances in nautical miles. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has received significant attention due to the increase in cruise ship passengers visits during the 1990s. After a significant increase in cruise ship passengers visiting Alaska in the 1990s, concerns over cruise ship pollution on marine resources grew among Alaska Natives and other groups. In a notable case, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties of $6.5 million for knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances in Alaska, including oil-contaminated bilge water. This was part of a larger $18 million federal plea agreement for environmental violations in multiple locations. Public outcry over these violations prompted the state to implement a program. The Royal Caribbean cruise ship faced penalties for environmental violations in multiple locations, including Florida, New York, and California. Public concern led to a program in December 1999 to identify cruise ship waste streams. Voluntary sampling in 2000 showed that waste treatment systems on most ships did not meet U.S. Coast Guard standards, with fecal coliform levels far exceeding the limits. Legislation was passed in December 2000 to address cruise ship pollution in Alaska. Legislation in December 2000 established standards for cruise ships in Alaska, prohibiting discharge of untreated sewage and graywater in US navigable waters. EPA was authorized to set regulations for sewage and graywater discharges. Cruise ships can only discharge treated sewage wastes in Alaska waters while traveling at least 6 knots and 1 nautical mile from shore, with specific limits on fecal coliforms and total suspended solids. The legislation in December 2000 established standards for cruise ships in Alaska, prohibiting the discharge of untreated sewage and graywater in US navigable waters. Vessels with systems that can treat sewage and graywater must meet effluent standards of no more than 20 fecal coliforms per 100 ml, no more than 30 mg/l of total suspended solids, and total residual chlorine concentrations not exceeding 10 mg/l. Coast Guard oversight and enforcement require sampling, data collection, and recordkeeping by vessel operators. Regulations were issued in 2001 to implement the federal law, stipulating minimum sampling and testing procedures. The Coast Guard issued regulations in 2001 to implement federal law for cruise ships in Alaska, with penalties for violations. EPA conducted a project to evaluate treatment systems and standards for sewage and graywater discharges. Data from wastewater sampling in 2004 and 2005 was summarized in the 2008 Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report. EPA also distributed a survey questionnaire in 2004. In 2004, EPA distributed a survey on sewage and graywater treatment devices for cruise ships in Alaska. Sampling efforts show that advanced treatment systems are effective in treating various pollutants. Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to set standards for cruise ship discharges. In 2001, Alaska enacted its own law (AS 46.03.460-AS 46.03.490) to regulate the discharge of blackwater and graywater from ships. The law set standards and sampling requirements for blackwater discharges, with additional standards for graywater due to high fecal coliform counts. Effluent standards for large cruise ships were implemented in 2001 for blackwater and 2003 for graywater, while small ships had three years to comply. The law in Alaska regulates the discharge of blackwater and graywater from ships, with standards set for large cruise ships in 2001 and 2003. Large ships have improved wastewater treatment systems, while small ships have not installed new systems. The quality of wastewater discharged from large ships has improved dramatically, while small ships have not installed new treatment systems. Effluent quality from small ships remains constant, with pollutants exceeding water quality standards. Concentrations of free chlorine, fecal coliform, copper, and zinc from smaller vessels pose risks to aquatic life and human health. Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative in 2006, requiring cruise lines to pay taxes for each passenger, increasing fines for violations, and mandating new environmental regulations for cruise ships. Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative in 2006, imposing taxes on cruise lines for each passenger, increasing fines for wastewater violations, and mandating new environmental regulations for cruise ships. Revenues from the taxes will benefit local communities and public services. Some cruise lines have stopped operating in Alaskan waters due to the initiative, while opponents argue it could harm the state's tourism competitiveness. Alaska enacted legislation (HB 134) to give the Department of Environmental Conservation more time to implement stringent wastewater treatment standards and created a scientific review board to assess achievability. Other states have also taken action to regulate cruise ship discharges. Maine enacted legislation (Maine LD. 1158) governing discharges of graywater or mixed blackwater/graywater into coastal waters, applicable to large cruise ships after January 1, 2006, with advanced wastewater treatment systems and permits from the state Department of Environmental Protection. The federal Alaska cruise ship law requires ships to obtain a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Prior to 2006, graywater discharges were allowed if ships had a treatment system meeting requirements. California enacted laws in 2004 to prohibit various discharges from cruise ships. EPA approved Maine's request for No Discharge Zones. California has enacted several laws to regulate cruise ship waste management, including bans on waste incinerators, sewage sludge discharge, and hazardous waste discharge. In 2006, California also passed a law requiring ballast water performance standards to prevent the spread of invasive species. Other states like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii have agreements with the industry to enforce certain practices. Cruise ships have agreements with various states and organizations to adhere to waste management practices, such as eliminating wastewater discharges within a certain distance from the coast, reporting hazardous waste off-loaded in the US, and undergoing environmental inspections. For example, in 2004, Washington, Northwest Cruise Ship Association, and Port of Seattle signed a memorandum allowing treated wastewater discharge but prohibiting untreated wastewater and sludge discharge. The memorandum of understanding (MOU) allows cruise ships to discharge wastewater treated with advanced systems into state waters, prohibiting untreated wastewater and sludge. Environmental advocates criticize voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement, but states argue that federal law permits more rigorous requirements. In 2009, the Department of Ecology found that cruise ships mostly complied with the MOU, producing high-quality effluent comparable to on-land plants. Enforcement of the voluntary agreement remains a concern. The cruise ship industry has adopted waste management practices to protect water quality, with guidelines requiring discharge of graywater and blackwater only while underway and at least 4 miles from shore. Pressure from environmental advocates and the industry's desire to promote a positive image have led to these initiatives. Members of the Cruise Lines International Association have implemented these practices in their worldwide operations, building on regulations of the IMO and U.S. EPA. The cruise industry has implemented waste management guidelines for discharging graywater and blackwater at least 4 miles from shore. They have also adopted Safety Management System plans certified by the IMO. Collaboration with equipment manufacturers and regulators is ongoing to develop technologies for environmental protection. Environmental groups prefer enforceable standards over voluntary ones. The cruise industry has implemented waste management guidelines for discharging graywater and blackwater at least 4 miles from shore. They have also adopted Safety Management System plans certified by the IMO. Collaboration with equipment manufacturers and regulators is ongoing to develop technologies for environmental protection. The industry joined with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance, announcing conservation efforts in four areas to protect biodiversity in coastal regions. In 2006, CLIA and CI collaborated to protect marine ecosystems by integrating sensitive areas into cruise line navigational charts. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. committed to retrofitting its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, following environmental violations in the 1990s. Efforts to improve practices after federal enforcement actions in the 1990s for environmental violations resulted in RCCL paying $27 million in fines. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in laws, regulations, research needs, oversight, and enforcement. More assessment is needed to determine if current measures are sufficient, and whether legislative changes are necessary to address gaps in managing cruise ship pollution. The report discusses the management of cruise ship pollution and the need for potential legislative changes to address gaps in regulations. Graywater contamination from cruise ships is a particular concern, with findings of fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and plastics. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy has advocated for strengthened requirements in this area. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear, uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels, including uniform standards, recordkeeping, sampling, testing, and incentives for innovative treatment technologies. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed similar measures but did not progress in Congress. The Clean Cruise Ship Act, introduced in the 111th Congress, aimed to amend the Clean Water Act to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters without meeting specific standards. It would require wastewater treatment on cruise ships and enhance federal enforcement authority. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed stricter regulations on cruise ship discharges, including sewage, graywater, and bilge water. It would authorize federal enforcement authority and impose passenger fees for implementation. Environmental advocates supported the legislation, while industry groups argued against targeting an industry with high environmental standards. Congress may need to address state-level regulations on cruise ship discharges and harmonize differences. The status of EPA's efforts to manage cruise ship wastes is also an issue for Congress. Congress authorized EPA to issue standards for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska in 2000. EPA has been collecting information and assessing the need for additional standards but has not proposed any rules yet. In December 2008, EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report that examines five cruise ship waste streams and discusses current federal actions to address them. The report discusses possible options to address cruise ship discharges, highlighting the need for harmonizing U.S. laws and updating regulations to reflect improved technology. EPA has not determined the necessity or feasibility of these options. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy emphasized the importance of research to understand cruise ship waste generation, impacts of discharges, and potential control technologies. Research can help prioritize resources to address significant threats, focusing on pollutant transport processes, small passenger vessel practices, and disposal options for concentrated sludge. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the need for research on cruise ship waste generation and impacts of discharges. This includes studying pollutant transport processes, small passenger vessel practices, disposal options for concentrated sludge, and the cumulative impacts of vessel pollution on sensitive ecosystems. EPA's 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report suggested research options like nationwide sampling programs and studies on human health and environmental effects of cruise ship discharges. The 2000 GAO report highlighted the need for monitoring cruise ship discharges to evaluate current standards and management effectiveness. Increased federal oversight by the Coast Guard is necessary for maintenance, operation of pollution prevention equipment, and verification of proper off-loading of garbage and oily waste. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing federal programs on cruise ship pollution, including monitoring pollution prevention equipment and verifying proper waste disposal. There are concerns about the Coast Guard's resources for inspections, especially with increased homeland security responsibilities. EPA suggests options for improving enforcement, such as enhancing monitoring and rewarding passengers for assistance. The EPA has identified options for improving enforcement and compliance on cruise ship pollution, including enhancing monitoring, rewarding passengers for detecting illegal activities, allowing state personnel to inspect pollution control equipment, and charging a passenger fee for onboard marine engineers. The GAO found issues with the process for referring violations to other countries and recommended greater efforts by the Coast Guard to follow up on pollution cases occurring outside U.S. jurisdiction."
