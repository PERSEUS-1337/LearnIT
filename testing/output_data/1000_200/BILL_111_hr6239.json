    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prevention of Frivolous Ethanol Lawsuits Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to ethanol lawsuits. The Congress finds that ethanol is widely used in gasoline for vehicles but increasing the blending limit raises concerns about emission control device failure and engine performance. The Federal Trade Commission is considering labeling requirements for fuels with higher ethanol blending limits to warn consumers of potential harm to conventional vehicles. Federal testing is ongoing to assess the impact of increased ethanol blending on motor vehicle engines. The executive branch is currently conducting tests on newer motor vehicles to assess the effects of raising the ethanol blending limit in gasoline. There is a lack of data on how this change would impact older vehicles and nonroad engines. Despite this, the executive branch has the authority to increase the blending limit and is in the process of making a decision. Congress should address any negative impacts on interstate commerce that may result from allowing an increase in the blending limit. SEC. 3. TARGETED LIABILITY PROTECTIONS FOR CLAIMS RELATED TO ETHANOL IN FUEL. Liability Protections: Covered entities are immune from suit and liability under Federal and State law for claims related to the use of renewable fuel containing ethanol in concentrations greater than 10 percent in internal combustion engines. Loss includes death, injury, illness, disability, or fear of injury. The immunity provision covers claims for loss related to the use of renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10%, including physical, mental, or emotional injury, illness, disability, fear of injury, and property damage. The immunity applies regardless of when the loss occurred. The Clean Air Act allows for the use of ethanol concentrations over 10% in internal combustion engines. Covered persons have immunity from most suits, except for cases of death or serious injury caused by willful misconduct. An action for wrongful death or serious physical injury caused by willful misconduct can be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Clean Air Act grants immunity to covered persons, except in cases of death or serious injury. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia handles cases of wrongful death or serious physical injury due to willful misconduct. The law governing such cases is based on the state where the misconduct occurred, unless it conflicts with federal law. Complaints in these cases must detail each element of the claim, including the alleged misconduct and its causal link to the injury. The complaint in cases of wrongful death or serious physical injury due to willful misconduct must include facts supporting the allegation of causation and the injury suffered. It also requires a verification by affidavit from the plaintiff stating the truth of the pleading, except for matters alleged on information and belief. The plaintiff must prove willful misconduct by each person sued with clear and convincing evidence in cases of wrongful death or serious physical injury. Actions under this subsection will be heard by a three-judge panel for motions to dismiss or summary judgment. The three-judge panel has jurisdiction over actions under subsection (b) for motions to dismiss and summary judgment. If motions are denied or time expires, the action is referred to the chief judge for further proceedings, including trial. Civil discovery is not allowed until each person sued has a chance to file a motion to dismiss and the court rules on it. In actions under subsection (b), the court allows discovery only on relevant issues contested in the action. Discovery requests must be responded to only if the court deems the information necessary for the requesting party's case. Under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court will allow discovery only if the requesting party needs the information to prove or defend a material issue in the action, and if the benefits of the response outweigh the burden on the responding party. In an action under subsection (b), the amount of damages awarded to a plaintiff will be reduced by any collateral source benefits received. Additionally, noneconomic damages can only be awarded in proportion to a defendant's responsibility for the harm to the plaintiff. The term \"noneconomic damages\" refers to losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, and other nonpecuniary losses. Rule 11 sanctions will be imposed by a district court for violations in actions under subsection (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 11 sanctions may include ordering payment for expenses incurred due to violations, such as attorney's fees, to deter repeat conduct. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals within 30 days of denial of immunity or exclusion motions. The exclusion for regulated activity of manufacturers or distributors under subsection (h)(1) states that if an act or omission related to a covered countermeasure is subject to regulation by the Clean Air Act and no enforcement action has been initiated or if the action has been terminated without a covered remedy, it shall not be considered willful misconduct. The exclusion for regulated activity of manufacturers or distributors under subsection (h)(1) states that if an enforcement action has been initiated and terminated without a covered remedy, it shall not be considered willful misconduct. Any action under subsection (b) shall be stayed during such enforcement action. This section does not limit any rights or remedies of the United States under other laws. In this section, definitions for \"covered entity\" and \"enforcement action\" are provided. A covered entity is defined as an entity involved in the manufacture, sale, or distribution of fuel or products using renewable fuel. An enforcement action includes various legal proceedings such as criminal prosecution, injunctions, civil monetary proceedings, and product recalls. The term \"covered remedy\" refers to outcomes like criminal convictions, injunctions, civil monetary payments, and debarments resulting from a final court or agency decision. The terms \"final\" and \"finally\" pertain to court judgments that cannot be appealed or voluntary dismissals. The term \"willful misconduct\" refers to acts or omissions not compliant with regulations or waivers under the Clean Air Act. The term \"willful misconduct\" denotes intentional, unjustified actions disregarding known risks under the Clean Air Act regulations for ethanol-gasoline blends over 10% ethanol volume."
