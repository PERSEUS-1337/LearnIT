    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tar Creek Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to the restoration project. The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma was a lead and zinc mining area that operated from the early 1900s to the 1970s. The site, located in a flood-prone area, was on Indian land controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Mining companies had to pump large volumes of water from underground mine workings due to water in the ore-producing Boone Aquifer. During World War I and II, mining at the Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma accounted for a significant portion of the Nation's wartime lead and zinc consumption. The mining operations generated millions of tons of waste tailings, known as chat, which the Department of the Interior recommended to be stockpiled aboveground for later reprocessing. In 1960, Congress passed a law to encourage lead and zinc production at the site as mining activity declined in the early 1970s. The Zinc Mining Stabilization Act aimed to boost lead and zinc production at the Tar Creek Superfund Site. By the early 1970s, water from the Boone Aquifer began filling the underground mine workings, leading to the formation of acid mine water. In 1979, acid mine water started discharging at the surface, prompting the site's placement on the National Priorities List in 1983. The Environmental Protection Agency initiated remediation efforts in 1984, ultimately concluding in 1994 after significant financial investment. The Environmental Protection Agency found it impossible to remediate the acid mine water at the Site due to numerous open mine shafts and boreholes. The stockpiled chat, containing toxic heavy metals like lead, contributes to flood problems and recharges underground mine workings. The stockpiled chat at the Site is used in construction, contaminating residential areas with heavy metals like lead. In 1994, the EPA started remediation work on yards with unsafe lead levels, as studies show children in the area have elevated blood lead levels causing health issues. The stockpiled chat at the Site poses a danger to human health due to elevated lead levels, causing learning disabilities and other health problems in children. Subsidences have occurred at the Site, with no remediation efforts by the US Government. The Site's unique environmental problems make it unsafe for human habitation. The curr_chunk states \"SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE.\" The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to residents in the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma. The EPA will continue to be responsible for the cleanup of the site and will work with other agencies for a comprehensive resolution. The EPA will provide assistance to residents in the Tar Creek Superfund site and work towards a comprehensive resolution for environmental and health problems related to the site."
