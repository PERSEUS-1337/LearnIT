    "content": "In enacting the CAA of 1970, Congress differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were given flexibility by states to set emission limits, while new sources had to adhere to EPA-set standards to prevent new pollution problems. The CAA of 1970 differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. New sources must adhere to strict technology-based standards set by the EPA to prevent new pollution problems. Major new sources in clean or dirty air areas must undergo NSR, requiring pre-construction permits with emission limits based on best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate. The RMRR issue arises due to CAA regulations. The Clean Air Act requires new stationary sources to meet strict technology-based standards for emissions. The RMRR issue arises because modifications of existing sources are also subject to these standards. NSR applies to major new sources or modifications in both PSD and nonattainment areas. The key issue is determining the exact changes that trigger NSR. The Clean Air Act requires new stationary sources to meet strict emissions standards. The pivotal issue is determining what changes to a stationary source constitute a \"modification.\" The definition of \"modification\" includes any physical change or change in operation that increases air pollutant emissions. This definition determines which changes trigger NSR. The definition of \"reconstruction\" under the Clean Air Act triggers NSPSs and NSR when an existing facility undergoes significant component replacement exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost of a new facility. Unlike modifications, reconstructions can occur regardless of emission increases. EPA's definition of \"modification\" also plays a crucial role in determining compliance with emissions standards. The EPA's definition of \"modification\" includes exceptions for routine maintenance, repair, and replacement activities that do not trigger heightened pollution-control requirements. Eligibility for the exemption was previously determined on a case-by-case basis. The EPA's RMRR exemption was determined on a case-by-case basis, considering various factors. In the case of WEPCO, EPA dismissed the argument that the proposed renovations qualified as RMRR, requiring a permit for construction to begin. The Seventh Circuit upheld EPA's ruling using a case-by-case approach. The Seventh Circuit ruled that EPA's decision on WEPCO's proposal not meeting RMRR criteria was proper due to the substantial and unprecedented extent of the plant work. The project's purpose, infrequency, and high cost all indicated non-routineness. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point recently, with CAA enforcement actions against electric utilities for exceeding routine maintenance. President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group also issued recommendations in May 2001. In May 2001, President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group issued recommendations regarding the RMRR exemption. This led to EPA's report in June 2002 on the impact of NSR, which recommended specifying certain categories of activities as \"routine maintenance.\" EPA then published final regulations on December 31, 2002, affecting how emission increases are calculated for NSR purposes. EPA also proposed a rule on the same day to clarify the RMRR exception by specifying activity categories considered RMRR. The EPA proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception by specifying activity categories that will be considered RMRR without other considerations. The Eleventh Circuit made a decision in EPA v. Whitman, where the EPA found TVA violated the CAA through projects beyond RMRR without permits. The court found the CAA unconstitutional in imposing severe penalties. The court found the CAA unconstitutional in imposing severe penalties for noncompliance with EPA-issued ACOs. TVA was free to violate the ACOs without fear of penalty. The RMRR exception was reshaped in October 2003 with a new equipment-replacement rule. The new rule establishes activities as per se RMRR, providing regulatory certainty without hindering plant operations. EPA's final action on part of the December 2002 proposal does not include the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement allowance. The replacement of process unit components with identical or functional equivalents is considered RMRR under the new rule. The new rule allows for the replacement of components in a process unit under certain conditions, without the need for a case-by-case approach. This change aims to provide regulatory certainty and streamline plant operations. The new rule allows for component replacement in process units without a case-by-case approach, aiming to streamline operations and provide regulatory certainty. The higher thresholds of the per se approach will reduce the need for case-by-case analysis. The rule imposes no recordkeeping requirements, relying on existing business records and EPA's inspection authority for enforcement. It only applies to conduct after the effective date and does not affect pending enforcement actions. Multiple states and environmental groups are challenging the rule in court, arguing it exceeds EPA's authority under the CAA. The RMRR rule, challenged in court, was stayed pending full review due to demonstrated irreparable harm and likelihood of success by petitioners. The old case-by-case approach continues as the new rule remains suspended. The court declined to consolidate the cases with another group challenging a previous rule but designated the same panel for review. The court declined to consolidate cases challenging the December, 2002 final rule with another group but designated the same panel for review due to the related nature of the two groups."
