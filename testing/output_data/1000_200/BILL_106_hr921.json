    "content": "The \"Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings and purposes, definitions, market loss assistance, payment amounts, relationship to other payments, emergency requirements, livestock market reporting, and regulations. The Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999 highlights the adverse effects of changes in marketing relationships between swine producers and meat packers on swine prices. It also addresses the concentration of the meat packing industry and the increase in live swine imports impacting slaughter capacity and swine prices in the United States. Additionally, it acknowledges a swine market price crisis in 1998. During the last quarter of 1998, there was a significant increase in swine available for slaughter, a decrease in packer slaughter capacity, and a surge in Canadian swine imports to the United States. This led to the lowest live swine prices in the spot market for the 20th century, resulting in a substantial reduction in equity capital investment for swine producers. In 1998, swine producers experienced a reduction in equity capital investment due to a decrease in their share of the consumer pork dollar. Despite stable retail prices, pork consumption increased by seven percent, making it the only meat protein with a per capita consumption increase. The purpose of the Act is to compensate swine producers affected by circumstances beyond their control. The Act aims to compensate swine producers for losses incurred in the fourth quarter of 1998 due to adverse economic factors and government failures in pursuing foreign trade opportunities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"swine,\" \"swine producer,\" \"crisis period,\" \"packer,\" \"feeder pig,\" and \"swine operation.\" These definitions clarify the specific meanings of these terms within the context of the Act. The term \"swine operation\" refers to a person or group raising swine in the United States during a crisis period. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. MARKET LOSS ASSISTANCE. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide financial assistance to swine producers to offset market losses during the crisis period. Eligibility requires maintaining a swine operation and marketing swine for slaughter. Certain producers, like those affiliated with publicly owned packers, are ineligible for assistance. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide financial assistance to swine producers during the crisis period. Eligible producers must maintain a swine operation and market swine for slaughter. Assistance will be limited to swine producers who are not affiliated with publicly owned packers, and an application process will be required for eligibility determination. SEC. 5. PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND PAYMENT LIMITATIONS. Assistance under this Act will be distributed fairly and equitably to swine producers who have incurred losses. Payments to eligible producers will not exceed $25.00 per slaughter-weight swine or $9.00 per feeder pig marketed during the crisis period. Payments to swine operation producers under this Act are calculated by multiplying the number of eligible swine marketed and slaughtered by $25.00, adding the number of eligible feeder pigs marketed multiplied by $9.00, and deducting payments received in another program. Payment limitations are set at $50,000 per swine operation for a swine producer. SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PAYMENTS. Assistance provided under this Act is in addition to assistance, payments, and loans obtained under various other programs such as the Agricultural Market Transition Act, noninsured crop assistance program, crop insurance indemnities, and emergency loans for 1998 production. Payments under the Small Hog Operation Program of the Department of Agriculture announced on January 8, 1999, will be deducted from payments made to swine producers under this Act. SEC. 7. Emergency Requirement; Use of Commodity Credit Corporation. Congress designates funds as emergency requirement for this Act. The Secretary will utilize Commodity Credit Corporation for Act provisions. SEC. 8. Mandatory Livestock Market Reporting. Agricultural Marketing Act amended to include mandatory livestock market reporting. In this section, definitions are provided for livestock, livestock product, and packer. Livestock includes cattle, sheep, and swine. Livestock product refers to products derived from livestock. A packer is defined as a person involved in buying livestock for slaughter, processing livestock products, or marketing livestock products. The term 'prices, volume, and terms of sale' in the context of marketing livestock products includes various pricing factors, quality characteristics, and contracts offered by packers. The Secretary of Agriculture is referred to as the 'Secretary'. Mandatory reporting requirements apply to packers estimated to be involved in a significant portion of the market. The Secretary mandates reporting requirements for packers involved in buying, manufacturing, or marketing livestock products in the U.S. This includes reporting information on prices, volume, and terms of sale for domestic and imported livestock. The Secretary requires packers to report domestic and imported livestock products promptly. Noncompliance with reporting requirements is unlawful, and the Secretary can verify the accuracy of the information provided. The Secretary can issue a cease and desist order and impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation if a packer is believed to be violating reporting requirements. Factors are considered in determining the penalty amount. The Secretary can impose a civil penalty on a packer for violations, considering factors like the gravity of the offense and the packer's business size. If the packer fails to pay the penalty, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for legal action. The Secretary also encourages voluntary reporting. The Secretary can impose civil penalties on packers for violations and may recover the penalty amount in a civil action. Voluntary reporting by packers not under mandatory reporting is encouraged. Information received will be made available to the public in a timely manner with limitations on disclosing party identities. The report transaction details are not disclosed, packer identities remain confidential, and proprietary business information is protected. The Secretary's authority to collect voluntary reports is not restricted. The mandatory reporting requirement will expire after three years. Repeal of section 1127(a) of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999. SEC. 9. REGULATIONS.
