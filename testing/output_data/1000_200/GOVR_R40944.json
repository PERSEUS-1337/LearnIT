    "content": "Copyright is the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and exploit an original work of authorship. Registration with the U.S. Copyright Office offers advantages, such as the ability to file infringement suits and potentially receive statutory damages and attorney's fees. In the 2001 Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Tasini, the exclusive rights of copyright owners were litigated. In the 2001 Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Tasini, freelance authors sued publishers for reproducing and distributing their work electronically without specific authorization, requiring publishers to obtain a separate license from the author for electronic reproduction. In the aftermath of Tasini, freelance works were removed from electronic databases. Multiple class action infringement suits were activated and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, including Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick, a similar class action lawsuit. The Reed Elsevier case involves individual authors and trade groups representing authors who produced written works for certain publishers on a freelance basis. The publishers reproduced the articles in their electronic databases without compensating or obtaining consent from the authors, leading to a class action lawsuit. Litigation can only proceed after the court certifies the class, and settlement proposals require court approval. Any class member can object to a settlement proposal, but the objection can only be withdrawn with the court's permission. The Reed Elsevier case involved authors who produced freelance works for publishers, which were later reproduced in electronic databases without consent. The plaintiffs sued for copyright infringement, leading to a settlement in 2005 categorizing claims for compensation based on copyright eligibility. The settlement in the Reed Elsevier case categorized claims for compensation based on copyright eligibility. Category A claimants received a flat fee, Category B claimants received a flat fee or a percentage of the original price of the work, and Category C claimants also received a flat fee or a percentage of the original price. However, if total costs exceeded $18 million, Category C claimants' payments could be reduced or eliminated before Category A and B claimants were affected. The \"C-reduction\" feature in the Reed Elsevier case affected Category A and B claimants. Plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against defendants in exchange for compensation. Plaintiffs and defendants sought class certification and settlement approval. Objectors argued the settlement was unfair to Category C claimants who were paid less and faced reduction if total claims exceeded $18 million. Defendants contended Category C claimants were adequately represented. The defendants argued that Category C claimants with unregistered copyrights were adequately represented in the settlement, as they would not have been able to bring infringement actions otherwise. The district court granted final class certification and settlement approval in September 2005, but objectors appealed, questioning the fairness of the settlement and the representation of named plaintiffs. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals raised jurisdictional concerns regarding claims of infringement of unregistered copyrights. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals raised jurisdictional concerns regarding claims of infringement of unregistered copyrights. Both plaintiffs and defendants argued that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not jurisdictional in nature, stating that district courts acquire jurisdiction over related copyright claims even if they arise from unregistered copyrights. The majority opinion disagreed, emphasizing Congress's limited provision of subject-matter jurisdiction in copyright actions. The appellate court emphasized that district courts' subject-matter jurisdiction in copyright cases is limited to claims arising from registered copyrights only, citing relevant case law. The Second Circuit held that copyright registration prior to an infringement suit is jurisdictional, and unregistered copyrights prevented class certification and settlement approval. Judge Walker dissented, citing the need to distinguish between true jurisdictional bars and claim-processing rules. The Supreme Court's ruling in Eberhart prompted a re-evaluation of the copyright registration requirement, categorizing it as an \"enforcement mechanism.\" The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts federal court jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts federal court jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions by requiring preregistration or registration of the copyright claim before initiating a civil action. If registration is refused, the applicant can still proceed with the action by serving notice on the Register of Copyrights. The Register may choose to become a party in the action within sixty days. The Register's failure to become a party does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to determine the copyright claim issue. Petitioners argued that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is not a jurisdictional restriction but a mandatory prerequisite to suit. They contended that even if it is jurisdictional, it only applies to initiating actions, not settling them. The registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is not a jurisdictional restriction but a mandatory prerequisite to suit. Respondents argue that it is a claim-processing rule, not a bar to jurisdiction, and can be waived by defendants. They warn that the Second Circuit's interpretation could hinder negotiated resolutions for disputes involving unregistered works. The petitioners and the United States argued that the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over the case, even if original subject-matter jurisdiction was lacking. They emphasized that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory prerequisite to suit and should be strictly enforced. The U.S. argued that district courts should enforce \u00a7411(a) even if not raised by a party, to avoid wasting judicial resources. Both petitioners and respondents wanted the Supreme Court to overturn the Second Circuit's ruling. Professor Merritt supported the Second Circuit's judgment, stating that \u00a7411(a) clearly restricts registration requirements. Professor Deborah Jones Merritt supports the Second Circuit's judgment on \u00a7411(a), arguing that it restricts federal court jurisdiction, serves public purposes, and upholds the integrity of the judicial process by not allowing parties to waive it. Professor Merritt defended the fairness of the settlement in court, arguing that the registration requirement protects Internet service providers from excessive copyright claims. The Computer and Communications Industry Association also supported the Second Circuit's judgment, emphasizing the importance of the registration requirement in reducing technology companies' copyright exposure. The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) supported the Second Circuit's decision in Reed Elsevier, stating that the registration requirement protects technology companies from copyright claims. CCIA argued that there was no case or controversy before the Supreme Court and no circuit split on the issue of \u00a7411(a) limiting federal courts' jurisdiction. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals' judgment on March 2, 2010. The Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals' judgment in Reed Elsevier on March 2, 2010. Justice Thomas ruled that the Copyright Act's registration requirement does not limit federal courts' jurisdiction in copyright infringement claims for unregistered works. The district court had the authority to certify the class and approve the settlement between freelance authors, publishers, and electronic databases. The Supreme Court clarified that subject-matter jurisdiction pertains to the court's power to adjudicate a case, distinguishing between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdictional claim-processing rules. Congressional intent determines whether a statutory limitation should be treated as jurisdictional. The Arbaugh Court clarified that statutory limitations on coverage should be treated as nonjurisdictional if Congress does not specify them as jurisdictional. In a Title VII case, the Court determined that the requirement of having 15 or more employees was a substantive element of the claim, not affecting federal court jurisdiction. This decision was based on the lack of clear jurisdictional language in Title VII and no prior Supreme Court cases suggesting otherwise. The employee numerosity requirement in Title VII claims was not clearly stated as jurisdictional, as no prior Supreme Court case had suggested. The requirement is separate from Title VII's jurisdiction-granting section, similar to the Arbaugh precedent in the Copyright Act. The Court rejected the argument that the word \"jurisdiction\" in the statute indicated Congress' intent to make it jurisdictional. The Court affirmed that Congress intended the requirement for registration in copyright infringement suits to be jurisdictional, separate from other jurisdiction-granting provisions in the Copyright Act. The Court emphasized that federal courts have adjudicatory authority over the issue of registrability, regardless of the Register's involvement in the suit. Additionally, exceptions to the registration requirement are congressionally authorized in Section 411(a) of the U.S. Code. The Court highlighted exceptions to the registration requirement in copyright infringement suits, allowing adjudication for unregistered works in specific cases. It argued against ascribing jurisdictional significance to this condition, citing previous decisions treating similar prerequisites as nonjurisdictional. The Court aimed to differentiate its 2007 decision in the Reed Elsevier case. In the Reed Elsevier case, the Court distinguished its 2007 decision in Bowles v. Russell regarding statutory requirements for initiating a lawsuit. The Court emphasized the relevance of context in determining whether a statute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional. The Court in Reed Elsevier case discussed the relevance of context in determining if a statute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional. It was found that \u00a7411(a)'s registration requirement is not jurisdictional, akin to the Arbaugh employee numerosity requirement rather than the Bowles statutory time limit. The Court rejected arguments to construe \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional for policy goals and declined to affirm on estoppel grounds. The Supreme Court rejected arguments to construe \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional in the Reed Elsevier case. The Court found that the registration requirement is not jurisdictional, similar to the Arbaugh employee numerosity requirement. The Court also declined to affirm on estoppel grounds. The Supreme Court declined to affirm on estoppel grounds and did not express an opinion on the fairness of the settlement. The court of appeals will now consider the merits of the settlement and objections to it. The question of whether \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory precondition for copyright infringement claims remains open for lower courts to decide. Justice Ginsburg, along with Justices Stevens and Breyer, agreed that \u00a7411(a) should be a precondition for filing a copyright infringement claim without restricting federal court jurisdiction. Justice Ginsburg, along with Justices Stevens and Breyer, highlighted the tension between the Arbaugh and Bowles precedents regarding the jurisdictional nature of statutory conditions for copyright infringement claims. While the Arbaugh Court emphasized that conditions are jurisdictional only if Congress explicitly states so, the Bowles Court considered the time limit for filing an appeal as jurisdictional based on longstanding precedents. Ginsburg proposed reconciling the two by suggesting that Bowles relied on established decisions. Justice Ginsburg proposed reconciling the tension between Arbaugh and Bowles precedents by emphasizing that Bowles relied on longstanding Supreme Court decisions, not Congress, making \u00a7411(a) nonjurisdictional. Over 200 lower court opinions characterize \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional, but none are from the Supreme Court. The Reed Elsevier case is remanded to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for further consideration. The case is remanded to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review the settlement's merits and objections. Freelance authors may receive compensation and databases can restore publications. Judge Walker's dissent raises concerns about the proposed damages formula. The Supreme Court's opinion in Reed Elsevier has implications for copyright holders in future infringement cases, allowing participation in settlements and lawsuits even without registered works. District courts may dismiss copyright claims for unregistered works. Objectors raise concerns about favoritism towards A- and B-class claims over C-class claims in settlements. The Supreme Court's Reed Elsevier decision allows district courts to dismiss copyright infringement claims for unregistered works, while also affirming the approval of class action settlements involving both registered and unregistered works. This case clarifies federal courts' jurisdiction and reaffirms the clear statement rule for statutory limitations."
