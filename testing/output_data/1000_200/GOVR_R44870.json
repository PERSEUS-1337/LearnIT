    "content": "Many governments recognize the international risks posed by environmental degradation and climate change, leading to the negotiation of international agreements to protect the environment and promote sustainable growth. While wealthier countries are called upon to take the lead, it is acknowledged that efforts must also be made in lower-income countries. However, these countries may lack the resources and expertise to implement environmental measures, leading to a reliance on international financial assistance. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992) was the first treaty to address human-driven climate change, with higher-income Parties committing to provide financial resources to developing countries for environmental obligations. The United States has provided financial and technical assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through bilateral and multilateral programs. This assistance aims to meet the full costs incurred by developing country Parties in complying with their obligations under the UNFCCC, ensuring adequacy, predictability, and burden sharing among developed country Parties. The United States has provided financial and technical assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through various international financial institutions and organizations like the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds. The Convention establishes a financial mechanism to provide funds to developing country Parties, with the GEF being one of the entities involved in this process. Article 11 of the Convention entrusts the operation of the financial mechanism to international entities like the GEF, established in 1991. The US has committed $2.732 billion to the GEF since 1994, corresponding to 13% of total funding. The US has committed $2.732 billion to the GEF since 1994, accounting for 13% of total funding. In 2009, the COP in Copenhagen noted the Copenhagen Accord, leading to the adoption of the Cancun Agreements in 2010, including a commitment to provide $30 billion for climate finance from 2010-2012. Additionally, there was a pledge to mobilize $100 billion annually by developed countries. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 from developed countries to address climate finance needs of developing countries. Funds can come from various sources, public and private. Developed countries, including the US, are obligated to provide financial support to assist developing countries in combating climate change. The Paris Agreement requires developed countries, like the US, to mobilize financial support for developing countries' climate efforts. It encourages all Parties to provide voluntary financial support, emphasizing a progression in climate finance beyond previous efforts. The COP Decision reaffirms the pledge of $100 billion annually by 2020 and calls for continued mobilization through 2025. The Paris Agreement mandates developed countries to provide $100 billion annually by 2020 for climate finance, with a new goal set for 2025. President Trump announced withdrawal from the agreement in 2017, effective after November 4, 2020. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established in 2011 to operate independently from the UNFCCC. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established in 2011 during the COP in Durban, South Africa. It operates independently from the UNFCCC with its own board, trustee, and secretariat. The fund aims to assist developing countries in combating climate change through grants and concessional financing. It is capitalized by financial inputs from developed countries and other sources, totaling approximately $10.3 billion. The GCF became operational in 2014. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) became operational in 2014 with approximately $10.3 billion pledged for its initial capitalization. The Obama Administration pledged $3 billion over four years, with contributions made in 2016 and 2017. The funds were obligated from the Economic Support Fund under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. No contribution was made with FY2017 budget authority. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request aims to eliminate U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to align with President Trump's promise. Despite denouncing the GCF, the U.S. disbursed $1 billion under the Obama Administration, ensuring its membership on the GCF board. The future stance of the Trump Administration on GCF funding remains unclear. The Obama Administration ensured US membership on the GCF board during capitalization. The Trump Administration's stance on retaining board membership remains unclear. Future US engagement with the GCF will be decided as part of internal policy development on climate change. The GCF is one of many possible sources for climate finance commitments. The GCF is one of many sources for climate finance commitments, including public, private, bilateral, and multilateral sources. While the GCF may contribute to the $100 billion goal, it is not expected to provide the entirety of the funding. Development bank instruments, carbon markets, and private capital are also crucial for mobilizing assistance. The GCF would not interfere with bilateral climate change assistance and would complement existing multilateral mechanisms like the GEF and the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a mechanism for climate change assistance that complements existing multilateral mechanisms like the GEF and the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds. The GCF board determines its complementarity with other U.N. multilateral mechanisms, and donor countries allocate funds based on congressional guidance. Donor Parties, pledges, and disbursements to the GCF are listed in Table 1. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) lists donor Parties, pledges, and disbursements in U.S. dollars as of June 2, 2017. The top 20 donor countries are presented in Figure 1 based on pledges per capita. Withdrawal from the PA and financial commitments may have positive and negative implications for the United States, including fiscal savings from the annual $1 billion climate finance provided under the Obama Administration. Critics question the effectiveness and transparency of financial assistance programs. Critics question the effectiveness of international financial assistance in spurring economic development and mitigating climate change. Reductions in funding could benefit other priorities and sustain markets for GHG-intensive products, including U.S. exports. Some stakeholders argue that U.S. withdrawal from commitments under the PA redefines international relations, emphasizing sovereignty and national interest. The U.S. withdrawal from commitments under the PA redefines international relations, emphasizing sovereignty, national interest, and economic control. Possible repercussions include investment efficiencies and the argument that climate finance supports humanitarian and security interests. Some argue that climate finance, particularly adaptation assistance, can benefit the humanitarian and security interests of the United States. The impacts of global climate change could worsen poverty, social tensions, and environmental degradation in developing countries, affecting U.S. interests. Additionally, climate finance in these countries may support U.S. businesses that promote low-emissions technologies, while reductions in financial assistance could hinder global economic activity and U.S. exports. Financial commitments under the PA and foreign assistance can enhance the United States' global environmental leadership, influencing international economic and environmental policies. Withdrawal from the PA would release specific obligations but not general commitments under the UNFCCC to provide financial resources for developing countries. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and cessation of U.S. payments to UN climate change programs could impact international efforts to help developing countries confront climate change. The decision's effects would depend on the efficiency of other nations, regional governments, states, cities, and the private sector in providing assistance to make up for the lack of U.S. contributions. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and cessation of U.S. payments to UN climate change programs could impact international efforts to help developing countries confront climate change. U.S. contributions to developing countries for climate change-related activities are determined by the U.S. Congress, which authorizes federal agency programs and provides guidance to the agencies. Congressional committees oversee U.S. interests in international climate change assistance."
