    "content": "Some in the 112th Congress wanted to cut international affairs spending, including foreign aid programs, to reduce the federal budget deficit. However, others believed a strong foreign affairs budget was crucial for national security and foreign policy interests, potentially saving money by avoiding costly military interventions. Congress considered the FY2013 Department of State appropriations in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The House passed legislation (H.R. 933) on March 6, 2013, to fund federal programs for the remainder of FY2013. The Senate approved an expanded version on March 20, 2013, and it was signed into law on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). The State-Foreign Operations appropriation, representing about 1.5% of the total federal budget, supports international affairs programs and activities. The State-Foreign Operations appropriation, representing about 1.5% of the total federal budget, supports international affairs programs and activities, including foreign economic and security assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. However, some international affairs programs like food aid and certain commissions are funded through other appropriations bills. The State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds international programs and activities, including foreign assistance and State Department operations. Some commissions like the International Boundary and Water Commission are also funded through this bill. Congressional activity related to this bill includes the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA Continuing Resolution signed by President Obama on March 26, 2013. Abbreviations and organizational structure details are provided in the appendices. President Obama signed the FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA, Full Year Continuing Resolution, which funds State-Foreign operations accounts at the FY2012 level for the remainder of FY2013. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, funded the government until March 27, 2013, providing a slight increase in funding for State and Foreign Operations non-OCO activities. H.J.Res. 117 would fund the federal government through March 27, 2013, providing a slight increase in funding for State and Foreign Operations non-OCO activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2013 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill with funding levels below the requested amount. The Senate set FY2013 funding for agencies at $16.3 billion, including $1.6 billion for OCO. The House Appropriations Committee approved a bill totaling $40.3 billion for regular funding and $8.2 billion for OCO, 12% less than requested. The bill allocated $15.8 billion for the Department of State and $32.9 billion for Foreign Operations. The House Appropriations Committee approved initial subcommittee allocations based on the House-passed budget resolution, allocating $48.38 billion for State-Foreign Operations, including $8.2 billion in OCO funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $53.02 billion for the same subcommittee, $3.2 billion of which were OCO funds, 3% less than the Administration's request. The Obama Administration had requested a 2.6% increase in funding for the Department of State-Foreign Operations and Related Agencies for FY2013. The Obama Administration requested a 2.6% increase in funding for the Department of State-Foreign Operations and Related Agencies in its FY2013 budget proposal to Congress. The total request was $54.9 billion, including $46.6 billion for the core budget and $8.2 billion for war-related Overseas Contingency Operations in frontline states. This represented a 2.6% increase over the estimated FY2012 funding level. The Obama Administration requested a 2.6% increase in funding for the Department of State-Foreign Operations and Related Agencies in its FY2013 budget proposal to Congress, totaling $54.9 billion. This included a 4.5% increase in State Department accounts and a 0.1% increase in Foreign Operations accounts. The Administration also requested $770 million for the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund and $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. The FY2013 budget request included a slight increase in State Department Administration of Foreign Affairs funding, a slight decrease in bilateral economic aid, and a small increase in security assistance funding. These three categories make up over 85% of the total State-Foreign Operations funding requested. The FY2013 State Department budget request included funding for various international affairs activities, with a 4.5% increase to $18.8 billion. This included support for State Department operations, International Organizations, International Peacekeeping, International Broadcasting, and entities like the National Endowment for Democracy and the U.S. Institute of Peace. The focus was on key efforts such as the military-to-civilian transition in Iraq and State Department-led efforts in frontline states. The FY2013 State Department budget request focused on supporting key efforts, including the military-to-civilian transition in Iraq and ongoing State Department-led efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The State Department became the lead agency for U.S. programs in Iraq after the departure of military forces in 2011, undertaking a wide-ranging policy agenda. The State Department is pursuing a wide-ranging policy agenda in Iraq after taking over responsibilities from the U.S. military forces in late 2011. The Administration requested 23% less funding for State Operations in Iraq for FY2013, reflecting the intent to \"normalize\" the U.S. presence. Cost-saving measures include a planned 25% reduction in the State Department presence in Iraq. The State Department's funding for operations in Iraq for FY2013 included a reduction in presence, security and sustainment contract cuts, and completion of construction projects. The House appropriations bill allocated $2.8 billion for operations in frontline states, with increased security but no funding for additional staff. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $2.1 billion for State Department operations in Iraq, citing adequacy under revised operational assumptions. The FY2013 budget request reflected reforms outlined in the QDDR. The FY2013 budget request reflected reforms outlined in the QDDR, including the establishment of a new Bureau of Energy Resources and elevation of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism to a Bureau. Funding for State Department operations in support of the Counterterrorism mission increased from $3.2 million in FY2011. The FY2013 budget request included increased funding for the State Department's Counterterrorism mission, with $19 million allocated for the new Bureau of Counterterrorism. Additional positions were requested for both the Bureau of Counterterrorism and the Bureau of Energy Resources. The FY2013 budget request included 22 new direct-hire positions for the Bureau of Energy Resources at a cost of $5.4 million. The Bureau aimed to strengthen market incentives, enhance human resource expertise on energy matters, and engage more broadly on U.S. global energy priorities. Plans were also made to establish regional hubs in Istanbul, Singapore, Johannesburg, and Rio de Janeiro. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the additional funding and positions in their recommendation. The Senate Appropriations Committee report did not mention the additional $5.4 million and 22 new positions for the Bureau of Energy Resources. The Administration's FY2013 request for the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations included an 86% increase in funding and a restructuring to reduce staffing levels by 64 positions for greater deployment capacity. The Civilian Response Corps model was also modified to fund experts only when deployed. The FY2013 proposal for Conflict and Stabilization Operations included reducing the number of CRC members by 76. The House Appropriations Committee provided authority for the Secretary of State to transfer funds to CSO, while the Senate Appropriations Committee authorized transferring funds from Diplomatic & Consular Program to CSO. The Administration's FY2013 request focused on additional human resources for D&CP. The Administration requested an additional $10 million from the Complex Crisis Fund for human resources in the FY2013 budget. This included $24.9 million to hire 121 new positions at the State Department as part of the \"Diplomacy 3.0\" initiative. Secretary Clinton aimed to increase Foreign Service Officers by 25% by 2014, but with the proposed funding, there would be an 18% growth since 2008, with 82 new FSOs and 39 civil servants hired. The proposed funding would have allowed the State Department to hire 82 new Foreign Service Officers and 39 civil servants. The department postponed its goal of 25% growth in the Foreign Service beyond 2014 due to budget constraints. Additionally, $81.4 million was requested for the final phase of implementing Overseas Comparability Pay for FSOs to address previous pay cuts and recruitment challenges. State officials warn that the issue of Overseas Comparability Pay (OCP) could impact diplomatic readiness by increasing attrition and recruitment challenges. Congress has approved two prior OCP adjustments since 2009, reducing the pay differential by nearly 70%. The FY2013 request aimed to bring the comparability pay level to the Washington, DC, locality pay rate. However, the House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for hiring above attrition in FY2013 and rejected the department's request for an extension of authority for overseas comparability pay. The authorization committee oversees overseas comparability pay, which was not included in the FY2013 proposal. The U.S. opposes Palestinian statehood outside of negotiations with Israel, leading to funding restrictions for UNESCO. The U.S. opposes Palestinian statehood outside of negotiations with Israel, leading to funding restrictions for UNESCO. U.S. contributions to UNESCO have been withheld due to the Palestinians being accepted as full members. The House committee report includes language prohibiting Economic Support Funds assistance to the Palestinian Authority if they gain full membership in the United Nations without a negotiated Israeli-Palestinian agreement. The Senate legislation did not recommend funding for UNESCO within the CIO account, as it is prohibited by law. It also included restrictions on U.S. funding to UNESCO and other U.N. entities granting full membership to the Palestinian Authority. Both proposals allocated less funding than requested for the International Organizations and Programs account. The Foreign Operations budget is a significant part of U.S. foreign assistance programs, with the exception of food assistance. The Foreign Operations budget, managed by USAID and the State Department, includes U.S. contributions to multilateral financial institutions and agencies like the World Bank. It also funds trade promotion activities through the Export-Import Bank and replenishes commitments to international financial institutions. The Foreign Operations budget includes U.S. contributions to international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, emphasizing trade promotion activities. The FY2013 budget request totaled $36.07 billion, with a focus on ongoing foreign assistance initiatives and funding for war-related states like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. There was also a call for a new regional funding account for political transitions in the Middle East and North Africa, with some disagreement in Congress over priorities and policy issues. The congressional foreign aid funding debate focused on funding levels and policy issues such as restrictions on international family planning programs and aid conditions. Recent uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa have raised questions about using foreign assistance for democracy promotion, especially after the fall of governments in Egypt and Libya. The fall of the Mubarak regime in Egypt and the U.S. role in ousting Muammar Gaddafi in Libya have raised policy questions about U.S. involvement in foreign political transitions. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund to support effective engagement in the region. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund to support engagement in the region. $65 million for MEPI, $5 million for OMEP, and $700 million for unallocated funds to incentivize countries towards democracy. Funds could be used for humanitarian relief, peacekeeping, or loan forgiveness. Some Members of Congress raised concerns about the proposed MENA IF, citing worries about giving the Administration too much discretion and limiting Congressional oversight. The House committee bill allocated $175 million in the ESF account and $25 million in the Foreign Military Finance account for \"Middle East Response,\" with $50 million for Jordan and $75 million unallocated. In contrast, the Senate committee report included $1 billion for MENA IF, a 30% increase from the requested amount, and increased MEPI funding to $70 million. The Administration requested $6.8 billion for aid to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan in FY2013, with a significant portion designated as OCO funds. The FY2013 request for Iraq included $1 billion for the Police Development Program, reflecting a transition to State Department authority. The State Department's largest program in Iraq, the Police Development Program (PDP), faced scrutiny in 2012 amid reports of significant reductions. Despite doubts, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad emphasized the program's importance in the U.S.-Iraqi relationship. The House legislation expressed support for the PDP without specific funding for Iraq. The House legislation supported the Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq but did not provide specific funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not allocate funds for the PDP due to Iraqi disinterest and inadequate planning. The Administration requested $2.5 billion for Afghanistan in FY2013, with $1.2 billion designated as OCO, a 7.6% increase from FY2012. The Administration requested $2.5 billion in foreign operations funds for Afghanistan in FY2013, with almost half designated as OCO. This was a 7.6% increase from FY2012, reflecting a surge in infrastructure and economic growth investments. The House legislation did not specify total funding for Afghanistan and required security certification for aid workers. The Senate bill included $1.8 billion for Afghanistan, citing the Afghan government's increasing control over programs. The Administration requested $2.2 billion in foreign operations funds for Pakistan in FY2013, with $800 million designated for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. The request included modest increases in civilian assistance for energy, economic growth, stabilization, education, and health. The House legislation did not specify aid levels for Pakistan but prohibited assistance if Pakistan is uncooperative in anti-terrorism efforts. The Senate bill allocated $842.3 million for Pakistan, including $50 million for the PCCF. The Senate bill allocated $842.3 million in foreign operations funds for Pakistan, including $50 million for the PCCF. It also included new conditions on aid, such as withholding $33 million in FMF until Dr. Shakil Afridi is released from prison. The budget request for the Global Health Initiative was approximately $7.9 billion, a reduction from the previous year. The proposed cut in foreign operations funding was approximately $300 million, the largest reduction requested in dollar terms. This would have ended a decade-long growth trend in global health funding, with decreases in all areas except for a 1.2% increase in international family planning and a 57% increase in funding for the Global Fund. The most significant reductions were for bilateral HIV/AIDS activities, with the Administration claiming that current goals could still be achieved through program efficiencies and reduced drug costs. The House legislation provided slightly more funding than the request, at $8 billion for global health. The House and Senate proposed more funding than requested for global health, with the House providing $8 billion and the Senate proposing $8.5 billion for the Global Health Initiative (GHI). The Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative, aimed at addressing global hunger, requested $1.1 billion in Foreign Operations funds for related programs in FY2013. The FY2013 request included $134 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), managed by the World Bank. The House proposal supported the goals of Feed the Future (FtF) without specifying funding levels, except for $99.8 million for GAFSP. The Senate recommended $1.2 billion for agricultural and food security, including $200 million for GAFSP. The FY2013 request for the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) was $770 million, a 1% increase from FY2012. GCCI funds flow through various appropriations accounts. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) funding for FY2013 was $770 million, an increase from the previous year. Funds for GCCI activities flow through different appropriations accounts and support climate change activities such as adaptation, clean energy technologies, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. A significant portion of the funding goes through World Bank Trust Funds, leveraging contributions from other donor countries and sources. The House and Senate had differing proposals for GCCI in FY2013, with the House not mentioning it and recommending zero funding for certain climate funds. The House legislation for FY2013 did not mention the GCCI and recommended zero funding for the Clean Technology Fund and Strategic Climate Fund, while providing half of the requested funds for the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The Senate committee recommended $111 million for Sustainable Landscapes, a pillar of the GCCI, and showed strong support for multilateral climate change funds by exceeding the Administration's funding requests. The Administration also requested $643 million for family planning and reproductive health activities in FY2013, sparking contentious debates in Congress primarily over policy issues. The FY2013 House legislation proposed codifying the Mexico City policy, which requires foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they won't promote abortion. The Senate bill did not include this provision. The Mexico City Policy, which bans U.S. assistance to organizations supporting coercive family planning, has been a point of contention between administrations. President Obama rescinded it in 2009, but the FY2013 House legislation aimed to codify it. UNFPA has faced grant suspensions due to alleged coercive practices in China, with disagreements on whether they engage in such activities. The George W. Bush Administration suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008, but President Obama resumed funding in 2009. Obama resumed U.S. contributions to UNFPA in 2009, requesting $39 million for FY2013. The proposed House legislation included $461 million for family planning and reproductive health, while the Senate bill included $700 million, with $44.5 million for UNFPA. Both bills included the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Administration proposed dissolving the AEECA account in FY2013, reflecting the end of special focus on former Soviet and Eastern bloc states. Funding for programs under AEECA would be cut by 18% from FY2012. The request included $420.9 million in funding for programs currently funded through AEECA, a cut from FY2012 funding. The House legislation merged AEECA funds with other accounts, while the Senate proposal allowed funds from other accounts to be used for AEECA-eligible countries. Neither proposal provided a minimum funding level for these countries. U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests are key rationales for international affairs activities. During the Cold War, foreign aid and diplomatic programs focused on anti-communism and other U.S. policy interests like economic development, trade promotion, education, health care, human rights, and environmental protection. Post-Cold War, new objectives emerged such as nuclear non-proliferation, drug trafficking prevention, peace efforts in the Middle East, regional stability, religious freedom, and combating human trafficking. The 9/11 attacks led to a shift in focus towards national security in U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs. Following the 9/11 attacks, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs shifted focus towards national security objectives, particularly in efforts to counter terrorism. President Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy established global development as a key component of U.S. national security, alongside defense and diplomacy. Foreign assistance budget justifications began prioritizing the war on terrorism, with a focus on aiding \"front-line\" states. Large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq became prominent in the foreign aid budget. The United States shifted foreign aid focus towards national security after 9/11, emphasizing aid as a tool against terrorism. Efforts included diplomatic security, public diplomacy in Muslim communities, and increased aid for HIV/AIDS globally. The Bush Administration created PEPFAR and MCC for development assistance. The Obama Administration continued these initiatives. The Obama Administration continued Bush's foreign aid initiatives, including the MCC and global health funding. They also completed the first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review in 2010, naming USAID as the leading agency for development assistance. Reforms for the Department of State were implemented as well. The QDDR identified reforms for the Department of State, including establishing the Bureau of Energy and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction. The FY2012 budget proposed changes in funding for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, extending OCO funds to cover temporary costs for State and USAID. Congress adopted the OCO designation and expanded it to include additional accounts and countries, gaining significance in August 2011. The OCO designation, established in the FY2012 State-Foreign Operations appropriations legislation, was expanded to include funding for additional accounts and countries. This designation allows war-related funding to be separate from core international affairs activities within the budget allocation. However, OCO funds are not exempt from automatic across-the-board reductions under the Budget Control Act of 2011. This approach is similar to the use of supplemental international affairs appropriations in the past decade for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other regions. The Obama Administration criticized the practice of using emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations in FY2002-FY2010, arguing that these activities should no longer be considered emergencies. Base funding increased in FY2010, but supplemental funds were still requested for activities in Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. FY2011 was the only year in the last decade where all international affairs funding was part of the base budget before the OCO approach was adopted in FY2012. In FY2011, all international affairs funding was part of the base budget before the OCO approach was adopted in FY2012. For FY2013, $8.24 billion was requested as OCO, 5% less than FY2012, and 26% less than what Congress enacted. The House legislation designated $8.3 billion as OCO, while the Senate bill designated $2.3 billion. The Senate bill allocated $2.3 billion as OCO, 72% less than requested, with no funding for the Iraq Police Development program. State Department-Foreign Operations funding trended upward until 2011, with reductions in FY2011 to meet deficit reduction goals. FY2012 and FY2013 funding levels leveled off due to deficit reduction efforts, below the FY2009 funding level after adjusting for inflation. State Department-Foreign Operations funding trended upward until 2011, with reductions in FY2011 to meet deficit reduction goals. FY2012 and FY2013 funding levels leveled off largely due to congressional efforts to reduce deficit spending, remaining below the FY2009 funding level after adjusting for inflation. Recent years have shown an increase in State Department and related agencies funding, reflecting a focus on increasing human resource capacity at the Department of State. The Foreign Operations budget appropriations have shown a similar trend as the overall State-Foreign Operations budget over the past decade. Foreign aid funding levels off in FY2012 and FY2013, with Israel and Egypt historically receiving the largest amounts of U.S. foreign aid. Assistance to Iraq has declined in recent years after the completion of reconstruction efforts. In FY2013, reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan led to their inclusion in the top five aid recipient countries. Pakistan also moved up the list due to security and economic aid. The top five recipients remained the same as in FY2012, with Israel receiving the most aid at $3,100 million for Foreign Military Financing. Afghanistan ranked second with $2,505 million requested, including OCO funds. Pakistan ranked third at $2,228 million, including funds for PCCF and ESF. Iraq's aid increased, moving up from sixth place in FY2010. In FY2013, aid to Africa would have declined by 10% to $6.4 billion, while aid to the Near East would have increased by 12% to $9.0 billion, mainly due to support for the Arab Spring. Aid to South Central Asia would have increased by 6% to $5.3 billion, with 88% of the aid requested for war-related costs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Near East region request continued to be dominated by assistance to Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. In FY2013, aid to Africa would have declined by 10% to $6.4 billion, while aid to the Near East would have increased by 12% to $9.0 billion, mainly due to support for the Arab Spring. The Near East region request continued to be dominated by assistance to Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. The Western Hemisphere's projected relative decline in FY2013 was attributable to a reduction in funding for Colombia. Europe and Eurasia's 14% decline was largely due to progress made by many countries in the region and other global priorities. Aid to East Asia and Pacific remained relatively low and consistent with past years' levels. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors funded across multiple accounts and agencies. Administrations have started presenting budget requests with a section addressing key interest areas. The Administration's budget requests for FY2013 showed declines in funding for most key interest areas compared to FY2012. Two major initiatives, Food Security and Global Climate Change, also saw reduced funding. Only five out of 23 sectors listed had higher funding requests in FY2013. The FY2013 budget request showed declines in funding for various sectors, including Sustainable Landscapes, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Nutrition, Maternal and Child Health, Higher Education, Clean Energy, and Basic Education. Increased funding was emphasized for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation."
