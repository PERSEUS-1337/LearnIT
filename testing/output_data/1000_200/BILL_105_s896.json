    "content": "The \"Landmine Elimination Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress findings include a Senate vote to impose a moratorium on anti-personnel landmines, retired military officers urging a ban on production and use of landmines, and the impact of landmines in Vietnam. In Vietnam, 7,318 US military personnel were killed and 56,783 injured by landmines. In Bosnia, at least 204 soldiers under UN command and 55 soldiers under NATO command were injured or killed by landmines. The Department of State estimates a person is killed or injured by a landmine every 22 minutes. President Clinton declared pursuing an international ban on landmines in 1996. The Organization of American States declared a goal of a Western Hemisphere landmine free zone in 1996. On June 4, 1997, the Organization of African Unity adopted the goal of establishing Africa as an anti-personnel landmine free zone. On October 5, 1996, Canada announced negotiations for a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines to be completed in Ottawa in December 1997. On December 10, 1996, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution to pursue a treaty banning the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. Formal negotiations on the Ottawa treaty are set to begin. Formal negotiations for the Ottawa treaty to ban anti-personnel landmines are set to begin in Oslo, Norway in September 1997. The United States could use its international influence to secure support for the treaty, which would enhance US security and humanitarian interests by deterring the use of landmines against US Armed Forces and civilians. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON NEW DEPLOYMENTS OF ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINES. Beginning on January 1, 2000, no funds may be used for new deployments of anti-personnel landmines. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report within 180 days outlining alternative proposals for the Korean Peninsula. The President can delay the restriction if annual reports are submitted to Congress. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress annually certifying the necessity of new deployments of anti-personnel landmines on the Korean Peninsula in case of war or emergency. The report should also detail efforts to implement alternative proposals for the Korean Peninsula. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"anti-personnel landmine\" refers to munitions designed to detonate by contact with a person, causing harm. \"New deployments of anti-personnel landmines\" are those placed after January 1, 2000, excluding command-detonated Claymore munitions."
