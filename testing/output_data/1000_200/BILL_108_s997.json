FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the Middle Rio Grande bosque in Albuquerque, New Mexico is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in the Southwest, an old inhabited area, home to 6 pueblos, and a critical habitat for migratory birds. The area adjacent to the bosque provides water to many in New Mexico. It should be maintained to protect endangered species, the river flow, and be more accessible to the public. The Corps of Engineers should prioritize environmental restoration in the Middle Rio Grande bosque to protect endangered species, ensure the healthy growth of native vegetation, and enhance public accessibility. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. The term \"critical restoration project\" refers to a project under this Act that will provide immediate ecosystem restoration benefits. The term \"Middle Rio Grande\" is the portion of the Rio Grande in New Mexico. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Army. The Secretary will implement critical restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande, selecting them based on feasibility studies and utilizing existing studies and plans. Local participation from public and private entities active in ecosystem restoration in the Rio Grande watershed, including those under the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act, will be considered. Entities active in ecosystem restoration in the Rio Grande watershed, including those under the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program and the Bosque Improvement Group of the Middle Rio Grande Bosque Initiative, must enter into a cost-sharing agreement with the Secretary before critical restoration projects. Non-Federal interests are required to contribute 25% of the total project costs and provide necessary land and resources. The critical restoration project includes relocations, dredged material disposal areas, and recreational features. Non-Federal interests must contribute 25% of total project costs and provide land and resources. The Federal Government will cover all operation, maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation costs post-enactment and hold harmless from any claims or damages, except for negligence. The critical restoration project includes recreational features, with non-Federal interests responsible for costs exceeding 30%. Non-Federal contributions may receive credit towards project costs if approved by the Secretary. Non-Federal contributions exceeding 30% of project costs may receive credit if deemed integral by the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2005 through 2013."
