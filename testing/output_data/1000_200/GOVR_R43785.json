Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, with commercial sales starting in 2014. Alaska and Oregon followed suit in 2014. Several states, including Colorado and Washington, have legalized recreational marijuana, with commercial sales starting in 2014. Alaska and Oregon also approved initiatives to legalize, regulate, and tax marijuana for recreational purposes in 2014. The District of Columbia approved measures to legalize the cultivation, possession, and exchange of marijuana. Polls show a majority of Americans support marijuana legalization, leading to increased debate at the federal level. The debate over federal marijuana legalization has intensified due to state policies and public sentiment. Bills in Congress propose removing marijuana from Schedule I drugs, imposing a federal excise tax, and establishing a National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy. The economic aspect of legalizing marijuana, specifically through imposing an excise tax, is a focal point of the debate. This report focuses on the economic debate over federal marijuana legalization, specifically on imposing an excise tax on legalized marijuana. It provides an overview of marijuana production, arguments for taxes, and analyzes possible tax designs. Marijuana is derived from the Cannabis sativa plant and contains THC as the primary psychoactive ingredient. Marijuana contains various cannabinoids besides THC that contribute to its effects, with different strains sought for specific effects like anxiety relief. The potency of marijuana products can vary based on preparation and plant parts, with buds having the highest THC concentration. Female marijuana plants are preferred for their higher cannabinoid content. The buds of marijuana plants have hair-like trichomes coated with resin containing high THC levels. Female plants grown without pollination produce more resin, leading to sinsemilla varieties with 10%-18% THC. Marijuana is commonly smoked in joints or blunts, with a typical joint containing less than half a gram of marijuana. Marijuana can be consumed by smoking joints or blunts, which typically contain less than half a gram of marijuana. Other methods include using glass pipes, vaporizers, or consuming edibles like candy or baked goods infused with THC. Hashish, with over 40% THC content, is made by pressing trichomes together. Excise taxes are generally considered less favorable than other types of taxes. Excise taxes on marijuana are discussed in this section, with reasons including reflecting external costs, discouraging use, preventing price falls, funding programs, and raising revenue. Economic efficiency is achieved when the price equals costs, and if marijuana consumption imposes costs on others, a tax could be imposed to achieve economic efficiency. Similar justifications have been used for alcohol and tobacco. The rationale for imposing excise taxes on marijuana, similar to alcohol and tobacco, is to reflect external costs and achieve economic efficiency. External costs should be separated from costs borne by the user, such as lost years of life and healthcare expenses. Society bears the loss of tax revenue from early deaths and some healthcare costs, but also gains from lower future health costs. Discounting future costs is important, as external costs are typically smaller than total costs. A 1991 study by Manning et al. estimated external costs of alcohol and tobacco using this method. The external costs of alcohol and tobacco were estimated to be $30 billion in a 1991 study. No similar study exists for marijuana, but comparing the costs of cannabis to alcohol shows that cannabis has lower external harm at 19% of alcohol. The external harm of alcohol was ranked at 47, while cannabis was ranked at 9, or 19% of alcohol. Studies suggest that marijuana has lower externalities per user compared to alcohol, with evidence showing it impairs driving ability less and is inversely related to domestic violence. Enforcement costs for marijuana are higher, likely due to its illicit status. The prevalence of marijuana use is smaller compared to alcohol, with external costs ranging from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion. A 2014 report by the White House ONDCP provides estimates on market size, price, and consumption weight of marijuana in the US. The White House ONDCP estimates the unit price, total expenditure, and consumption weight of marijuana in the US using data from NSDUH and ADAM. The report shows a 40% increase in marijuana consumption from 2002 to 2010, with total expenditures ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion in 2010. THC levels in marijuana also rose during this period. The external cost estimates suggest a tax of 0.8% to 5.3% of the current price. The White House's 2014 ONDCP report provides estimates of the price per gram of marijuana from 2000 to 2010, showing a nominal price that remained constant over the period. In 2010, the estimated price per gram was $7.11 ($199.08 per ounce), indicating a likely decrease in inflation-adjusted price over time. Anecdotal prices from anonymous sources and informal interviews, along with data from priceofweed.com, have been used by researchers to estimate marijuana prices across various locations. Newer techniques and data sources, like priceofweed.com, are used to estimate marijuana prices globally. The estimated price is $317 per ounce, but reports suggest prices as low as $224 per ounce in some areas. Another source mentions a price of $238 per ounce. Tax rates vary from 0.8% to 5.3%, but overall, marijuana prices are much higher than production costs. In a legal market, marijuana prices could be lower, with estimates of external costs ranging from $1.60 to $16.80 per ounce. The tax rates range from 0.8% to 5.3% of the price, equivalent to $0.30 per joint at the highest estimate. Comparatively, federal taxes on cigarettes are $0.05 per cigarette, while taxes on alcoholic drinks vary. The federal tax on cigarettes is $0.05 per cigarette, while taxes on alcoholic drinks vary. States also impose taxes on alcohol and tobacco, and they would likely tax marijuana as well. The external costs of marijuana suggest a relatively small tax compared to current prices. Imposing a tax on marijuana could discourage users who underestimate long-term health costs and potential dependence. Some argue for a tax on marijuana to deter users who underestimate long-term health costs and dependence. Studies show a percentage of users become dependent, with medical marijuana laws increasing abuse probability. More research is needed to improve awareness of risks. Economists debate whether user behavior is rational regarding addiction. The behavior of users, particularly adults, is considered suboptimal. Economists debate whether user behavior is rational regarding addiction, with theories suggesting that informed consumers make desirable choices. A tax on marijuana intended to benefit users must consider the potential reduction in income. Research shows that a small percentage of heavy users consume a large portion of marijuana, similar to alcohol consumption patterns. Researchers estimate that heavy users make up 20% of marijuana users but consume 80% of the product. A tax on marijuana, like other excise taxes, would mainly affect heavy users. The impact of the tax on consumption depends on users' response to price changes, measured by elasticities. A low elasticity means a small decrease in quantity consumed for a given price increase. The price elasticity of demand for marijuana is low, meaning that consumer demand is relatively unresponsive to changes in price. Gallet's model predicts elasticities of demand for marijuana ranging between -0.15 and -0.31, indicating that a 1% increase in price leads to a 0.15% to 0.31% decrease in demand. This suggests that users would be harmed overall by a tax on marijuana, even though their consumption may change minimally. Government policies often aim to limit drug use by minors, including marijuana. While state laws prohibit those under 21 from purchasing marijuana, youth may still find ways to obtain it. Studies show that the price elasticity for minors is higher, with estimates ranging from -0.44 to -1.01 for ages 12-17. Taxes may be more effective in reducing youth usage, assuming they do not access marijuana through illegal markets or informal channels. The policy question revolves around determining the appropriate tax burden on non-responsive adult users to limit youth consumption of marijuana. The objective is to set a tax that prevents the price of marijuana from significantly dropping with legalization, especially among minors who are more sensitive to price changes. This tax aims to maintain prices until the effects of a legal market on youth consumption can be evaluated. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced costs of evading law enforcement. Producers currently operate on a smaller scale, leading to higher prices. Workers in the illicit trade of marijuana are compensated more due to law enforcement risks. A legalized market may lead to firms gaining market power and charging higher prices for specific brands. After legalization, the marijuana market could become more competitive, leading to lower prices as firms earn no excess profit. A federal tax rate should be considered to offset price reductions, but not set too high to discourage illicit production. Caulkins (2010) estimates the costs of producing legalized marijuana. Caulkins (2010) estimates the production costs of legalized marijuana, with outdoor production being cheaper but potentially lower in THC content. Processing costs are estimated to add $20 to $35 per pound. Greenhouse production costs are around $215 per pound plus processing costs, while outdoor production costs around $10 per pound plus processing costs. Marijuana production costs vary depending on the method used. Greenhouse production can cost up to $215 per pound plus $35 for processing, while outdoor production costs around $10 per pound plus processing fees. THC concentration also affects pricing, with sinsemilla containing 10%-18% THC. Estimates suggest government-sponsored marijuana in Canada can be produced for as low as 33 cents per gram. Retail market prices are estimated to be around $2.80 per ounce. In jurisdictions where marijuana is quasi-legal, prices are typically lower than street prices but higher than production costs. In jurisdictions where marijuana is quasi-legal, prices tend to be lower than street prices but higher than production costs. In Canada, medical marijuana prices range from $1.80-$5 per gram to the final consumer, with street prices at $10-$15 per gram. The Canadian government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 per gram in April 2014, closer to street prices. Small growers and homegrown marijuana will no longer be permitted under the new law. The Canadian government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 per gram, higher than the current average and closer to street prices. Small growers and homegrown marijuana will no longer be allowed under the new law. Actual prices can be seen on websites like Leafly.com, which provides consumer reviews and menu prices of marijuana products in Colorado shops. The price of marijuana in Colorado ranges from $9 to $15 per gram, $29 to $40 per eighth of an ounce, and $190 to $350 per ounce. Prices on Leafly may include tax, but it is unclear. Prices on priceofweed.com show high quality at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce, lower than national prices. These prices reflect a mix of illicit and legal markets, with taxes likely included in legal purchases. Prices in Colorado show a mix of illicit and legal markets, with taxes likely included in legal purchases. However, prices are not close to the cost of production and may not reflect those in a fully legal market due to the quasi-legal status. Marijuana businesses face challenges with banking assistance and high federal income taxes, imposed without deductions due to the illegal status. In a study on the effects of marijuana legalization in California, researchers estimate a significant decrease in the pretax retail price of marijuana, with projections ranging from $40-$150 per ounce in a fully legal market. However, marijuana businesses still face the threat of federal enforcement, and prices in current markets may not reflect those in a fully legal market due to the quasi-legal status. In a fully legal marijuana market, prices could range from a few dollars to $100 per ounce, but street prices currently range from $200-$300 per ounce. To align legalized prices with street prices, a tax rate of up to $200 per ounce could be feasible. However, setting taxes too high may fuel the illicit market, undermining the goal of eliminating illegal sales and reducing law enforcement costs. The potential benefits of legalizing marijuana include eliminating the illicit market, reducing law enforcement costs, and funding marijuana research. Medical marijuana has been approved by 23 states and the District of Columbia, but research is hindered by federal approval barriers and the classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug. The report discusses the potential benefits of legalizing marijuana, including funding research and studying its efficacy and side effects. Legalization could allow for the study of various issues like externalities, addictive properties, and health effects on users. Revenue from taxes could finance information programs on risks and discourage consumption by minors. Excise taxes on marijuana could be designed to raise revenue and offset healthcare spending. An excise tax on marijuana can generate revenue, but the exact amount is uncertain due to market variables. Legalization may attract new consumers who were previously deterred by legal consequences, potentially increasing revenue. Existing price elasticity estimates may not fully account for this expansion in the market. The potential revenue from nationwide marijuana legalization, influenced by state-level legalization and taxation, could be significant. Analysts use economic models to estimate revenue, considering factors like excise taxes and market dynamics. Analysts estimate that federal excise taxes on marijuana could generate $5.8 billion annually, based on a 50% tax rate on consumer prices. This calculation assumes a $13.13 billion national market for marijuana, a 50% price decrease post-legalization, and a 25% consumption increase. Additionally, $3.3 billion in annual law enforcement savings is projected. Miron and Waldock suggest a tax range of $50-$75 per ounce. Analysts project that federal excise taxes on marijuana could generate around $5.8 billion annually, assuming a 50% tax rate on consumer prices. Miron and Waldock suggest a tax range of $50-$75 per ounce, with estimates based on a $13.13 billion national market for marijuana. The calculation takes into account market size estimates, consumer response, and revenue yield, considering factors like aggregate consumption and interactions with income taxes. Data on price and quantity are crucial for estimating revenues, with market value ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion according to ONDCP. Assuming intermediate values of a $40 billion market and a $250 current price, the potential revenue from a $50 per ounce tax is outlined. The potential revenue from federal excise taxes on marijuana could reach $8 billion annually, assuming a fully legalized industry with a $50 per ounce tax. This calculation considers market size estimates, consumer response, and revenue yield, with a total market value estimated between $30 billion to $60 billion according to ONDCP. The potential revenue from federal excise taxes on marijuana could reach $6.8 billion annually with a projected excise tax collection of $9.1 billion. This calculation considers market size estimates, consumer response, and revenue yield, with a total market value estimated between $30 billion to $60 billion according to ONDCP. The projected revenue gain from federal excise taxes on marijuana is $6.8 billion annually, with a potential short-term yield of less than $300 million due to limited legalization in Colorado and Washington. The revenue could increase if medical marijuana in other states is taxed, but data from the illicit market may not accurately represent a fully commercialized market. Tax collection data from Colorado and Washington could provide early indicators of the national tax base. Tax collection data from Colorado and Washington could serve as early indicators of the potential tax base of a national legalized market. In Colorado, recreational marijuana sales are subject to three different state taxes: a 15% marijuana excise tax, a 10% retail marijuana excise tax, and a 2.9% general sales tax. The approximate effective tax rate on marijuana products is between 15% and 25%. Local taxes can also apply on top of the state taxes. Colorado has collected over $37.0 million in taxes on recreational marijuana from January to September 2014. Based on tax revenue data from Colorado, the national market for marijuana could be estimated to have a sales tax base between $15.9 billion and $17.0 billion per year for recreational marijuana. Medical marijuana data extrapolation is challenging due to incomplete data in some states. The tax collections data from Colorado suggest that medical marijuana consumption could double the consumption base. Combined medical and recreational marijuana sales in Colorado extrapolated to the United States indicate a market of at least $30 billion. However, the Colorado market may be underdeveloped, leading to continued illicit sales. Non-resident sales in Colorado, known as \"pot tourism,\" could also overstate consumption. The issue of exempting medical marijuana and enforcing any exemption is important due to non-resident sales. Design issues for an excise tax include levying it at earlier production stages to reduce costs and tax evasion. Federal excise taxes are typically imposed on manufacturers and imports. Marijuana can be taxed based on unit measurement or product price, each with its own pros and cons. Taxing marijuana can be done based on weight or potency. A weight-based tax is similar to tobacco excise taxes and is easy to administer. However, it could lead to the production of more potent marijuana. On the other hand, a potency-based tax, which is based on THC content per ounce, could be more complex and costly. A potency-based tax on marijuana, determined by THC content per ounce, may be more complex and costly to enforce compared to a weight-based tax. The main challenge lies in ensuring accurate and reliable lab testing of marijuana strains, with costs ranging from $60-$120 per test. Legalization may lead to more labs entering the market, potentially driving down testing prices and promoting the development of more reliable technology. More competition in testing may reduce prices but could lead to unreliable THC measurements. A tax based on THC potency may increase consumption of less-potent marijuana. An alternative could be a tax based on THC to CBD ratio to promote sedative effects. Ad valorem taxes could be levied on the retail price of marijuana. A tax based on THC to CBD ratio could promote sedative effects in marijuana. Ad valorem taxes, like those in Colorado and Washington, are used on wholesalers. H.R. 501 proposes a 50% tax on the producer or importer price. The main disadvantage is the need for regulations to specify taxable prices. A manufacturers tax is simpler to administer as fewer firms are involved in manufacturing. A retail tax regime, resembling a sales tax, could capture price markups due to product type or market power. The price of marijuana products could be determined by various characteristics. Per unit taxes can be indexed for inflation using price change measures. The tax rate for legalized marijuana could be indexed for inflation using measures like the Consumer Price Index. Sunset provisions could be included in the initial tax laws to adjust the tax rate based on evolving market conditions. The tax rate for legalized marijuana could be set low initially to undercut the black market, then gradually increased to limit consumption. Different taxation methods, such as a general tax based on price or weight with surcharges for higher-THC products, could be combined. Differential tax rates could shape consumption to reduce negative social costs, but may lead to unequal tax burdens. Alcohol is taxed based on potency and category, while cigarettes are taxed per unit. The taxation of alcohol is based on potency and category, while cigarettes are taxed per unit. Cigars have an ad valorem tax with a high ceiling. The potential federal marijuana tax raises questions about integrating existing stocks into the tax base, including plants and consumer goods in legalized jurisdictions. This integration could help meet initial demand, simplify tax regulations, and increase federal tax revenue. The potential federal marijuana tax aims to simplify tax regulations, increase federal tax revenue, and help legal producers compete with the underground market. However, existing marijuana plants and products may not comply with new federal regulations. Colorado and Washington have different approaches to integrating existing stocks into the tax base. In Colorado, retail licenses were initially issued to existing medical marijuana dispensaries. In Washington, current plants can be converted to legal stocks with a producer license. Federal excise taxes on untaxed floor stocks aim to prevent inventory buildup before tax effective date. Issues may arise regarding restrictions, exemptions, and special treatment under federal marijuana tax. Policy makers can choose federal regulations or state laws for tax treatment. Differential tax treatments would complicate the tax system. State laws in Colorado and Washington limit recreational marijuana. State laws in Colorado and Washington limit recreational marijuana purchases to individuals aged 21 or older, which could impact the tax base. Excluding younger consumers may lead to underground production or indirect sales. Colorado residents can possess up to one ounce of marijuana under state law. Under state law, Colorado residents can possess up to one ounce of marijuana and make unlimited transactions within that limit. Non-residents are limited to purchasing one quarter of an ounce in a single transaction to reduce risks of diversion. More restrictive purchasing limits and ad valorem tax rates can increase taxes on heavy users. Production limits could be based on market size or per grower, with Washington aiming for 80 metric tons for marijuana products. Washington aims for a maximum market size of 80 metric tons for marijuana products, with half for dried marijuana and half for extract-based products. This policy is to prevent sales diversion and regulate the number of licenses issued. Concerns about underground exports to countries where marijuana is illegal could be addressed with a tax closer to the production chain. Production limits could also prevent larger producers from increasing negative social consequences of marijuana consumption. Production limits for marijuana aim to prevent larger producers from increasing negative social consequences of consumption and generating windfall profits. The tax treatment of medical marijuana varies by jurisdiction, with Colorado applying a 2.9% general sales tax but exempting it from retail marijuana taxes. Medical marijuana is exempt from state sales tax and retail marijuana taxes. There is a debate over the medical need for marijuana, with evidence showing a decrease in prescription drug overdoses in states with medical marijuana. Exempting medical marijuana from federal tax could limit the tax base if not regulated properly. Exempting medical marijuana from federal tax could limit the tax base if not regulated properly. Rules vary for products subject to excise taxation, with different regulations in states like Colorado and Washington. Home production of marijuana is allowed in some states, unlike home distilling of alcohol in federal law. Home production of marijuana is allowed in some states, with debates on quantity limits and taxation exemptions. Pat Oglesby suggests a high limit due to plant yield, but others argue it could undermine enforcement efforts. Caulkins et al. suggest that banning home production of marijuana could undermine enforcement efforts and increase tax revenue. Small producers could be eligible for lower tax rates, similar to the exemptions for wine and beer producers. However, a lower tax for small producers may not be efficient as it could encourage evasion and go against the objective of collecting taxes from larger producers. A small businesses exemption for marijuana production could lead to larger evasion opportunities. Lower taxes for outdoor cultivation may reduce costs, but concerns about environmental impact exist. Incentives for higher-potency marijuana could favor indoor production. Another option is a special occupational tax on businesses involved in marijuana production, distribution, or sales. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 (H.R. 501) proposes an occupational tax on marijuana businesses, with a $1,000 annual tax for producers, importers, or manufacturers, and a $500 annual tax for others in the industry. Enforcement and administrative efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana. The illicit trade of bootleg spirits in the US continued after Prohibition until tariff cuts on imports and increased enforcement. Today, enforcing marijuana laws would require deterring consumers from illegal transactions and compelling producers to pay taxes. Legalizing marijuana without adequate tax enforcement resources could undermine the federal tax base. Legalizing and taxing marijuana could undermine the federal tax base due to increased smuggling. Tax collection closer to production could reduce the number of taxable entities. Tax stamps or seals on packages could be used to monitor tax payment. Colorado has implemented a system to track marijuana plants from seed to sale using RFID tags. Marijuana enterprises must report their inventory through a linked-computer system called Marijuana Inventory Tracking Solutions (MITS). Other methods discussed include genetic markers and dye for tracking production. The Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division uses a linked-computer system called Marijuana Inventory Tracking Solutions (MITS) to complement traditional enforcement methods. Standardizing weights and potency measurements would be necessary for a marijuana tax regime to ensure consumer safety and accurate dosing. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could establish marketing standards for labeling and branding different strains of marijuana to inform consumers and prevent competition from products that do not meet the same standards. Regulations could define labeling for \"indica,\" \"sativa,\" and hybrid strands. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp during the omnibus farm bill debate, allowing certain research institutions to study it. The Agricultural Act of 2014 allows research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow industrial hemp if permitted by state laws. Hemp could be legalized for industrial production if marijuana is legalized, with THC content used to distinguish between the two. Europe and Canada require less than 0.3% THC for legal hemp. Some argue that marijuana can be hidden in hemp fields due to the low THC content required for legal hemp. However, cross-pollination would weaken marijuana plants. The federal legalization of marijuana could impact state tax policies. States with marijuana legalization laws could use a system of licensing private businesses to grow and sell marijuana instead of state-based monopolies. Proponents see monopolies as a way to regulate consumption, while opponents view them as prone to corruption and driven by revenue motives. The dominance of licensing systems may make it challenging for lawmakers to switch to state monopolies in the future. The dominance of licensing systems in states may hinder lawmakers from rolling back these systems and could lead to state monopolies in the future. Uncertainties surrounding legalized marijuana, such as pricing, market size, consumer response, and health effects, make it challenging to project tax revenues accurately. These uncertainties also complicate decisions on tax levels and structures, including considerations of potency, pricing, and compliance costs. The tax base for legalized marijuana sales is limited compared to alcohol or tobacco in the short term, especially if medical marijuana sales are exempt from federal taxation. The relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption is a key factor in determining the social costs of marijuana legalization. Researchers have not reached a consensus on the relationship between marijuana consumption and alcohol consumption. Economic studies may not capture long-term effects or examine representative populations due to regulation of marijuana research in the United States. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States does not fund research on the potential medical benefits of marijuana. There is uncertainty about the impact of marijuana legalization on society, especially in relation to alcohol consumption. No other jurisdiction has implemented policies like Colorado or Washington, making it difficult to assess the effects on a large scale. The social costs of marijuana legalization could vary based on polydrug use, with some claiming it is a \"gateway drug\" to other illicit substances. Research on driving under the influence is also a concern. Research on the effects of marijuana use on traffic fatalities is limited by methodological shortcomings. Marijuana is the most frequently detected substance in drivers involved in crashes, but a causal link to traffic fatalities is not established. Studies have limitations in detecting marijuana intoxication levels in drivers involved in crashes. Current technology can detect cannabinol in the blood up to a week after use, making it challenging to differentiate recent users from chronic medical marijuana patients. This hinders the ability to accurately measure drug impairment in DUI cases. Some studies have limitations in detecting marijuana intoxication levels in drivers involved in crashes, as current technology can detect cannabinol in the blood up to a week after use. This makes it challenging to differentiate recent users from chronic medical marijuana patients, hindering the ability to accurately measure drug impairment in DUI cases. Some claim that marijuana legalization could lead to savings in criminal justice spending, with estimates varying in size. For example, Jeffrey Miron estimated in 2005 that legalizing marijuana would save $7.7 billion per year in enforcement costs, while Sevigny and Caulkins estimated that 8% of state and federal prison inmates serving sentences for drug violations were marijuana-only offenders. Federal legalization of marijuana would likely not affect federal inmates already serving sentences for marijuana-related charges. It is unclear how federal legalization of marijuana might impact the future federal prison population. In state and local jails, drug violations account for about one-fifth of incarcerations and marijuana-only violations account for less than 10% of those charges. Legalizing marijuana could lead to 2% fewer prisoners. Legalizing marijuana could lead to a 2% reduction in prisoners in jails over time. The majority of costs associated with the black market for illicit drugs are related to illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana. The majority of costs associated with the black market for illicit drugs are related to illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana. Marijuana exchanges often occur indoors among friends and family, reducing conflict risk. Marijuana producers and retailers cannot deduct selling expenses for federal tax filings due to IRC Section 280E. The IRS enforces a provision that prohibits businesses involved in trafficking controlled substances, like marijuana, from claiming tax deductions. This results in a significant tax burden on marijuana-related businesses, leading some to challenge the IRS in court. For example, Canna Care marijuana dispensary is contesting over $800,000 in tax penalties in a case before the U.S. tax court in San Francisco, CA. The Sacramento-based Canna Care marijuana dispensary is challenging IRS tax penalties of over $800,000 in a case before the U.S. tax court in San Francisco, CA. The IRS refused $2.6 million in business deductions for employee salaries, rent, and other costs over three years. The discrepancies in tax treatments create economic incentives for underground activities, and marijuana businesses face implicit taxes up to 39.6% or 35% of their expenses. The status quo administration of federal tax laws creates an economic advantage for illicit marijuana sellers, who are not subject to direct taxation of their sales. The Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 would exempt businesses conducting marijuana sales in compliance with state law from certain tax prohibitions. Data from Colorado and Washington can be used to estimate a national marijuana tax base. For estimating the national marijuana tax base, data from Colorado and Washington can be used, although they may underrepresent total demand due to pending licenses. The most recent tax revenue data from Colorado is used to calculate the state's marijuana tax base, utilizing tax collections from retail marijuana sales tax and general sales tax. The two calculations are averaged to determine an estimate. The Colorado Department of Revenue reported that the 10% retail marijuana sales tax collected $2.9 million and the 2.9% sales tax collected $886,915 in September 2014. Averaging these two numbers leads to an estimate of $30.0 million in recreational marijuana sales in the state of Colorado. This data can be used to estimate the national sales tax base for each state and the District of Columbia. The national sales tax base for recreational marijuana can be estimated by multiplying the recreational sales tax base from Colorado by each state's population and marijuana usage rates. This calculation assumes variations in consumption are based on population and usage rates, without considering major price changes or state tax rates. Using data from Colorado in August 2014, the estimated national sales tax base for recreational marijuana is $14.5 billion to $15.4 billion per year. Based on data from Colorado, the national sales tax base for recreational marijuana is estimated to be $14.5 billion to $15.4 billion per year, subject to revision. Medical marijuana sales in Colorado were $31.3 million in September 2014, with monthly sales ranging between $31 million and $35 million from January to September 2014. Before the legalization of recreational marijuana in FY2013, state sales tax collections implied an annual medical marijuana tax base of $314.2 million. The Colorado Department of Revenue's tax collections data suggest an annual medical marijuana tax base of $314.2 million in sales. It is uncertain if the opening of the recreational marijuana market has impacted the demand for medical marijuana in Colorado. Medical marijuana consumption in Colorado could potentially exceed total marijuana consumption amounts. There may be a self-selection bias in medical marijuana patient data, as some individuals may have relocated to states allowing medical marijuana if they had limited options for treatment."
