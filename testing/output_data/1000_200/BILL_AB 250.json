Non-compliance is considered unprofessional conduct. This section does not change a provider's scope of practice or allow unauthorized healthcare delivery. (f) Laws on health information confidentiality and patient rights apply to telehealth. (g) Excludes patients under Department of Corrections jurisdiction.
