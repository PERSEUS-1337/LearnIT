However, they do not have complete control over their music, as cover versions can be made under certain conditions. For example, Taylor Swift withdrew her music from Spotify, but a cover version by Ryan Adams was still available on the platform. Copyright law allows for this as long as royalties are paid. As a singer who owns the rights to her sound recordings, Taylor Swift can withdraw her music from Spotify, but as a songwriter, she cannot control how the music service uses other versions of her songs. The payment she receives for her music depends on market forces, contracts, and copyright laws. Congress updated some copyright laws in the 1990s to adapt to the internet music distribution. The evolution of music distribution on the internet led Congress to update copyright laws in the 1990s to address unauthorized use of copyrighted content. Different laws were applied to digital services resembling radio broadcasts and physical media. However, music consumption has continued to evolve with the rise of streaming services, blurring traditional lines of exploitation. The evolution of music distribution on the internet led to changes in copyright laws in the 1990s. Streaming services have blurred traditional lines of exploitation. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of Napster. Apple's iTunes Music Store launched in 2003, marking a shift towards legal online music purchases. By 2012, digital downloads surpassed physical media sales. Apple dominated with a 65% market share. However, digital download sales declined after 2012 with the rise of streaming services like Spotify. After dominating digital music downloads with a 65% market share, Apple faced declining sales as streaming services like Spotify gained popularity. To combat this, Apple launched its own streaming service, Apple Music, in 2015. The shift to subscription music services has significantly changed music consumption habits, with streaming services accounting for 67% of total U.S. recording industry retail spending in 2017. Consumer spending on music remained flat between 2014 and 2015, then grew by 10% between 2015 and 2016. Consumer spending on music in the U.S. remained flat between 2014 and 2015, then grew by 10% between 2015 and 2016, and 14% between 2016 and 2017. Despite this growth, annual spending on music is still nearly two-thirds below its 1999 peak. These changing consumption patterns impact how performers, songwriters, record companies, and music publishers are compensated for their work.Creators of musical works and artists typically license their rights to third parties, who may then exercise those rights on their behalf. Owners of musical works and certain sound recordings have exclusive rights under copyright law, including the right to reproduce the work. The Copyright Act grants owners of sound recordings exclusive rights, including reproduction and distribution rights known as \"mechanical rights.\" This dates back to the 1909 Copyright Act when music publishers issued mechanical licenses for reproducing musical compositions. The term \"mechanical rights\" refers to royalties from music reproduction, including various formats like vinyl records, CDs, and digital copies. Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies to those fixed after February 15, 1972. Owners of musical works and sound recordings have the right to publicly perform their works. The right to publicly perform sound recordings applies to digital audio transmissions only, such as webcasting and music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify. This right is granted to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, and consumers purchase the rights to listen to music in a private setting. Record labels pay music publishers for the right to record sound recordings. Consumers purchase rights to listen to songs privately, while record labels pay music publishers for the right to distribute music in physical formats. Retail outlets pay distribution subsidiaries of record labels. Radio listeners have less control over song playback. Broadcast radio stations do not pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists but do pay royalties to music publishers and songwriters. Congress exempted broadcast radio stations from paying public performance royalties to record labels and artists in 1995. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights, including making temporary copies of songs known as \"ephemeral recordings.\" Interactive music streaming services allow users to listen to songs on demand, similar to playing a CD. Interactive music streaming services allow users to listen to songs on demand by downloading digital files to their devices. These \"conditional downloads\" require users to remain subscribers to the service. Royalties are paid to music publishers/songwriters and record labels/artists for the right to reproduce and distribute musical works and sound recordings. The music industry involves songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees. The music industry involves various categories of interests including songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees. Songwriters work with music publishers to promote songs, license intellectual property, and collect royalties. Publishers may pay advances to songwriters in exchange for a portion of the copyright in their compositions. Their role includes monitoring, promoting, and generating revenue. Songwriters work with music publishers who assign a portion of the copyright in their compositions. Publishers monitor, promote, and generate revenue from music use, including mechanical licensing rights. They may contract with performing rights organizations to collect payments for public performances. Royalty income is shared between songwriters, publishers, subpublishers, and coauthors, with a standard 50-50 division between the publisher and songwriter. Multiple songwriters with their own publishers can complicate income division. Music publishers are divided into four categories: Major Publishers (Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, Warner Music Group), Major Affiliates, Independent Publishers, and Writer-Publishers. Independent publishers manage their own music catalogs and are not affiliated with major publishers. Some songwriters control their own publishing rights. Some songwriters control their own publishing rights and may hire individuals to administer their royalties. Record labels are responsible for finding talent, recording music, and promoting artists. Major labels distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings through large networks, but their distribution role is evolving. The distribution role of record labels is changing as physical recordings decline. Labels now focus on selling digital copies, adding data for royalties, negotiating with streaming services, and monitoring sales. Recording artists may contract with labels or distribute their own recordings, with contracts typically requiring artists to transfer copyrights to labels. Recording contracts require artists to transfer copyrights to record labels for defined periods and regions. In return, artists receive royalties. Record companies finance recordings, advance funds, and guide careers. Major stars may negotiate full ownership of future sound recordings. The three major labels are Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group, earning 65% of U.S. revenue. Each label shares a parent company with major music publishers. The music industry is dominated by major record labels like Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group. Artists often sign recording contracts with these labels, transferring copyrights in exchange for royalties. However, some artists like Chance the Rapper retain their copyrights and distribute music independently, earning money through touring and merchandise sales. Independent record labels, like Big Machine Records, may have distribution agreements with major labels for wider reach. Chance the Rapper gives away his music for free and earns from touring and merchandise. Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive rights to his album, Coloring Book. Record producers bring creative music into tangible form. Artists now work with multiple producers on albums, controlling the terms themselves. It is common for recording artists to work with multiple producers on a single album, with the artists controlling the terms of the producer's compensation. Producers may demand royalties if they have negotiating leverage. Sound engineers run recording sessions under the producer's oversight, while mixers piece together polished finished products. Mixers usually receive one-time payments per track, but those in high demand may negotiate for a portion of the artist's royalties. The 1909 Copyright Act recognized the exclusive right of copyright owners to make mechanical reproductions of music. The 1909 Copyright Act allowed for mechanical reproductions of music, including the distribution of copies for private use. Concerns were raised about a potential monopoly by the Aeolian Company in buying exclusive rights from music publishers. In response to concerns about a potential monopoly by Aeolian Company, Congress established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law. This allowed music publishers/songwriters to withhold reproduction rights but required them to allow others to use their work for a specified royalty once it was distributed to the public. For example, in 2015, Ryan Adams covered Taylor Swift's album 1989 without seeking permission, instead paying a government-set rate for a compulsory mechanical license. The 1909 Copyright Act set the royalty rate at $0.02 per \"part manufactured,\" which remained unchanged for nearly 70 years. The Copyright Act of 1976 revised the mechanical license, specifying rates payable for each record made and distributed, rather than per record manufactured. Congress defined \"phonorecord\" for audio-only recordings and has since amended the law multiple times, changing the rate-setting process. The 1976 Copyright Act established procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses for music recordings. Licensees must serve a notice of intention to license the music on the copyright owner or the Copyright Office if the owner's address is unknown. If unable to locate owners, licensees set aside money owed until owners are found. The Act also made it easier for copyright owners to sue for non-compliance with licensing requirements. The 1976 Copyright Act simplified procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses for music recordings. It removed limitations on liability for potential licensees and required a notice of intention to license. Failure to provide the notice makes a licensee ineligible for a compulsory license. Copyright holders no longer need to file a \"notice of use\" to recover against unauthorized record manufacturers. Failure to identify themselves to the Copyright Office only affects receiving royalties under a compulsory license. This may result in no public record of the copyright owner's distribution of copyrighted works. The Copyright Act of 1976 simplified procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses for music recordings, requiring a notice of intention to license. This led to controversy between rights holders and licensees regarding NOIs and the Copyright Office's database of musical works. Adjusting the statutory mechanical royalty rate periodically was suggested in 1967, with complexity in administering compulsory licenses noted in 1975. In 1976, a separate royalty tribunal was established by Congress to simplify administering compulsory licenses and set royalty rates for mechanical licenses. The tribunal considers four policy objectives when determining rates, including maximizing public access to works, ensuring fair returns for copyright owners and users, reflecting contributions to making products available, and minimizing any barriers. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established in 2004 to set licensing rates every five years, acting as a ceiling for what copyright owners may charge. In 1995, the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) was passed, introducing new provisions. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) of 1995 amended 17 U.S.C. Section 115 to cover the reproduction and distribution of musical works by digital transmission. Congress directed that rates and terms for digital phonorecord deliveries should distinguish between incidental and general deliveries, sparking a debate on what constitutes an \"incidental DPD.\" The Copyright Office proposed new rules in July 2008 to address this issue. In July 2008, the Copyright Office proposed new rules regarding the music industry's survival in the 21st Century. After years of hearings and litigation, a landmark agreement was reached in September 2008 on the applicability of mechanical licenses to music streaming, ensuring music publishers receive royalties from streaming services. In 2008, a landmark agreement was reached regarding mechanical licenses for music streaming, ensuring royalties for music publishers. The agreement set royalty rates and standards for various music streaming services, covering the period from 2013 to 2017. In 2018, the CRB issued new mechanical royalty rates and terms for the 2018-2022 period. The CRB issued new mechanical royalty rates and terms for the 2018-2022 period, including flat rates for physical phonorecord deliveries and permanent digital downloads, and formulas for interactive streaming rates based on music service revenues. Minimum per-subscriber payments are also set for interactive music services. The CRB issued new mechanical royalty rates and terms for the 2018-2022 period, including flat rates for physical phonorecord deliveries and permanent digital downloads, and formulas for interactive streaming rates based on music service revenues. Minimum per-subscriber payments are also set for interactive music services, with zero rates during free trial periods. Public performance royalties are either overseen by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York or determined through marketplace negotiations between publishers and licensees. Songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works in 1897, requiring establishments to obtain permission to perform musical works. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) was formed in 1914 to address the logistical issue of licensing and collecting payment for public performances. ASCAP is a performance rights organization that issues public performance licenses on behalf of songwriters and publishers, allowing licensees to perform musical works for a flat fee. In 1930, SESAC was founded as a competing PRO to help European publishers and writers collect royalties from U.S. licensees. ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters in 1932, establishing rates based on a percentage of total revenues. In 1932, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters based on a percentage of advertising revenues. Broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to strengthen their bargaining power against ASCAP and attract new composers. ASCAP and BMI initially had exclusive rights to negotiate for their members and offered blanket licenses covering all songs in their catalogs. The dispute between radio stations and ASCAP/BMI over royalty rates led to a DOJ investigation for antitrust violations. Both ASCAP and BMI entered consent decrees in 1941 to avoid lawsuits. The decrees had similar features, including restrictions on acquiring music rights. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, established in 1941 to avoid antitrust lawsuits, share key features such as nonexclusive licensing rights, non-discriminatory licensing terms, and acceptance of new members meeting certain standards. They also offer alternative licenses and allow for determination of reasonable license fees by federal district court judges in the Southern District of New York. Unlike mechanical rights, public performance rights are not subject to compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. The public performance of musical works is not bound by compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. Rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are overseen by federal district court judges, while rates charged by SESAC and GMR are based on marketplace negotiations. The judges must ensure that the rates are \"reasonable\" and consider the disproportionate power ASCAP and BMI have in the music rights market. Judges are prohibited from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels and artists when setting public performance rates. The provision prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels and artists when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. This provision was created in 1995 with the passage of the DPRA to address concerns about the impact on music performance royalties. The DOJ periodically reviews the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, last amended in 2001 and 1994 respectively. In 2016, the DOJ completed a review, and in 2017, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to the interpretation of the decrees. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was enacted to address unauthorized duplications of sound recordings, with the House Judiciary Committee recommending amendments to federal copyright laws. The 1971 Sound Recording Act aimed to combat unauthorized duplications of sound recordings by amending federal copyright laws. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that California's record piracy law applied to pre-1972 sound recordings. States also passed their own antipiracy laws, leading to recommendations to exclude pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve existing antipiracy measures. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws that provided rights equivalent to copyright, but exempted pre-1972 works from federal protection. States may protect pre-1972 sound recordings until 2067, after which federal law will preempt state protection and these recordings may enter the public domain. Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act in 1998 to authorize ephemeral server reproductions of sound recordings by noninteractive digital services. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for temporary reproductions of sound recordings. The rates and terms of this license are set by the CRB, and through SoundExchange, copyright owners receive Section 112 fees. Before the 1990s, record labels and artists did not have public performance rights for their sound recordings, relying on retail sales for income. With the rise of the internet in the early 1990s, the recording industry faced challenges with music piracy. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998 were introduced to address this issue. The DPRA granted record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, limited to certain digital audio services. It also created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for specific subscription services. The DPRA in 1995 granted record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings on certain digital audio services. It also created a compulsory license for specific subscription services, leading to debates between music publishers, writers, and record labels regarding public performance royalties for sound recordings. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions for noninteractive online music services and established rate-setting standards for the CRB. Services existing before July 31, 1998, are subject to one standard, while webcasters and newer music streaming services have different rates and terms. Music streaming services that entered the marketplace after July 31, 1998, are subject to rate-setting standards that aim to represent negotiated rates between buyers and sellers. The Section 801(b)(1) standard includes minimizing disruptive impacts on industry structure and practices. The purpose of applying this standard to services existing before July 31, 1998, is to prevent disruption of their operations. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) allowed owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance rights at marketplace-determined rates. Interactive services enable individuals to arrange for specific recording transmissions and were seen as a potential threat to traditional record sales by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 acknowledged the impact of interactive music streaming services on traditional record sales. They emphasized the importance of broadcast radio in promoting sound recordings and the mutual beneficial relationship between the radio industry and the music industry. Congress does not require radio stations to obtain public performance licenses for sound recordings, as they play a significant role in promoting music. The Senate Judiciary Committee distinguishes broadcast radio from other services, stating that it provides entertainment, non-entertainment programming, and public interest activities to local communities. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Negotiations can occur within a three-month period, followed by written statements, discovery, and further attempts at reaching a settlement. Participants may reach agreements at any point during the rate-setting proceeding. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Participants may reach agreements at any point during the rate-setting proceeding, submitting proposed rates for comment. If no agreement is reached, live testimony is heard, and a determination is issued, which can be challenged through a rehearing or appeal. The CRB may grant or deny a rehearing, and participants can appeal CRB determinations to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. RIAA established SoundExchange in 2000 as a common agent for record labels to receive royalties, later spinning it off as an independent entity in 2003. SoundExchange deducts costs before distributing royalty payments. The CRB sets \"per-performance\" rates for online music services and percentage-of-revenue rates for preexisting subscription services and satellite digital audio services. The CRB sets royalty rates for public performances of sound recordings by various music services. Congress has passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes instead of CRB-set rates. Recent agreements expired in 2015, and the CRB began setting royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020. In 2015, the CRB started setting royalty rates for noninteractive music streaming services for 2016-2020. Questions arose about the interpretation of a provision barring consideration of agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts. Pandora Media, Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia), and SoundExchange disagreed on whether direct agreements based on the Pureplay settlement could be used as evidence in the CRB rate proceeding. SoundExchange argued for exclusion, while Pandora Media and Clear Channel disagreed. The CRB referred novel material questions of substantive law to the Register of Copyrights for resolution regarding the interpretation of agreements negotiated under the Webcaster Settlement Acts. The Register ruled that the CRB may consider directly negotiated licenses reflecting provisions in a Webcaster Settlement Act agreement. In December 2015, the CRB issued its decision on rates for the 2016-2020 period, requiring streaming services to pay $0.17 per 100 streams on nonsubscription services. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) set rates for streaming services for the 2016-2020 period, tying annual rate increases to the Consumer Price Index. Ephemeral royalties fees were set at 5% of total Section 114 royalties. In December 2017, the CRB issued rate decisions for digital subscription services and satellite radio for the 2018-2022 period. Public performance rates vary based on the type of music service and rate-setting standard used by the CRB. The Copyright Act specifies how royalties collected under Section 114 are distributed: 50% to the copyright owner, 45% to the featured artist, and 2.5% each to agents representing nonfeatured musicians and vocalists. Record producers are not included in the statutory split of royalties for public performances, but can be compensated if the artist directs a portion of their royalties to the producer via SoundExchange. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services has been a matter of debate in defining the process for setting rates for public performance rights. 17 U.S.C. Section 114 specifies that an interactive service allows the public to receive specially created programs or specific sound recordings upon request. This is relevant to how producers can be compensated for their work, such as directing a portion of royalties to them via SoundExchange. The CRB does not distinguish between interactive and noninteractive services for obtaining mechanical rights from music publishers. In a 2009 case, a music streaming service using user feedback was deemed noninteractive by the Second Circuit Court. This distinction aims to protect sound recording copyright holders from sales cannibalization. The court's decision on protecting copyright holders from cannibalization of record sales focused on the predictability of music selection in interactive services like LAUNCHcast, owned by Launch Media, Inc. The unique playlists created by the service were deemed insufficient to guarantee predictability, leading to concerns about potential impact on music sales. The court determined that LAUNCHcast was a noninteractive service, eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. Noninteractive services must limit features like announcing specific songs in advance and adhere to the sound recording performance complement. The Launch Media decision allowed personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio to obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. Personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio can obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. The rates established by the CRB do not differentiate between these services and others that transmit radio-style programming. In contrast, Spotify offers on-demand access to specific albums, songs, and artists. Users can access songs for free with ads on personal computers or pay a monthly fee for ad-free listening on multiple devices and offline music playback. Congress provided antitrust exemptions to statutory licensees and copyright owners of sound recordings in 1995. In 1995, Congress provided antitrust exemptions to statutory licensees and copyright owners of sound recordings to negotiate collectively with SiriusXM and subscription services over royalty rates for public performance rights. The exemption is only available if common agents designated are nonexclusive, preventing copyright owners from demanding supracompetitive rates. The DPRA does not create an antitrust exemption for negotiating rates for interactive services. The DPRA does not create an antitrust exemption for negotiating rates for interactive services. However, copyright owners and entities can use common agents for a clearinghouse function, not rate-setting. Section 112 of the DMCA addresses ephemeral server reproductions, providing an antitrust exemption for designated common agents to negotiate royalty payments. Section 112(e)(2) does not specify exclusivity for the designation. The CRB was created in 2004. The report states that Congress created the CRB in 2004 with provisions regarding licensee payments. It marked the first time a government entity could designate an entity to receive royalties. This provision ensures parties subject to statutory licensing continue to make payments. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" in 2006, allowing parties to continue making payments while appealing royalty decisions. Royalty Logic, a subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange. Royalty Logic requested recognition as a \"designated agent\" by the CRB to compete with SoundExchange in royalty distribution. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are already designated agents, and Royalty Logic's involvement was not necessary. The CRB also stated that competition between multiple collectives may not be beneficial in statutory licensing situations. The CRB found that selecting a single collective for royalty collection under statutory licenses is the most efficient system. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld this decision in 2009, rejecting arguments that the CRB couldn't designate a single entity for payments. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole entity to receive royalty payments for the statutory license, fulfilling Congress's expectation for a single collective. SoundExchange was the only party requesting to be a collective for the period 2011-2014. The CRB designated SoundExchange as the sole collective for collecting royalties under statutory licenses, citing economic and administrative efficiency. SoundExchange reached agreements with radio stations in 2015, approved by the CRB for the rate period 2016-2020. No objections were raised to SoundExchange's continued role as the sole collective. SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for managing sound recording royalties from 2016-2020. Congress created an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees to designate common agents for negotiating mechanical licenses. Music publishers collect royalties through third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency. The Harry Fox Agency, a major administrator, distributes mechanical royalties to publishers who then pay songwriters. SESAC acquired the agency in 2015. Music publishers can also issue mechanical licenses themselves. Competition among agents for licensing musical works was raised in 2006. In 2006, Royalty Logic, Inc. raised concerns about competition among agents for licensing musical works and collecting mechanical royalties. Noncash considerations, like equity stakes in Spotify, can influence the prices paid by interactive services for music access. Sony sold part of its Spotify stake in 2018 and pledged to share proceeds with artists and independent parties. Sony sold a portion of its Spotify stake in 2018 and pledged to share proceeds with artists and independent labels. Music publishers can participate in deals negotiated for mechanical royalties based on rates paid to record labels for performance rights. Copyright law prohibits tying rates for public performances of musical works to rates for sound recordings. Copyright law prohibits tying rates for public performances of musical works to rates for sound recordings. ASCAP and BMI represent about 90% of songs available for licensing in the United States, while SESAC and Global Music Rights handle performance rights licensing for a smaller share of songs. Publishers have raised concerns about fair payment sharing from digital music services. Music publishers have alleged they have not received a fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services due to ASCAP and BMI consent decrees. Publishers pressured ASCAP and BMI to allow them to negotiate directly with digital services for market rates. ASCAP and BMI amended their rules in 2011 and 2013 to permit music publishers to license their public performance rights for new media uses, enabling them to negotiate with digital streaming services at market prices. The major music publishers and PROs challenged the partial withdrawal of rights by Pandora Media, Inc. in court, leading to rulings that publishers must either have their song catalog \"all in\" or \"all out\" of the PRO. Following the rulings, publishers and PROs requested modifications to the consent decrees to allow partial grants of rights, expedited arbitration for rate-setting, and flexibility for ASCAP and BMI to provide services. ASCAP and BMI requested changes to consent decrees for partial rights grants, expedited arbitration, and bundled licenses. DOJ reviewed \"100% licensing\" vs. \"fractional licensing\" in 2015. DOJ determined in 2016 that consent decrees required 100% licensing, allowing any rights holder to issue a performance license without others' consent. The DOJ completed its review in 2016, requiring PROs to issue 100% licenses for all songs in their catalogs to promote competition. DOJ did not propose modifications to the consent decrees but suggested Congress reconsider copyright law in the music industry. BMI filed a lawsuit challenging this interpretation, leading to a ruling in 2017 permitting fractional licensing. In September 2017, Judge Stanton ruled that BMI's consent decree allows fractional licensing, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in December 2017. Licensees must serve a Notice of Intention (NOI) to the copyright holder before distributing phonorecords and pay royalties. The Copyright Office introduced new procedures in April 2016 for bulk electronic filing of NOIs, reducing filing costs significantly. The Copyright Office introduced new procedures in April 2016 for bulk electronic filing of NOIs, reducing filing costs significantly from $2 per song to $0.10 per song. Licensees like Spotify, Amazon, and Google began filing NOIs in bulk one week after the change. They affirmed that they searched Copyright Office records and found no copyright owner information for the songs. This move was supported by digital music service companies to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. Several digital music service companies contacted the U.S. Copyright Office in late 2015 to advocate for digitizing the compulsory licensing process to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. In April 2018, the House of Representatives unanimously passed the Music Modernization Act, which includes creating a new nonprofit \"mechanical licensing collective\" funded by online music services to offer broad blanket mechanical licenses. This bill aims to streamline the process of suing for infringement of mechanical licenses. The Music Modernization Act aims to streamline the process of obtaining mechanical licenses for online music services and change the standards for setting royalty rates. It also extends federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972 and creates procedures for royalty payments to producers and engineers. Online music services could pay for a broad blanket mechanical license under this bill. The Music Modernization Act aims to simplify obtaining mechanical licenses for online music services by establishing a new nonprofit entity called the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC). The MLC would be funded by online music services through assessments set by the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) and would have various duties including maintaining a musical works database. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) established by the CRB would review assessment rates every five years. The MLC's duties include maintaining a musical works database, administering blanket licenses, identifying musical works, locating copyright owners, and collecting/distributing royalties from online music services to rights holders. Songwriters would receive at least 50% of royalties for unmatched works. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) would collect and distribute royalties from online music services to rights holders. Songwriters would receive at least 50% of all royalties for unmatched works. The MLC would not negotiate royalty rates or terms, grant licenses for public performances, or engage in government lobbying activities. Authorized duties of the digital licensing coordinator include establishing governance structure, membership criteria, and dues, enforcing notice and payment obligations, and participating in proceedings to establish assessment rates. The digital licensing collective, part of the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC), would handle administrative tasks such as establishing assessment rates and maintaining records. It would be prohibited from government lobbying activities. Failure to provide reports or royalties could lead to default of the blanket license. Disputes could be reviewed in federal court if the collective improperly terminated a license. Copyright owners would be unable to sue online music services with valid blanket licenses for infringement. The Music Modernization Act prohibits copyright owners from suing online music services with valid blanket licenses for infringement. If a lawsuit is filed after January 1, 2018, for unauthorized reproduction or distribution of a musical work, the owner can only recover royalties under the new system, not damages or other remedies. The online service must show compliance with specified requirements. The Music Modernization Act requires online music services to comply with specified requirements, such as identifying copyright owners. Judges in the Southern District of New York can consider sound recording public performance rates when setting royalty rates for online services and satellite digital audio services. The Music Modernization Act allows judges in the Southern District of New York to consider sound recording public performance rates for online services and satellite digital audio services. Changes include a random process for assigning judges to oversee rate setting cases, with original judges not permitted to oversee rate proceedings. This change is not based on past actions but reflects the committee's belief in fair rate setting. According to the House Judiciary Committee report, judges in the Southern District of New York will be randomly assigned to oversee rate setting cases for sound recordings. This change is not based on past actions but aims to ensure fair rate decisions. Rights owners of pre-1972 sound recordings can receive payments from digital music services under federal law, in addition to other legal remedies. To qualify for statutory damages or attorney's fees, rights owners must provide specific information to the Copyright Office. Rights owners of pre-1972 sound recordings must file information with the Copyright Office to receive statutory damages or attorney's fees. Regulations will be issued for filing sound recording identification and contact information. Federal protection for pre-1972 sound recordings will be in place until February 15, 2067. Producers, mixers, and sound engineers can seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB with a letter of direction from a featured artist. The CRB requires a nonprofit collective to handle distributions for royalties from pre-1972 sound recordings. Legislation has been introduced to support the music industry, including S.Con.Res. 6 and H.Con.Res. 13, which declare Congress should not impose any restrictions on local radio.
