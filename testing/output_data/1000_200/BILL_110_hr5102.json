    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Our Nation's Trade, Infrastructure, Mobility, and Efficiency Act of 2007\" or the \"ON TIME Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the growth in international trade, especially containerized trade, is straining the nation's transportation network and causing traffic congestion near major US-international gateways. The value of international trade and the number of containerized trade shipments have been steadily increasing, with existing and potential future trade agreements expected to further exacerbate freight congestion. The United States is heavily involved in international trade with numerous free trade agreements and negotiations in progress. Traffic congestion in US cities is worsening, leading to significant time and fuel wastage costing billions of dollars annually. Freight bottlenecks are also causing economic losses and productivity delays. Maintaining current traffic conditions is a challenge. The United States faces worsening traffic congestion, leading to significant economic losses and productivity delays. To maintain current traffic conditions, government investments of billions of dollars are required annually. Additionally, to improve transportation systems for economic benefits, even larger investments are needed over the years. The United States needs to address transportation investment needs in national trade gateway corridors, reduce freight congestion, and develop corridors to enhance the freight transportation system reliability and quality of life for citizens. Establishment and collection of national trade gateway corridor fee. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a national trade gateway corridor fee on imported articles, amounting to .075 percent of the article's value or $500, whichever is less, within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, will assess and collect a fee for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors for imported articles. The fee will be deposited in a specific account and will not apply after fiscal year 2017. Additionally, an export fee will be established in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security. In 2017, the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Commerce, will establish a national trade gateway corridor fee on exported articles from the United States. The fee will be 0.75% of the article's value or $500, whichever is less. The term \"value\" is defined in section 30.7(q) of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with Homeland Security and Commerce, will collect a fee for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors. The fee will be deposited in a designated account and will cease after fiscal year 2017. The Secretary of Transportation will establish the \"National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund\" for fees collected for transportation trade corridors. The fund will be used for expenditures until October 1, 2018, to fulfill obligations under the Act. SEC. 4. APPORTIONMENT OF FUNDS. The Secretary of Transportation sets aside 2 percent of funds from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund for administrative expenses. The remaining amount is apportioned to State departments of transportation for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors. The Secretary apportions funds collected from fees at Customs ports of entry based on the amount collected for each port compared to the total collected. For transportation trade corridors spanning multiple states, funds are divided among states based on lane miles of Federal-aid. The apportionment of funds for transportation trade corridors is divided among states based on lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on Federal-aid highways. The apportionment of funds for transportation trade corridors is based on lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on Federal-aid highways in states. Amounts granted for eligible projects in these corridors remain available for 6 years, with unobligated funds after this period allocated to other states for similar projects at the Secretary's discretion. Project selection and eligibility criteria are outlined in Section 5. The Secretary of Transportation must issue project selection guidelines for State departments of transportation within 180 days of this Act. Guidelines must include consulting with various stakeholders and adhering to planning processes when selecting projects for grants under this Act. The Secretary of Transportation must issue project selection guidelines for State departments of transportation within 180 days of this Act, including developing a selection process, rating proposed projects, and clearly identifying the basis for rating projects. The Secretary of Transportation must issue project selection guidelines for State departments of transportation within 180 days of this Act, including developing a selection process, rating proposed projects, and clearly identifying the basis for rating projects. Additionally, a grant program will be established. The Secretary of Transportation may grant funds to State departments of transportation for projects in transportation trade corridors, subject to approval for eligible projects. Projects on Federal-aid highways must meet construction standards. The Federal share of project costs under this Act is 80 percent. The non-Federal share of project costs for eligible projects under this Act cannot come from other Federal funds. Prevailing wage rates apply to projects receiving assistance under this section as they would under chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code. SEC. 7. TRANSPORTATION TRADE CORRIDORS. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall establish transportation trade corridors for Customs ports of entry, with specific criteria for their boundaries and limitations on distance. These corridors may include areas in multiple contiguous states and are restricted to areas used for motor vehicle and cargo movements related to international trade. The Secretary of Transportation may establish a single transportation trade corridor for multiple ports of entry located close to each other within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. A 45-day comment period will be provided for public input on the proposed boundaries of the transportation trade corridors. The Secretary of Transportation will establish transportation trade corridors within one year of the Act's enactment. Periodic reviews will be conducted to ensure a corridor for each Customs port of entry with collected fees. The Secretary of Transportation will establish transportation trade corridors for each Customs port of entry with collected fees to ensure appropriate boundaries for the objectives of the Act. The Secretary of Transportation will issue regulations within one year of the Act's enactment. Appropriations from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund are authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2018. Grants approved by the Secretary for highway projects are considered contractual obligations of the Government. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines an \"eligible project\" as a project eligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code, and includes construction or improvements to a publicly owned intermodal freight transfer facility. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to transportation, such as \"Federal-aid highway,\" \"State,\" \"State department of transportation,\" and \"United States.\" These definitions are important for understanding regulations and requirements in the transportation sector."
