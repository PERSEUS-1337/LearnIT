    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011, when an omnibus funding bill was signed in April 2011, providing $659.9 billion for DOD activities, a reduction of $18.2 billion from the President's request. H.R. 1473 provided $17.8 billion for DOD's military construction budget, a reduction of $2.2 billion from the President's request. The bill incorporated $4.4 billion worth of reductions to the President's request, including cuts to various spending categories. The bill H.R. 1473 made significant reductions to the President's DOD budget, including cuts to major weapons programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and new ground combat vehicles. It also added funds for items such as Navy strike fighters. The bill H.R. 1473 made cuts to major weapons programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and added funds for items such as Navy strike fighters, National Guard equipment, medical research programs, Israeli missile defense systems, and the Military Career Advancement Account program. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorized $725.9 billion for DOD and defense-related activities, $2.7 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported a bill authorizing $725.7 billion for DOD and defense-related activities, a reduction from the Administration's request. The bill was set aside after the Senate rejected a motion to begin consideration due to opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees negotiated a compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523), dropping the \"don't ask, don't tell\" provision. The bill was signed by the President on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383), supporting the Administration's budget request and not adding funds for the C-17 cargo plane production. The bill also authorized a 1.9% increase in basic pay for military personnel. The House-passed bill challenged Administration positions by authorizing a 1.9% increase in basic pay for military personnel and $485 million for an alternate jet engine for the F-35, contrary to the President's request for a 1.4% pay raise and termination of the engine project. The enacted FY2011 bill authorized the 1.4% pay raise and $485 million for the engine. The FY2011 budget for the federal government's military activities (function 050) includes $733.3 billion in discretionary spending, with $5.3 billion in mandatory spending. This budget also includes $548.9 billion for regular operations of the Department of Defense and $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The FY2011 budget for military activities included $159.3 billion for ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, with an additional $33 billion requested for war costs in FY2010. This would bring the total DOD request for FY2011 to $708.3 billion. The Administration's FY2011 budget for military activities allocated $159.3 billion for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, with an additional $33 billion requested for war costs in FY2010. The budget also included $655 million for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake. DOD was exempt from the budget freeze on discretionary spending for security agencies. The Administration's FY2011 budget includes a 3.4% increase in the base budget for security agencies, providing real growth in spending for various agencies such as the Department of State, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security. The requested budget for discretionary programs of security agencies is $719.2 billion, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. Non-security agencies are subject to a budget freeze on discretionary spending. The FY2011 budget includes a 3.4% increase in the base budget for security agencies, totaling $719.2 billion, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. The requested budget for non-security agencies is $386.4 billion, a 1.5% decrease from FY2010. The $548.9 billion requested for the DOD base budget is $18.2 billion higher than FY2010, providing a 3.4% increase in real purchasing power. Adjusted for inflation, the FY2011 base budget would be DOD's third largest since the end of the Korean War. The FY2011 base budget for DOD would be the third largest since the Korean War, adjusted for inflation. The Administration projects annual increases in the budget that fall short of the 2% real growth rate needed for investments planned through FY2015. Defense Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap between sustaining the current force and future budgets. Defense Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to sustain the current forces with future budgets. He suggested shifting funds within the budget to support combat forces while reducing spending on administrative and support activities. Defense Secretary Gates proposed increasing spending on DOD's fighting force by cutting administrative and support costs. He aims to shift about $10 billion from support functions to directly support combat forces, following root-and-branch changes for sustained savings. Defense Secretary Gates proposed reallocating $10 billion from DOD's administrative and support functions to directly support combat units, aiming for a 3% increase in the \"tooth\"-related part of the FY2012 DOD budget request. He announced initiatives to reduce costs, including a 10% cut in service support contractors, reducing the number of generals, admirals, and senior DOD civilians, and eliminating certain departments. Secretary Gates announced 23 initiatives to increase efficiency in DOD contracts for goods and services, totaling $400 billion of the department's $700 billion annual spending. Initiatives included requiring affordability targets for new systems, rewarding contractors for efficiency, and reducing costs for services contracts. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the Administration's projected savings. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the Administration's projected savings in DOD contracts for services, which account for over half of the annual contracting budget. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon has warned that the planned budgets may lead to scaling back acquisition programs, while others object to exempting DOD from the budget freeze on discretionary spending. Representative Barney Frank calls for reductions in the DOD budget to terminate unnecessary weapons programs and overseas military deployments. President Obama's exemption of the military budget from deficit reduction efforts may lead to devastating cuts in other federal programs. The FY2011 DOD base budget request is 3.6% of GDP, marking a leveling off of the steady upward trend in DOD's share of GDP. The FY2011 DOD budget request maintains initiatives from the previous year and aligns with the Quadrennial Defense Review. It marks a stabilization in the DOD's share of GDP after a steady increase since 9/11. The FY2011 DOD budget request aligns with the Quadrennial Defense Review, emphasizing the need for U.S. forces to be ready for diverse missions, with a focus on ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends increased funding for acquiring helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft to enhance counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism operations. It also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade, with potential for more conversions in the future. The report assumes that no likely adversary will directly challenge U.S. conventional military capabilities in the next 10-20 years. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review suggests that adversaries will likely challenge U.S. forces asymmetrically using unconventional tactics and technologies. It challenges the idea of a conflict spectrum and highlights the use of advanced technologies by terrorist groups and near-peer competitors. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasizes the importance of military operations in cyberspace and the need to defend cyber-networks. Specific steps include developing a comprehensive approach, increasing cyber expertise within the DOD, centralizing command of cyber operations, and collaborating with other agencies for enhanced cyber security. The report also maintains the policy that U.S. forces should be prepared to win two major regional wars. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasizes the importance of military operations in cyberspace and the need to defend cyber-networks. It highlights the need for U.S. forces to be prepared for multiple missions of different types around the globe, including stabilizing countries, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency, and supporting civil authorities in times of disaster or terrorist attacks. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasizes preparing U.S. forces for asymmetric threats like \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities developed by China and other adversaries. These threats target U.S. forward bases and naval forces crucial for projecting power globally, which is costly but essential for U.S. alliances and stability efforts. The cost of power projection capabilities is a reason for high U.S. defense spending, which exceeds that of any other nation. U.S. power projection capabilities are vulnerable to various attacks, including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and other advanced technologies. The Quadrennial Defense Review recommends strategies to counter these anti-access threats. The Quadrennial Defense Review recommends countering anti-access threats with long-range strike weapons, submarines, electronic attack capabilities, and missile defense. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel. The FY2011 budget request would fund 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, marking a 4.7% increase over the end-strength of 1.38 million in FY2000. Active-duty manpower saw a reduction starting in FY1987 and accelerated in the 1990s. The Army and Marine Corps end-strength rebounded to 562,400 and 202,100, respectively, meeting goals three years earlier than planned. In FY2011, Congress authorized an increase in the Army's active duty strength to 569,400, with a $1 billion budget for a 1.4% raise in basic pay. The Basic Allowance for Housing was also set to increase by 4.2% in FY2011. Congress has typically approved military basic pay raises higher than the Employment Cost Index increase. In FY2011, Congress approved a 1.4% raise in basic pay for the Army, with a 4.2% increase in Basic Allowance for Housing. Military pay raises have been consistently higher than the Employment Cost Index increase since FY2004. There is debate over whether a 1.9% raise should be provided across-the-board or if the $340 million would be better spent on reenlistment bonuses and special pays for critical specialties. Military advocacy groups argue for the higher increase to close the pay gap between military personnel and civilians. The FY2011 DOD funding bills were used for legislative initiatives related to President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations. In FY2011, Congress approved a 1.4% raise in basic pay for the Army, with a 4.2% increase in Basic Allowance for Housing. Military pay raises have been consistently higher than the Employment Cost Index increase since FY2004. The FY2011 DOD funding bills provided a platform for legislative initiatives regarding President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations on openly homosexual individuals serving in the military. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness. Critics debate changing the policy due to stress from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some legislators call for immediate repeal of the 1993 law or a moratorium on discharges for violating the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. President Obama called for repealing the 1993 law and adopting a policy of nondiscrimination against persons with a same-sex orientation. The Department of Defense launched a study on how such a change in law and policy would be implemented, with Secretary Gates opposing repeal pending completion of the study. Changes in enforcement procedures were announced, stating that only a general or flag officer could initiate an investigation and separate someone who had engaged in homosexual activity. In May 2010, Senators proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 law barring openly homosexual persons from military service, pending completion of a DOD review and certification from key officials. In response to proposed legislation to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military, the Administration supports the draft amendment despite preferring to wait for the completion of a DOD study. Secretary Gates believes the review should be finished before any repeal legislation is passed, but acknowledges Congress's decision to move forward with the legislation. The Department of Defense review should be completed before any legislation repealing the 'don't ask, don't tell' law. Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the law unconstitutional on September 9, 2010. The Ninth Circuit temporarily stayed the injunction on October 19, 2010. Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley issued a memorandum on October 21, 2010, limiting the authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior. The FY2011 budget request included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system. The FY2011 budget request included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system, which has seen a significant increase in costs over the past decade. The system serves 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through various medical facilities and is projected to account for 10% of the planned DOD budget by FY2015. The DOD health care system's costs have increased due to various factors, including an increase in retirees using TRICARE, legislative benefit increases, and no fee adjustments since 1995. Proposed fee increases by the Bush Administration were blocked by Congress, and the Obama Administration did not propose any fee hikes in 2011. The Obama Administration's 2011 budget did not include proposals to increase TRICARE fees or copayments. Secretary Gates expressed a desire to control costs while ensuring care for military personnel and retirees. The FY2011 budget requested an increase in funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a shift in budget allocation towards procurement and away from research and development. The FY2011 budget requested an increase in funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a shift in budget allocation towards procurement and away from research and development. This shift reflected the transition into production of major programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, with appropriations of $11.2 billion in FY2010 and $11.2 billion in FY2011. The budget included cuts in major weapons programs, such as no funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or an alternate jet engine for the F-35. The FY2011 budget request did not include funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or an alternate jet engine for the F-35. In response, Congress added $2.5 billion for 10 C-17s and $465 million for the alternate engine in FY2010. Some Members of Congress have questioned the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which aims to develop new ground combat equipment, including the controversial Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). This program replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) program. The Future Combat System (FCS) program aimed to develop new combat equipment to replace current systems like the M-1 Abrams tank and M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. In 2009, Secretary of Defense Gates recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle (MGV) component of FCS due to design flaws. The Army then launched the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017. The Army replaced the MGV component of the Future Combat System (FCS) program with the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program, aiming to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017. The Army cancelled the existing competition for the GCV development contract in August 2010, revising the performance specifications for the new vehicle. The competition was restarted in November 2010. The Army restarted the GCV competition in November 2010, incorporating elements of the FCS program into the Army's Modernization program. The FCS components planned for deployment have not shown effectiveness in field exercises. The Navy's FY2011 budget requested funding for nine new battle force ships. The Navy's shipbuilding plan includes a total of 50 new battle force ships over five years, with half being relatively inexpensive LCSs or JHSVs. The 30-year plan includes 276 ships but falls short of fully supporting the 313-ship plan. The fleet is projected to grow to 315 ships by FY2020, peak at 320 ships in FY2024, and then decline before increasing again to 301 ships by FY2040. The Navy's shipbuilding plan projects a decrease in ships to 288 in FY2032-FY2033, followed by an increase to 301 ships in FY2039-FY2040. The plan would require an average of $15.9 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars, but a Congressional Budget Office report estimates it would need $19.0 billion per year. If funding remains at current levels, the Navy may not be able to afford all purchases in the 2011 plan. The Navy's shipbuilding plan may face funding challenges as it aims to procure next-generation ballistic missile submarines to replace the Ohio-class submarines. The program received significant research and development funding in FY2010 and FY2011, with plans to procure the first SSBN(X) in FY2019. The estimated procurement cost for each SSBN(X) is $6 billion to $7 billion. The Navy plans to procure the first SSBN(X) in FY2019, with estimated costs of $6-7 billion each. Concerns arise that this program could impact the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding plans by potentially reducing procurement rates for other ship classes. The Navy plans to procure the first SSBN(X) in FY2019, with estimated costs of $6-7 billion each. Options for reducing the cost of the SSBN(X) program or its potential impact on other Navy shipbuilding programs include procuring fewer than 12 SSBN(X)s, reducing the number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) to be carried by each SSBN(X), and stretching out the schedule for procuring SSBN(X)s. The Navy's FY2010 budget proposed ending Zumwalt class destroyer procurement at three ships and resuming Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyer procurement. Congress supported this proposal. The FY2011 budget calls for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The Navy also plans to build an improved version of the DDG-51, Flight III, starting in FY2016, terminating the CG(X) cruiser program as unaffordable. Flight III DDG-51s procurement is set for FY2016 onwards. The Navy plans to procure the Flight IIA version of the DDG-51 in FY2010-FY2015, followed by the Flight III DDG-51 starting in FY2016. The Navy's FY2011 budget requested $228.4 million for the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR). The Aegis ballistic missile defense program aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. Some are concerned about using Aegis-BMD ships to defend Europe against potential ballistic missile attacks. The Aegis BMD program faces challenges as demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships are outpacing availability. Concerns also arise over the strain on the Navy's resources to provide Aegis ships for non-BMD missions. Funding for the program comes mainly from MDA's budget, with additional support from the Navy. In FY2011, MDA requested $2,161.6 million for Aegis BMD, while the Navy requested $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. The FY2011 budget requested $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts, including funding for the Aegis BMD program and the development of the Flight III DDG-51 design. Additionally, $1.59 billion was requested for two Littoral Combat Ships designed for shallow water operations with interchangeable weapons modules. The Navy planned to buy different versions of LCS from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, but later decided to choose a single design for all LCSs procured from FY2010 onwards. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over five years, with a second competition for up to five additional LCSs from FY2012-FY2014. The Navy initially planned to buy different versions of LCS from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, but later decided to choose a single design for all LCSs procured from FY2010 onwards. They would compete for contracts to build LCSs in FY2015 and subsequent years. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps collectively had about 3,500 fighters in early 2009, with concerns about a shortfall due to budgetary limits on replacement fighters. Air Force officials projected a shortfall of up to 800 fighters in 2008. The Air Force and Navy are facing fighter aircraft shortages due to budget constraints. Congress is concerned about the affordability of modernizing the tactical aircraft force, with predictions of a budget \"train wreck\" as acquisition plans clash with funding limitations. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is crucial for DOD's tactical aircraft plans. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is key to DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans, with a total of 2,443 JSFs to be acquired at an estimated cost of over $300 billion. The program is the largest weapon procurement effort for DOD, with additional purchases planned by U.S. allies. The FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the F-35 program, including funding for research and development as well as procurement. The F-35 program receives significant funding from the Air Force and Navy for research and development, as well as procurement. Concerns have been raised about the affordability of the F-35 in the face of budget constraints, as the program will require over $10 billion annually for acquisition. Supporters argue that the F-35 is a cost-effective option for the military. The British government announced a plan to reduce defense spending by cutting the number of F-35 planes from 138 to as few as 40, excluding the vertical-takeoff version. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the program for an alternative engine, with approximately $2.5 billion provided for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed to terminate the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, which has received $2.5 billion for the alternate engine. DOD estimated an additional $2.9 billion needed for the F136 engine development. Critics argue termination was due to budget pressures, while supporters highlight cost savings and reliability from engine competition on other programs. The proposed termination of the F136 engine program raises concerns about long-term engine affordability, operational risks of relying on a single engine design, potential impacts on the defense industrial base and U.S. relations with allied countries, and the elimination of competitive market forces in DOD business worth billions of dollars. Continuing F136 development raises concerns about impact on the F-35 acquisition program, potential reduction in the number of F-35s acquired, outyear costs, and operational challenges of supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's FY2011 defense budget requested $863.9 million for the Air Force's KC-X tanker program to replace aging KC-135 tankers. The Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for a program to build 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, valued at $35 billion. Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS competed with tanker designs based on the 767 and A330 airliners respectively. Bidding closed with three offerors submitting bids, including EADS offering a design based on the Airbus A330 and Boeing offering a design based on the 767. The Department of Defense awarded the new tanker contract to Boeing for the KC-X program, valued at $35 billion. EADS decided not to challenge the decision, and the history of previous attempts to acquire a new tanker added context to the competition. The history of tanker acquisitions has been contentious, shaping the context for the DOD's KC-X competition. The Obama Administration shifted from a land-based BMD system in Europe to the Phased Adaptive Approach using BMD-capable Aegis ships for defense against potential ballistic missile attacks. Similar BMD capabilities could be pursued in other regions like the Middle East and Northeast. The Obama Administration shifted to the Phased Adaptive Approach using BMD-capable Aegis ships for defense against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. $2.27 billion was requested in FY2011 for PAA programs, including $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for the Aegis BMD system. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing saw a 20% reduction, mainly due to decreased spending on new facilities for units relocating from the 2005 BRAC Commission. The FY2011 budget for military family housing decreased from $2.3 billion in FY2010 to $1.8 billion. This reduction is due to the privatization of military family housing and an increase in Basic Allowance for Housing payments to personnel. The FY2011 DOD bills supported the Navy's plan to establish Mayport, FL as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port for security reasons, requiring new nuclear support facilities. The Navy's plan to establish Mayport, FL as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port is supported by the FY2011 DOD bills. This move would require the construction of new nuclear support facilities and shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport. Certain Members of Congress from Florida endorse the proposal, citing benefits in mitigating risks to the Navy's Atlantic Fleet CVNs. The estimated cost of moving a CVN to Mayport is $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging approved by Congress in the FY2010 DOD budget. The Administration's budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam for 8,000 Marines and their families moving from Okinawa. Congress approved dredging in the FY2010 DOD budget for a carrier homeport in Mayport, FL, but some Members express skepticism about the benefits and funding allocation. The Department of Defense plans to relocate military personnel to Guam from the United States by 2014-2016. Estimates suggest a potential increase in Guam's population by as much as 56,000 due to the influx of military personnel, families, and supporting contractors. Concerns have been raised about whether Guam's infrastructure can support this population surge. Additionally, the Administration's budget supports the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command. The Administration's budget supports the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection. This reorganization began in 2008, integrating responsibility for offensive and defensive cyber operations under one organization. In 2009, Secretary Gates directed the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command under U.S. Strategic Command, integrating offensive and defensive cyber operations. The NSA director was nominated to lead the new command, raising concerns about privacy implications. Centralized command aims to standardize DOD cyber practices and operations. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Air Force Operations and Maintenance included $139 million to stand up U.S. Cyber Command, an increase of approximately $105 million above the FY2010 budget. Some elements of the FY2011 DOD budget request reflected an effort to \"rebalance\" the roles of DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance. The FY2011 NDAA legislation does not include two programs previously funded by DOD. The FY2011 NDAA legislation does not include two programs previously funded by DOD, as the Administration requested these controversial items in the Department of State budget. This includes the \"Section 1207\" program and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. Additionally, the State Department will take responsibility for Iraq police training in FY2012. The DOD budget request for FY2011 includes funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund for Iraqi police training. The State Department FY2011 budget request includes police support funding for the transition year, transferring roles from DOD to State in security assistance. Pentagon officials debate maintaining or expanding DOD's role. Senate Armed Services Committee welcomes interagency review on security assistance authorities. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) noted the importance of advising and mentoring foreign security forces in the FY2011 NDAA report. Secretary of Defense Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mullen emphasized the need for the armed forces to strengthen their capability to train and advise partner nations' security forces. In a March 3, 2010 speech, Admiral Mike Mullen emphasized the importance of military power combined with diplomacy. Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen urged bolstering civilian capabilities to assist foreign governments in conflict prevention and recovery. They highlighted the need for a new relationship between defense and diplomacy to complement each other in international relations. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes controversial security assistance under DOD's control. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes various security assistance programs under DOD's control, such as the \"Section 1206\" program, the Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program, and new initiatives like the Defense Institution Reform Initiative. Additionally, a new Stability Operations Fellowship Program is proposed, although Congress has previously rejected this idea. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes a new Stability Operations Fellowship Program, which Congress has rejected in the past. Secretary Gates emphasized the need for the State Department to lead in national security, proposing a pooled fund for security assistance. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes $725.9 billion for DOD, $2.7 million less than requested by the Administration. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 5136; H.Rept. 111-491) would authorize $725.9 billion for DOD and defense-related activities, $2.7 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate version (S. 3454; S.Rept. 111-201) would authorize $725.7 billion, a reduction of $240.7 million. The Senate did not act on the bill due to opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees negotiated a compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) which dropped the provision relating to the \"don't ask; don't tell\" policy. The bill was cleared for the President on December 22, 2010, and signed on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383). H.R. 6523 authorized lump-sum totals for appropriations accounts in the DOD and Energy Department budgets, but did not include funding tables allocating those totals among specific programs. The defense authorization bill, H.R. 6523, authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the active-duty components of the armed services, with a 1.4% increase in military basic pay. The House-passed bill proposed a 1.9% raise, which was not included in the final version. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives for recruiting and retaining highly qualified individuals in essential specialties. They also directed GAO to review the process for identifying specialties for incentives and assess the housing allowance determination process for service members. The final version of the FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. The House had adopted an amendment to repeal the legislation after the DOD review is completed and certain certifications are made to Congress. The DOD review has been completed, and key officials have certified that policies are in place for the repeal of the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military. The Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate have also taken steps towards including this provision in the defense authorization act. In 2010, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on a bill regarding the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The final bill did not include a provision to repeal a law prohibiting military facilities from performing abortions. The Senate committee provision in 1993-1995 allowed military facilities to provide abortions using private funds, but the enacted version of the bill did not include this provision. Additionally, a House-passed provision for a pilot program to broaden officers' mid-career educational programs and assignments was not included in the final bill. The final version of the bill establishes the position of director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, requires improved protocols for medical care of sexual assault victims in the military, and guarantees access to victim advocates. H.R. 6523 establishes the director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, improves medical care protocols for military sexual assault victims, and ensures access to victim advocates. The bill does not include provisions for confidentiality of victim communications or legal assistance, but requires evaluation of authorizing victims to receive help from military legal counsel. It authorizes most of the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program. The bill, H.R. 6523, authorizes most of the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program. It includes provisions prohibiting increases in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments, similar to previous years. TRICARE beneficiaries can now extend coverage to dependent children up to age 26, in line with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The enacted version of H.R. 6523, the health care reform bill, did not include a House provision for a unified medical command under the Defense Health Agency. It included a provision for proper documentation of academic and military performance for officers in the services' medical corps, in response to the Fort Hood incident in November 2009. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions intended to address the Fort Hood incident in November 2009 and another incident in Little Rock, AR in June 2009. One provision would have provided special compensation to individuals targeted because of their affiliation with the U.S. military.

EADS proposed an Airbus A-330 tanker to compete with Boeing's 767 bid. A House amendment requires DOD to consider unfair competitive advantages in bids, referencing EADS' government subsidies. The World Trade Organization found that EADS received government subsidies for its commercial airliners, potentially giving it an unfair advantage in bidding on the KC-X tanker. Boeing's KC-46A design was selected by the DOD, and EADS decided not to challenge the decision.
