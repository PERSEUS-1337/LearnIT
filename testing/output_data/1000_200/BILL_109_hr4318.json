    "content": "The \"Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas Relief Act\" terminates prohibitions on expenditures for offshore gas leasing and revokes withdrawals from leasing areas. It also establishes an Outer Continental Shelf leasing program. SEC. 10. STATE APPROVAL REQUIREMENT WITH RESPECT TO GAS LEASING. The Secretary cannot grant gas leases within 20 miles of a state's coastline without the state governor's approval. Additionally, at least 75% of available unleased acreage within each outer Continental Shelf planning area must be offered for gas leasing in each 5-year program. The amendment applies to the 5-year Outer Continental Shelf gas leasing program in effect on the enactment date and all future programs. SEC. 4. SHARING OF REVENUES. Section 8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to allocate bonus bids and royalties from new Federal gas leases on submerged lands to States, with 40 percent going to the State and 10 percent available for other uses. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act allocates bonus bids and royalties from new Federal gas leases on submerged lands to States. 40 percent goes to the State, and 10 percent is available for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. For existing gas leases, amounts received by the United States will be paid to the State. The Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas Relief Act stipulates that the percentage of amounts received from gas leases allocated to States increases over four fiscal years: 10% in the first year, 20% in the second year, 30% in the third year, and 40% in the fourth year and beyond. This applies to leased tracts partially within a state's seaward boundaries. The Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas Relief Act states that bonus bids and royalties from leased tracts partially within a state's seaward boundaries are allocated to States based on the percentage of surface acreage within those boundaries. The Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas Relief Act defines existing and new federal gas leases and establishes state seaward boundaries for allocation of bonus bids and royalties. The Outer Continental Shelf Natural Gas Relief Act establishes state seaward boundaries for allocation of bonus bids and royalties after September 30, 2006. SEC. 5. NATURAL GAS-ONLY LEASING.

The Secretary can issue leases for natural gas production on the outer Continental Shelf, with regulations defining rights and obligations for lessees. All laws and regulations applicable to oil and gas leases also apply to natural gas-only leases. Existing oil and gas leaseholders can request to convert to natural gas leases. The Secretary can issue natural gas-only leases on the outer Continental Shelf without amending existing leasing programs, allowing for restrictions on development to natural gas and associated condensate. Public notice and comment are required for lease issuance.
