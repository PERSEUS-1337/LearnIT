The Izembek National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is defined as a \"Refuge\" in the Act, with the term \"Wilderness\" referring to the Izembek Wilderness designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The Secretary of the Interior is referred to as the \"Secretary\" in the Act. SEC. 4. LAND EXCHANGE REQUIRED. The State can convey non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land for road corridor construction in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. Valuation and equalization of land values are required for the exchange. The Secretary and State must select an appraiser to conduct appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land for a land exchange. The appraisals must adhere to nationally recognized standards. If the values are not equal, they must be equalized according to specified procedures. In a land exchange, if the final appraised value of Federal land exceeds that of non-Federal land, the values must be equalized by conveying additional non-Federal land, making a cash payment, or a combination of both methods. In a land exchange, if the final appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, the State can adjust the acreage of the non-Federal land to be conveyed to equalize the values. The Secretary may also accept a payment in excess of 25 percent of the value of the Federal land conveyed. The land exchange under this section must be completed within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land, while the non-Federal land will be added to the Wilderness and managed according to the Wilderness Act and other relevant laws. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. Requirements for the road construction will be in accordance with the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. The exchange of Federal land and non-Federal land, as well as the construction of a road under this Act, will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
