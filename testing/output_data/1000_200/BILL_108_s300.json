FINDINGS.\"\n\nSummarized: Section 1 presents the findings. \"Congress finds that Jackie Roosevelt Robinson, born in 1919 in Cairo, Georgia, excelled in multiple sports at UCLA before becoming the first black player in Major League Baseball with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. He was awarded the National League's Rookie of the Year in his first season and voted the Most Valuable Player in 1949.\" Jackie Robinson's achievements extended beyond athletics, influencing civil and human rights in America. He was the first black player in Major League Baseball, recognized for his fortitude, integrity, and athletic prowess. Robinson was voted the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1949 and elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. His signing preceded significant events in desegregation, civil rights marches, and a historic Supreme Court ruling. Jackie Robinson's influence extended beyond athletics, as he was regarded as a person of exceptional fortitude and integrity. He was named vice president of Chock Full O' Nuts and co-founded the Freedom National Bank of Harlem. Robinson influenced political leaders and worked with various organizations to better the lives of Americans. The Jackie Robinson Foundation preserves his memory by providing educational opportunities for children of low-income families. Robinson's legacy as an athlete, business leader, and citizen has positively influenced civil rights in the United States. The President is authorized to present a gold medal to Jackie Robinson's family in recognition of his contributions. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal. Duplicates in bronze may be sold to cover costs. The medals hold national status. The medals struck under this Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code. An amount not to exceed $30,000 is authorized to be charged to pay for the medal. Amounts received from the sale of duplicate bronze medals shall be deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. Congress suggests designating a national day to recognize Jackie Robinson's accomplishments, with the President issuing a proclamation for observance. The Senate passed S. 300 on October 17, 2003, awarding a congressional gold medal to Jackie Robinson posthumously for his contributions to the nation. Congress also suggests establishing a national day in recognition of Jackie Robinson."
