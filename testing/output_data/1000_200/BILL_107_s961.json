The findings section highlights the prevalence of breast implants among American women, with estimates ranging from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 recipients over 35 years. The FDA received numerous adverse reaction reports for both silicone gel-filled and saline-filled implants from 1985 to January 2000. Women are emphasized to need complete and accurate information about breast implants. Silicone breast implants were never FDA approved; saline breast implants, approved in 2000, had high complication rates. 43% of augmentation patients and 73% of reconstruction patients experienced local complications after three years. 40% of reconstruction patients needed additional surgery due to complications and device failure. FDA opened an investigation in 1998. In 1998, the FDA investigated manipulation of research data by a breast implant manufacturer. Despite this, saline breast implants were approved in 2000. A Mayo Clinic study in 1997 found that 1 in 4 women needed additional surgery within 5 years of receiving breast implants. Research sponsored by the FDA in 2000 revealed complications even in women who had not sought additional surgery. Research sponsored by the FDA in 2000 found that almost 70 percent of women with breast implants had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years, with silicone migrating away in 21 percent of cases. The relationship between free silicone and disease progression is still unknown. A 1993 study by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al. at the University of California showed a significant incidence of anticollagen antibodies in women with silicone breast implants. The 1999 Institute of Medicine study on silicone breast implant safety highlighted local complications as the primary issue, emphasizing the lack of comprehensive research on these complications. Concerns persist regarding potential connective tissue or autoimmune diseases resulting from exposure to silicone breast implants. Additionally, a 2001 National Cancer Institute study revealed higher rates of lung and brain issues among breast implant recipients. A 2001 study by the National Cancer Institute found higher rates of lung and brain cancer in breast implant recipients. A 1999 case report showed evidence of silicone migration in women with ruptured implants, leading to severe inflammation and complications. Once silicone gel leaks from the implant, it can trigger significant pathological responses. According to reports, silicone breast implants can hinder accurate mammograms by masking up to 40% of breast tissue, delaying breast cancer detection. Breastfeeding women with implants should be cautious as silicone leakage into breast milk and its effects on infants are unknown. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on breast implant-related issues. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on breast implant-related issues and ensure accurate information is provided to women. It aims to address the potential health effects of breast implants and urges the FDA to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by manufacturers. The Act aims to address the availability of silicone breast implants for various medical purposes. The Act requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health to provide a report on existing breast implant research within 90 days. Additionally, an amendment to the Public Health Service Act includes a new section on breast implant research. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research, who will coordinate research efforts across various Institutes including the Office of Research on Women's Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and others. The Director of NIH establishes study sections to review research grant applications on breast implants and conducts clinical studies to understand the health implications of saline and silicone implants in women over eight years. A clinical study on women with breast implants for at least eight years should differentiate between mastectomy, reconstructive, and cosmetic purposes, as well as saline and silicone implants. The study should focus on local complications, atypical symptoms, silicone migration, neurological dysfunction, and immune system irregularities, comparing their health to suitable controls. The Director of NIH will annually report the study results to Congress. SEC. 4. The FDA will evaluate saline breast implant manufacturers' data based on postmarket recommendations from the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel, reporting to Congress regularly. SEC. 5. The FDA will expand activities for silicone breast implants. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will expedite the investigation into wrongdoing by a breast implant manufacturer, provide up-to-date consumer information, and make aggregate data on implant problems available to the public. The FDA will make aggregate data on silicone breast implant complications available to the public upon request. Manufacturers must update package inserts with accurate information on complications and ruptures, and clinical studies must provide patients with FDA's booklet and informed consent documents. Appoint a special ad hoc patient information panel to amend the study protocol and informed consent document for breast prosthesis trials. Include providing patients with informed consent documents, informing women about obtaining a Medwatch form, and providing inclusion criteria and a Consumer Information number. Appoint a special ad hoc patient information panel to review breast implant information and advertisements annually, ensuring consumer information is accurate and thorough. Panel members include breast implant recipients, bioethicists, rheumatologists, and oncologists with experience in clinical care and research."
