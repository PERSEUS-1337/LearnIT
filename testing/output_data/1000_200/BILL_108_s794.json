    "content": "The Act titled \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" includes phased increases in fuel economy standards. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon. Amendments to the act include removing certain standards and adjusting the language regarding increasing the applicable standard. The paragraph discusses amending the fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles, setting different mileage requirements for various model years starting from 1984. The fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles are being amended, with different mileage requirements set for various model years. After model year 2011 and before model year 2015, the standard shall be 24.5 miles per gallon, and after model year 2014, it shall be 27.5 miles per gallon. If the Secretary does not increase the standard within 24 months after the latest increase, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons for not increasing the standard. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE. (a) Automobile.--Paragraph (3) of section 32901(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to increase weight limits. (b) Passenger Automobile.--Paragraph (16) of the same section is amended to define \"passenger automobile\". The definition of a passenger automobile is amended to exclude vehicles with a primary load carrying device, seating capacity of more than 12 persons, seating capacity of more than 9 persons behind the driver's seat, or equipped with a certain weight limit. The amendments exclude vehicles with a seating capacity of more than 9 persons behind the driver's seat or a cargo area of at least 6 feet in length that is enclosed by a cap. The changes apply to automobiles manufactured after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. Increased Penalty for Violations of Fuel Economy Standards: Amends section 32912 of title 49, United States Code to increase the penalty amount to $10, adjusted annually based on the price index. The amendment increases the penalty for violations of fuel economy standards to $10, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers. The amendment applies to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the accuracy of automobile fuel economy testing, including an assessment of fuel economy accuracy and discussion of testing methodology changes. The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency consult on the biennial report on automobile fuel economy testing accuracy and planned changes in testing methodology. The first report on testing quality under section 32920 of title 49, United States Code, is to be submitted to Congress in 2005. The Secretary of Transportation is required to conduct a study to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process. The Secretary of Transportation is required to conduct a study comparing automobile fuel economy ratings for different categories of use and report the results to Congress within two years of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress on the determinations and comparisons made in a study on automobile fuel economy ratings, including an estimate of the adjustment needed to align ratings with the testing process used for chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure for accurately measuring automobile fuel economy ratings within 180 days of submitting a report to Congress. This procedure will be used to determine the average fuel economy of each model of automobile. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure within 180 days to determine the average fuel economy of automobiles manufactured after model year 2006. The procedure will be based on the most accurate measures of actual automobile fuel economy. Additionally, adjustments in average fuel economy standards will be required for automobiles manufactured after model year 2006. The Secretary of Transportation will amend fuel economy standards to reflect improved accuracy from revised testing procedures. The standards must be at least as strict as the original standards if the testing procedure had not been revised. SEC. 6. STANDARDS FOR EXECUTIVE AGENCY AUTOMOBILES. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to set fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. The fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles are set in Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code. In a fiscal year, passenger automobiles must have a fleet average fuel economy of at least the average fuel economy standard applicable for that model year. The President shall prescribe regulations requiring that at least 20% of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executive agencies have a fuel economy rating at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard for that model year. Beginning in fiscal year 2009, executive agencies must ensure that at least 10,000 vehicles in their fleet have a fuel economy at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard for that model year."
