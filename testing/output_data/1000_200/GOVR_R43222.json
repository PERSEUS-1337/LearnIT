Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, and the Water Resources Development Act is the main legislative tool for altering harbor maintenance policy. The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) is crucial for changing the Corps' Civil Works Program and harbor maintenance policy. With merchandise trade now accounting for 25% of GDP, decisions on harbor maintenance have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The harbor maintenance tax (HMT) funds dredging costs, with a tax rate of 0.125% on cargo and cruise tickets. Most revenue comes from imported waterborne cargo, supporting the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF). The revenue from the harbor maintenance tax (HMT) is generated by imported waterborne cargo and flows into the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF). The fund covers the Corps' costs for dredging channels, maintaining jetties, breakwaters, and operating locks. HMTF can only be used with an appropriation by Congress and any surplus reduces the federal budget deficit. About half of the HMT collected annually is spent on harbor maintenance, with the remaining balance accruing interest in the trust fund, which was $8.5 billion as of July 2013. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) balance was $8.5 billion as of July 2013. In FY2014, the Corps expects the HMTF to receive $2.05 billion in income. Proposed bills in Congress aim to increase spending on harbor maintenance and ensure HMT revenues are used for maintenance rather than accumulating in the trust fund. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) balance was $8.5 billion as of July 2013, with proposed bills aiming to increase spending on harbor maintenance. By FY2020, 80% of the HMT collected the prior fiscal year would be spent on harbor maintenance, potentially reducing funding for other Corps activities. Congress may need to allocate more funds to the energy and water development appropriation to compensate for increased HMTF funding. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) balance was $8.5 billion as of July 2013, with proposed bills aiming to increase spending on harbor maintenance. Congress defined \"harbors\" and \"inland harbors\" in relation to commercial navigation, with specific criteria for each. The definitions have remained unchanged since 1986. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as a purpose. Most harbor projects are authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects, with O&M costs payable from the HMTF. If a project is \"multi-purpose,\" only specific costs are covered. Costs at harbors are payable from the HMTF, with specific expenditures eligible for recovery based on project purposes. High-use ports account for 90% of maritime commerce and receive two-thirds of HMTF spending, while moderate and low-use ports receive 19% and 7% of spending respectively. O&M activities are planned for most high-use ports. In FY2013, high-use ports handling 90% of maritime commerce received 19% of HMTF spending, with O&M projects planned. Low-use ports, handling 1% of commerce, received 5% of spending. This allocation of funds is a key point of debate in the HMTF allocation. The allocation of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending is a key point of debate. H.R. 3080 aims to change the allocation criteria, while S. 601 seems to favor funding large commercial cargo ports. Data shows that many waterways eligible for HMTF funds have little to no commercial traffic. Almost 75% of eligible waterways for Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending handle little to no cargo, with the majority of funds directed to high-use harbors based on cargo volume rather than value. A shift to a value-based metric could prioritize ports handling higher-value container ships, concentrating maintenance funding. The distribution of HMTF funds to ports is skewed towards high-use harbors that handle container ships with higher cargo value. The five largest container ports handle 56% of U.S. maritime container shipments. In FY2011, high-use ports received half of the requested O&M funds, moderate-use ports received 30%, and low-use harbors received 10%. Small harbors received only one-tenth of the funds requested by local Corps officials. The distribution of funds for harbors is skewed towards high-use ports, with small harbors receiving only one-tenth of the requested funds. The most economically significant ports received only half of the funds requested, leading to operational challenges for commercial shipping channels. The Corps' allocation of funding prioritizes partial investments across many facilities rather than larger investments in critical facilities. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in terms of ship capacity than tonnage, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports. The Corps may justify concentrating O&M funds on high-use harbors, but this could hinder the development of moderate-use ports and impact ports with fishing and recreational vessel traffic. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with many requiring maintenance only once every several years. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance required once every several years. In any given year, maintenance work is performed on 400 to 500 harbors and channels. The Corps is authorized to maintain over 1,400 coastal navigation projects but actively maintains only 360. It is unclear if the Corps is maintaining fewer projects than before, and the reasons for this are uncertain. The Corps study in 2003 questioned the need for continued maintenance of Corps projects, including harbor projects. It highlighted the lack of systematic reevaluation of economic justification for federal investment in harbors, leading to passive stewardship of resources. The study recommended establishing explicit requirements for confirming economic viability of harbor projects. The 2003 Corps study emphasized the need for policy guidance to confirm economic viability of harbor projects, especially those authorized many decades ago. Modern transportation alternatives have bypassed many small harbors originally used for maritime commerce, now mainly utilized by pleasure boats. The Corps still maintains these channels and harbors. The Corps retains responsibility for maintaining protected channels and small harbors, primarily used by pleasure boats. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest some inland waterways projects not needed for commercial cargo. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance and uses a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" for fund allocation. Budget guidance indicates the use of metrics to assess dredging needs. The Corps uses metrics like tonnage, cost per ton, and other criteria such as support for commercial fishing, public safety, infrastructure condition, and legal requirements to allocate O&M funds for harbor maintenance projects. This approach addresses concerns raised in a 2003 study about the lack of criteria, although the large number of criteria makes it unclear how many are used. The 2008 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report recommended creating an advisory committee to provide input on national harbor maintenance projects, but no such committee has been established. A 2010 GAO report expressed concerns that the Corps' criteria for prioritizing projects are not transparent and may not yield the highest return on investment. The Corps' budget process focuses more on anticipated rather than demonstrated project performance, according to the GAO audit. The Corps' budget process focuses on anticipated project performance, but GAO clarified that the O&M budget reflects actual performance. Opportunity cost is a significant metric for distributing O&M funds efficiently to harbors, although not mentioned in the Corps' budget guidance. Former Secretary of the Army highlighted the importance of considering opportunity cost nearly half a century ago. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly, making an average over several years a better indicator. However, there has been no joint analysis of O&M expenses and waterway usage data. The Corps maintains federally designated channels, with the HMTF covering 100% of maintenance costs for harbors up to 45 feet deep. For harbors deeper than 45 feet, a non-federal sponsor pays 50% of the additional maintenance costs. S. 601 proposes changing the cost-sharing requirement so that local funding is only needed for channels deeper than 50 feet. New construction projects are not funded by the HMTF but by general government revenues. The HMTF covers maintenance costs for federally designated channels up to 45 feet deep. For deeper channels, a non-federal sponsor pays 50% of additional maintenance costs. New construction projects are funded by general government revenues, not the HMTF. The federal share of construction costs ranges from 40% to 80% depending on harbor depth. Ports with deep channels may not use HMTF money for berths or private side channels. Some ports argue this limits their access to HMTF funds despite generating significant revenue from shippers. S. 601 and H.R. 3080 propose allowing ports with high revenue from shippers to use HMTF funds for dredging and other purposes. This could benefit ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach but may reduce funds for other ports. There is a wide variation in HMT generated at different harbors, with New York Harbor generating 15% of total HMT collections in 2011. The top 15 harbors collect over 75% of total HMT revenue, with New York Harbor generating $132 million in 2011, about 15% of total collections. Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors contribute a quarter of total HMT collections. The Corps maintains harbors for public safety, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft, authorized by Congress between 1850 and 1950. Critical harbors of refuge receive priority for O&M funds. The Corps prioritizes \"critical\" harbors of refuge for O&M funds, including those supporting Coast Guard stations and subsistence harbors for isolated communities. In FY2012-2014, additional funding was allocated for maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors by House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The Appropriations Committees allocated an extra $30 million for the maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors, urging the Corps to revise criteria for funding navigation projects based on economic impact and national importance. Federal maintenance of recreational harbors has been a contentious issue in past administrations. President Clinton proposed a two-year phase-out of federal funding for harbors not contributing to the HMTF, totaling 501 projects with $63 million in annual expenditures. President Reagan had previously suggested terminating funding for harbors with federal maintenance costs exceeding $1 per ton of cargo, aiming to save $150 million annually. The HMT was enacted as a user fee during the Reagan Administration to save $150 million in annual federal harbor maintenance expenditures. Debate over maintaining harbors with little or no commercial cargo dates back to at least the 1950s, with the Corps' policy not to maintain harbors not extensively used by commercial navigation. The government is not obligated to maintain economically obsolete waterways, as shown by minimum appropriations in recent years. An audit in 1956 revealed that the Corps was maintaining waterways mainly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, prompting the recommendation for Congress to establish specific criteria for federal navigation projects. The General Accounting Office identified 11 coastal navigation projects of questionable value in 2011. In 2011, the GAO identified 11 coastal navigation projects of questionable value, receiving $12 million in O&M spending and generating $1.5 million in HMT revenues. Only two projects still carry cargo, with one being the Okeechobee Waterway in Florida recommended for reclassification as a flood-control project. Despite this recommendation, the waterway continued to receive about $30 million from the HMTF from FY1999 to FY2008. The HMTF-funded Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas received $17 million from FY1999 to FY2008, but no cargo has moved on this waterway in recent years. Recent budget requests have shifted O&M expenses to flood risk mitigation instead of navigation. Recreational harbors can have a positive local economic impact, with studies showing that recreational boaters on the Great Lakes and in Oregon contribute significantly to the economy and job creation. Boaters do not contribute to the HMTF but pay federal fuel taxes for fish habitat restoration, boating safety programs, and marina facilities. Use of boat fuel taxes for harbor dredging dates back to before a cargo tax was enacted in 1986. Some in the recreational boating industry support using motorboat fuel taxes for harbor dredging. The Corps is piloting a program for local financing on low-commercial-use waterways. Key information on harbor maintenance spending is not publicly available, including current HMTF expenditure reports. Key information on harbor maintenance spending, such as current HMTF expenditure reports and data comparing harbor usage with O&M expense, is not publicly available. The Corps has collected cargo tonnage data since 1922 and tracks O&M expenditures on each facility since 1977, but the information is not easily accessible. The Corps has been tracking O&M expenditures on each facility since 1977, but the nomenclature in its tonnage database does not match the expenditure database. The Corps does not compare shipping channels' dimensions to authorized dimensions or publish estimates of economic loss from deficiencies. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program aims to develop economic tools for navigation improvement evaluation. The NETS program focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects, rather than on maintaining existing harbors and channels. Congress requested the Corps to estimate the nationwide average availability of authorized dimensions for maintained channels from the HMTF in FY2014. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container at $109. The HMT rate is 0.125% and is more significant when measured against typical freight charges. Shipping a 40-foot container from an Asian port to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000. A container of imported electronics valued at $117,606 would be assessed an HMT of $147, raising shipping costs by about 4%. The HMT on electronics valued at $117,606 would be $147, raising shipping costs by about 4%. U.S. ports near Canadian and Mexican borders claim the HMT diverts cargo to ports across the border due to tax differences. Factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities also influence shippers' decisions. If U.S. importers were relieved of the HMT, shippers could divert 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year from Canadian to U.S. ports. The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) concluded that removing the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) would lead to some U.S. cargo returning from Canadian ports to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation replacing the HMT with a maritime goods movement user fee to discourage shipping through Canada. The HMT poses a significant obstacle to transshipment of import and export cargo by sea. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is levied twice on imported cargo if unloaded at a U.S. port and reloaded on another ship, discouraging coastal feeder service. CBP and the Corps estimate $500 million per year in uncollected HMT from domestic waterborne shippers. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable, affecting the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. The duty drawback program affects the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports by refunding import duties on materials used in U.S.-made products when exported. Exporters do not pay the HMT for port use when exporting a product, but they do pay the HMT on materials transported through a port. The debate over WRDA is in the context of industrial supply chain cost-effectiveness. House and Senate Committees express concern about insufficient budget requests for Corps O&M to ensure competitiveness in a global marketplace. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce are focusing on improving the nation's marine transportation system to enhance national competitiveness. Supply chain competitiveness impacts product costs and influences investment decisions. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce are working to enhance the nation's marine transportation system to improve national competitiveness. Supply chain competitiveness affects product costs, investment decisions, and the design and management of supply chains and transportation infrastructure. In March 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to align waterside and landside infrastructure for improved transportation infrastructure investments. President Obama announced an initiative in 2012 to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors, aligning waterside and landside infrastructure investment along national priorities. In response to calls for a more strategic framework for allocating federal investments, a Task Force on Ports was established in the FY2013 Budget."
