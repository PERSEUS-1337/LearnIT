If not done, any Member of that House may introduce the bill.\n(b) Bill.--A bill under this section refers to a bill in Congress that approves agency regulations, giving them the force of law.\n(c) Referral and Consideration.--Such bills do not need to be referred to a committee, and any Member can move for consideration. (c) Referral and Consideration.--A bill described in subsection (b) bypasses committee referral. Any Member can move for consideration of the bill, with waived points of order.

The House receiving the bill will follow normal procedures but will vote on the bill from the other House for final passage. Upon receipt of a bill from the other House, final passage will be based on the bill from the other House. After the bill from the other House is dealt with, the original bill will not be considered. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"agency\" and \"regulation\" in accordance with existing laws. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to agency regulations made after its enactment. SEC. 7. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Regulations in bills under this Act are not subject to judicial review as agency actions."
