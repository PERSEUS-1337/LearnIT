    "content": "Both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism measures. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, incorporating provisions from S. 1253 to resolve disputes. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with provisions inserted into H.R. 1540. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be discussed in conference. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills and threatened to veto any legislation that limits the President's intelligence collection authority. The Administration opposes military detention mandates, limits on prosecuting terrorist suspects, and constraints on detainee transfers. The report provides an analysis of the House and Senate bills regarding detainee provisions, focusing on confirming and expanding detention authority granted to the President post-9/11. Congress authorized the President to use force against those involved in the attacks to prevent future terrorism. The President was authorized to detain individuals involved in or supporting terrorist attacks post-9/11 to prevent future acts of terrorism against the United States. Many captured individuals have been placed in preventive detention to prevent their involvement in hostilities or terrorist activities. Some have been tried in military commissions or civilian courts for terrorism-related crimes. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld allowed for the detention of enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. The Hamdi decision allowed for the detention of individuals involved in or supporting terrorist attacks post-9/11, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. The D.C. Circuit has generally supported the government's detention authority under the AUMF, particularly in cases involving Guantanamo detainees challenging their detention. It is uncertain if these rulings will be reviewed by the Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit has upheld the government's detention authority under the AUMF, allowing for the detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Congress has not passed any legislation to clarify the scope of detention authority granted by the AUMF. The military commissions established under the Military Commissions Acts of 2006 and 2009 detain individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, including those who support these forces in hostilities. Most detainees are picked up during military operations in Afghanistan or elsewhere abroad and held at Guantanamo Bay or other locations for interrogation. The Parwan facility in Afghanistan holds a large number of detainees captured in Afghanistan, but it may not be a viable option for future captures outside of Afghanistan. The current practice for future captures outside of Afghanistan appears to be ad hoc, as detainees suspected of terrorist activity in the US are usually prosecuted in federal court instead of being placed in military detention. There have been rare instances where individuals arrested in the US were transferred to military custody and labeled as \"enemy combatants.\" The detainees, one from Afghanistan and the other a legal permanent resident alien, were transferred back to civil authorities for trial in federal court amid uncertainty over the legality of their prior military detention. There has been controversy over how to handle suspected terrorists, with some arguing for military custody and trial for those affiliated with Al Qaeda. Some argue that suspected terrorists should be held in military custody and tried before a military commission, while others believe they should be transferred to civilian law enforcement for trial in an Article III court. There is disagreement over the best approach, with some advocating for executive discretion in deciding how to handle such cases. This debate has become common in high-profile cases involving suspected terrorists. Congress passed funding restrictions to prevent the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for criminal prosecution, extending the prohibition through FY2012. This effectively limits trial options to military commissions for suspected terrorists involved in high-profile cases. The funding restrictions extended beyond FY2011, preventing Guantanamo detainees from being transferred to the United States for trial. This limitation leaves military commissions as the only viable option for prosecuting detainees. Controversy arose over the transfer of Somali national Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame to face terrorism charges in a civilian court, after being detained on a U.S. naval vessel for interrogation. The controversy surrounding the handling of detainees continued, with debates over whether individuals should be held in military or civilian custody. The 2012 NDAA was expected to address the disposition of persons apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1540, which contained provisions on this issue. H.R. 1540 addresses the handling of detainees in the conflict with Al Qaeda, imposing restrictions on transfers and releases. The White House expressed support for most aspects of the bill but criticized detainee provisions, threatening a veto. The White House criticized detainee provisions in S. 1253, threatening a veto. The bill authorized detention of certain persons, regulated status determinations, periodic review proceedings for Guantanamo detainees, and funding restrictions on detainee transfers. Senate Majority Leader Reid delayed consideration of the bill due to objections. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported a new version of the bill, S. 1867, with revised detainee provisions. The Department of Defense and the White House objected to the revised provisions. The Senate passed S. 1867 with an amendment clarifying detainee authority on December 1, 2011. The Senate amended H.R. 1540 with provisions from S. 1867 regarding detainee matters in the FY2012 NDAA. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities on detention, initial status determinations, periodic reviews, and concerns about transferring detainees from Guantanamo are discussed. The Obama Administration's detention authority under the AUMF allows for the detainment of individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks, as well as those who supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces engaged in hostilities. The scope of this authority is subject to differing interpretations due to vague language in the AUMF. The President has the authority to detain individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks or who supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces engaged in hostilities. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" and the criteria of \"substantial support\" in the AUMF may raise questions about the extent of the executive's detention authority. The Supreme Court has interpreted this authority with reference to law of war principles. The Court in Hamdi interpreted the detention authority under the AUMF with reference to law of war principles. There is a dispute regarding indefinite detention based on providing support to a belligerent force. The government in 2009 did not clarify the aspects of its detention authority, stating it is not possible to define \"substantial support\" or \"associated forces\" precisely. The Obama Administration's detention authority definition is similar to the Bush Administration's, requiring \"substantial support.\" Recent court decisions have not provided clarity on this issue. The definition of an \"enemy combatant\" requires \"substantial support\" and recent court decisions have not clarified this aspect. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority since 2004. The AUMF authorizes the detention of enemy combatants for the duration of hostilities, leaving the full parameters of detention authority to lower courts. The AUMF does not limit the organizations it covers to just al-Qaida or the Taliban, allowing for the detention of individuals associated with private armed groups in Afghanistan. This authority is based on principles of co-belligerency in traditional international armed conflicts. The Bush Administration previously detained Chinese Uighur dissidents as members of an \"associated force.\" In Parhat v. Gates, the D.C. Circuit rejected the government's claim that a Chinese Uighur dissident was an \"enemy combatant\" based on alleged affiliation with ETIM. The court upheld the government's criteria for membership in an \"associated force\" linked to al Qaida or the Taliban, but found insufficient evidence to support this in the case. The government defined \"associated force\" as closely linked to al Qaida or the Taliban. The court found insufficient evidence to connect ETIM to Al Qaeda as an \"associated force.\" The court did not find evidence to connect ETIM to Al Qaeda as an \"associated force,\" as defined by the government. The term \"associated forces\" has been interpreted in habeas cases to cover armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Membership in groups like \"Zubayda's militia\" has been considered an \"associated force.\" The AUMF has been used to detain individuals associated with groups like Hezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin and the 55th Arab Military Brigade defending the Taliban. There is uncertainty about applying the AUMF to individuals captured outside of Afghanistan. The term \"associated forces\" has been interpreted to cover armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The AUMF has raised uncertainty about detaining individuals captured outside of Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens or those with ties to the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals has suggested that the AUMF allows for the detention of individuals linked to Al Qaeda, even if captured outside the U.S. The AUMF has raised uncertainty about detaining individuals captured outside the United States, including U.S. citizens or those with ties to the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and a resident alien captured in the U.S. as enemy combatants. The Supreme Court has not yet addressed the issue of detaining individuals captured or arrested in the U.S. under the AUMF authority. The Pentagon established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) in response to Supreme Court decisions in 2004 regarding \"enemy combatants\" at Guantanamo. The Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) at Guantanamo determine detainee enemy belligerency status. CSRTs confirm enemy combatant status for detainees, allowing for transfer or other actions. The process has confirmed 539 enemy combatants from 2004 to 2009. While the CSRT process is mostly inactive since 2007, new Guantanamo detainees would likely face a CSRT. This process is unique to Guantanamo detainees. The CSRT process is used for Guantanamo detainees to determine enemy combatant status. Non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan have a different review process with fewer rights. President Obama created task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy. The Obama Administration established task forces to study Guantanamo detention and U.S. detention policy. Military commission and review board proceedings at Guantanamo were put on hold pending recommendations. A new review system was implemented for detainees at Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011 for periodic review of Guantanamo detainees' continued detention. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011, establishing a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees for national security reasons. If detention is not warranted, efforts are made to transfer detainees outside the United States. The Executive Order 13567 established a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess Guantanamo detainees' continued detention for national security reasons. Detainees can challenge their detention and present evidence in a hearing within a year of the order. The process is discretionary and does not create new detention authority. Detainee transfers from Guantanamo have raised concerns about potential terrorist activities post-release. Statistics on post-release activities are limited and classified, but some detainees have been involved in terrorism. The policy implications and significance of these activities are debated. The release of Guantanamo detainees has sparked debate over their post-release activities. In 2007, the Pentagon reported that 30 former detainees engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda. Researchers challenged these numbers, citing discrepancies in data and a lack of identifying information for verification. The Pentagon's assertion of Guantanamo detainees' \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement\" was disputed due to discrepancies in data and lack of verification. Some ex-detainees engaged in terrorist activities post-release, with 36 confirmed or suspected cases reported by the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2008. In 2008, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that 36 ex-Guantanamo detainees were confirmed or suspected of returning to terrorism. In 2009, the Pentagon reported that 74 out of 534 transferred prisoners engaged in terrorism or militant activity. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of National Intelligence to release a report on recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees, which showed that 13.5% were confirmed and 11.5% were suspected of engaging in terrorism. In December 2010, a report on Guantanamo detainees revealed that 13.5% were confirmed and 11.5% suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities after transfer. Out of 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are deceased, 54 in custody, and 83 at large. Since Executive Order 13492, 2 confirmed and 3 suspected detainees participated in terrorist activities. The accuracy of these numbers has been questioned. The New America Foundation estimated that around 6% of released Guantanamo detainees posed a threat to the US or its interests. The discrepancy between public estimates and the DNI's report on detainee recidivism remains unclear due to classified intelligence data. There is a consensus that the number of released detainees engaging in terrorism has increased. The House of Representatives passed subtitle D of title X of H.R. 1540 on May 26, 2011, defining \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-US citizens detained after March 7, 2011. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" under subtitle D of H.R. 1540 refers to non-US citizens detained at Guantanamo after March 7, 2011, who are not US citizens or members of the US Armed Forces and are under the effective control of the Department of Defense. The provision does not specify detainees under the AUMF, allowing for detainees found not to be enemy belligerents to remain at Guantanamo until transfer or release. The term \"effective control\" by the Department of Defense is ambiguous, potentially covering situations beyond physical custody. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" in H.R. 1540 covers non-US citizens under the Department of Defense's control. It may include detainees not directly in DOD custody, such as those supervised by other agencies. The definition is broad enough to encompass foreign nationals brought to Guantanamo for reasons unrelated to hostilities. Executive authorities may not interpret the term to include foreign refugees. Section 1033 of the bill allows guilty pleas in capital cases under the Military Commissions Act of 2009. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases, permitting the death penalty in cases where the accused has pled guilty with unanimous approval from military commission panel members. It also addresses pre-trial agreements for a reduction in the maximum sentence. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases and address pre-trial agreements for sentence reduction. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, affirming the President's authority to detain captured belligerents. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to use necessary force in the armed conflict under the AUMF, including the detention of belligerents supporting Al Qaeda or the Taliban. This provision has sparked controversy among supporters and critics. Supporters of the provision in Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 argue that it confirms the evolving armed conflict since the 2001 AUMF, aligning with the executive branch's interpretation. Opponents are concerned that the inclusion of \"associated forces\" without a direct link to the 9/11 attacks could expand the conflict to any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda. Proponents believe the proposed language is not overly broad, as the AUMF was never geographically or temporally limited, giving the President discretion in the use of force. The AUMF was not limited geographically or temporally, giving the President discretion in the use of force. Section 1034 expands the identification of belligerent parties beyond Al Qaeda and the Taliban to include any entities engaged in or supporting hostilities. This raises concerns about potentially broadening the conflict to new terrorist groups associated with Al Qaeda. The AUMF granted the President broad discretion in the use of force, expanding the identification of belligerent parties to include entities engaged in or supporting hostilities beyond Al Qaeda and the Taliban. This raises concerns about broadening the conflict to new terrorist groups associated with Al Qaeda, with implications for detention authority during hostilities. The AUMF granted the President broad discretion in the use of force, expanding the identification of belligerent parties to include entities engaged in or supporting hostilities beyond Al Qaeda and the Taliban. This raises concerns about broadening the conflict to new terrorist groups associated with Al Qaeda, with implications for detention authority during hostilities. The legislative history of H.R. 1540 suggests that Section 1034 is not intended to authorize a significant expansion of the ongoing conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations, but instead to reaffirm the current interpretation of the AUMF advanced by the executive in habeas litigation involving wartime detainees. The terrorist threat has evolved despite military pressure from the US and its allies. Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces still pose a grave threat to US national security. The Authorization for Use of Military Force includes the authority to address this threat. The committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the AUMF, as described in a 2009 filing. This affirmation does not limit the President's existing authority. The term \"associated forces\" is being construed by the courts. The interpretation of the term \"associated forces\" in H.R. 1540 Section 1034 paragraphs (1) and (2) aligns with Congress's authorities. The D.C. Circuit's view in Parhat suggests a broader interpretation of \"associated.\" The language in paragraph (3) mirrors this interpretation. The language in paragraph (3) aligns with a broad interpretation of \"associated forces\" in H.R. 1540 Section 1034, extending to nations and organizations involved in the conflict. The White House strongly objects to this section. The White House strongly objects to Section 1034 in H.R. 1540, stating that it could recharacterize the scope of the conflict and create confusion. Section 1036 requires a review process for Guantanamo detainees, similar to an earlier Executive Order but with differences such as the composition of the review panel. The review process under Section 1036 for Guantanamo detainees mandates military officers on the initial panel, sets strict criteria for detention assessment, and limits private counsel assistance. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 180 days on establishing a periodic review process, including a full review every three years and annual file reviews. Excluded from this process are detainees undergoing military trial or serving sentences imposed by a military commission. The review process for Guantanamo detainees excludes those undergoing military trial or serving sentences imposed by a military commission. A full review can occur no sooner than 21 days after arrival at Guantanamo, conducted by a panel of military officers with relevant expertise and security clearances. The detainee is entitled to assistance from a military representative and can present statements, evidence, and call witnesses to advocate on their behalf regarding their threat level to the United States. The detainee's personal representative is provided with a copy of the government's submission prior to the hearing, and outside parties, including the detainee's private counsel, may provide a written submission to the military panel if authorized by the detainee. The annual file review considers new information on the threat posed by the individual. The limited annual file review assesses new information on the threat posed by Guantanamo detainees, considering factors like likelihood of terrorist activity post-release and behavior in military custody. Relevant information from military commission cases must be provided for review. The interagency review board, composed of senior officials from various government departments, is responsible for reviewing the military panel's assessment of Guantanamo detainees for errors and can reject recommendations by majority vote. The interagency review board reviews the military panel's assessment of Guantanamo detainees for errors and can reject recommendations by majority vote. If the military panel recommends a detainee's release, the interagency review panel finds a suitable country for transfer based on various factors. The interagency review board reviews Guantanamo detainee assessments and can reject recommendations. The detainee has no right to seek redress in U.S. courts. The White House raised concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540 potentially leading to a presidential veto due to undermining the periodic review system established by the President's Executive Order. The President's Executive Order established a periodic review system, but Section 1039 of H.R. 1540 could limit advice from intelligence and law enforcement professionals, hindering informed decision-making on national security interests. It also restricts the transfer of non-citizen detainees held abroad by the Department of Defense into the United States. The 2012 Minibus (P.L. 112-55) prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution, in response to the Obama Administration's plan to close the Guantanamo detention facility. The 2012 Minibus prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. Funding restrictions in Section 1039 of H.R. 1540 cover a broader category of detainees and restrict their transfer or release into the US. Section 1039 of H.R. 1540 imposes restrictions on transferring non-citizen detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations other than Guantanamo into the United States. Unlike current restrictions, these limitations apply to all federal agencies and would expire at the end of FY2012. Additionally, H.R. 1540 includes provisions beyond FY2012, such as a permanent bar on prosecuting enemy belligerents for terrorist offenses. The White House strongly objects to Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which restricts transferring detainees into the United States. The Obama Administration argues that this measure interferes with executive discretion in prosecuting detainees in Article III courts. Section 1039 is seen as a challenge to the Executive branch's authority in determining when and where to prosecute detainees for national security interests. The White House opposes Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which limits transferring detainees to the US, arguing it hinders executive discretion in prosecuting detainees in federal courts. Section 1037 of the same bill prohibits using funds to construct facilities in the US for Guantanamo detainees, impacting national security efforts. The 2012 Minibus contains restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries or entities, except when certain criteria are met. These restrictions mirror those in previous defense authorization acts and appropriations acts, motivated by congressional concern over detainee recidivism. The 2011 CAA and NDAA imposed funding restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, with supporters arguing they reduce terrorist activity risks and critics claiming they are overly stringent. No detainee has been transferred since these acts went into effect, and the Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress before any transfer can occur. The Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress before transferring Guantanamo detainees, ensuring the destination country is not a state sponsor of terrorism, can control the detainee, prevent future threats, share information with the US, and allow access to appropriate agencies. The certification requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries include ensuring the destination country can control the detainee, prevent future threats, share information with the US, and allow access to appropriate agencies. Additionally, the receiving foreign entity must agree to permit U.S. authorities to have access to the transferred individual. These requirements are similar to those established in the 2011 NDAA and CAA. The White House opposes restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign governments, citing interference with executive foreign policy decisions. Section 1035 mandates the Secretary of Defense to submit a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees' communications within 90 days. The White House opposes restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign governments, citing interference with executive foreign policy decisions. Section 1035 mandates the Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed national security protocol for detainee communications within 90 days, outlining limitations and privileges, monitoring procedures, and enforcement measures. Section 1038 prohibits DOD funds in FY2012 from allowing family visits to Guantanamo detainees. Section 1043 prohibits... Section 1038 of the FY2012 DOD funds prohibits family visits to Guantanamo detainees. Section 1043 restricts rights and benefits for detainees repatriated to certain countries under the Compact of Free Association. Repatriation refers to returning a person to their home country, potentially affecting travel to the US for detainees resettled in specific countries like Palau. Section 1043 of the FY2012 DOD funds restricts rights and benefits for detainees repatriated to certain countries under the Compact of Free Association, such as Chinese ethnic Uighur detainees resettled in Palau. This may effectively bar them from traveling to the United States. Additionally, Section 1042 requires consultation before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by a military commission, determining whether the prosecution should occur in a U.S. district court or before a military commission. Section 1042 of the defense authorization bill requires consultation before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by a military commission, deciding on the venue for prosecution and potential transfer to military custody for intelligence interviews. The White House opposes this provision, arguing it could disrupt existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related cases. Section 1046 mandates that foreign nationals involved in terrorism-related activities must be tried by military commission. Certain terrorism-related conduct must be tried only by military commission for such offense. The provision applies to foreign nationals who engage in conduct constituting an offense relating to a terrorist attack against persons or property in the United States or against any US Government property or personnel outside the US. It is unclear if the provision applies to prospective attacks that are never carried out, and what qualifies as a \"terrorist attack\" is not defined. The criteria for what constitutes a \"terrorist attack\" is not clearly defined. In the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's attempted attack on an airliner in 2009, it may need to be proven that the attack occurred within the United States or involved U.S. government property or personnel. If these criteria are met, the offense must also be one that can be tried by a military commission under the Military Commissions Act. The Military Commissions Act allows for prosecution of individuals involved in terrorist attacks, such as attempting to bring down a civilian aircraft with an explosive device. Jurisdiction requires the offense to be committed in the context of hostilities, meaning a connection to opposing forces in an armed conflict must be established. The accused must also be a non-citizen and an unprivileged enemy belligerent for a military commission to have jurisdiction. The Military Commissions Act allows for prosecution of individuals involved in terrorist attacks, with jurisdiction requiring the offense to be committed in the context of hostilities. To establish jurisdiction, the accused must be a non-citizen and an unprivileged enemy belligerent, meeting specific criteria such as engaging in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. Military commissions have the authority to make their own jurisdictional determinations. The bill does not specify how criteria for determining unprivileged enemy belligerents are to be determined. Military commissions and Article III courts could both make jurisdictional determinations. The provision may complicate extradition and trial of terrorism suspects, potentially only applying to foreign nationals in U.S. custody. It could also impact cases involving terrorism charges and extradition efforts. The provision in the bill may only apply to foreign nationals in U.S. custody and could complicate extradition and trial of terrorism suspects. It does not specify criteria for determining unprivileged enemy belligerents and allows for trials in military commissions for certain offenses. The provision in the bill allows for trials in military commissions for certain offenses, but defendants could challenge the court's jurisdiction based on the language of the provision. If a federal criminal offense is charged, the defendant may avoid military commission jurisdiction by framing the offense under a terrorism-related provision of title 18, U.S. Code. This reading is supported by Section 1042, which gives broader discretion to executive branch officials over prosecutorial decisions. Section 1032 extends authority for rewards up to $5 million for providing information on terrorism. Section 1041 requires quarterly briefings from the Secretary of Defense to congressional defense committees. Section 1041 shifts the annual reporting requirement to February, requiring quarterly briefings from the Secretary of Defense to congressional defense committees on global counterterrorism operations. Section 1044 expresses Congress's support for DOD anti-terrorism efforts. Section 1045 focuses on improving interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups, outlining the President's guidance for identifying goals and agency roles in at-risk areas. The President is required to submit guidance documents to Congress within 15 days of completion, with agencies entering into memorandums of understanding. Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" and was passed with revisions addressing Administration concerns. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 on December 1, 2011, with an amendment clarifying detainee provisions. Section 1031 affirms the AUMF's authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents. The bill combines AUMF language with the Obama Administration's detention authority. The bill defines \"covered persons\" as individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting terrorist groups like al-Qaeda or the Taliban. It combines AUMF language with the Obama Administration's detention authority. The bill defines \"covered persons\" as individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting terrorist groups like al-Qaeda or the Taliban. It combines AUMF language with the Obama Administration's detention authority. Section 1031 of Senate-passed S. 1867 states that dispositions under the law of war \"may include\" several options for detainment. The law of war allows for detention without trial until the end of hostilities, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country. It is unclear if U.S. citizens or lawful residents can be considered \"covered persons.\" S. 1867 does not limit or expand the President's authority under the AUMF. The revised provision of S. 1867 aims to reinforce the executive branch's view of detention authority under the AUMF, particularly for U.S. persons arrested in the United States. Significant floor debate focused on the potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens and others within the country. The revised provision of S. 1867 aims to reinforce the executive branch's view of detention authority under the AUMF, particularly for U.S. persons arrested in the United States. An amendment was adopted to clarify that Section 1031 does not affect existing law or authority relating to the detention of U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens in the country. The controversy surrounding the detention of U.S. citizens and resident aliens captured in the United States has not been definitively resolved in the courts. While the Supreme Court has ruled that individuals captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan can be militarily detained for the duration of hostilities, the circumstances for those captured in other locations remain unclear. Section 1031 of the AUMF does not clarify when a U.S. citizen or resident alien may be held as an enemy belligerent in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The AUMF does not definitively clarify the circumstances for detaining a U.S. citizen or resident alien in the conflict with Al Qaeda. Section 1031 does not provide additional clarification on terms like \"substantial support\" or \"associated forces,\" potentially allowing for a broadening of the conflict scope. The revised provision in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the provision applies to \"covered persons,\" including \"associated forces.\" This may necessitate an ongoing account of entities considered as such. The Administration has not raised specific objections to the language in revised Section 1031, but believes codification of existing authorities is unnecessary and poses some risk. Congress must be cautious not to raise new legal questions that could distract from national security efforts. Future legislative action should ensure that codification of military detention authority does not have unintended consequences. Section 1032, which requires temporary military detention, has sparked controversy. Section 1032 of the legislation requires temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, excluding U.S. citizens but applying to U.S. resident aliens captured during hostilities. The provision has sparked controversy and raised concerns about its impact on national security efforts. The legislation mandates detention for certain individuals captured in hostilities authorized by the AUMF, defining them as members of al-Qaeda or associated forces involved in planning or carrying out attacks against the US or its partners. These individuals must be held in military custody until disposition under the law of war, with additional requirements for transfer to another country. The detainee must meet requirements before being transferred to another country, including being held in military detention until hostilities end, tried before a military commission, transferred for trial by another court, or transferred to a foreign government. Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to members of \"associated forces\" acting in coordination with al-Qaeda. The provision does not mention the Taliban as a force. The omission of any reference to the Taliban in Section 1032 of S. 1867 suggests that it may not be treated as a force associated with Al Qaeda unless its actions are coordinated or directed by Al Qaeda. Questions may arise regarding the detention of members of associated forces who act independently but coordinate some activities with Al Qaeda. Determinations could be based on the specific attack the individual is involved in. Captured Taliban insurgents suspected of targeting local government officials may be handed over to the Afghan government without needing certification under Section 1033, as long as there is no cooperation with Al Qaeda. The Afghan government can take custody of Taliban members targeting local officials without certification under Section 1033, as long as there is no Al Qaeda cooperation. Section 1032 does not apply to \"lone wolf\" terrorists with no Al Qaeda ties. The definition of an \"attack\" against the US or coalition partners is unclear, potentially allowing for military detention in certain cases. The reading discusses the interpretation of the term \"attack\" in relation to the law of war, particularly in cases involving terrorist acts against civilian targets. It also raises questions about whether lawful resident aliens can be detained based on conduct within the United States. The mandatory detention requirement is linked to hostilities authorized by the AUMF, potentially excluding insurgents targeting U.S. or coalition targets in Iraq. S. 1867 includes a new requirement for the President to submit to Congress, within 60 days of enactment, a report describing procedures for implementing the provision, including designating authorized personnel to determine covered persons and preventing interruptions in surveillance or intelligence gathering. The new requirement in S. 1867 mandates the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days detailing procedures for implementing the provision, including designating authorized personnel and preventing interruptions in surveillance or intelligence gathering. The bill also includes provisions for the transfer of detainees from third countries and waiver authority for this purpose. It is unclear how these procedures will interact with those under Section 1036, which requires the Department of Defense to submit procedures for status determinations for persons detained under the AUMF. The procedures under Section 1036 aim to determine detainability under the AUMF before deciding on the appropriate disposition. The bill allows for multiple processes to identify covered persons, depending on custody. It also permits a single procedure for determining detainment under Section 1032 and the law of war, potentially avoiding transfers to military custody. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032, as it could complicate trials of covered persons and limit counterterrorism tools according to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. Secretary Panetta and the White House strongly object to Section 1032, stating that it would restrict the executive branch's counterterrorism tools and limit the President's authority to defend the nation from terrorist threats. Panetta also criticizes the provision for not clearly limiting its scope to persons captured abroad and complicating the Department's ability to interpret and implement the restriction. Additionally, the White House views the provision as unnecessary, untested, and legally controversial. The Administration expresses doubt about the committee revisions to Section 1032, stating that it would tie the hands of intelligence and law enforcement professionals. The revised text only directs the President to develop procedures to prevent interruptions in interrogations, without fixing the fundamental defects or removing the provision entirely. This concedes the risks of mandating military custody without providing a solution. Section 1033 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries for the fiscal year, similar to previous NDAA and CAA provisions. It requires Congress to receive certification 30 days before any detainee transfer. The text chunk prohibits the expenditure of DOD funds for any detainee transfer from Guantanamo to a foreign country unless Congress receives a certification from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence. The certification ensures that the destination country is not a designated state sponsor of terrorism, maintains control over the detention facility, and has taken measures to prevent the individual from engaging in terrorism. The Senate bill requires the Secretary of Defense to certify that a foreign country receiving Guantanamo detainees will prevent them from engaging in terrorism and share relevant information with the United States. Unlike H.R. 1540, access to transferred individuals is not required. Certification is not needed for detainees transferred under certain conditions. The Senate bill mandates the Secretary of Defense to certify that a foreign country receiving Guantanamo detainees will prevent them from engaging in terrorism and share information with the US. Section 1033 prohibits transfers to any foreign country with a confirmed case of a detainee engaging in terrorist activity post-transfer, unless waived by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense may issue a waiver for transferring Guantanamo detainees to a foreign country with a history of recidivism if alternative actions will mitigate the risk. The transfer must be in the national security interests of the United States, and details of the determination and waiver must be provided to congressional defense committees 30 days prior to the transfer. The Senate bill's transfer restrictions under the 2012 NDAA apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. It remains to be seen if the term would cover foreign refugees at the Migrant Operations Center. Section 1033 also applies to persons under mandatory detention under Section 1032. The 2012 NDAA transfer restrictions apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. Section 1034 prohibits the use of DOD funds to construct or modify facilities in the U.S. for Guantanamo detainees without congressional authorization. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of these provisions. The 2012 NDAA includes restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, with Section 1034 prohibiting DOD funds for facilities without congressional approval. The Senate bill does not ban transferring detainees to the US, unlike previous enactments. The 2012 NDAA includes restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, with Section 1034 prohibiting DOD funds for facilities without congressional approval. The Senate bill permits the transfer of detainees into the custody of civilian law enforcement for criminal prosecution and clarifies aspects of the detention review process at Guantanamo. The 2012 NDAA includes restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, with Section 1034 prohibiting DOD funds for facilities without congressional approval. Section 1035 clarifies the periodic review process for detainees, emphasizing that it is to determine ongoing threat to U.S. security, not review legality of detention. The Secretary of Defense has final decision on detainee release or transfer, considering factors like likelihood of terrorist activity resumption. The Administration objects to a provision in the 2012 NDAA that shifts responsibility for detainee status determination to the Defense Department. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF within 90 days of enactment. The 2012 NDAA includes a provision that shifts responsibility for detainee status determination to the Defense Department, which the Administration objects to. The provision requires a military judge to preside over proceedings for determining the status of unprivileged enemy belligerents held in long-term detention. The detainee may choose to be represented by military counsel during these proceedings, regardless of their location. The 2012 NDAA shifts responsibility for detainee status determination to the Defense Department, requiring a military judge to preside over proceedings for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention. Detainees held by the United States in Afghanistan may have greater privileges during status determination hearings. The impact on Guantanamo detainees and habeas challenges is unclear. The implications of Section 1036 on Guantanamo detainees' habeas challenges are uncertain. It remains unclear whether the provision applies to all detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention under the AUMF or only to those detained after the Senate bill's enactment. The provision lacks clarity on how to determine if a detainee is subject to long-term detention before a status hearing. The detainee held in long-term detention may be subject to special requirements, with implications for Guantanamo detainees' habeas challenges. The provision lacks clarity on determining detainee status before a hearing. The detainee in long-term detention may not have military counsel or a military judge at their status determination proceedings. Multiple status determinations may be held for detainees to change their disposition, such as transferring them to another country or prosecuting them. The status review process under Section 1036 may only apply to detainees already designated for long-term detention, while others may have their status determined through existing administrative review processes. The White House disapproves of a provision in the military review process for detainees, citing conflicts with established procedures. Section 1037 allows plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a House-passed bill but without amending existing laws."
