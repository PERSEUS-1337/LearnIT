The \"Economic Sanctions Reform Act of 1999\" defines new unilateral economic sanctions laws and legislation as those enacted after the date of the Act, authorizing the implementation of unilateral economic sanctions by the United States. The \"Economic Sanctions Reform Act of 1999\" defines unilateral economic sanctions as measures taken by the United States to advance foreign policy or national security interests, constraining economic activities and government programs. The curr_chunk states that the policy advanced by the executive branch in an international financial institution does not include any obligation or responsibility of the United States under an international agreement or other international regime. SEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. Any new unilateral economic sanctions legislation should include a statement of the foreign policy or national security objective, provide authority for the President to refrain from imposing sanctions if in the national interest, ensure contract sanctity unless it hinders the effectiveness of the sanction, and authorize the President to consider the impact. The legislation should not restrict humanitarian aid, agricultural exports, or assistance for activities aimed at changing sanctioned conduct, unless the President deems it necessary. The President can waive sanctions if it is in the national interest of the United States. The President must review and report on the effectiveness of sanctions annually. The President must review the continued imposition of sanctions annually, considering objectives, multilateral support, costs, gains to the United States, and any determination to exercise additional authorities. SEC. 5. GUIDELINES FOR CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. In considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should ensure complete information on costs and gains, consider international legal obligations, and assess consistency with existing sanctions provisions. The proposed legislation for new sanctions should consider costs, gains, and administrative costs. Factors to consider include the likelihood of achieving objectives, national interests, and impact on humanitarian conditions. The proposed legislation for new sanctions should consider various factors such as conditions in specific countries, humanitarian activities, relations with allies, national security interests, diplomatic efforts, and multilateral adoption likelihood. The proposed legislation should also consider the likelihood of multilateral adoption of measures, the existence of alternative measures, potential retaliation against US interests, and the impact on US business, agriculture, consumers, and international reputation. SEC. 6. CONGRESSIONAL RULES OF PROCEDURE. The text outlines rules for considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation in the House of Representatives and the Senate, requiring specific matters to be included in the legislation. It also designates such legislation as a Federal private sector mandate and mandates a report by the Congressional Budget Office on the costs to the U.S. economy, including trade impacts. The proposed sanctions legislation aims to assess the long-term economic impact on the United States, including trade performance, employment, and industry competitiveness. This section is enacted by Congress as part of the rulemaking power of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The rules of each House supersede other rules only if inconsistent; each House has the constitutional right to change its rules regarding procedures at any time. SEC. 7. EXECUTIVE BRANCH ACTION. The President should adopt guidelines for imposing sanctions and establish procedures for public outreach. SEC. 8. RULES REGARDING SANCTIONS IMPOSED BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OR BY STATUTORY ENACTMENTS. The President has the authority to suspend, terminate, or not impose sanctions if the gains for national interests do not outweigh the costs. If sanctions are refrained from or suspended, they can be reimposed with notification to Congress. The President can suspend, terminate, or refrain from imposing sanctions if the benefits for national interests do not outweigh the costs. Sanctions can be reimposed with congressional notification. Congress can disapprove the President's decision within 30 days. In cases of suspension or termination of sanctions, the President must submit a report to Congress, and unless Congress disapproves within 30 days, the suspension or termination takes effect. Congressional procedures for joint resolutions are outlined in the Senate and House of Representatives to expedite consideration and enactment. Under subsection (c), a motion to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution in the House of Representatives is highly privileged. The provisions of this section supersede any other provision of law."
