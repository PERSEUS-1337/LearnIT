    "title": "AB 2133",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers in California is a priority as it will also protect the children under their care. Family child care providers face occupational health and safety hazards such as toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical strain. They have musculoskeletal injury rates similar to industrial workers. Since they are not covered by workers' compensation insurance, it is crucial for them to be trained to prevent injuries and illnesses on the job. This is highlighted in the amendment to Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code in California. The director is required to publish an annual list of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes, detailing their services and licensed capacity. The department must protect the privacy of small family day care homes by not including their names and addresses on the lists. To protect the privacy of small family day care homes, the department will not include their names and addresses on lists, except for necessary licensing purposes and providing information to specific agencies and programs. The entity selected to provide trainings required by Section 1596.864 includes family day care organizations and specialized health care service plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. They offer employee assistance program services with child care referral services. Parents seeking local day care services can request names and telephone numbers of local small family day care providers. The department, in consultation with the Child Development Division of the State Department of Education, shall adopt regulations on the confidentiality of information for small family day care homes. Regulations will ensure referral only to licensed homes in good standing. Violators may be denied access to information and reported to appropriate departments. Definitions for \"family child care provider\" are provided in this section. The definition of \"family child care provider\" includes licensed family day care home providers and individuals providing child care under a publicly funded program exempt from licensing, excluding relatives of the children in care. A publicly funded child care program subsidizes early learning and care for children, administered by various state departments. Family child care providers must undergo a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to their profession. The State Department of Social Services requires family child care providers to complete training within four years or three months of becoming a provider. The training includes identifying and minimizing risks such as chemical hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards. It also involves small and large group discussions and learning from experienced child care professionals. The Department of Industrial Relations selects an entity to provide training on infectious diseases, physical hazards, and stress for family child care providers. The training includes small and large group discussions, learning from experienced professionals, and feedback opportunities for providers. Organizations can also present relevant information on improving the child care system and offer training opportunities. The Department of Industrial Relations selects an entity to provide occupational health and safety training to family child care providers. The training includes developing curriculum with input from providers, periodic updates on health and safety matters, and administration of the contract by the State Department of Social Services. The State Department of Social Services administers the contract for training family child care providers. The training is coordinated with other requirements to reduce provider burden. Monthly lists of attendees are provided to the training entity for updates on health and safety issues. Providers can request removal of personal information from the lists. The department and selected entity for training must comply with the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act, providing training materials in non-English languages. This section will be effective on July 1, 2017. Section 1 of the act, effective July 1, 2017, aims to codify the rights of child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints with the State Department of Education for violations of laws or regulations. Section 8221.6 of the Education Code allows licensed or license-exempt child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints if the program has not complied with laws or regulations. The programs covered include the California Alternative Payment Program, CalWORKs Stage 2 Program, CalWORKs Stage 3 Program, and Migrant Alternative Payment Program. This section is dependent on funding from the annual Budget Act or another statute."
