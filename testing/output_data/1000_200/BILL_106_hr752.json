Many communities have lost scheduled air service, and smaller airlines now serve half of those remaining. The Department of Transportation's reports show significant fare increases and decreased traffic in major city pairs. A study found that large US air carriers charge higher fares at hub airports without low fare competition. Complaints about airline travel have risen by over 25 percent. Complaints about airline travel have increased by more than 25 percent, with a rise in complaints against large US air carriers. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission reported worsening flight delays, with a 20 percent increase in daily aircraft delays of 15 minutes or longer in 1996 compared to 1995. Forecasts predict a 52 percent increase in passenger enplanements between 1996 and 2006.
