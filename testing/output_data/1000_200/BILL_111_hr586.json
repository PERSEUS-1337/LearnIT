    "content": "The \"Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009\" recognizes the importance of individuals standing up for their rights and beliefs, citing the actions of those involved in the Civil Rights movement as examples of this principle. The Act highlights the significant events of the movement, including the Montgomery Bus Boycott, sit-ins, Freedom Rides, March on Washington, drive for voting rights in Mississippi, and the March to Selma. It also acknowledges the lesser-known individuals who played crucial roles in the movement alongside well-known leaders like Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks. The Civil Rights movement participants hold valuable first-hand memories that should be recorded for future generations to learn from. A Federal project to collect oral histories would provide a detailed history of the important and tumultuous period, serving as a model for future projects. The purpose of this Act is to create a federally sponsored project to collect video and audio recordings of personal histories of individuals who participated in the Civil Rights movement. The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution will serve as repositories for these oral histories. The Act aims to collect video and audio recordings of personal histories of Civil Rights movement participants. The project will be established jointly by the Librarian of Congress and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and the Librarian of Congress will establish an oral history project to collect audio and video recordings of personal histories of Civil Rights movement participants, as well as relevant visual and written materials. The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and the Librarian of Congress will establish an oral history project to collect audio and video recordings, as well as visual and written materials, related to the personal histories of individuals involved in the Civil Rights movement. The collected materials will be cataloged, indexed, and made available to the public through the Library of Congress and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture will oversee the implementation of this project. The Librarian and the Secretary may collaborate with other entities through agreements and partnerships to carry out activities related to the oral history project. They can also seek guidance from interested individuals and develop guidelines for acquiring and sharing recordings. Additionally, they are authorized to enlist the services of experts, consultants, and volunteers to support the project. The Librarian and the Secretary can procure services under section 3109 of title 5, accept volunteers, reimburse for travel expenses, make advances of money, and collect video and audio recordings related to the Civil Rights movement. The Civil Rights movement in the United States from 1954 to 1968 aimed to secure racial equality by challenging segregation and achieving equal rights legislation. Private donations are encouraged to support activities related to Civil Rights history at the Library of Congress. The Act authorizes funds to be appropriated for supporting Civil Rights activities at the Library of Congress, with $500,000 allocated for fiscal year 2010 and additional funds as needed for fiscal years 2011 through 2014. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
