    "content": "Several tax options have been proposed to finance health care reform, including restricting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers, modifying the tax exclusion for employer-provided health care, increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages, and imposing an excise tax on non-diet sweetened beverages. The House Ways and Means Committee has suggested funding the reform through a surtax on high-income individuals, which was passed by the House on November 14, 2009 (H.R. 3962). The House Ways and Means Committee proposed financing health care reform through a surtax on high-income individuals, passed by the House on November 14, 2009 (H.R. 3962). The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796 with an excise tax on insurers for high-cost plans. President Obama's compromise proposal, based on H.R. 3590, includes changes to revenue provisions, delaying the tax on high-cost employer plans to 2018 and raising exemption thresholds. The new plan proposed by the Administration would modify H.R. 3590 from 2013 to 2018, increasing the exemption threshold for the tax. It includes a 3.8% tax on unearned income for high-income households. The House passed H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872 on March 22, 2010, with the President signing them into law shortly after. Detailed revenue estimates of the different versions show varying effects on behavior and income distribution. The tax proposals in the new plan have varying effects on behavior and income distribution. Taxes may fall more heavily on higher-income taxpayers (progressive), equally on all taxpayers (proportional), or lower-income taxpayers (regressive). For example, limiting itemized deductions and high adjusted gross incomes affects top income brackets, while limiting health-related exclusions impacts middle-income brackets more proportionally. Excise taxes tend to be regressive, impacting lower-income classes more. The distributional analysis in the report focuses on the regressive nature of excise taxes, which disproportionately affect lower-income classes. Despite this regressive revenue source, the overall health care reform proposals are likely to benefit lower-income families. The report reviews various revenue raisers proposed by the House, Senate, and President Obama, as well as other financing proposals. The final legislation's most significant revenue raiser is the increased excise taxes. The final legislation's main revenue raisers include an increased Medicare tax, a fee on health insurance providers, a tax on employer health insurance premiums, and a fee on branded drugs. These health-related provisions account for about 90% of revenues over a 10-year period. In 2019, revenue raisers include Medicare tax, Cadillac tax, health insurance fees, drug fee, and biofuel provision. Provisions enacted by the new law and their revenue effects can be found in Table A-1. House Ways and Means Committee announced tax provisions for health care reform. The tax-related provisions for funding health care reform included a tax on high-income individuals. Legislation such as H.R. 3200 and H.R. 3962 were passed to implement these provisions, with modifications made to the surtax on high-income taxpayers and additional revenue raisers. The initial proposal estimated generating $583.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014, with $543.9 billion coming from a surtax on individual taxpayers. The tax provisions in H.R. 3200 aimed to raise $583.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014, primarily through a surtax on high-income individuals. The surtax rates ranged from 1% to 5.4% based on income levels, with potential adjustments based on health program savings. Additionally, there was a provision to align medical expense definitions for health savings accounts with itemized deductions for health care. The tax provisions in H.R. 3200 aimed to raise $583.1 billion primarily through a surtax on high-income individuals. The plan included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, such as a delay in the revised allocation of interest for the foreign tax credit, a provision to address tax sheltering by corporations, and an expansion of the definition of dependents for certain health-related tax purposes. The tax provisions in H.R. 3962 aimed to raise $460.5 billion primarily through a 5.4% surtax on incomes over $1 million for joint returns. It also included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, such as a provision on the use of treaties to avoid U.S. tax and modifications to the economic substance doctrine. The economic substance doctrine provision in H.R. 3962 includes penalties for underpayments, estimated to raise $5.7 billion. Other provisions involve restrictions on health-related tax measures, such as limiting health flexible spending arrangements to $2,500, increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, disallowing deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies, imposing a 2.5% excise tax on medical devices, and requiring information reporting on payments to corporations. The proposal includes extending reporting requirements to corporations for payments over $600, with potential gains and losses in health benefits and fees. Additionally, there is a provision to exclude Indian Tribe health benefits from gross income. The tax on the sale of medical devices is also part of the Senate Finance Committee proposal. The House bill proposal includes a surtax on high-income individuals, affecting only a small percentage of taxpayers. Concerns have been raised about the impact on small businesses and entrepreneurship, with only about 4% of businesses being affected by the surtax initially. The surtax in the initial proposal would affect about 4% of businesses, with 1.2% of unincorporated businesses paying the revised surtax. Higher-income individuals would be more impacted as they have a larger share of income, with statistics showing income concentration at higher levels. Business income is also more concentrated in higher-income brackets. The concentration of income at higher levels is evident, with labor income making up three-quarters of overall income. Business income is more concentrated in higher-income levels. Individuals with incomes over $1 million contribute significantly to unincorporated business net income. Returns with adjusted gross income of $1 million or more and over $500,000 accounted for a significant portion of total proprietorship and partnership/Subchapter S firm income. Taxpayers at the top tax rate are responsible for a majority of business flow-through income, with some income potentially coming from passive sources or tax shelters. Limited liability companies and limited partnerships make up a large portion of partnership income. According to IRS data, nearly 85% of partnership income comes from limited liability companies or limited partnerships, with Subchapter S firms being more evenly distributed. This includes passive income and income from businesses less focused on entrepreneurship. High-income taxpayers only accounted for 46% of active positive business income. The Tax Policy Center found that only 22.8% of returns affected by the surtax had business income exceeding half of total income, indicating that much of this income is passive investment income. The majority of partnership income comes from limited liability companies or limited partnerships, with a focus on passive investments rather than entrepreneurship. Data shows that business income is concentrated in finance, real estate, oil and gas, and professional services, with a significant portion coming from passive investments. The data suggests that small business income is concentrated in passive investments, stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants. While small businesses create more jobs, they also contribute to job loss. This sector offers more opportunities to women and minorities but pays less, is less stable, and has fewer benefits. The economy creates its own jobs over time, so there is no need for a permanent policy to create jobs. Excluding income from certain business operations could mitigate the impact on small businesses. Flow through income is a significant portion of the top 1%'s income, and excluding it would reduce revenue. Excluding certain income sources could reduce revenue, with passive income and income from specific sectors being considered. Other provisions in the bill have smaller revenue effects, such as disallowing spending on over-the-counter medications in tax-favored plans. Health-related tax expenditures are also discussed, including limits on flexible spending accounts and conforming medical expense definitions. The Senate proposal discusses changes to health-related tax provisions, including limits on flexible spending accounts and aligning medical expense definitions. Both House and Senate bills include a tax on medical devices, with the Senate version imposing a fixed fee. The House and Senate bills both include a tax on medical devices, with the House bill imposing a 2.5% tax on manufacturers and importers. The tax may be passed on to consumers, leading to higher insurance payments. Unique devices under patent may absorb some costs, but overall, the tax could discourage investment in new innovations. The tax on medical devices in the House and Senate bills could discourage investment in new innovations by manufacturers and importers. The interest allocation proposal would repeal a provision allowing worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit, potentially reducing U.S. tax liability for firms with more foreign taxes paid than allowable credits. The 2004 provision increased allowable foreign tax credits by including interest on foreign borrowing and debt-financed investment in the calculation. This resulted in more domestic interest allocated to domestic income, reducing foreign income interest and increasing the foreign tax credit limit. Another provision aims to reduce \"treaty-shopping\" by imposing withholding taxes on certain payments to foreigners, but treaties with other countries may reduce these rates. Setting up a subsidiary in a treaty country can help firms avoid withholding taxes. The third provision aims to codify the economic substance doctrine, which disallows tax benefits for arrangements lacking economic substance. Legislative standards are proposed to ensure transactions meet both objective and subjective tests, with penalties for non-compliance. The proposed legislation aims to codify the economic substance doctrine, requiring transactions to pass both objective and subjective tests with penalties for non-compliance. Supporters believe this will reduce tax avoidance and ensure consistent treatment in courts. Additionally, H.R. 3962 includes a provision for information reporting on payments to corporations to aid in tax enforcement on self-employed individuals with high noncompliance rates. The provision in the proposed legislation aims to increase compliance for small businesses by modifying the cellulosic biofuels producer credit to exclude fuels with water, sediment, or ash content. This change may simplify reporting requirements but could also burden businesses with increased compliance. The black liquor provision, previously eligible for the cellulosic biofuels producer credit, aimed at reducing fossil fuel use in the paper industry. The original black liquor credit expired in 2009, viewed as an unintended recipient of a blended fuel credit. Under current law, firms must report payments to unincorporated businesses providing services over $600 per year on form 1099-MISC. If vendor's taxpayer ID is not obtained, taxes must be withheld. Reporting requirements aim to increase third party reporting to address unreported income, especially from small businesses. Compliance rates for other income types are higher. Despite covering a significant share of payments, only a small fraction of firms file this information return. The reporting requirements aim to increase third-party reporting to address unreported income, especially from small businesses. The proposed revision includes expanding reporting of payments for services to corporations and goods as well as services. This expansion is driven by the increase in compliance and the need to simplify compliance for firms dealing with corporate or unincorporated businesses. The proposed revision aims to expand reporting to include goods in addition to services, simplifying compliance for businesses dealing with corporate or unincorporated entities. However, businesses criticize the increased cost and administrative burden, questioning the IRS's capacity to utilize the additional information. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796, America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, which includes a provision for a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding certain thresholds. This provision was somewhat scaled back in H.R. 3590, passed by the Senate, raising a total of $398.1 billion in revenue. The Senate's H.R. 3590 bill includes provisions such as a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding $8,500 for singles and $23,000 for families, raising $398.1 billion in revenue. Other revenue raisers include an increase in the payroll tax for high-income earners, a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, and changes in the treatment of Blue Cross. Additionally, the bill introduces a temporary fee on insured and self-insured plans, liberalizes the adoption credit, and excludes assistance for certain health professionals in state student loan repayment programs. The Senate's H.R. 3590 bill includes a 40% excise tax on high-cost health coverage, raising $398.1 billion in revenue. Other revenue raisers relate to health tax provisions, such as increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts and disallowing deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies. The plan also includes provisions to limit health flexible spending arrangements and raise the floor for itemized deductions. The Senate's proposal includes various revenue-raising measures related to health tax provisions, such as increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts and disallowing deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies. It also proposes raising the floor for itemized deductions for medical costs to 10% of adjusted gross income, limiting deductions for certain individuals, imposing fees on medical device manufacturers and importers, health insurance providers, and branded drug manufacturers, as well as implementing an excise tax on indoor tanning facilities. The Senate's proposal includes revenue-raising measures such as fees on medical device manufacturers, health insurance providers, and branded drug manufacturers. It also proposes an excise tax on indoor tanning facilities and a fee on insured and self-insured health plans. Additionally, there is a provision for an additional 0.9% HI payroll tax on wages over $200,000 for singles and $250,000 for joint returns. The curr_chunk discusses provisions including a qualifying therapeutic discovery project credit, an exclusion of funds for state student loan repayment programs, and changes to the adoption tax credit. It also mentions the excise tax on health insurance coverage, fees on drugs and medical devices, and the excise tax on cosmetic procedures. The excise tax falls on insurance companies, plan administrators, and employers for certain self-insured plans. The excise tax on health insurance coverage is expected to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years. The tax would impact high-income taxpayers more significantly and could lead to higher premiums or reduced benefits for recipients. Thresholds for the tax would be adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index, with higher initial thresholds for states with higher healthcare costs. The excise tax on health insurance coverage is expected to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years. Thresholds for the tax would be adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index, with higher initial thresholds for states with higher healthcare costs. The limits would also be higher for those over 55 and for those in risky professions. A study indicates that 90% of plans would be unaffected by the provision, which applied to amounts in excess of $8,000 and $21,000. The excise tax on health insurance coverage is aimed at discouraging rising healthcare costs. The tax would apply to amounts exceeding $8,000 and $21,000, with thresholds adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index. The revenue estimates suggest that more plans would be affected over time as healthcare costs continue to rise. The tax would have similar economic and distributional effects as an across-the-board cap on the exclusion, potentially leading to fairness issues. The excise tax on health insurance coverage aims to reduce costs by taxing amounts exceeding certain thresholds. This tax could potentially impact lower-income employees more than a cap on the exclusion. Questions remain on how self-insured firms would be treated and if the tax would be deductible. H.R. 3590 proposes increasing the HI payroll tax for high earners to fund Medicare. The HI payroll tax would increase by 0.9% for earnings over $200,000 for single persons and $250,000 for joint returns, raising $86.8 billion in revenue. The tax would be collected by the employer on compensation over $200,000, with the employee responsible for any discrepancy. This provision targets high-income taxpayers and is progressive, not affecting capital income. Health insurance provider fees generate $59.6 billion, with all fees and excise taxes totaling $106.3 billion from FY2010 to FY2019. Branded drugs fees raise $22.2 billion, and medical devices fees raise $19.2 billion. The fees on health insurance providers and medical devices have generated a total of $106.3 billion from FY2010 to FY2019. The fees on branded drugs account for $22.2 billion and the fees on medical devices account for $19.2 billion. The fees increase over time for health insurance providers and medical devices, with fixed nominal aggregate fees becoming less important. Insured and self-insured plans have smaller fees of $2.6 billion, designed to finance the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund, and expire after September 31, 2019. The fees on health insurance providers and medical devices have generated a total of $106.3 billion from FY2010 to FY2019. These fees are designed to finance the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund and expire after September 31, 2019. The fees could increase prices, reduce profits, and be passed on to consumers. The medical device fee exempts certain devices with a retail cost of $100 or less. The medical device fee and branded drug fee have sliding scales to reduce the impact on small producers. For medical devices, the first $5 million in sales is not counted, and 50% of sales between $5 million and $25 million are included. For drugs, the fee structure varies based on sales amounts. Insurance premiums and third-party administrator fees also have exclusions and inclusions based on specific sales thresholds. The medical device fee and branded drug fee have sliding scales to reduce the impact on small producers. For medical devices, the first $5 million in sales is not counted, and 50% of sales between $5 million and $25 million are included. The fees are not deductible. Imposing the fee as a fixed amount with apportionment produces a tax at the margin without providing additional revenue. H.R. 3590 also imposes a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, which would raise $2.7 billion over 10 years. This provision was not in the Finance Committee plan. A provision for taxing cosmetic producers was discussed during the debate, but was not included in the final bill. The tax on cosmetic producers was not included in the final bill, unlike the 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities. Nonprofit hospitals must meet a \"community benefit\" standard to maintain their charitable and tax-exempt status. Nonprofit hospitals must meet a \"community benefit\" standard to maintain their charitable and tax-exempt status. Concerns have been raised about the level of charity care provided by nonprofit hospitals compared to for-profit hospitals. Congressional hearings have been held to discuss the benefits and tax exemptions of nonprofit hospitals. Senator Grassley raised concerns about nonprofit hospitals in a staff discussion draft. In 2005, Senator Grassley raised concerns about nonprofit hospitals, including charity care, community benefits, governance, and billing practices. An IRS report in July 2007 found that the median share of revenues spent on charity care was 3.9% for nonprofit hospitals. The staff discussion draft proposed codifying rules for determining charitable status for nonprofit hospitals, including a community needs standard and a minimum annual level of charitable patient care. This could increase the level of charity care provided without significantly impacting revenues. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) allow for reductions in taxable income to fund certain program benefits. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) allow employees to opt for a reduction in salary to contribute to program benefits. Concerns include the \"use it or lose it\" nature of the plan, with amounts forfeited at the end of the year. Both House and Senate bills limit these arrangements to $2,500, with indexing by the CPI after 2011. The House and Senate bills limit flexible spending accounts to $2,500, with indexing by the CPI after 2011. Over-the-counter medication costs are not deductible for expenditures above the 7.5% floor, but are covered under health savings accounts. Individuals can deduct medical expenses above 7.5% of adjusted gross income, aimed at those with high medical costs relative to income. JCT estimates the cost at $10.7 billion per year. The medical expense deduction provision costs $10.7 billion per year and benefits taxpayers with high medical costs relative to income. It is used by about 12 million taxpayers, mainly those without insurance or for uncovered costs like mental health care and dental care. The deduction tends to benefit middle-class taxpayers more than other itemized deductions. IRS statistics show that higher-income groups claim a smaller percentage of the medical expense deduction compared to other itemized deductions. The medical expense deduction provision costs $10.7 billion per year and benefits taxpayers with high medical costs. It is used by about 12 million taxpayers, mainly those without insurance or for uncovered costs like mental health care and dental care. Higher-income groups claim a smaller percentage of the medical expense deduction compared to other itemized deductions. The Senate bill increases the floor to 10% for the deduction. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with other tax-exempt companies, are eligible for a special deduction of 25% of claims and expenses in excess of surplus. The tax benefits for Blue Cross and Blue Shield and other tax-exempt companies were substituted in 1986 due to their activities being similar to commercial insurance. The revenue loss from this provision is about $1 billion a year. A proposal in the Senate bill aims to disallow these tax benefits for firms with premiums exceeding 85% of claims. The Obama Administration released a compromise proposal on February 22, 2010. The Obama Administration's compromise proposal modifies the tax on high-cost health insurance plans by delaying the effective date to 2018 and raising the exemption amount to $27,500 for families and $10,200 for individuals. To offset the revenue loss, the proposal broadens the Medicare HI tax for high-income taxpayers. The President's proposal includes a 0.9% increase on the Medicare HI tax rate to 2.35% for high-income couples earning over $250,000 and individuals over $200,000. It also introduces a 2.9% assessment on unearned income for the same income brackets. Additionally, the plan clarifies that certain byproducts are not eligible for a biofuel tax credit and seeks to codify the economic substance doctrine. The President's proposal includes a 0.9% increase on the Medicare HI tax rate for high-income couples and individuals, along with a 2.9% assessment on unearned income. It seeks to codify the economic substance doctrine and excludes certain byproducts from a biofuel tax credit. The reduction in high-cost insurance tax revenue is significant, and the House has passed H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872 for consideration by the Senate. Amounts paid by firms for employee health insurance are excluded from taxes. The Senate Finance Committee's revenue options in May 2009 included capping the exclusion for employer-supplied health insurance. Some propose eliminating the exclusion, with options like a dollar limit based on a benchmark plan or limits related to income. The Advisory Panel on Tax Reform in the Bush Administration suggested a cap based on the average cost of health insurance. The Advisory Panel on Tax Reform in the Bush Administration proposed a cap on the employer exclusion for health insurance, which is the largest health-related income tax benefit. The revenue losses from this exclusion were estimated to be significant, with potential offsets from increased tax revenue and benefit adjustments. The Advisory Panel on Tax Reform in the Bush Administration proposed a cap on the employer exclusion for health insurance to address significant revenue losses. The cap would recover part of the revenue lost from the tax exemption related to income and payroll taxes, with estimates of $14 billion in 2010, $25 billion in 2011, and continuing to rise. The revenue from a cap depends on indexing and whether it is for general price inflation or health price inflation. If not indexed, a cap based on average health insurance costs in 2009 could raise $18.2 billion in 2010 and grow at an average rate of 32%. The Tax Policy Center estimates that a cap on the employer exclusion for health insurance could raise significant revenue, with projections ranging from $4.9 billion to $226.5 billion in 2019, depending on indexing to health price inflation. Caps need to be indexed to health price inflation to maintain a steady revenue stream. The employer exclusion for health insurance could raise significant revenue by capping it and indexing it to health price inflation. Critics argue that the subsidy favors high-income employees and incentivizes purchasing too much insurance, leading to increased healthcare costs. Higher-income individuals benefit more from the exclusion due to higher marginal tax rates. The tax benefits of the payroll-tax exclusion are not as targeted towards higher-income families as the employer exclusion for health insurance. Payroll taxes are flat rate taxes, and the excluded income from health insurance benefits does not rise with an individual's income. This suggests that the tax benefit may not increase as a percentage of income, making the burden from repealing the tax benefit not necessarily progressive. The tax effects of repealing the payroll-tax exclusion may not be progressive, with the burden distributed proportionally across income brackets. The tax increase from repealing the exclusion is highest in the middle income brackets, suggesting a tax benefit proportional to income. A cap related to income would result in a different distribution of tax burdens. The average tax increase from repealing the exclusion in Table 1 cannot be directly tied to the average size of the health insurance benefit package. The exclusion reduces adverse selection in the health care market and employer health insurance covers 62% of the non-elderly population. There are concerns that altering tax subsidies might reduce employer participation. Imposing a cap on tax subsidies for health insurance could reduce employer participation. One advantage is addressing the issue of purchasing more insurance than necessary. However, determining includable income for tax purposes could lead to inequities and administrative burdens. Various factors affect the true economic costs of health insurance for employees. The cost of health insurance for employees can vary based on factors like geographic location, number of individuals covered, age, sex, and health status. Employer plans involve implicit cost shifting, where the young may subsidize the old and small families may subsidize large ones. Group characteristics affect premiums for firms that purchase insurance and claims for firms that self-insure. While varying benefits by health status goes against risk-sharing objectives, variations by family coverage, age, and location are legitimate considerations. Most proposals for health insurance variations consider family coverage but not age. Imputing income by age may benefit older individuals but burden younger ones. Not varying imputed income by age can lead to inequities across employees. Imputing income for health insurance may vary based on characteristics like age, gender, and workforce health, which could lead to higher tax implications for certain firms. Adjustments for these factors could increase administrative burden. Suggestions include aligning benefits with COBRA rules for continuity of insurance. The Senate Finance Committee options document also addresses the exclusion of certain benefits from income. The Senate Finance Committee options document suggests reformulating the exclusion of insurance benefits as a deduction, credit, or a combination. Credits could equalize treatment across taxpayers, with refundable credits benefiting those without tax liability. An alternative approach could be restricting deductions for employers, reducing or eliminating deductions for insurance costs above a certain threshold. This would generate revenue and discourage excessive benefits. The Senate Finance Committee's options document proposes reformulating the exclusion of insurance benefits to raise revenues and discourage excessive benefits. Other health-related tax expenditures were considered, including the exclusion of Medicare benefits and medical benefits for military dependents and retirees. The exclusion of these benefits was not included in the options. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits of health savings accounts (HSAs) for individuals with high-deductible employer health plans. Contributions to HSAs are tax-deductible, with investment earnings and income not taxed if used for medical costs. However, distributions for non-medical purposes incur taxes. HSAs help individuals manage catastrophic healthcare costs while reducing unnecessary spending on routine care. The cost of foregone taxes due to HSAs is estimated at $0.5 billion annually and is expected to increase. The Finance Committee options paper discusses limiting contributions to HSAs under high deductible health plans and increasing penalties for non-medical uses. Distributions from HSAs would only be tax-exempt for medical costs if verified by an employer or third party. Proposals also include capping HSA contributions by employers. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to clarify FICA tax exceptions for certain services provided by employees of educational institutions, including medical residents. The proposal would extend Medicare coverage and associated taxes to all state and local employees, increasing health insurance payroll taxes to finance Medicare. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to extend Medicare coverage and associated taxes to all state and local employees, increasing health insurance payroll taxes to finance Medicare. This provision would lead to increased Medicare costs due to expanded coverage. Additionally, the proposal discusses excise tax provisions on alcoholic beverages and sugared beverages, with suggestions for increases in tobacco taxes. Alcohol taxes vary based on beverage type, with distilled spirits taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon and beer at $18 per barrel. Alcohol taxes vary based on beverage type. Distilled spirits are taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon, equivalent to $0.21 per ounce of alcohol. Beer is taxed at $18 per barrel, with alcohol taxed at $0.10 per ounce. Wine is taxed by type, with ordinary table wine taxed at $1.07 per gallon. Alcohol taxes are levied per unit and have not been revised since 1991, leading to a decrease in real value over time. If adjusted for inflation, the tax on distilled spirits would be around $19.60 currently. Alcohol taxes, like tobacco taxes, have implications for health costs and external costs. Studies show that the costs imposed by alcohol are larger than current taxes, and consumption is somewhat responsive to price changes. These taxes tend to be regressive, impacting low-income individuals more. Distributional data on federal excise taxes is limited, with the latest data from a 1990 study. Expenditures on alcoholic beverages as a percentage of income by quintile are shown in Table 2. The burden of alcohol taxes is expected to be more concentrated in lower income classes due to the higher prices of alcohol purchased by higher income classes. The regressivity of the tax could be significantly greater than suggested by expenditure data, as the tax is distributed by alcohol content and not by price. For example, the burden relative to income could be 333% larger for the top quintile compared to the bottom one. The price of distilled spirits is twice as much for the top quintile than for the bottom one, making the burden relative to income 333% larger rather than 116% larger. Alcohol taxes are regressive due to their unit tax nature, burdening individuals who consume alcohol socially and responsibly. The proposal suggests increasing taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits to generate more revenue. The proposal suggests increasing taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits to generate more revenue. The tax on distilled spirits would increase by 18.5%, on wine by 225%, and on beer by 148%, resulting in a total revenue increase of $5.7 billion per year. This price increase is expected to reduce consumption. The proposal suggests increasing taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits to generate more revenue. Price elasticity estimates indicate that consumption is not highly responsive to price changes. Applying these elasticities suggests a 0.8% decrease in beer consumption, a 4.7% decrease in wine consumption, and a 0.6% decrease in consumption of spirits. The proposal includes increasing taxes on non-diet sweetened beverages. Testimony suggests a tax of one cent per 12-ounce can could raise $1.5 billion per year, while a tax of one cent per ounce could raise $17 billion annually. Unlike alcohol and tobacco, the health effects and societal costs of these beverages have not been extensively studied. The tax is likely regressive and may raise questions about singling out this specific product. The imposition of additional costs on society through taxes, particularly on non-diet sweetened beverages, has raised concerns about regressiveness and singling out specific products. Various deductions, including for taxes and mortgage interest, play a significant role in individual taxpayers' choices. The largest share of itemized deductions are for mortgage interest (36%) and taxes (35%), with income taxes and property taxes on homes making up the majority. Charitable deductions account for about 15% of the total. President Obama's tax proposals include capping deductions for the top two tax rates at 28%, expected to raise $25 billion in revenues by FY2012. Itemized deductions benefit about one-third of taxpayers, with the value increasing with the marginal tax rate. The proposed tax increases would mainly target high-income taxpayers, particularly those earning over $250,000. These taxpayers, representing the top 2% of incomes, account for around one-fifth of itemized deductions. The $200,000-to-$500,000 income class makes up 11.4% of deductions, while the $500,000-and-over class makes up 14.6%. The top tax rate is expected to reach 39.6% after the 2001 tax cut expires in 2010. The $500,000-and-above income class accounts for about 4% of mortgage interest deductions, 3% of property taxes deductions, and 32% of charitable contributions deductions. Concerns were raised about the impact on charitable contributions, but studies suggest only a modest 1% reduction in giving due to limited tax benefit effects and behavioral responses. Higher-income individuals may see larger effects on charitable giving for health, art, and education causes. Higher-income individuals tend to favor charitable objectives like health, art, and education, which have larger effects on giving compared to religious organizations or basic welfare. Excluding these deductions from the cap could sacrifice a quarter of expected revenue gain. Other proposals include limiting all itemized deductions to 15%, raising $141 billion in 2011. President Obama suggests base-broadening provisions to finance health care reform through increased compliance and administrative changes. The tax provisions aim to reduce the tax gap and increase compliance, resulting in about $1 billion of revenue gain. Another set of provisions includes revisions in tax accounting methods, estate tax, and financial institutions, raising around $5 billion to $6 billion per year. The largest revenue loss comes from restrictions on valuation discounts for family-owned assets and modification of corporate-owned life insurance. The tax provisions aim to increase compliance and reduce the tax gap, resulting in about $1 billion in revenue gain. Other provisions include changes in tax accounting methods, estate tax, and financial institutions, raising around $5 billion to $6 billion per year. Additionally, potential revenue sources could come from various income tax provisions, such as rate increases and broadening the tax base. Burman suggests adjusting the rate brackets indexing to CPI minus 1% for a more accurate cost of living change calculation. The proposal aims to adjust the CPI to account for changes in spending composition, estimated to raise $8 billion in 2010 and $50 billion in 2019. Suggestions include increasing capital gains tax, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, international tax reforms, and repealing LIFO inventories. Revenue estimates from these changes are outlined in the Treasury's \"Greenbook\". The interest and LIFO repeal would raise a total of $9 billion in revenue. International reforms in the President's proposal could raise over $20 billion. Increasing payroll taxes could generate $100 billion annually. Eliminating the Social Security earnings cap could raise $84 billion. A proposed 10% value added tax (VAT) could generate $600 billion in revenue. Burman proposed a 10% value added tax (VAT) to raise $600 billion in revenue. Another option is a carbon tax or auction revenue from a cap and trade system. Implementing these new taxes would involve administrative compliance issues and transition problems. Table A-1 compares revenue provisions in H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3590. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of revenue provisions in H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3590, highlighting the regressive nature of excise taxes. Table A-1 shows the provisions enacted into law in P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152."
