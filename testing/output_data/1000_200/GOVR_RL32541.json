    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including lax screening, lack of in-flight security measures, and a failure of imagination among senior officials. The 9/11 Commission identified a failure of imagination among senior officials and agencies responsible for intelligence, national defense, and aviation security. They found that the likelihood of suicide hijackings was greatly underestimated, with no specific actions taken to defend against this threat before September 11, 2001. Congressional oversight of aviation security was also lacking prior to the attacks. The 9/11 Commission found that the hijacking scenario was greatly underestimated before September 11, 2001. Congress focused on airport congestion and passenger service rather than terrorism. After the attacks, Congress quickly passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act to address aviation security weaknesses. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was established after the 9/11 attacks to address vulnerabilities in transportation systems. It created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all modes of transportation, with key measures including federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and reinforced cockpit doors. ATSA also granted TSA authority to assess and implement security measures across all transportation modes, primarily focusing on aviation. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and placed the TSA within it, authorizing the arming of airline pilots for security. The Vision 100 Act further enhanced aviation security by creating a capital fund for explosive detection systems and expanding the program to arm pilots of all-cargo aircraft. Congressional and administration oversight of aviation security remains a priority. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and placed the TSA within it, authorizing the arming of airline pilots for security. The Vision 100 Act further enhanced aviation security by creating a capital fund for explosive detection systems and expanding the program to arm pilots of all-cargo aircraft. Despite these actions, vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, access controls for airport employees, screener performance, and possible terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles persist. The 9/11 Commission identified major vulnerabilities in cargo and general aviation security, inadequate screening, and access controls, leading to ongoing aviation security challenges. The commission made specific recommendations for improvements in airport passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system in aviation, addressing various terrorist tactics. It did not issue recommendations for access controls or shoulder-fired missile threats. Coordination between different security layers was highlighted as essential. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the importance of a multi-layered security system in aviation to address various terrorist tactics. Recommendations focused on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation, including enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection on passengers, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, and expediting security measures. The 9/11 Commission issued six aviation-specific recommendations to enhance transportation security, including improving passenger pre-screening, detecting explosives on passengers, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, deploying baggage screening systems, screening potentially dangerous cargo, and using hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, an overarching recommendation was made to prioritize transportation security based on risk and implement cost-effective deterrents. The CAPPS system, used for passenger pre-screening, has evolved to identify possible hijackers by matching behaviors to hijacker profiles. It is maintained by airlines and uses computer algorithms to flag \"selectees\" based on certain criteria. The CAPPS system, used for passenger pre-screening, has evolved to identify possible hijackers by matching behaviors to hijacker profiles. CAPPS II, the follow-on system, has faced controversy over data protection and civil liberties concerns. It would authenticate passengers' identities using commercial databases and check names against terrorist watch lists. The 9/11 Commission recommended utilizing federal government watchlists for improved pre-screening capabilities. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the successor to CAPPS should utilize federal government watchlists for improved pre-screening capabilities. The Department of Homeland Security was directed to address concerns with CAPPS II implementation, with limited testing until verified by the Government Accountability Office. Airlines' reluctance to provide data for testing due to liability concerns has hindered progress. The 9/11 Commission recommended airlines provide information for passenger pre-screening. CAPPS II program scrapped over privacy concerns, new program may replace it. Congress may increase oversight of Secure Flight program. H.R. 10 requires TSA to take over pre-screening within 180 days and start testing by November 1, 2004. The 9/11 Commission recommended airlines provide information for passenger pre-screening. The Secure Flight program is set to be tested by November 1, 2004, aligning with administration plans. Concerns over airline bombings were highlighted, including the Bojinka plot and Richard Reid's attempted shoe bombing. Concerns over IEDs were raised after high-profile incidents involving explosives on passenger jets. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving detection of explosives on passengers, including screening all individuals selected for secondary screening. Current screening technologies have limited capabilities to detect explosives carried by passengers. New technology is being tested to detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals at airport sites. Other methods include body scan imaging using low dose x-ray backscatter. Body scan technology is somewhat controversial. Body scan technology, using low dose x-ray backscatter, is controversial due to the nude images it produces. Alternative methods for detecting explosives on passengers include bomb-sniffing dogs and physical searches. Congress may debate implementing and funding initiatives for passenger screening based on the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. The TSA is advised to conduct a human factors study to improve screener performance at checkpoints. The TSA is addressing screener performance issues highlighted by a recent audit through initiatives like threat image projection (TIP) and improved recurrent training for screeners. Key human factors issues include screener selection, training, fitness for duty, and interaction with screening technologies. Research on aviation security human factors, including screener selection and training, is limited compared to other sectors like the Department of Defense and FAA. There is a lack of a comprehensive strategic plan for addressing human factors in aviation security. Congress may need to conduct oversight to ensure TSA's research efforts adequately address concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. Consideration may be given to tasking independent bodies like the National Academy of Sciences for further examination. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance and pilot next-generation checkpoint screening technologies. Congress may debate the adequacy of current funding for in-line baggage screening systems recommended by the 9/11 Commission. Vision 100 authorizes up to $500 million annually for this purpose. Congress may debate the adequacy of current funding for in-line baggage screening systems, with only $250 million appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005 out of the authorized $500 million annually. The total cost of integrating EDS equipment at all passenger airports is estimated to exceed $4 billion, potentially taking several years to complete given current funding levels. Letters of intent (LOIs) issued to airports by the TSA were created to leverage limited federal funding by stretching obligations over several years, but the TSA has implemented LOIs by reimbursing airports for expenses as they are incurred. The TSA has implemented LOIs by reimbursing airports for expenses as they are incurred, potentially slowing down the integration of EDS systems. Airlines and airports share the costs of EDS integration, with airlines paying the first $250 million annually from security fees. Defining a fair share of costs has been a point of contention. The TSA has proposed to increase the local share for airport security projects, which airports oppose. The 9/11 Commission implied that industry is not paying its fair share under the current scheme. Congress may debate the equity of cost-sharing for EDS integration in response to this recommendation. The House homeland security appropriations bill included language to limit the federal share for airport security projects. The House homeland security appropriations bill included language to limit the federal share for airport security projects. Legislation introduced in the House seeks to double the amount collected in aviation security fees for aviation security capital fund and increase TSA's flexibility for checked baggage security screening requirements. The 9/11 Commission recommended that TSA intensify efforts to identify suspicious cargo and screen potentially dangerous cargo in aviation and maritime operations. TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in November 2003, focusing on enhancing shipper security, pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft through facility security measures. Goals include pre-screening all cargo shipments to determine relative risk levels and collaborating with industry. The 9/11 Commission recommended that TSA intensify efforts to identify and screen suspicious cargo in aviation and maritime operations. TSA's strategic plan for cargo security focuses on pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft through facility security measures. Goals include collaborating with industry to enhance security measures. Congress may further scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security and debate approaches to air cargo security. Congress may further scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security and debate approaches to air cargo security, focusing on the level of physical screening needed for cargo on passenger aircraft. Proposals for 100% screening have been debated, but Congress has supported a risk-based approach using the known-shipper program. Both H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to improve cargo screening and tracking, with S. 2845 specifically requiring TSA to double air cargo screening within a year. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft carrying suspicious cargo, but the cost and opposition from airlines may hinder this initiative. Deploying these containers could increase operational costs and lead to lost revenue for the industry. Opponents of deploying hardened cargo containers argue that recommended initiatives to improve cargo identification, tracking, and screening may eliminate the need for them. Proponents, however, believe that hardened containers provide an additional layer of defense similar to hardened cockpit doors. Using only one hardened container per passenger aircraft still leaves vulnerabilities in the system, dependent on the effectiveness of risk assessments and flagging suspicious cargo. TSA currently requires proper vetting and verification for all cargo from shippers not in the known-shipper program. The TSA requires proper vetting for all cargo from shippers not in the known-shipper program. There is uncertainty on how to detect high-risk cargo and allow suspect cargo in hardened containers on passenger airplanes. Congress may debate the effectiveness of deploying hardened cargo containers for security against potential bombings. The debate over using cargo containers for security against potential bombings includes legislation requiring evaluation of blast-resistant containers on passenger airliners. The 9/11 Commission also recommended establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets, including developing a strategic plan for aviation security. TSA was tasked with selecting cost-effective approaches and allocating resources to federal, state, and local authorities and private stakeholders. This risk-based approach has been a key policy tool for aviation security, but a unified strategic plan is still lacking. The TSA has focused on meeting ATSA mandates post-9/11 attacks, deploying air marshals and federal screeners. With normal operations in place, the TSA can now develop a formal strategy for national aviation security policy, likely based on a risk-based multi-layered approach. Congress may task the TSA with creating a strategy addressing funding, budget, and roles of authorities. The TSA is tasked with developing a national strategy for aviation security that addresses funding needs, budget implications, and roles of authorities and stakeholders. Challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state, local, and industry involvement in aviation security. Local jurisdictions handle the physical security of airport sites, while the TSA maintains security oversight and enforcement. The security of airport sites is primarily the responsibility of local jurisdictions and airport operators, with the TSA overseeing security and passenger screening. Local governments and state authorities support aviation security through law enforcement presence. Air carriers must also participate in security measures, while air cargo and general aviation rely on aircraft owners and operators for security. The federal government enforces aviation security requirements. The federal role in aviation security is oversight and enforcement. There is a need for a unified plan to assign roles and missions to stakeholders and adopt a systems approach for overall security strategy. Congress and the TSA should improve strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources for aviation security, including integration with transportation security for rail, maritime, and highway security. H.R. 10 requires the Department of Homeland Security to prepare a transportation security plan, including modal plans for aviation, to set risk-based priorities and assign roles to authorities and stakeholders. Congress has focused on the 9/11 Commission recommendations for transportation security. The 108th Congress passed legislation related to aviation security, including the Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act and the National Intelligence Reform Act in response to the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Vision 100 included provisions for a redress process for pilots and mechanics. Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, enacted in 2003, established a redress process for aviation professionals facing certification issues. It also required justification for Air Defense Identification Zones and modified security training requirements for airline crews. Vision 100 mandated basic security training for crews and voluntary self-defense training by TSA for crew members. It also required a study on aviation security effectiveness, recommendations for improvement, and created the Aviation Security Capital Fund with annual appropriations of up to $500 million. Vision 100 established the Aviation Security Capital Fund with annual appropriations for airport security projects. It also set guidelines for project costs and required security programs for air charter operators. Vision 100 required security programs for air charter operators with aircraft over 12,500 pounds, mandated a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system, and authorized armed pilots through the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program. It also introduced the \"Secure Flight\" prescreening system as an alternative. Vision 100 expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include other flight crew members and required regulations for the security of foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations. It also modified background check requirements for foreign pilots seeking training in the United States, transferring the responsibility to the DHS from the Department of Justice. Flight schools and instructors must provide notification and identification information for individuals seeking training in smaller aircraft. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) mandates aviation security measures, including background checks for flight training in larger aircraft and the development of a National Strategy for Transportation Security by the Department of Homeland Security. Fee collections are authorized to cover the costs of these checks. See CRS Report RL32498 for more details on Vision 100 and aviation security provisions. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates aviation security measures, including the development of a National Strategy for Transportation Security. The act requires the TSA to issue guidance for biometrics in airport access control systems and establish biometric credential procedures for law enforcement officers on passenger aircraft. $20 million is authorized for research on biometric technologies for aviation security. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates aviation security measures, including the development of a National Strategy for Transportation Security. It authorizes $20 million for research on biometric technologies for aviation security. The act also authorizes $1 million to establish a center of excellence in biometric technologies. TSA is required to begin system testing of an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005. TSA must assume the role of passenger prescreening and checking passenger names against watch lists within 180 days after completing testing. Redress and remedy procedures for passengers falsely identified or targeted by the system must be established. TSA is required to minimize false positives, establish an oversight board, and implement safeguards for system security and integrity. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates aviation security measures, including the development of a National Strategy for Transportation Security. It authorizes funding for research on biometric technologies and the establishment of a center of excellence. TSA is required to test an advanced passenger prescreening system and assume the role of passenger prescreening within 180 days. Redress procedures for falsely identified passengers must be established, along with safeguards for system security. The act also mandates prescreening for international flights, screening against terrorist watch lists for FAA certificate applicants, and voluntary prescreening for air charter companies. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates aviation security measures, including prescreening using aircraft over 12,500 pounds. It requires reports on privacy impact, criteria for watch lists, and development of screening technologies for detecting weapons and explosives. TSA is directed to initiate a pilot program for advanced prescreening. The DHS is tasked with creating a strategic plan for explosive detection equipment at airport screening checkpoints. The TSA must conduct a pilot program for advanced airport screening systems and improve screener performance. The Federal Air Marshal Service will protect the anonymity of air marshals, and law enforcement officers will receive training in inflight counterterrorism and identification of fraudulent documents. The act authorizes the TSA to expedite installation of baggage screening equipment at airports and increase funding for aviation security. It also encourages international agreements for deploying Federal air marshals on flights and providing training to foreign law enforcement. The act increases authorization for the aviation security capital fund by up to $400 million per year through FY2007. It directs TSA to study using wireless communication for cabin crew to notify pilots discreetly in case of security breaches. FAA must issue tamper-resistant pilot licenses with a photo. TSA must develop standards for screener staffing levels at airports for security and minimal passenger wait times. The DHS is tasked with determining appropriate screener staffing levels at airports for security and efficiency. $100 million is allocated for research on improved explosive detection systems. TSA is directed to prohibit butane lighters and other inappropriate carry-on items. The President is urged to pursue international treaties to limit MANPADS proliferation. The President is directed to pursue international treaties to limit the availability and proliferation of Man-portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADSs) worldwide. The act also requires reports on diplomatic efforts, annual briefings on MANPADS non-proliferation, expedited certification for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft, and assessments of aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks. The act requires a report within one year assessing aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks and plans for securing airports and aircraft. It establishes a pilot program for blast-resistant cargo containers with $2 million in funding. Additionally, it authorizes $200 million annually through FY2007 for air cargo and airport security, and $100 million per year for research on air cargo screening technologies. The act also establishes a grant program for advanced air cargo security technology development and requires TSA to issue final regulations for cargo security. The TSA is required to issue final regulations for cargo security, including screening systems on passenger aircraft. The DHS, in coordination with other agencies, must report on threats from international cargo shipments and consider establishing secure facilities along aviation routes for diverting and securing potentially threatening aircraft. Additionally, the DHS is directed to research, develop, and procure systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft, with a goal of tripling the percentage of cargo inspected. During the 108th Congress, aviation security legislation addressed concerns from the 9/11 Commission, but some areas like general aviation and air cargo security were not fully addressed. The Commission briefly mentioned general aviation security concerns without formal recommendations. Legislation focused on airport and airspace restrictions. Legislation during the 108th Congress addressed general aviation security concerns by focusing on airport and airspace restrictions. Some provisions, like allowing general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, lacked a clear timeline for implementation. However, legislation regarding general aviation security was criticized for not being as comprehensive as other aviation security measures. During the 108th Congress, legislation addressing general aviation security concerns was criticized for not being as comprehensive as other aviation security measures. Some concerns were raised about the risk posed by private planes and helicopters, as well as the lack of comprehensive legislation on air cargo security operations and oversight. Measures passed by the Senate were stripped from the final version of the National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004, directing the TSA to address these issues through proposed rulemaking. The 109th Congress may focus on overseeing the TSA's implementation of air cargo security rules and strategic plan to ensure desired objectives are met."
