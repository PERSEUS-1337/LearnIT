Changes in House rules in the 112th Congress included posting legislative text electronically, implementing open or modified open rules, and having a new schedule with five-day work weeks. Most standing rules remained unchanged despite shifts in majority control, as they reflect years of experience. Rules facilitate the majority's organization but do not dictate policy goals or outcomes. In the new millennium, managing the House required accommodating diverse perspectives among Members and balancing governance with minority voices. Changes included fewer open special rules, more structured rules, an additional day for legislation consideration, reduced session days, increased committee jurisdiction competition, and passing measures by the House. In the House, legislation was passed with fewer session days, increased committee jurisdiction competition, and more control by the majority leadership over committee agendas and drafting major legislation. Party leaders had to rely more on their own caucus for key votes due to less political overlap between parties. During the 109th and 110th Congresses, turnover in the House favored leadership's influence over legislation, with 60 and 67 new Members elected respectively. This turnover brings new energy and ideas but also centralizes power within leadership. During the 111th, 112th, 113th, 114th, and 115th Congresses, high turnover continued with a total of 105, 75, and 67 new Members being elected in each respective term.

The House of Representatives remains an independent political institution designed by the Framers. Congress's role is not only to make laws but also to evaluate proposals for their feasibility, public support, and practicality. Chamber rules ensure all Members can participate in the legislative process. In the 116th Congress, rules changes are expected to be incremental, considering the party majority's size and composition. The House majority party must balance majority control of the Senate and minority prerogatives while governing effectively. Consideration of party arrangements and the effectiveness of the President and Congress over the past 30 years is also important. In the past 30 years, Presidents have dealt with various party arrangements in Congress, with successes and failures in major policy initiatives under each setup. President Reagan, President George H.W. Bush, President Clinton, President George W. Bush, President Obama, and President Trump all faced different compositions of Republican and Democratic control in Congress. Trump began his presidency with Republican control of both chambers. Presidents have succeeded and failed with their major policy initiatives under each arrangement. Both parties in the House focused on their party rules in the 114th and 115th Congresses to open up decision-making to more voices. Members in the Democratic Caucus are organizing under the \"progressive\" banner, while Members in the Republican Conference are organizing under the \"very conservative\" banner. Understanding the parties' organization and decision-making is crucial for Members and Congress watchers. The rules of the House are not meant to achieve specific legislative results but are available to all Members regardless of party control. The rules of the House are not meant to achieve specific legislative results but are available to all Members regardless of party control. Speaker Thomas Bracken Reed created the modern majority-minority House, but could not have foreseen how a strong Speaker like Joseph Cannon would dominate. The Corrections Calendar was terminated in the rules package for the 109th Congress after being created in 1995. The consideration of legislation under suspension of the rules has become a more frequent procedure in House sessions. The House rules allow motions to suspend rules on certain days, including Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 required two budget resolutions annually but was abandoned due to impracticality. House rules are crucial for governance and are accessible to all Members and parties."
