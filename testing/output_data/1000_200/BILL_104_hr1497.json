    "content": "The Act titled \"Insurance Tax Fairness and Small Insurance Company Economic Growth Act of 1995\" revises the limitation on the deduction of policyholder dividends by mutual life insurance companies. The Act \"Insurance Tax Fairness and Small Insurance Company Economic Growth Act of 1995\" amends the deduction limitation for mutual life insurance companies regarding policyholder dividends. The deduction for any taxable year is capped at the lesser of 90% of policyholder dividends or 30% of taxable income without considering policyholder dividends. The limitation for any taxable year for mutual life insurance companies regarding policyholder dividends is set at $35,000,000. Stock life insurance companies are treated as mutual if certain stock ownership criteria are met. Repeal of Section 809 in the tax code removes the policyholders' share of tax-exempt interest calculation for mutual life insurance companies. The tax code amendments remove certain sections and paragraphs related to policyholders' share of tax-exempt interest calculations for mutual life insurance companies, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1994. The tax code changes affect the application of certain sections for mutual life insurance companies, starting after December 31, 1994. Loss carrybacks are limited for taxable years after December 31, 1994, and before January 1, 1995. SEC. 3 exempts small life insurance companies from capitalizing certain policy acquisition expenses starting after December 31, 1994. SEC. 4 expresses Congress's view on the use of increased revenues. The Congress believes that any additional revenues generated from the amendments in this Act should be allocated towards deficit reduction, tax incentives for small life insurance companies, and programs benefiting children's nutrition, education, housing, and family support."
