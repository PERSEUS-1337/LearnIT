Without action, rates would have increased to pre-2003 levels. President Obama proposed keeping lower rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers but increasing rates for higher-income earners. The tax rates were extended until the end of 2012. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended tax rates for higher-income individuals until the end of 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 increased capital gains taxes for married couples with incomes over $480,050 and singles over $453,350 in 2018. The potential revenue gain from raising capital gains taxes is influenced by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. The Obama Administration estimated that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion in revenue. The Obama Administration estimated that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion in revenue by 2019. However, projections from the Congressional Budget Office suggested that the effective capital gains tax rate would have increased from 13.3% in 2008 to 17.9% in 2019, potentially resulting in a revenue difference of $40 billion due to behavioral responses. Some propose applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued to address these responses. Some propose applying mark-to-market rules to tax capital gains as accrued to eliminate realization responses for affected assets. This approach aims to address behavioral responses and increase taxes on realized capital gains. Realization responses in revenue projections were publicly discussed in the 1980s, affecting revenues. The analysis suggests that projections by the Obama Administration and the JCT may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. Concerns arise from taxpayers delaying realizations to avoid taxes, potentially leading to a loss in revenue if the response is significant. Postponing realizations until death can entirely avoid taxes, creating an incentive for delay. The elasticity of capital gains realizations in response to tax changes determines the revenue impact. A higher elasticity value indicates a smaller revenue gain or loss from tax changes. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase can lead to revenue gains. The elasticity of capital gains realizations determines the revenue impact of tax changes. A higher elasticity value results in a smaller revenue gain or loss. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase can lead to revenue gains. Different types of elasticities are discussed in economics literature, including permanent elasticity for long-term responses to tax rate changes. The permanent elasticity measures the longer-term response to a permanent tax rate change, while the short-run elasticity measures the short-term response. The transitory elasticity captures the response to temporary tax changes, which can be influenced by varying incomes and pre-announced tax changes. This discussion focuses on the magnitude and effects of permanent elasticities, with short-term and transitory effects also considered. The discussion focuses on the short-term effects of permanent elasticities, particularly in response to a capital gains tax cut. The short-term response may be limited if there has been recent increases in realizations. The recent increase in realizations, such as the surge in 1986 due to pre-announced capital gains tax changes, suggests limited short-term response to tax cuts. Short-term responses may not apply to unannounced tax increases, as unrealized gains remain unaffected. The transitory response to tax changes, like the surge in realizations in 1986 and 2012 due to tax rate increases, can be temporary and not always tied to legislative changes. This response was more pronounced when capital gains were subject to graduated rates. In the period before 1987, capital gains were subject to graduated rates, leading to a pronounced response in realizations. Elasticities of gains in response to tax rates are important, with the 22% rate being a key reference point in the 1990 debate. Capital gains realizations elasticities are expected to be negative, but are reported in absolute value for clarity. This approach also helps determine a revenue-maximizing tax rate. The report discusses the revenue-maximizing tax rate for capital gains, with elasticities presented in absolute value. The 22% rate is considered a starting point for tax increases, alongside current rates of 0%, 15%, and 20%. Additional taxes include a 3.8% net investment income tax for high-income taxpayers. Estimates show an overall marginal tax rate of around 21.2-21.3% for long-term capital gains. The Department of the Treasury estimates an overall marginal tax rate of 21.2% for long-term capital gains. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed to increase the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28%. Revenue-estimating agencies began to investigate behavioral responses in the late 1980s. In 1990, the issue of revenue cost was crucial due to strict budget constraints. The Administration and JTC used different elasticities to forecast baseline capital gains revenues. Two types of data, aggregate time series and micro-data studies, were used to estimate realizations response to tax rates. Estimates of realizations response varied widely, ranging from 0.3 to almost 4, with implications for revenue. Elasticities ranged from 0.3 to 4, indicating potential revenue gains or losses. Aggregate time series estimates were lower, while individual taxpayer data showed a broader range. The wide range of estimated responses highlighted issues with estimation methods. The range of estimated responses for realizations varied widely, from 0.55 to 3.8, indicating serious issues with estimation methods. Individual data was preferred for estimation due to potential biases with aggregation and difficulty in controlling for changing factors over time. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses was a key challenge when using individual data. The challenge of distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses when using individual data precluded relying on simple cross-section results for estimating revenue. Panel data studies were suggested as a way to separate these elasticities by examining individual tax rates over several years. Panel data studies over several years were used to separate elasticities in individual tax rates. These studies reported smaller but still significant elasticities, influencing the Treasury to choose a larger elasticity. However, the last panel study also showed a very large elasticity, suggesting that transitory effects may not be fully corrected for. Panel studies attempted to control for transitory effects in individual tax rate elasticities, but limitations existed due to the short duration of available panels. Despite efforts to reduce transitory elements, estimates could still be skewed. Ultimately, proposed tax cuts were not implemented at that time. The range of elasticities, especially in time series estimates, varied widely, impacting revenue estimation and evaluation. The range of realizations elasticities for revenue estimation and evaluating capital gains taxes is broad. A significant event in 1986 showed a sharp spike in realizations, raising concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies. The magnitude of transitory realizations responses raised concerns about their reflection in econometric studies. Eleven additional academic studies on realizations response since 1990 are reported in Table 1, along with estimates by CBO, JCT, and Treasury. CBO's caution about its estimates not being for revenue estimation is noted. The studies in Table 1 are arranged by elasticity, with results from a study by Gravelle also included. The study by Gravelle found a limit to the realizations response, with an upper limit of 0.5 for the elasticity, which was lower than estimates from other studies. The study in 1991 found an upper limit of 0.5 for the realizations elasticity, lower than other studies. This implies individuals would sell every asset annually without taxes or transaction costs, but in reality, the elasticity is likely lower due to satisfaction with investments. The study covered data from 1954 to 1989, estimating a 46% realizations to accruals level. The 1991 study estimated a 46% realizations to accruals level and an 18.4% tax rate. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 shows a 48% ratio and a 17.3% tax rate, supporting the limits to realizations elasticities. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study suggests that if all taxes were eliminated, realizations could increase 4.25 times, but accruals suggest only a doubling is possible. The study also corrected the elasticity to 3.2, reinforcing previous observations. The Burman and Randolph study in the 1980s used state tax rates to estimate elasticity, finding a small permanent elasticity and a large transitory one. Auerbach and Siegel replicated the study with similar results. These findings align with the Gravelle estimate of limits, falling below the upper bounds. Siegel replicated the approach with different years, finding consistent results with previous studies. Most subsequent studies included state tax rates. The Auten and Joulfaian study and the Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study had the highest elasticities. Adding state tax rates and a longer panel likely lowered their elasticities compared to earlier studies. However, their estimates may still reflect timing responses rather than permanent ones. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study provided sensitivity analysis with a wide range of estimates based on different specifications, variables, and time periods. Three studies, including CBO's estimate, used aggregate time series data. Gillingham and Greenlees added a few years of data, while Eichner and Sinai added many more years, both controlling for the unusual year 1986. More years added to the time series may affect the results. The Eichner and Sinai study added more years to time series data, showing lower elasticities. The time series results fall within the range of studies from the 1980s. One study falls below Gravelle's upper limit, one is around it, and one is larger. The third study used Australian data. State studies by Bogart and Gentry, and Bakija and Gentry, had results slightly above Gravelle's upper limit, emphasizing the importance of state fixed effects. The Bakija and Gentry study found that controlling for state fixed effects is important, as coefficients increased from 2.91 to 3.88 without them. The elasticities in Table 1 were lower than those in studies from the 1980s, and both JCT and Treasury estimates appear to be high, likely understating the revenue to be gained. The JCT and Treasury estimates of the effects of raising the tax rate on capital gains appear high, likely understating the potential revenue gain. Table 2 compares revenue estimates for a five-percentage-point tax rate increase in 2019, showing a range of reduction in revenue gain as a percentage of static gain. The revenue gain for a five-percentage-point tax rate increase ranges from $31.4 billion to $1 billion, with potential for adopting accrual-based taxation methods. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study is considered the most reliable for estimating revenue impacts. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study is considered the most reliable for estimating revenue impacts, with potential for adopting accrual-based taxation methods. The Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced the largest elasticity, indicating fragility in the estimates. Eichner and Sinai results suggest that time series results should be preferred, with CBO including even more years. The results suggest that revenue gains from increasing the tax rate by five percentage points are likely, with elasticities below 0.5. The revenue gain could be three times higher than projected by the JCT, and up to 45% larger using upper limits. JCT's projections may underestimate revenue gains without a change in their response. The JCT's projections may likely understate revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates, with potential revenue gains up to 45% larger than projected. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated using a semi-log function. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated using a semi-log function, where revenue gains may be larger than projected by up to 45%. The revenue equation is written as R = tAe -bt, and if the elasticity bt is 1, there is no revenue gain. The revenue maximizing tax rate is determined where the coefficient of b equals zero, which is equal to 1/b. For example, if b is 2, the revenue maximizing tax rate is 50%, and if b is 5, the rate is 20%. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as accrual taxation. To calculate taxes using this method, the growth rate g can be determined using the formula g = (S/B) (1/T) -1. The new basis B* can be found to give the same return as accrual taxation by calculating the gain on realization with the new basis.

Studies in the 1980s reported elasticities of realizations, influencing choices in the 1990 debate. Elasticities reported at a 22% tax rate are categorized based on the fundamental approach used in studies. The debate over the evidence reflects challenges in statistical studies relating capital gains realizations to tax rates. Aggregate time series results ranged from 0.3 to 0.9, while estimates based on micro data varied from 0.55 to almost 4. Estimates for elasticities based on micro data ranged from 0.55 to almost 4, reflecting the preference for individual data over aggregate data due to loss of information and potential biases. Challenges in controlling for changes over time could lead to overstated estimates, while the use of individual data sets also presented severe problems for researchers. The use of individual data sets in studies can lead to severe problems due to endogeneity of the explanatory variable, such as the effective capital gains tax rate. Various techniques can be employed to address this issue, including using different tax rates or instrumental variables methods. The endogeneity of explanatory variables, like the capital gains tax rate, poses challenges when using individual data sets. This issue is more pronounced in individual cross-section data compared to aggregate time series data. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses is crucial, especially for high-income individuals who may time realizations to coincide with low tax rates. Attempts to address this issue include averaging data from previous, current, and next years in panel studies. Studies since the 1980s have attempted to address the issue of individuals timing realizations to coincide with low tax rates. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) used a six-year small panel to replicate previous studies and found varying elasticities. The authors conducted a study to replicate previous research on elasticities related to tax rates. They found large elasticities, with some exceeding 5. Results varied over time periods, and some were not statistically significant. Slemrod and Shobe also estimated a regression but obtained statistically insignificant results, suggesting potential transitory effects. This study continues a methodology that has largely been rejected. The study extends previous research on elasticities related to tax rates, using an instrumental variables technique to increase the coefficient and elasticity values. The results are excluded from Table 1 due to being based on a methodology that has largely been rejected. The study suggested using the maximum tax rate as an instrument to increase the coefficient and elasticity values. Differencing the data also produced higher elasticities, but they were not statistically significant. Extending the time period through 1989 showed different estimates, with and without excluding 1986. In 1986, estimates of 3.4 and 3.5 were found using different methods, with corresponding elasticities. The study questions whether to use predicted gains or maximum rate as an instrument. Using the maximum rate as an instrument poses challenges due to changes in the law over time. The study by Burman and Randolph (1994) innovatively separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates. They found a coefficient of 3.4, questioning the use of maximum rate as an instrument due to changes in the law over time. The authors separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates. They estimated an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate and 0.22 at a 22% tax rate. The estimated effect was not statistically significant due to limited variation in tax rates. Other studies also use state tax rates to analyze responses. Bogart and Gentry (1995) relied on state differentials and aggregate gains from 1979 to 1990. The study by Auerbach and Siegel (2000) used panel data from 1985 to 1994 to replicate the results of Burman and Randolph for a different time period. They reported an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate, which is estimated to be around 25%. This suggests an elasticity of 0.25 at a 22% tax rate, similar to the findings of Burman and Randolph. The tax rate is estimated to be around 25%, with a coefficient of 1.126 suggesting an elasticity of 0.25 at a 22% rate. Auerbach and Siegel found a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 compared to 0.33, likely due to the inclusion of the current first dollar rate. The 1.126 coefficient in Table 1 explains the larger elasticity for the tax rate. A separate regression for wealthy and sophisticated taxpayers shows no response. Excluding 1986 and possibly 1997, the coefficient is 2.18, implying an elasticity of 0.48 at a 22% tax rate. The coefficient in a semi-log specification is 2.18, implying an elasticity of 0.48 at a 22% tax rate. Different specifications were tried, including an instrumental variables method using the top marginal tax rate, resulting in an estimate of 3.8 and an elasticity of 0.84. Excluding 1997 led to a coefficient of 5.13 and an elasticity of 1.13. Various specifications with changes in tax rates produced elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46, but many tax rate coefficients were not statistically significant. The analysis in the current chunk uses a longer micro-data panel over 17 years to estimate permanent and transitory effects of tax rate changes. The approach is similar to panel studies from the 1980s, but the estimate is lower, possibly due to time series elements. The 2.28 coefficient reported in Table 1 is more stable compared to other estimates with tax rate changes. Auten and Joulfaian (2004) do not use state tax variation to identify permanent effects, and their estimate likely contains transitory elements. The current study estimates a lower elasticity compared to short panels from the 1980s, possibly due to time series elements. The elasticity is found to be 0.72 at a 20% tax rate and 0.79 at a 22% tax rate. Evans (2009) conducted a cross-section regression study with elasticities typically between 2 and 5, but the findings are limited by the shortcomings of cross-section studies. Bakija and Gentry (2014) results are not reflected in Table 1. The study by Bakija and Gentry (2014) uses a 50-year panel of state data with state- and time-fixed effects to analyze the effects of changing tax rates. Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) also use panel methods in their study, showing significant effects when omitting state-fixed effects and year-fixed effects. The study by Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) uses standard panel methods with a 10-year panel and year-fixed effects to analyze elasticities. The study by Minas, Lim, and Evans (2018) is an aggregate time series study using Australian data from 1988 to 2015, including controls for GDP, inflation, and the stock market index.
