    "content": "The \"Prescribe A Book Act\" adds a new section to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, focusing on Pediatric Early Literacy Programs and defining key terms. The \"Prescribe A Book Act\" defines an eligible entity as a nonprofit organization with demonstrated effectiveness in providing peer-to-peer training on literacy promotion to healthcare providers, delivering training through various medical education settings, offering technical assistance to healthcare facilities, and creating opportunities for local healthcare. The \"Prescribe A Book Act\" aims to implement a Pediatric Early Literacy Program in healthcare facilities by offering book discounts and integrating research-based training for healthcare providers. The program focuses on early language and literacy promotion through a 3-part model. The Pediatric Early Literacy Program involves nurses promoting reading aloud to children, healthcare providers giving books to children aged 6 months to 5 years, and volunteers reading to children in waiting areas. The Pediatric Early Literacy Program involves healthcare facilities promoting reading aloud to children, demonstrating effectiveness in altering parent behavior and improving language skills in young children, and receiving endorsements from medical associations. The Secretary can award grants to eligible entities for Pediatric Early Literacy Programs. Eligible entities must submit an application and provide matching funds equal to at least 50% of the grant received. Grant funds can be used for program implementation. An eligible entity receiving a grant for a Pediatric Early Literacy Program must enter into contracts with private nonprofit organizations or public agencies, provide training and technical assistance, and include terms determined by the Secretary for program effectiveness. Contractors are selected based on prioritizing at-risk individuals. The contractor for the Pediatric Early Literacy Program must prioritize serving at-risk children, including those from low-income families, without medical insurance, enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, living in rural areas, migrant children, and those with limited library access. The Secretary must ensure that eligible entities have arrangements with book publishers or distributors to obtain books at favorable discounts. Eligible entities receiving grants must report annually on program effectiveness. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is amended to include a new subpart for pediatric early literacy programs, outlining definitions, program authorization, applications, matching requirements, use of grant funds, restrictions on payments, and reporting requirements. Eligible entities must have arrangements with book publishers for discounts and report annually on program effectiveness."
