    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Science Education Incentive Act of 2005\". The Congress emphasizes the importance of maintaining the US's position in science and technology for advancing human understanding and improving lives. Over half of the US economic growth is attributed to research and development in science and technology. The United States emphasizes the significance of science and technology for economic growth and human advancement. Education is crucial for developing intellectual capital, including scientists and engineers. The United States requires intellectual capital in the form of scientists, engineers, technologically proficient workers, and scientifically literate voters and consumers to drive economic growth and make informed decisions about public policy. However, student performance in math and science education falls short compared to other countries, highlighting the need for improvement in K-12 education. The United States needs to improve math and science education to produce a skilled workforce and informed citizens. New teaching methods, better curricula, teacher training, parental involvement, and hands-on learning are essential for students to understand science as a process of inquiry. To successfully tap into children's innate curiosity, science education must start early and continue throughout school. High-quality teachers are crucial in connecting students with content, requiring incentives to stay in the classroom and improve. Training teachers is essential for superior results. Training teachers is essential for superior results in the classroom. Teachers need to be knowledgeable about their content area, curriculum, up-to-date research in teaching and learning, and techniques to connect with students. A new section, SEC. 36, has been added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a refundable credit for undergraduate tuition paid by certain teachers. The new section SEC. 36 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows eligible teachers to claim a credit of 10% of qualified undergraduate tuition paid, up to $1,000. Teachers in high-needs school districts can claim up to $1,500 in the first 5 years.

For eligible teachers, the credit is allowed for 10 years, and an eligible teacher is defined as a full-time teacher in grades kindergarten through 12th grade who primarily teaches math, science, engineering, or technology courses. Teachers eligible for the tax credit must teach math, science, engineering, or technology in grades K-12, hold a relevant degree, and be highly qualified. Administrative personnel have a special rule. The tax credit for teachers under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 applies to administrative personnel if their functions primarily relate to teaching courses in math, science, engineering, or technology. Qualified undergraduate tuition refers to higher education expenses for enrollment at an institution of higher education. The text discusses the definition of an institution of higher education and the regulations that the Secretary shall prescribe to carry out the purposes of the section. Conforming amendments are also mentioned in relation to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The text includes amendments related to tuition for undergraduate education of certain teachers and overpayments of tax. It also introduces credits for contributions benefiting STEM education at the elementary and secondary school level in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Effective dates for these amendments are specified. Contributions benefiting STEM education at the elementary and secondary school level are introduced in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The section introduces a tax credit for STEM contributions at the elementary and secondary school level. Qualified STEM contributions include school contributions, teacher externship expenses, and teacher training expenses. STEM school contributions consist of property and service contributions. The tax credit for STEM contributions at elementary and secondary schools includes STEM property contributions, which are deductions for charitable contributions of STEM inventory property to eligible schools within the United States or defense dependents' education system for educational purposes in grades K-12.

The deduction amount is determined as if the limitation under section 170(e)(3)(B) applied to all STEM inventory property. The term 'STEM service contributions' refers to payments for STEM services provided in the US or defense dependents' education system for students at specific schools. 'STEM inventory property' includes property contributed to schools that meet certain criteria. The term 'STEM services' and 'STEM inventory property' refer to contributions needed by schools for education in STEM subjects for grades K-12. STEM services include teaching courses in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The term 'STEM teacher externship expenses' refers to amounts paid for a program involving eligible STEM teachers, including stipends. This program aims to enhance STEM education in schools. The STEM externship program provides training for eligible STEM teachers in grades K-12 to enhance their teaching skills in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Eligible teachers receive a stipend while participating in the program. The STEM teacher training program is for K-12 teachers in the US or on a US military base, teaching science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. STEM teacher training expenses cover costs for eligible teachers in a training program provided by their school. The STEM teacher training program is for K-12 teachers in the US or on a US military base, covering costs for eligible teachers in a training program provided by their school.
