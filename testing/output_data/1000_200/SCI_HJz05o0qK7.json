    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. Evaluating compositionality in these representations is important, but the machine learning literature lacks tools for this. A procedure is described to measure compositionality by approximating the true representation-producing model with a model that composes inferred primitives. This method is used to characterize compositional structure in various settings. The procedure described measures compositionality in representations by approximating the true model with inferred primitives. It explores the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The success of modern representation learning techniques has sparked interest in understanding the structure of learned representations, particularly compositionality. The success of modern representation learning techniques has sparked interest in understanding the structure of learned representations, particularly compositionality. Many human-designed representation systems exhibit compositionality, the ability to represent complex concepts by combining simple parts. Machine learning approaches often utilize human-designed compositional analyses, but it is also important to consider how compositionality arises in learning problems where it is not built in from the start. This raises questions about the compositional nature of learned encoding schemes for communication tasks. The current work aims to provide a formal and quantitative technique for evaluating the compositional structure in learned representations, focusing on an oracle setting where the structure of model inputs is known. This addresses the need for a standardized approach in analyzing encoding schemes for communication tasks. The work focuses on evaluating the compositional structure in learned representations in an oracle setting. It introduces a formal framework and a metric called TRE to measure compositionality in (input, representation) pairs. The goal is to optimize primitive meaning representations to approximate the true model's compositional structure.

The text discusses the importance of compositionality in language understanding and the process of identifying primitive representations. It suggests measuring compositionality by searching for representations that allow a compositional model to approximate the true predictor closely. The evaluation procedure is defined as Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE). The evaluation procedure is defined as Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE), which measures how well a compositional model approximates the true predictor by optimizing over parts. Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE) optimizes over parts to measure how well a compositional model matches the true predictor. The choice of composition function is left to the evaluator, with caution needed to avoid trivial solutions. If D is injective, there is always a composition function that achieves TRE = 0. If D is injective, a unique derivation is assigned to every x \u2208 X, ensuring a composition function that achieves TRE = 0. Implementation details involve using gradient descent for models with continuous \u0398 and differentiable \u03b4 and * , and a continuous relaxation for discrete \u0398. The paper discusses the use of gradient descent for models with continuous \u0398 and differentiable \u03b4 and * to solve optimization problems. It also introduces an SGD-based TRE solver and mentions the application of task-specific optimizers for different problems. The remainder of the paper explores the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics in machine learning, focusing on the information bottleneck theory proposed by BID45. The paper explores the compression phase in machine learning, where mutual information decreases between inputs and their representations. It investigates how this phase isolates decision-relevant attributes and discards irrelevant information. The model predicts classifiers in a meta-learning framework by analyzing compositional visual concepts. The model is trained to minimize logistic loss between logits and ground-truth labels. The model computes a classifier using \u03b8 as representation and is trained to minimize logistic loss. Visual concepts used are single attributes or conjunctions of attributes like background color and digit identity. The training dataset consists of 9000 image triplets with a validation accuracy of 75.2% on average. The study explores the relationship between the information bottleneck and compositionality by comparing TRE(X) to the mutual information I(\u03b8; x) between representations and inputs during training. Both TRE(X) and I(\u03b8; X) are initially low but increase over time, indicating a higher degree of compositionality. The study compares the information bottleneck and compositionality by analyzing the relationship between mutual information and reconstruction error during training. Both metrics start low and increase over time, suggesting a discovery of compositional representations.

It uses reconstruction error to differentiate between compositional and non-compositional bigrams, comparing them to human judgments. Results show an inverse correlation between TRE and human ratings of compositionality. Top compositional collocations include application form, polo shirt, and research project, while least compositional words are fine line, lip service, and nest egg. The next section aims to provide a formal analysis. The next section discusses the relationship between TRE and another perspective on representation analysis, focusing on topographic similarity and derivational similarity. It aims to clarify the connection between the two evaluations by introducing a notion of topographic similarity and arguing that a learned representation captures relevant domain structure if distances between learned representations are correlated with distances between their associated derivations. This provides weak evidence for compositionality. The relationship between derivational similarity and edit distance is clarified by equipping derivations with a tree edit distance function. The tree edit distance serves as an upper bound on the distance between representations, indicating that representations cannot be much farther apart than the derivations producing them. The relationship between derivational similarity and edit distance is clarified by equipping derivations with a tree edit distance function, which serves as an upper bound on the distance between representations. This demonstrates that compositionality imposes constraints on the inferences drawn from similarity judgments between representations. In this section, the focus is on evaluating the relationship between compositionality and generalization through empirical training of agents using compositional communication protocols. A speaker model describes target objects to a listener model, who reconstructs them for rewards. The experiment centers on a reference game with two trained policies: a speaker and a listener observing target objects represented with feature vectors. The experiment involves training two policies, a speaker, and a listener, in a reference game using a discrete communication protocol. The speaker describes target objects with a message to the listener, who reconstructs them by predicting attribute sets. Both models receive rewards for correct predictions. The communication protocol is discrete, and the policies are jointly trained using a policy gradient objective. The target referents consist of two objects, each with two attributes, forming a compositional structure. The target referent consists of two objects with two attributes each. A subset of object pairs is held out during training to evaluate generalization. Representations are fixed-length discrete codes, and derivations have a more complex semantics. Agent messages are represented as one-hot vectors, with the error function based on the 1 distance between vectors. The composition function involves one-hot vectors and free composition parameters. Compositional languages show lower absolute performance, even in successful training runs. Two multiagent training runs result in different languages. The study involves training speaker-listener pairs with random initial parameters to measure their performance on training and test sets. The results suggest a nuanced relationship between compositionality and generalization. The study involves training speaker-listener pairs with random initial parameters to measure their performance on training and test sets. Results suggest a nuanced relationship between compositionality and generalization, with TRE significantly correlated with generalization error and absolute model reward. \"Compositional\" languages often result from poor communication strategies, but low TRE is not a necessary condition for good generalization. The study explores the correlation between TRE and generalization error in representation learning. Low TRE is not always required for good generalization, as shown by languages achieving good performance at both low and high levels of compositionality. TRE evaluates compositional structure by inferring primitive meaning representations and measuring the quality of their composition. This analysis has been applied to various representation learning problems, linking compositionality to learning dynamics, linguistic compositionality, similarity, and generalization. The study explores the correlation between TRE and generalization error in representation learning, linking compositionality to learning dynamics, linguistic compositionality, similarity, and generalization. Many questions remain open in representation learning, including how to generalize TRE without oracle derivations and understanding the impact of data distributions and loss functions on compositional representations. Code and data for experiments are available at https://github.com/jacobandreas/tre. The author trained a model for few-shot classification using a CNN with specific layers and parameters. Training was done using ADAM with a learning rate of .001 and a batch size of 128. Word embeddings were trained on a dataset from the NYT section of Gigaword to acquire bigram representations. The code and data for all experiments are available at https://github.com/jacobandreas/tre. To acquire bigram representations, the dataset is pre-processed so that each bigram occurrence is treated as a single word. The encoder and decoder RNNs use gated recurrent units with embeddings and hidden states of size 256. The discrete vocabulary size is 16, and the maximum message length is 4. Training employs a policy gradient objective with ADAM optimization, a learning rate of .001, and a batch size of 256 for 500 steps. Greedy decoding is used for evaluation and performance analysis. The size of a derivation is defined by DISPLAYFORM0. The tree edit distance between derivations is defined by taking \u03b8 k = \u03b8 = 0 and induction on |d| in Condition 3."
