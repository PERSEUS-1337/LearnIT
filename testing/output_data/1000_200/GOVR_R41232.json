    "content": "On July 29, 2010, the President signed H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212, which includes $59.2 billion in spending for war costs, disaster assistance, Haiti relief, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with the House receding from an amended version. The enacted version provides $58.8 billion in new budget authority after rescissions. The House version of H.R. 4899 included $65.1 billion in new budget authority, with $22.1 billion more in domestic spending offset by $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings over 10 years. Rescissions cancel unobligated budget authority, while mandatory savings reduce new direct spending. Additionally, the House debated a resolution to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days of adoption. The House debated a resolution proposed by Representatives Kucinich and Paul to withdraw all U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days or by December 31, 2010. The resolution was defeated by a vote of 38 to 372. The Senate disagreed with the House version of the bill, which included additional funding for various purposes, leading to a failed cloture vote and inability to limit debate. The House dropped support for a bill adding $22.5 billion for various purposes and adopted the Senate version due to concerns of funding shortages in the Defense Department. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $59.2 billion for war funding, Haiti relief, foreign aid, and new benefits for Vietnam veterans. The House and Senate debated on H.R. 4899, focusing on additional domestic spending proposals and the new war policy in Afghanistan. The Senate version included $59.2 billion for wars, Haiti relief, FEMA, and VA benefits, excluding funds for court cases. Representative David Obey introduced the Senate version for House consideration on July 27, 2010. In the original March 24, 2010 version of the FY2010 Supplemental bill, funding was allocated for war, Pell fund shortfalls, border security, and other emergencies. Representative Obey opposed the bill due to lack of support from Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the absence of a proposed House amendment for Congress to vote on the war policy. Representative Obey opposed the FY2010 Supplemental bill due to lack of support from Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the absence of a proposed House amendment for Congress to vote on the war policy. Despite this, Representative Lewis praised the Senate for rejecting nonemergency spending and urged support for the bill to aid troops and provide disaster assistance. Other members supported aspects such as DOD's war funding and disability benefits for Vietnam veterans. Representative Skelton endorsed the bill, while Representative McGovern raised concerns about corruption in the Afghan government. Chair of the House Armed Services Committee supported the bill, while concerns were raised about corruption in the Afghan government and the role of Pakistani intelligence services. Funding for the war was a concern, with the House due to go on recess. The House voted on a resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days. The House voted on a resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days or by December 31, 2010. Despite debates on troop presence, aid effectiveness, and funding, the resolution was defeated. The final version of H.R. 4899 appropriated $59.2 billion, $5.0 billion below the request. The final version of H.R. 4899 appropriates $59.2 billion in spending, $5.0 billion below the request. Key funding allocations include $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Assistance Fund, $13.4 billion for Vietnam veterans affected by Agent Orange, $30.8 billion for Department of Defense war-related funding, $2.1 billion for DOD's non-war request, and $2.9 billion for Haiti. Notable differences from the Administration's request include reduced funding for war-related foreign aid and zero funding for settling court cases. In the final version of H.R. 4899, Congress allocated $59.2 billion in spending, which is $5.0 billion below the requested amount. Key funding allocations include $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Assistance Fund, $13.4 billion for Vietnam veterans affected by Agent Orange, $30.8 billion for Department of Defense war-related funding, $2.1 billion for DOD's non-war request, and $2.9 billion for Haiti. Congress decreased funding for war-related foreign aid and did not provide funding to settle court cases as requested by the Administration. The final version of H.R. 4899, passed by the House on July 27, 2010, did not include $600 million for border security and $129 million for patent backlogs. Separate bills were passed for this funding on July 28, 2010. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212, allocated $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212, allocated $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. This includes $169.9 billion for the Afghan and Iraq wars, with $104.4 billion for the Afghan war and $65.5 billion for the Iraq war. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212, allocated $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 through various actions between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010, including passing H.R. 4899 with funding for disaster relief, war-related foreign assistance, and Haiti relief. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 on May 27, 2010, with $59.2 billion in spending for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, and Haiti reconstruction. The House later adopted the Senate's version with additional funds for education and court cases, totaling $81.8 billion in spending. The Senate disagreed with the House's amended version on July 22, 2010. The Senate disagreed with the House's amended version of H.R. 4899 on July 22, 2010. The House then adopted the Senate's version on July 27, 2010, with additional funds for education and court cases, totaling $81.8 billion in spending. The President signed the bill into law on July 29, 2010, allocating $64.4 billion in supplemental funding for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, Haiti reconstruction, border security, and court cases for American Indians and black farmers. The FY2010 supplemental requests included $5.1 billion for disaster relief, $33.0 billion for Defense Department, $4.5 billion for foreign assistance, $2.8 billion for Haiti reconstruction, $13.4 billion for Agent Orange compensation, $243 million for Deepwater Horizon oil spill, $600 million for border security, and $3.4 billion to settle land trust claims of American Indians and $1.2 billion for discrimination claims of black farmers. The Pigford II case settled discrimination claims of 70,000 black farmers for $1.2 billion. H.R. 4899 had different versions with varying amounts of rescissions and mandatory savings to offset spending. The House bill included $600 million in offsets, the Senate version had $380 million, and the amended House bill included $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings. In the amended version of H.R. 4899, $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings were included to offset the proposed spending of $81.8 billion. Most of the discretionary spending in the final bill was designated as emergency, exempting it from budget caps. The President's supplemental request includes $64.4 billion in discretionary and mandatory spending. Emergency supplemental appropriations are not subject to annual caps, which some view as undermining budgetary discipline. Emergency supplemental appropriations are seen as undermining budgetary discipline as they are not subject to annual caps on discretionary spending. Congress decides what qualifies as emergency spending, which may receive less scrutiny than regular appropriations. Concerns exist about the impact of additional spending on the deficit. Congress debates whether to increase spending above the already appropriated levels for the year. Congress may debate increasing spending above already appropriated levels for the year and must decide whether to offset the additional spending by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. Budget rules, such as the FY2010 budget resolution and PAYGO Act of 2010, constrain Congress's decisions on supplemental appropriations. Under budget rules like the PAYGO Act of 2010, Congress could exempt spending by designating it as an emergency or for overseas deployments. Waivers could also be used to bypass points of order during consideration of supplemental appropriations. Emergency designations may be subject to a point of order, which can be waived in both houses with specific procedures. The House and Senate have special rules for approving supplemental funding, with a three-fifths vote required in the Senate. Various agencies and plaintiffs have cited deadlines for the funding, with some flexibility in dates. Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities. Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities due to concerns about insufficient funding for Federal response operations within two weeks. The House and Senate passed a bill to raise the annual cap on funds to address this issue. The House and Senate passed S. 3473, P.L. 111-191, on June 9 and June 20, 2010, raising the annual cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1 billion specifically for the Deepwater Horizon Spill. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding in FY2010. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding in FY2010. Approximately 30,000 troops were deploying to Afghanistan by Memorial Day, with funding available until the end of June or beginning of July. Secretary of Defense Gates expressed concern about the lack of progress on the supplemental funding and urged passage by the July 4 recess. Gates expressed concern about the lack of progress on supplemental funding, urging passage by July 4 to avoid running out of money for Navy and Marine Corps in July. If not passed, disruptions in programs could occur, leading to furloughing civilians and unpaid military in August. Army and Marine Corps could run out of funding in August, with potential furloughs and disruptions. Geoff Morrell warned that the Army and Marine Corps could face funding shortages by August. Under Secretary of the Army, Joseph Westphal, testified that the Army had funds until mid-August, pending reprogramming approval. The latest DOD Cost of War report showed available funds in War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts for each service. The Army and Marine Corps could rely on these funds through August, with potential earlier depletion if spending increased rapidly. The services could rely on already appropriated war bridge funds through August, or sooner if spending increased. Base budget funding is used to temporarily finance war funding, allowing the services to last through the end of July and into August. FEMA limited fund releases for claims to make the Disaster Relief Fund last longer. In May 2010, FEMA estimated the Disaster Relief Fund would become insolvent by the end of June with average monthly spending of $350 million. However, as of June 7, 2010, FEMA had a balance of $952 million in the DRF, which could last through August 2010 if spending continued at the normal rate. FEMA limited fund releases for claims to ensure funds met the most urgent needs. FEMA had a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects awaiting payment for infrastructure and mitigation projects, which did not meet the immediate needs criteria. The State Department needed funding replenishment by June 1, 2010, to respond to future humanitarian crises. Congress did not enact the $1.15 billion appropriation by mid-April 2010 for the Pigford II court case to compensate black farmers. The settlement for black farmers may not be voided despite the option to do so, as it is a priority for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the White House. The deadline for Congress to approve the Cobell suit settlement is August 6, 2010, with uncertainty on further extensions. Congress raised concerns on evaluating spending on the Afghan War and ensuring effective use of foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) due to anticipated fund depletion for disaster needs and unanticipated claims. FEMA stated that DRF spending averages $350 million monthly with a current balance of $600 million. FEMA projected the Disaster Relief Fund would run out in May or June 2010, prompting measures to reduce expenditures and delay payments for certain projects. Congress questioned why FEMA had not requested disaster relief funds earlier. Congress raised questions about FEMA's delayed request for disaster relief funds, delays in congressional action, and higher spending levels in recent years. The Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for unrealistic budgeting practices and requested $2.0 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund in FY2010, but Congress only provided $1.6 billion. The Obama Administration requested $1.9 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund in FY2011, citing the need for additional funding due to a high number of disasters in recent years. This request follows Congress providing $1.6 billion in FY2010, which was $400 million below the Administration's request. Recovery from Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008 may require continued higher funding levels for the next five years or longer. Continued funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) may be necessary to address the aftermath of Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008, with recovery potentially taking five years or more. Some argue for increased funding to prevent the need for supplemental funding, while others believe disasters are unpredictable emergencies. FEMA's request for DRF replenishment lacks detailed justification, with only one example provided - a $475 million arbitration ruling for Charity Hospital in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina. FEMA's request for additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) lacks detailed justification, with only one example provided - a $475 million arbitration ruling for Charity Hospital in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $5.1 billion for the DRF, with $5 million transferred to the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General. Additionally, $396 million in other disaster relief funding was added for various disasters across the country. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness of information provided by OMB regarding disaster relief funding requirements. The FY2011 request is expected to be $1-2 billion short for previous disasters, including Hurricane Katrina. H.R. 4899 included $396 million for recent floods, fishery disasters, tornado damages, and Gulf Coast hurricane recovery projects. Additionally, $100 million was allocated to Housing and Urban Development for long-term recovery and infrastructure repair. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated funding for disaster-relief activities in various agencies, including $100 million for community development funds to Housing and Urban Development, $227 million to Army Corps of Engineers for infrastructure repair and recovery projects, $49 million to Commerce Department for economic development assistance, and $18 million to Agriculture Department for emergency forest restoration. FEMA was directed to create an interagency taskforce to track and address recovery efforts. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated funding for disaster-relief activities in various agencies, including creating an interagency taskforce to track and address recovery efforts related to FEMA's updates of flood maps. The DOD and State Department/USAID FY2010 supplemental requests provide funding primarily for deploying additional troops to Afghanistan and economic assistance to support military operations. The Obama Administration requested a supplemental appropriation of $33 billion for FY2010 to deploy additional troops to Afghanistan. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. The troops aim to improve security, target the insurgency, secure key areas, and train Afghan forces to transfer responsibility by July 2011. As of June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remaining 4,000 expected by September 2010. This would triple the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to 98,000 by fall. By September 2010, 98,000 troops would be deployed in Afghanistan, tripling the number from October 2008. Troop levels increased under President Bush and Obama, with a total of 98,000 troops expected by fall 2010. NATO allies also increased troop levels in response to U.S. requests. The FY2011 budget adds 4,000 support troops in Afghanistan, bringing the total number of foreign troops to about 148,000 by fall. The Defense Department requested $33 billion for additional troops in Afghanistan, training Iraq Security Forces, and fuel costs. Total DOD war spending in FY2010 rises to $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. The FY2010 Supplemental increased total DOD appropriations for the Afghan War to $314.1 billion, with a potential rise to $427.7 billion if the FY2011 request is approved. In comparison, the total enacted for Iraq is now $706.2 billion, potentially increasing to $752 billion with the pending FY2011 request. These figures exclude war funding for State/USAID and VA Medical. President Obama's new strategy in Afghanistan includes a timeline for beginning the transfer of forces out of the country in July 2011, following a review in December 2010. However, Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen have indicated that the drawdown in July 2011 may be minor, depending on conditions on the ground. Gates mentioned that the process could take several years. In July 2010, the transition in Afghanistan begins, not the departure, based on conditions on the ground. Secretary Gates and General Petraeus suggest a multi-year process. Concerns raised in Congress about the timing and length of the campaign, with debates on increasing congressional involvement in decision-making. Amendments to cut off funding for Afghanistan were rejected. Amendments to cut off funding for Afghanistan were proposed but ultimately defeated in Congress. Concerns about the U.S. military commitment in Afghanistan have been raised, with debates on the timing and length of the campaign. Concerns have been raised about the U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, particularly regarding the re-taking of Marjah and the upcoming campaign for Kandahar. The Department of Defense requested $30 billion for Afghanistan operations, including funds for military personnel, force protection, and training Afghan security forces. The Department of Defense requested $30 billion for Afghanistan operations, including funds for military personnel, force protection, training Afghan security forces, higher fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military and national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers estimate the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops at $1 million per troop, but this average does not account for the various activities and programs involved. The Department of Defense requested $30 billion for Afghanistan operations, including funds for military personnel, force protection, training Afghan security forces, higher fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military and national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). DOD developed functional categories for different activities, with funding increasing at different rates. DOD estimates differ from CBO's estimates, and spending may increase substantially later in the year. The DOD estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in FY2010 reflect a per troop cost of $875,000, which is higher than CBO's estimate of $467,000. Both DOD and CBO assume the same average monthly troop strength, with DOD attributing the high costs to setting up facilities in southern Afghanistan where troop presence is limited. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act transferred $5 billion of DOD's Operation and Maintenance funding to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund due to concerns about accurate budgeting for the Afghan and Iraq wars. DOD's estimates for operational costs in FY2010 may be high, as only 22% of the requested amount was obligated in the first five months. The DOD's estimates for operational costs in FY2010 may be high, with only 22% of the requested amount obligated in the first five months. To use all funds, monthly spending would need to double in the next seven months. DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund, bringing total funding to $9.2 billion. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund, bringing total ASFF funding to $9.2 billion, a 63% increase. Concerns were raised about the need for all the additional funds, the achievability of DOD's plan, oversight issues, and training problems. The plan aims to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011, with the Afghan Army growing to 171,000 and the Afghan Police to 134,000 by October 2011. NATO partners endorsed these increases in January 2010. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army to exceed 134,000 soldiers, improve pay, infrastructure, and equipment. Congress has appropriated $25.5 billion for Afghan Security Forces, with pending requests totaling $14.2 billion, bringing the total to $39.8 billion through FY2011. DOD has not provided an estimate of the ultimate cost or years needed to support Afghan Security forces. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but this goal has not been endorsed by the Obama Administration. Training of Afghan Security forces is managed by DOD and the State Department, with U.S. military personnel, NATO teams, and private contractors involved. Issues include high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, and absenteeism. Training for Afghan security forces faces numerous challenges, including attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, absenteeism, logistical limitations, illiteracy, corruption, and attacks by insurgents. Coordination issues between DOD, State Department, and NATO training efforts, problems with private contractors, and shortages of personnel to manage contracts further complicate the training process. The challenges in training Afghan security forces include poor performance, unauthorized firearm use, inadequate vetting, and shortages of contractor personnel. Despite additional trainers sent by DOD and requests for more from NATO allies, there are still reported shortages. Senator Levin expressed concerns about a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police, as noted in DOD's April 1, 2010 report. Members may want to know how many trainers are needed to meet the higher targets funded in the FY2010 supplemental request. The current ramp-up in training Afghan security forces faces challenges such as shortages of trainers and contractor personnel. Shortfalls in personnel could hinder the ramp-up, affecting DOD's funding. A sustained bid-protest may have delayed the plan to speed up training for Afghan police, but Congress allowed reliance on a previously awarded contract. The DOD faced challenges in providing Afghan police training due to shortages of trainers and contractor personnel. Despite initial delays, Congress allowed reliance on a previously awarded contract, ensuring continued funding availability. Some Members question the need for emergency war supplementals as wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue. DOD's FY2010 request was enacted in the DOD Appropriations Act. Debate surrounds the emergency designation for the supplemental request, with Congress having the authority to decide. Some of DOD's request, including $1 billion for training in the Iraqi Security Forces Fund (ISFF), $2 billion to offset fuel increases, and $1.7 billion for reset or replacement of war-worn equipment, may not be directly related to new deployments and could be part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation request. Congress is becoming less willing to fund Iraqi security forces, especially with the turnover of security responsibility to the Iraqi government and the rise in oil prices. The emergency designation of these funds could be challenged. Some argue that providing $2 billion for higher fuel costs in DOD's base budget could be covered internally. DOD typically uses cash reserves or transfers funds from less urgent needs to cover unexpected fuel price increases. However, DOD may argue that these actions would be challenging, necessitating an infusion of budget authority. Another request is $1.7 billion for equipment reset to replace war-worn equipment, which some believe is not directly tied to new deployments. The impact of additional combat operations on equipment in Afghanistan is expected to be gradual due to the phased-in deployment of troops. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request, including adjustments for excess funding, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. The impact of additional combat operations on equipment in Afghanistan is expected to be gradual due to the phased-in deployment of troops. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request, including adjustments for excess funding, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included adjustments such as a $436 million decrease to operation and maintenance, a $400 million cut rejecting a DOD proposal, and a $512 million increase to procurement accounts for additional combat losses. Both the House and Senate versions approved the amounts requested to train Afghan and Iraq security forces. The final version of the bill approved the requested amounts for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. It also included a requirement for intelligence committees to receive threat assessments from Guantanamo detainees. However, it removed a provision for $300 million for base closure transportation improvements. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, including $521 million for Afghanistan and $8 million for Air Force family housing utility bills. This would double the FY2009 level for war-related construction, raising questions about DOD's facility support for temporary stationing. The FY2010 total for war-related construction would reach $1.9 billion, double the FY2009 level, prompting concerns about the purpose of DOD's facilities in Afghanistan. Congress allowed spending for a \"long-term presence\" but not for \"permanent stationing\" of troops. The $521 million request aims to enhance infrastructure in Afghanistan to accommodate 30,000 additional U.S. troops, focusing on airfield capacity for increased airlift and combat operations. The request for $521 million aims to support the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops in Afghanistan by expanding airfield capacity, increasing logistics capacity, and providing necessary infrastructure. Army projects are focused in southern provinces for new military operations, while Air Force construction is planned in various provinces to support airlift and special operations forces. Army construction includes waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, and utilities. The construction projects in Afghanistan include infrastructure for airlift and special operations forces, such as waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, and utilities. Army projects are focused in southern provinces, while Air Force construction is planned in various provinces to support military operations. The construction projects in Afghanistan include infrastructure for airlift and special operations forces, such as waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, and utilities. Congress has debated whether military construction in Afghanistan signifies a long-term U.S. troop commitment, with legislation aimed at preventing the establishment of permanent bases in the country. Congress banned the use of defense funds for establishing permanent military installations in Afghanistan, with an exception allowing the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for projects supporting a \"long-term presence.\" The lack of a clear definition for permanency raises questions about the nature of military construction projects in the country. The use of Operation & Maintenance funds for military construction in Afghanistan to support a \"long-term presence\" is permitted by P.L. 111-84, reversing previous restrictions on funding for \"urgent ... temporary\" facilities. The distinction between projects for permanent stationing of troops and long-term presence is unclear, with some projects potentially serving both purposes. Congress has denied funds for projects seen as indicating a permanent presence without a comprehensive plan for troop stationing. In response to changing military needs in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been granted flexibility to use Operation & Maintenance funds for urgent military operational requirements since FY2004. Congress renewed this authority annually until FY2009, capping the amount between $100 million and $200 million. DOD anticipates a continued U.S. military presence in Afghanistan for several years, even after military operations. DOD planners anticipate a long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, even after military operations end. Congress authorized the use of $200 million in O&M funds for projects in U.S. Central Command and an additional $300 million for construction in Afghanistan to meet urgent military requirements. The FY2010 NDAA extended the authority to use O&M funding for military construction, increasing the amount spent on military construction significantly. In FY2009, DOD allocated $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan, adding to the $900 million appropriated, totaling $1.4 billion. This amount nearly matched the total spent on construction in Afghanistan from FY2003 to FY2008. DOD proposed using O&M funds for minor construction in support of contingency operations until October 1, 2012. The DOD submitted a legislative proposal to use O&M funds for minor construction in Afghanistan until October 1, 2012. Funding for military construction in Afghanistan could increase if the FY2011 proposal is approved by Congress. Significant investments have been made in key bases, including Bagram Air Base, Kandahar Air Base, and Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. DOD has also requested new language for the FY2011 DOD authorization to allow the use of O&M funds. The DOD has requested $299 million for military construction projects in Afghanistan, with a total of $894 million if approved. The proposal includes new language allowing the use of O&M funds for unspecified minor construction projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. This would create a temporary two-year authority with no limit on the total amount of O&M funds that could be used. The DOD proposed using O&M funds for military construction projects in Afghanistan without a set limit on the total amount that could be spent. Quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees would be done after-the-fact within 60 days. Questions were raised about the urgency of the $521 million supplemental request given the available $2.1 billion in unobligated budget authority from previous acts. In FY2009, DOD obligated about $607 million for military construction projects in Afghanistan. To obligate all of the $2.1 billion in funds available by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase its monthly average obligations six-fold to $300 million. $700 million must be obligated by September 30, 2010, and another $1.4 billion by September 30, 2011. To spend the remaining $1.4 billion for FY2010 projects, DOD would need to increase monthly obligations to $116 million, more than four times the current rate. With additional supplemental funds, obligations would have to triple from the FY2009 rate to $150 million a month. The FY2010 supplemental request could be considered part of DOD's FY2011 war request. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allocated $657 million for military construction/family housing, including $649 million for war-related construction in Afghanistan and $8 million for non war-related Air Force expenses. The final military construction funding was $127.5 million above the request to accelerate projects. The Senate emphasized the need for contingency construction requirements to be included in the budget request if known at the time. The final version of the bill allocated $657 million for military construction/family housing, with $649 million for war-related construction in Afghanistan and $8 million for non war-related Air Force expenses. The Senate emphasized the need for contingency construction requirements to be included in the budget request if known at the time. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request addressed specific foreign economic assistance and related civilian operational requirements of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request addressed specific foreign economic assistance and civilian operational requirements for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The total international affairs budget request for these war-related programs was $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion allocated for State Department personnel and infrastructure, and $2.6 billion for foreign aid programs. The FY2010 Supplemental request aimed to provide personnel and infrastructure for diplomatic and assistance programs, including foreign aid amounting to $2.6 billion. The Administration requested funding for specific needs in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, leading to a 55% increase in the FY2010 appropriation to about $9.2 billion. The FY2010 supplemental funding for international affairs and war-related foreign aid increased by 55% to $9.2 billion, with $3.7 billion allocated for diplomatic operations. The Administration's request for Afghanistan focused on civilian programs in governance and economic growth, in conjunction with military efforts. The December 2009 \"surge\" strategy accelerated the need for civilian assistance delivery in insurgent areas contested by the U.S. military. The new strategy aims to increase stability and reduce insurgency strength by creating jobs and providing social services through the Afghan government. Key concerns include Afghan government's leadership, coordination between military and civilian aid programs, and cooperation from local communities. The U.S. government is concerned about the impact of corruption on aid programs in Afghanistan, as increasing amounts of aid are being provided. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to boost U.S. international affairs funding levels for the country, with a focus on monitoring and ensuring accountability for the aid provided. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to increase U.S. international affairs funding levels for the country, with a focus on aid accountability. The enacted version of the legislation raises total FY2010 aid levels by 55% over the previous year. The Administration requested $1.6 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF) and $200 million in International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funding for Afghanistan. ESF is a key source of aid for economic, political, and social development, with allocations for alternative development, conflict mitigation, rule of law, and good governance. The US government recently allocated $760 million to strengthen Afghan government agencies, including $450 million for the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund and $115 million for the Ministry of Finance. Additional funds were provided for health, education, macroeconomic growth, trade and investment, financial sector, and agriculture development. The US government allocated $215 million for agriculture capacity building, $60.4 million for private sector development, and $8.6 million for expanding credit union services. Additionally, $200 million was requested for justice sector support, with a focus on rule of law activities and counter-narcotics programs. This included funding for corrections programs, model prisons, increasing judicial personnel, and supporting legal aid and women's initiatives. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs requested $211 million to support various justice activities, counternarcotics police, legal aid, women's justice activities, and drug treatment facilities. This funding aimed to further civilian personnel growth and included a 457 position increase for work at the district level and with Kabul ministries. The Administration proposed hiring 245 staff for work with Kabul ministries and in Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) from various federal agencies. They also planned to hire about 200 locally employed staff to support American personnel in the field. A report praised the U.S. embassy in Kabul but expressed concerns about staff being overworked due to a tripling in numbers over the past year. The proposed expansion would further strain resources. The Administration proposed hiring additional staff for work in Kabul and Provincial Reconstruction Teams, leading to concerns about overworked staff due to a tripling in numbers. The proposed expansion would strain resources, including housing and office space. The supplemental request did not address the added security needs resulting from increased civilian staff. Additional funding was requested for oversight programs, with the House-amended version adopting funding levels for Afghanistan approved by the Senate. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, cutting the ESF request by $267 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends specific funding levels for various program sectors within the ESF account, expressing concerns about providing aid directly to the government of Afghanistan. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, with concerns about providing aid directly to the government of Afghanistan. The Senate report limits direct government budget support to $100 million and cuts the INCLE account by $31 million due to concerns about the weak and corrupt justice system. The enacted legislation also addresses oversight issues by rejecting the request for SIGAR and rescinding $7.2 million in FY2009 supplemental SIGAR appropriations. The enacted legislation for Afghanistan aid includes conditions such as consulting with Afghan government representatives and civil society, measuring progress with specific benchmarks, and ensuring cooperation in reform efforts and human rights. Funding for the Electoral Commission is contingent on no involvement in corrupt activities. The enacted legislation for Afghanistan aid includes conditions such as consulting with Afghan government representatives and civil society, measuring progress with specific benchmarks, and ensuring cooperation in reform efforts and human rights. Funds for the Electoral Commission are dependent on the absence of corrupt activities. Additionally, aid for reconciliation with former combatants, like the Taliban, is subject to the participation of Afghan women in the process and the protection of their rights, with no immunity for war criminals. H.R. 4899 allows up to $300 million in funding for DC&P and Embassy Construction and Maintenance in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan to be merged with activities supporting U.S. civilian security. The FY2010 supplemental request for Iraq included a significant increase in U.S. assistance and State Department operations in response to the drawdown of U.S. military forces. Total economic aid programs for Iraq saw a 89% increase over the previous year with the enacted legislation. State operations also rose by 43% over the FY2009 level. The FY2010 State operations account would have risen by 79%, with a significant element being the request for $517.4 million in INCLE funds for the transition of police training responsibilities from the Department of Defense to the Department of State in Iraq. The State Department will advise the Ministry of Interior, police, and border forces, with a smooth transition requiring a successor program by the end of FY2010. The Department of State requested funding for a successor program in Iraq at the end of FY2010, including deploying advisors to work with the Iraqi military and funding infrastructure and security staff. The program is expected to employ up to 2,000 personnel and provide aircraft for efficient travel. Additionally, there was a significant boost in funding for State Department operational costs to maintain civilian outreach following the U.S. military drawdown. The funding requested by the Department of State at the end of FY2010 was intended to support civilian outreach in Iraq after the U.S. military drawdown. Currently, there are over 1,200 American federal employees from 14 civilian agencies stationed in Iraq, conducting various diplomatic missions. This includes personnel at the Embassy in Baghdad, the Regional Embassy Office in Basrah, and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) co-located with the military. Additionally, embedded PRTs (ePRTs) were established during the 2007 surge to allow civilian presence in additional locations protected by combat battalions. The State Department planned to establish two consulates and three temporary Provincial Diplomatic Teams (PDTs) to replace phased out embedded PRTs in Iraq by 2011, supporting reconstruction, economic assistance, and rule of law programs. Additionally, two U.S. Forces-Iraq managed PRTs would remain through 2011, with supplemental funding for infrastructure realignment. The State Department planned to establish two consulates and three temporary Provincial Diplomatic Teams (PDTs) in Iraq by 2011. The supplemental funding request included realigning infrastructure for the presence of an Embassy, State managed PDTs, and Defense Department PRTs. Costs previously covered by the military would transition to the State Department, including infrastructure, construction for consulate facilities, and security requirements for new field facilities. The State Department is transitioning responsibilities from the Department of Defense for housing, protecting, and maintaining staff in Iraq. This includes increasing contract employees for security, operations planning, maintenance, and other services. The Department has faced criticism for not having enough personnel to oversee contracts effectively. It is unclear if they are adequately prepared for the growing responsibilities in Iraq. The State Department is transitioning responsibilities in Iraq, increasing contract employees. It is unclear if they are prepared for the growing responsibilities and contract management. H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, cutting funds for diplomatic operations and site development. Senate appropriators suggest prioritizing consulate construction. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increases the amount for INCLE by $133 million, reconfiguring the use of funds for police training in Iraq. The Pakistan supplemental request shows no significant change in U.S. policy. Funding is subject to Iraqi Government support. The Pakistan supplemental request for FY2010 aimed at specific infrastructure needs to show continued U.S. support and help the government meet the needs of its population in insurgency-prone areas. The largest portion of the request was for $244 million in ESF, including funds for cash payments to displaced people and water and sanitation infrastructure. The FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan included $65 million for water and sanitation infrastructure, $65 million for agriculture irrigation systems, $64 million for energy solutions, $40 million for police training, and $60 million for military assistance to provide helicopters for counterinsurgency operations. Additionally, $26 million was requested for State Department operations to increase staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities. The FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan included $26 million for State Department operations to increase staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan by 56 positions. This was to better manage and support increased military and economic assistance, provide more contracting and management officers, enhance logistical support, and increase staffing at U.S. consulates in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar. The U.S. government is increasing staffing at consulates in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar to strengthen outreach and programs at provincial and local levels. H.R. 4899 provides $375 million for Pakistan aid and diplomatic operations, including additional funding for human rights and family assistance programs. The $15 million congressional addition to the ESF request is directed specifically to human rights ($5 million) and the program assisting families affected by military operations ($10 million). The act requires submission of a human rights strategy in Pakistan before any ESF funds can be obligated. The enacted legislation also includes language providing $1.5 million in ESF for leasing of aircraft to help USAID and the State Department better monitor its programs in the country. The Obama Administration requested $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding for relief and reconstruction support for Haiti after the earthquake. The Obama Administration requested $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding for relief and reconstruction support in Haiti after the devastating earthquake. Approximately 55% of the funds were for reimbursement of relief activities, 40% for new recovery and reconstruction activities, and 6% for diplomatic operations administration. The earthquake affected around 3 million people in Haiti, with over 2 million displaced. The earthquake in Haiti has affected one-third of the population, with over 2 million displaced. The government reports 230,000 deaths and 300,600 injured. The relief effort is expected to last for months. Haiti was already designated as one of the 50 least developed countries by the United Nations. Protection of the displaced population is a critical issue, with up to 1.69 million displaced in Port-au-Prince and 597,000 in other poverty-stricken areas. In areas outside the capital largely unaffected by the earthquake, poverty and lack of basic services are prevalent. Some Haitians have fled as refugees to countries like the Dominican Republic and the United States. Aid workers are providing necessities to Internally Displaced Populations, but there is a shortage of emergency shelter. The focus is on providing waterproof shelter, sanitation, and meeting basic needs. The total recovery and reconstruction needs in Haiti amount to $11.5 billion. The Haiti Post Disaster Needs Assessment found that the total value of recovery and reconstruction needs is $11.5 billion. At a donors conference, $10 billion was pledged by 48 countries and organizations for long-term reconstruction efforts in Haiti. The U.S. pledged $1.2 billion. Improved accountability of donor assistance is emphasized to enhance aid effectiveness and reduce corruption. Haiti has made progress in reducing corruption and increasing transparency, qualifying for debt relief. Haiti has made progress in reducing corruption, increasing transparency, and improving fiscal management, qualifying for debt relief. The U.S. Agency for International Development helped establish an online monitoring system for donor pledges and assistance spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $2.93 billion for Haiti, $129 million more than requested. The total includes funds for relief activities, recovery and reconstruction, and diplomatic operations. The Administration requested $1.5 billion in relief and disaster assistance funding for Haiti, which was $8 million less than requested. The funding covered various agencies and activities, including USAID, Agriculture Department, State Department, Department of Defense, U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Homeland Security. ($129 million more than requested in the enacted version of H.R. 4899) The FY2010 supplemental request included $350.7 million for International Disaster Assistance (IDA) to provide earthquake relief to Haiti, with $126.6 million allocated to USAID. As of June 11, 2010, the United States had provided over $1.1 billion in humanitarian funding for Haiti. The FY2010 supplemental request included $350.7 million for International Disaster Assistance (IDA) to provide earthquake relief to Haiti. The United States had provided over $1.1 billion in humanitarian funding for Haiti as of June 11, 2010. The IDA request covered Search and Rescue agreements, USAID/DART Program Support, and OFDA Relief Commodities. Relief activities in Haiti were organized into twelve clusters, with funding targeting humanitarian coordination, logistics, shelter, health, and nutrition programs. The request for earthquake relief in Haiti included funding for various programs such as humanitarian coordination, logistics, shelter, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, hygiene, and child protection. Additionally, $150 million was allocated for emergency food assistance, with a focus on providing food to up to two million people in need. As recovery progresses, food activities will target the most vulnerable and include food-for-work programs. Relief operations in Haiti will continue through 2010, with a focus on targeting the most vulnerable and implementing food-for-work programs. Recovery efforts will involve activities addressing humanitarian concerns, as natural disasters have frequently impacted Haiti in the last decade. The international community, including the United Nations and the United States, has provided significant humanitarian assistance in response to these disasters. The United Nations, along with partners like the United States, plays a key role in providing humanitarian assistance in Haiti to address significant disaster risks. The US is a major contributor to relief efforts and may use disaster accounts to fund immediate emergency relief. The State Department reported that disaster accounts are being drawn down to aid Haiti and prepare for future disasters. The State Department is drawing down disaster accounts to provide relief to Haiti and prepare for future crises. Resources need to be replenished by June 1, 2010, to maintain U.S. capacity for emergency response. The United Nations has issued a $1.44 billion Revised Humanitarian Appeal for Haiti, with $874 million committed as of June 4, 2010. It is unclear if donor amounts represent pledges or specific obligations. The uncertainty of whether donor figures represent pledges or actual contributions complicates the understanding of funding for Haiti relief. The challenge lies in sustaining donor interest and honoring existing pledges, while also securing funds for other disaster areas worldwide. Criticisms have been raised about the slow delivery of humanitarian assistance, highlighting the need for improved response efforts. Some critics have questioned the slow international response to delivering humanitarian aid in Haiti, citing challenges such as the weakened capacity of the Haitian government and logistical issues. Evaluations of the relief efforts are ongoing, with concerns about bureaucratic red tape, government capacity, and coordination among international entities. The international community faces coordination challenges in responding to the disaster in Haiti. The DOD and U.S. Coast Guard requested funds for relief efforts, including reimbursement and additional support. The response to the disaster is hindered by daunting challenges on the ground. The DOD's response to the Haitian earthquake through the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid Account (OHDACA) largely covered expenses incurred until June 15, 2010. Over 20,000 U.S. military personnel were involved in transporting supplies, evacuating people, providing security, and conducting humanitarian projects. The mission ended on June 1, 2010, when the last 300 personnel redeployed from Haiti. The DOD's earthquake response mission in Haiti ended on June 1, 2010, with the redeployment of the last 300 U.S. military personnel. Further assistance will be provided through the \"New Horizons\" annual humanitarian exercise involving National Guard and Reserve soldiers in engineering projects like building schools and clinics. The U.S.S. Iwo Jima will also provide medical assistance in July. The U.S.S. Iwo Jima is set to arrive in the Port de Paix area in July to provide medical assistance and perform specialized surgeries in Haiti. Concerns have been raised about the premature withdrawal of U.S. forces that had previously provided security, given the weakened state of Haitian security forces. The Administration requested $96.5 million for the State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities account to fund U.S. assessed contributions to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) saw an increase in military and police personnel levels after the earthquake, with additional police component surge capacity. The U.S. Administration requested funds to aid Haitian evacuees and migrants to the United States, including benefits programs and waiving immigration request fees, totaling $256.2 million for the Department of Health and Human Services. The President's request would provide $256.2 million for activities of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with $220.0 million directly allocated for completed and ongoing activities and $36.2 million for USAID to reimburse HHS. The $220.0 million would fund activities such as Medicaid and CHIP costs for evacuees, medical evacuations, assistance for evacuees, and public health activities in Haiti. Funding allocation for each activity was not specified in the request. The President's request for $256.2 million for HHS activities includes $220.0 million for Medicaid and CHIP costs for evacuees, medical evacuations, assistance for evacuees, and public health activities in Haiti. Funding allocation details were not specified in the request. The requested funds would be used to reimburse the HHS National Disaster Medical System for costs associated with medical evacuation of seriously injured earthquake victims to the United States and their subsequent care in U.S. hospitals. Additionally, funds would be used to provide cash and medical assistance to Haitian humanitarian parolees and cover repatriation costs as needed. The requested funds would be used to provide cash and medical assistance to Haitian humanitarian parolees, eligible for federal resettlement assistance programs funded through the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Additionally, funds would cover repatriation costs as needed. Requested funds would be used to support public health activities in Haiti, including disease surveillance and environmental health. The $36.2 million requested for USAID reimbursements to HHS would cover medical, surgical, and mortuary assistance teams deployed to Haiti, including personnel and supplies for a 250-bed hospital. U.S. disaster assistance to other nations typically does not involve accepting large numbers of disaster victims into the United States. Some forms of assistance to Haitian earthquake victims may be unprecedented, such as the use of NDMS for mass medical evacuation. The use of NDMS for mass medical evacuation of foreign disaster victims into the United States required rapid policy development and funding allocation. The President's supplemental request included $15 million for USCIS to cover immigration-related costs for Haitian migrants affected by the earthquake. USCIS funds processing and adjudication of immigration benefits through fees generated by the agency. In 2010, USCIS funded processing of immigrant, nonimmigrant, refugee, asylum, and citizenship benefits through fees collected. The agency had a budget authority of $2.727 billion, with $2.503 billion coming from fees. Additionally, $224 million was provided in direct appropriations, including $50 million for processing refugee and asylum claims. The Administration proposed using $15 million to reimburse USCIS for fees waived for eligible Haitians granted TPS and humanitarian parole. The Administration proposed using $15 million in supplemental appropriations to reimburse USCIS for waived fees for eligible Haitians granted TPS and humanitarian parole, as well as for processing adoption of Haitian orphans. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $1.6 billion in humanitarian assistance, $110 million above the request, and an additional $110 million for Haiti IDA relief activities, totaling $460 million. The final version also approves $150 million for P.L. 480-Title II assistance for food needs in Haiti and $655 million for the Department of Defense. The final version of the bill approves $96.5 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) in Haiti, $220 million for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Haitian evacuees and migrants, and $10.6 million for USCIS costs associated with Haitian migrants. Additionally, $5 million is added to the Coast Guard's request for operations in Haiti. The USCIS costs for Haitian migrants were $4.4 million below the request due to lower application requests. The total request for Recovery and Reconstruction funding in the supplemental proposal was $1.1 billion, primarily for new activities. The 111th Congress expressed bipartisan support for providing substantial assistance to Haiti after the earthquake crisis. Strategies moving forward aim to create a more sustainable Haiti and increase Haitian capacity to utilize foreign aid effectively. To coordinate aid programs better, donors focus on urgent infrastructure repairs in energy and agriculture, critical healthcare, governance, and security in Haiti. Some observers are concerned that U.S. assistance neglects areas like improving the educational system, which other donors prioritize. Critics question the limited approach to aid priorities. The revised Haitian development strategy aims to catalyze economic growth and provide services and opportunities. The revised Haitian development strategy, supported by the supplemental request, aims to correct the urban-rural imbalance by catalyzing economic growth outside of Port-au-Prince. Funds address immediate needs of displaced populations and strengthen local governance, infrastructure, and agriculture in less developed areas. Scientists assist in selecting less vulnerable areas for development. Haitian authorities are working on developing new \"growth poles\" outside of Port-au-Prince with the help of scientists to select less disaster-prone areas. While there is support for this strategy, officials acknowledge the high cost of developing neglected areas and caution against forcibly relocating populations. Experts emphasize the need for targeted poverty reduction programs in addition to economic growth. Aid to Haiti should focus on building the capacity of Haitians for long-term sustainability, despite challenges with measuring outcomes and short-term contracts for aid organizations. Aid organizations in Haiti are under pressure to show measurable outcomes with short-term contracts. Experts suggest that foreign aid programs need more time, funding, and personnel for thorough training and coordination with Haitian ministries. A supplemental proposal requested $749 million for International Assistance programs in Haiti, focusing on infrastructure rehabilitation, technical assistance, and reconstruction projects for essential services. The Administration requested up to $120 million of the ESF to be transferred to a multi-donor trust fund for Haiti, to leverage resources from other donors. ESF monies could also be transferred to USAID for staffing needs. Developing small-scale, clean energy sources locally was suggested as an alternative approach. Some experts recommend investing in small-scale, clean energy sources at the local level in Haiti to improve quality of life and stimulate economic growth. Concerns have been raised about insufficient funding for children's needs and psychological support. The State Department is set to receive $144 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement activities in Haiti to enhance security measures. The funding requested aims to strengthen law enforcement in Haiti through equipment purchases and police advisor additions for MINUSTAH. It also focuses on enhancing the Haiti National Police, restoring training capacity, providing equipment, and rebuilding prisons. Other programs include support for the criminal justice sector, counter-narcotics operations, and combating human trafficking. Additionally, $1.5 million is requested for the Office of the Inspector General of USAID to improve oversight and reduce corruption in relief and reconstruction funding for Haiti. The Administration requested $1.5 million for the Office of the Inspector General of USAID to improve oversight and reduce corruption in relief and reconstruction funding for Haiti. Additionally, $690,000 was requested for a Treasury Department attach\u00e9 to work with senior Haitian officials and oversee technical advisors, with a further $7.1 million allocated for advisors to restore basic treasury processes, reduce corruption, and enhance economic management skills in the aftermath of the earthquake. Up to $120 million in Economic Support Funds was also requested to contribute to Haiti's recovery efforts. The Administration requested $120 million in Economic Support Funds to contribute to a Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Haiti, aiming to improve coordination and tracking of foreign assistance. Despite criticism, Haitian officials acknowledge limited capacities post-earthquake and support the establishment of a development authority for long-term recovery. Additionally, the Administration proposed $252 million to cancel Haiti's debts to international organizations. The U.S. proposed contributing $252 million to cancel Haiti's debts to international organizations, including the Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank, and International Fund for Agriculture and Development. Congressional approval is needed for reallocating $40 million from the Treasury Department's Debt Restructuring Account, and both authorization and appropriations are required for an additional $212 million for multilateral debt relief. The final version of H.R. 4899 approved $1.140 billion for FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, $26 million more than requested by the Administration. The final version of H.R. 4899 approved $1.140 billion for FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, $26 million more than requested by the Administration. Direct budget support to the Haitian government requires written agreements with clear goals and mechanisms to prevent fund misuse. Funding to the Haitian government may be suspended if conditions are not met, with restrictions and reporting requirements imposed on recovery and reconstruction funding. Economic Support Funds and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement funds cannot be disbursed until Haitian governments are involved in program design and execution. The final version of H.R. 4899 approved $1.140 billion for FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, with funding to the Haitian government requiring written agreements with clear goals to prevent fund misuse. Economic Support Funds and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement funds cannot be disbursed until Haitian governments are involved in program design and execution, with restrictions and reporting requirements imposed. Funding for \"justice programs\" is prohibited until a credible investigation into alleged extrajudicial killings by Haitian police in January 2010 is carried out. The final version of H.R. 4899 approved $770 million for ESF, $21 million more than requested, with restrictions. It includes $10 million for children's education, collaboration on renewable energy, and directives on development, governance, family care, NGO grants, and reforestation. $148 million was approved for INCLE funding, with additional funds for correction facilities, combating human trafficking, and replenishing borrowed funds. The enacted version of P.L. 111-212 approves $3 million for oversight of increased funding for Haiti, $120 million contribution for a multi-donor trust fund, and up to $252 million in U.S. contributions for multilateral debt relief, including an additional $212 million. The enacted version recommends up to $252 million in U.S. contributions for multilateral debt relief in Haiti, with additional funds allocated for diplomatic and broadcasting operations, logistical support, and repair of Embassy buildings. The Secretary of State is required to submit progress reports every 90 days until September 30, 2012. The State Department requested $84.5 million for repairing or replacing staff housing and other Embassy buildings, including funds for evacuations and repatriation loans. The request also included $5 million for the Broadcasting Board of Governors' Creole Language Service to support increased broadcasts after the earthquake. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes additional funds for repairing broadcasting stations in Haiti, hiring staff, and establishing a Reporting Center in Port-au-Prince. It also allocates $147 million for State Department operations in Haiti, $8 million less than requested. Additionally, $592 million is added for foreign economic and humanitarian assistance programs for various countries, including $5 million for Mexico. Under H.R. 4899, Mexico receives $5 million for emergency security support and $175 million for activities related to the Merida Initiative. Jordan gets $100 million for Iraqi refugee issues and $50 million for security needs. El Salvador receives $25 million for Hurricane Ida relief. The Democratic Republic of Congo receives $15 million to assist victims of violence. The Democratic Republic of Congo receives $15 million to assist civilians, particularly victims of violence in the eastern region. USAID's GHCS account gets $45 million for pandemic influenza, and the State Department's MRA account receives $165 million to aid refugees. Vietnam is recommended to receive $12 million for dioxin contamination remediation. An additional $600 million is requested for border security due to security concerns. The Administration did not request additional funding for various sectors like teachers, law enforcement, and firefighters. The House's amended bill did include funding for these areas, but it was not included in the final version of the enacted bill. Funding for these proposals may be included in other bills. Funding for teachers, law enforcement, and firefighters was not included in the final version of H.R. 4899, but may be included in other bills. The Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1586 providing $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund and an increase in federal Medicaid reimbursements. The House plans to consider this bill after recess. President Obama and Secretary of Education did not request additional funds in FY2010 to prevent layoffs in these sectors. President Obama and Secretary of Education did not request additional funds in FY2010 to prevent teacher layoffs, law enforcement officers, or firefighters. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds for this purpose, but the House had previously considered a bill that included $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund. The House amended a bill to provide $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund, offset by cuts to other education programs. The Administration threatened a veto, warning that the cuts would harm school reform efforts. A survey estimated that 275,000 teachers and staff could be laid off without additional funding, leading to increased pupil-to-teacher ratios. The AASA estimates that pupil-to-teacher ratios may increase from 15:1 to 17:1 if layoffs occur due to lack of funding. The proposed Education Jobs Fund aims to prevent teacher layoffs by distributing funds to states based on population. The House bill requires the U.S. Department of Education to distribute funds within 45 days to states that meet maintenance of effort requirements. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for hiring programs under the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office. The proposed $1.179 billion appropriation for the COPS hiring program was dropped from the House-amended version approved on July 1, 2010. This funding would have helped law enforcement agencies facing budget shortfalls to hire or retain officers. The HAC proposed supplemental funding on July 27, 2010 to help law enforcement agencies facing budget shortfalls hire or retain officers. However, if tax revenues do not rebound, states may need to lay off officers again. The proposed $1.179 billion may not be sufficient to meet the demand for hiring funds, as seen with over 7,200 applications requesting $8.3 billion in response to previous funding. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds for firefighter hiring and retention, despite an earlier draft proposing $500 million for the SAFER program. The House proposed $500 million for the SAFER program to hire and maintain firefighters, but the July-amended version did not include funds. Proponents argue that additional funding is needed to prevent layoffs and maintain staffing levels, while opponents believe current funding is sufficient given the need to reduce federal spending. The House proposed $500 million for the SAFER program to hire and maintain firefighters, but the final bill did not include funds due to concerns about federal spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allocated $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program. This funding was necessary due to high demand for government loans since 2008, as banks have made credit less available. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allocated $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program. This funding was necessary due to high demand for government loans since 2008, as banks have made credit less available. Without supplemental appropriations, otherwise qualified loan applications from farmers or rural homebuyers may go unfunded for the rest of FY2010. The enacted version offsets this $50 million within agriculture by limiting $50 million of outlays from a mandatory bioenergy program. For Section 502 rural housing loans, the enacted version raises fees for receiving loan guarantees and adds $697 million of loan guarantee authority. The Agriculture Department is requesting $75 million for $1.2 billion of direct loans under Section 502 for regular FY2011 appropriation. The Agriculture Department is requesting $75 million for $1.2 billion of direct loans under Section 502 for the regular FY2011 appropriation. Additionally, they are seeking $151 million to support $4.7 billion of farm loans. The final version dropped $50 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and included $979 million of other rescissions from Agriculture Department accounts. The Agriculture Department's FY2010 supplemental included $979 million in rescissions from various accounts, including $487 million from the WIC program, $422 million from rural development, and $70 million from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The FY2011 request for the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program is pending, with hopes to accelerate clean energy projects and nuclear power plant projects. The Office of Management and Budget stated that DOE's FY2011 LGP request is for $500 million. The DOE's Loan Guarantee Program is under review for projects to move forward to conditional commitment in 2010. The FY2011 request for $500 million in credit subsidy costs may be reduced by $180 million. This funding would support advanced nuclear power facilities and renewable energy projects, potentially providing up to $18 billion in loan guarantee authority. Additionally, DOE requested $36.0 billion in loan guarantee authority for nuclear power projects and $500 million in credit subsidy costs for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The Loan Guarantee Program, established in 2005, received funding in FY2009 from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act to support innovative energy projects. $6 billion was allocated for renewable energy projects, with $2 billion later re-programmed for the Cash-for-Clunkers program. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 did not include $4.95 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program as proposed. The House Appropriations Committee FY2011 subcommittee allocations do not include the additional $4.95 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program as proposed in the House July amended version of H.R. 4899. The Senate Appropriations Committee also did not include the additional funding, but provides the $4,860 discretionary maximum award level in AY2011-12. The Federal Pell Grant program, funded through discretionary and mandatory appropriations, is the largest federal source of grant aid for undergraduate students. The Administration requested additional funds for border security, partially offset by rescinding funds for the virtual border fence. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funds for SBInet, also known as the \"virtual border fence,\" have been suspended pending a technical and cost review. The Administration requested that the remaining funds be designated as emergency requirements. $399 million would be allocated to DHS and $201 million to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Within the DHS funding, $297 million would be used to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, $37 million for two new unmanned aerial detection systems, $53 million for 160 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, $6.5 million for 30 new Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers, and $6 million for 20 new CBP canine teams to enhance border enforcement operations along the Southwest border. The $201 million DOJ funding would increase the presence of Federal law enforcement in the Southwest border districts by adding seven Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) agents. The $201 million of DOJ funding would increase the presence of Federal law enforcement in the Southwest border districts by adding ATF Gunrunner Teams, FBI Hybrid Task Forces, DEA agents, equipment, operational support, attorneys, immigration judges, and support for detention and incarceration costs for criminal aliens. Funding would also support Mexican law enforcement operations with ballistic and DNA analysis, information sharing, technical capabilities, and assistance. The House passed H.R. 5875 with $701 million for border security on July 28, 2010. The House passed H.R. 5875 with $701 million for border security on July 28, 2010, including $201 million for DOJ funding to increase law enforcement personnel in Southwest border districts. The Administration also requested $118 million in discretionary supplemental appropriations for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The U.S. Coast Guard received increased funding from the Oil Spill Liability Trust fund to support response activities in P.L. 111-191. The Administration requested funds for various programs related to the oil spill, including employment assistance and additional inspections by the Department of the Interior. The Department of the Interior received $15 million for additional inspections and activities related to the oil spill, NOAA got $13 million to mitigate economic impact on fishermen, the Department of Justice received $10 million for enforcement actions, NOAA also received $7 million for research, and the Economic Development Administration got $5 million for economic assistance in affected areas. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves a total of $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including economic assistance, environmental impact studies, and seafood inspection technologies. The bill includes funding for various agencies such as the Economic Development Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and Food and Drug Administration. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including disaster relief, expanded stock assessment of fisheries, and a study on the long-term effects on the ecosystem in the Gulf. Additionally, funds are allocated for an employment assistance program, a National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, and dredging activities by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Administration had requested $17.9 billion in additional mandatory spending for various purposes. The requested $17.9 billion in additional mandatory spending includes $13.4 billion for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, $3.4 billion for the Cobell case, $1.2 billion for the Pigford II case, and $175 million for Coast Guard funding and unemployment benefits for those affected by the spill. The Secretary of the VA has authority to determine service-connected health problems for veterans. The Administration proposed that spending for VA benefits and Deepwater Horizon oil spill response be exempt from budget procedural constraints. However, spending for court settlements would require new legislative authority and funds, potentially subject to budget rules like PAYGO. Members have suggested finding offsets or designating the funding as emergency. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has the authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure, including Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, and leukemia. The estimated cost for these new presumptions is $13.4 billion in FY2010, benefiting approximately 86,000 veterans. The VA estimates that $13.4 billion will be needed in FY2010 for new presumptive conditions related to Agent Orange exposure. Approximately 86,000 veterans are expected to receive retroactive benefits or an increase in disability rating. Disability compensation payments will start once final regulations are published, with the impact included in the FY2011 baseline. The Secretary of the VA has the authority to compensate veterans under current law, with CBO estimating a $5 billion requirement instead of $13.4 billion. The VA estimates $13.4 billion is needed in FY2010 for new presumptive conditions related to Agent Orange. CBO estimates $5 billion is needed instead. The differences in estimates are due to uncertainty about regulations and processing time. H.R. 4899 includes the $13.4 billion for additional benefits, with a provision prohibiting payment until Congressional review. The Senate-approved bill prohibits VA payments for Agent Orange claims until Congressional review period expires. $4.6 billion requested for settlements in Pigford Black Farmers and Cobell Indian Trust cases. Deadlines for settlements could be voided if funds are not appropriated by certain dates. The most recent deadline for the Cobell case is August 6, 2010, but it has been extended multiple times. The Pigford II discrimination case settlement was announced on February 18, 2010, with a $1.15 billion request for appropriation. If Congress failed to allocate the funds by March 31, 2010, claimants could void the settlement. The settlement in the Cobell v. Salazar case required a $1.15 billion appropriation by Congress by March 31, 2010. No funds were allocated by the deadline, but it is unlikely that the plaintiffs will void the settlement. The Administration requested $3.4 billion in FY2010 supplemental appropriations for the settlement, with $1.4 billion going to plaintiffs and $2 billion for land interests and education scholarships. The Cobell lawsuit settlement, requiring $60 million in education scholarships, was agreed upon by plaintiffs and government departments in 2009. The lawsuit stemmed from the Interior's mismanagement of Individual Indian Monies trust accounts, leading to difficulties in accurate accounting. The deadline for legislative authorization was extended multiple times, with uncertainty about further extensions. The Cobell settlement involves the division of allotments among heirs, creating 384,000 IIM accounts worth over $460 million. Both plaintiffs and defendants may support the settlement to end years of costly litigation. Some Indian organizations and plaintiffs have differing opinions on congressional approval. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include the requested $4.6 billion appropriation for the settlements. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include language for using the Judgment Fund to pay for settlements, including the Cobell and Pigford II court settlements. Senator Reid's office may propose passing these provisions in a separate bill or attaching them to other bills, which would require offsets or savings in mandatory programs under PAYGO provisions. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions for court settlements or mandatory savings as proposed in earlier versions. One provision aimed to increase rebates states receive from drug manufacturers by expanding the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP), while another sought to limit brand name drug manufacturers' deals with generic drug makers to reduce federal drug expenditures. These provisions were not included in the Administration request or previous versions of the bill. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions for court settlements or mandatory savings. The July 1 amended House version of the supplemental appropriations act aimed to amend Medicaid law to include injected, infused, and inhaled dosage forms of outpatient drugs in determining AMP, a benchmark price for Medicaid drug rebates. This proposal would ensure consistency in calculating Medicaid rebates for certain outpatient drugs. The House proposed adding injected, infused, and inhaled forms of outpatient drugs to the AMP calculation for Medicaid drug rebates, which was not included in previous versions of the bill. CBO estimated this change would reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $2.1 billion over 10 years. The Senate did not accept this provision in the final version of the bill. The House proposed adding additional drug forms to the definition of AMP in the July 1 amended version. A provision in S.Amdt. 4567 seeks to stop pay-to-delay arrangements between brand-name and generic drug companies. The House proposed adding more drug forms to the definition of AMP. A provision in S.Amdt. 4567 aims to prevent pay-to-delay agreements between brand-name and generic drug companies, which can increase costs for consumers and the government. The House proposed adding more drug forms to the definition of AMP. A provision in S.Amdt. 4567 aims to prevent pay-to-delay agreements between brand-name and generic drug companies, which can increase costs for consumers and the government. The provisions in the FTC Act would make unlawful any agreement involving compensation for delay of research, development, marketing, manufacturing, or sales of a generic drug, with potential savings estimated at $2.68 billion in federal budget deficits over the 2010-2020 period. The Senate did not accept the Preserving Access to Generic Drugs provisions included in the House amended version, nor were they included in the final bill sent to the President. The enacted version also did not include $538 million for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. These funds were intended for various government agencies to combat improper payments and illegal activities. The House amended version allocated $538 million for initiatives to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute illegal activity. Funds were designated for enhanced tax enforcement by the IRS, health care fraud control by HHS, and fraud and abuse investigations by the Department of Justice and SSA. The House allocated $538 million for initiatives to prevent illegal activity, with funds designated for enhanced tax enforcement by the IRS, health care fraud control by HHS, and fraud investigations by the Department of Justice and SSA. Additional funding was provided for continuing disability reviews, eligibility redeterminations, and unemployment insurance reviews. The funds were available until September 2011 for DOL, SSA, and IRS, and until September 30, 2012 for HHS. CBO estimated the funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010. The Administration proposed to increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010. They suggested expanding the Coast Guard's access to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and creating a new unemployment assistance program. This fund allows the Coast Guard to withdraw up to $150 million annually for response activities, funded by an excise tax on petroleum. Additionally, a 1 cent increase in the oil barrel tax was proposed to replenish the trust fund and support the new unemployment benefit program. The Administration proposed a $538 million increase in the federal deficit for 2010. They suggested expanding the Coast Guard's access to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and creating a new unemployment assistance program. This fund allows the Coast Guard to withdraw up to $150 million annually for response activities, funded by an excise tax on petroleum. Additionally, a 1 cent increase in the oil barrel tax was proposed to replenish the trust fund and support the new unemployment benefit program. The Administration's proposal authorized mandatory appropriations as \"advances\" from the trust fund, with later withdrawals not requiring appropriations. These funds could be recouped from responsible parties under the liability provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Administration proposed a $538 million increase in the federal deficit for 2010, including expanding the Coast Guard's access to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. They suggested authorizing advances of $100 million each from the fund for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with a proposed cap increase to $1.5 billion for total expenditure on individual incidents. This would allow more funds to be available if necessary to respond to the spill. The Administration proposed increasing the cap on the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund from $1 billion to $1.5 billion to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Office of Management and Budget estimated $1.575 billion would be available by the end of FY2010. The Coast Guard would need to notify Congress within 7 days for advances for the Deepwater Horizon spill, while other spills would still require 30 days notice. The final version of H.R. 4899 included provisions for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that were the same as those in legislation, P.L. 111-191 (S. 3473) that Congress passed separately on June 15, 2010. This legislation raises the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill and allows $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress. CBO estimated that this legislation would require $50 million in FY2010, offset by $50 million in reimbursements in FY2012, thus not violating PAYGO rules. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include the Administration's proposed new mandatory unemployment compensation program, which CBO estimated would cost $33 million. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010, with the House passing H.R. 4899 by a vote of 239-174. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010. The House passed H.R. 4899 with $5.7 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund and $600 million for the Department of Labor's summer jobs program. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 with $59.3 billion for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, and Haiti relief. The House and Senate passed multiple versions of H.R. 4899 between March and July 2010, addressing disaster relief, foreign assistance, and oil spill recovery funding. The final version included $81.8 billion in spending, with $65.1 billion in new budget authority. The bill was signed into law on July 29, 2010. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4899 in July 2010, totaling $5.7 billion in spending for disaster relief. The Senate version included funding for FEMA, war-related activities, and Haiti relief, but excluded funding for court settlements. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, $36.6 billion for DOD's and State Department/USAID war-related activities, $2.9 billion for Haiti relief and reconstruction, $200 million for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and $13.4 billion for additional benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Additional funding was allocated for U.S. disaster relief programs and foreign aid, totaling $59.3 billion offset by $300 million in rescissions. The Senate total was $4.1 billion below the Administration's request due to not addressing funding for court settlements. The Senate debated H.R. 4899, focusing on border security, Gulf oil spill response, supplemental spending, disaster funding, and Afghanistan withdrawal. Majority Leader Senator Reid proposed six amendments with strict time limits, followed by a cloture motion. The Senate rejected the amendments. The Senate rejected six proposed amendments, including additional funding for National Guard personnel to address border security issues. Other proposed measures included relief for small businesses affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and requiring oil polluters to pay for spills. Amendments to cut federal funding to finance additional spending were also proposed. Senators McCain and Coburn proposed amendments to cut federal funding by $59 billion to offset additional spending in the deficit. Senator Inouye questioned the realism of proposals to rescind unobligated balances and cap federal salaries. Six individual votes on amendments were rejected, including McCain's proposal for $250 million for National Guards to secure the southern border. Several unsuccessful amendments were proposed, including Kyl's $200 million for border security, Cornyn's National Guard deployment, Feingold's troop redeployment timetable, and Coburn's $59 billion cut in federal spending over 10 years. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 after making amendments to cut $59 billion in federal spending over 10 years. This included freezing federal civilian salaries, capping the number of federal employees, reducing government travel, and other proposed cuts. Additionally, Congress' own budget was reduced, unneeded federal property and equipment were disposed of, and unspent federal funds were rescinded. The Senate invoked cloture and adopted 16 amendments before passing the bill by a vote of 67 to 28. On July 1, 2010, the House passed an amended version of H.R. 4899 with additional funding for domestic programs and rescissions. The bill was then sent to the Senate after conferees were appointed. On July 1, 2010, the House adopted a rule and amendments for H.R. 4899, including funding for domestic programs and court settlements. The rule also set funding levels, authorized a summer jobs program, and made changes to transportation grant formulas and tax rules for biofuel producers. Amendment No. 2 by 239 to 182 included additional funding for domestic programs not in the Senate bill. Republicans argued for confining spending to FEMA disaster assistance, war funding, new VA benefits, and settling court cases. Democrats justified additional domestic spending to prevent layoffs, provide credit for farmers, energy projects, and students. War-related amendments were also debated. The House debated war-related amendments and additional funding for various domestic programs, including education, border security, Medicare and Medicaid integrity, nuclear and alternative energy loans, oil spill recovery, agricultural loans, and emergency food assistance. The House July-amended version included increased funding for various domestic programs, such as oil spill recovery, agricultural loans, and mine safety efforts. Additionally, there were larger offsets from rescissions and savings in mandatory programs compared to the Senate version. The House July-amended version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions, with $4.5 billion in savings from mandatory programs not addressed by the Senate. Rescissions of unobligated authority can offset new spending, and if budget authority remains unobligated, the funds expire, reducing the deficit. Some rescissions are controversial, while others are not, especially when the budget authority is unlikely to be obligated before its fiscal life ends. The House July-amended version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions, with savings from various programs such as DOD funding, highway contract authority, pandemic flu funds, American Recovery Act funding, Education Department funding, disaster assistance funding, State Department funding, and other programs. The Office of Management and Budget stated that the President would veto any version of the bill that undermined his abilities. In a Statement of Administration policy on July 1, 2010, the Office of Management and Budget announced that the President would veto any bill that affected his role as Commander-in-Chief in Afghanistan or included $800 million in cuts to the Administration's education initiative. The House rejected three amendments related to war funding, including one to delete all DOD war funding, another to restrict funding for protection and withdrawal of personnel, and a third to limit funds in the act. The House rejected amendments related to war funding, including one to restrict funding for protection and withdrawal of personnel, and another to limit funds in the act. The third war-related amendment, which required the withdrawal of troops by July 1, 2011, failed by a vote of 100 to 321. Another amendment to increase oversight of contractors in Afghanistan also failed by a vote of 162 to 260. The House added $1.2 billion for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program and $500 million for Firefighter Assistance grants to the funding bill."
