The \"Capitalizing Workforce Development Act of 2012\" includes a Job Training Resources Grant Program that provides funds for job training programs to purchase, renovate, construct, or lease real property for qualified self-sustaining job programs. The Job Training Resources Grant Program provides employment-related services to individuals with challenges, prioritizing applicants demonstrating significant need. No federal funds are required for programmatic expenses, except for those specified. Applicants are not prohibited from participating in other federal programs. The Job Training Resources Grant Program prioritizes eligible applicants with successful experience in establishing self-sustaining job programs or those affiliated with local organizations that have received grants under a specific section of the Internal Revenue Code. The Job Training Resources Grant Program prioritizes eligible applicants with successful experience in establishing self-sustaining job programs. Grants are awarded to organizations exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Revenue Code of 1986, including State or political subdivisions, Indian tribes, or tribal organizations. Grant conditions include job placement performance goals set by the Secretary in coordination with the grantee. The Secretary, in coordination with the grantee, sets job placement performance goals for self-sustaining job programs receiving grant funds. Performance assessment dates are established by the Secretary to measure goal achievement, not earlier than 1 year after the grant is awarded.

The Secretary ensures protection of the Federal Government's interest in real property purchased with these funds.

The Secretary sets job placement performance goals for self-sustaining job programs funded under this paragraph. $200,000,000 is appropriated for grants for fiscal year 2013 to support qualified job programs. A penalty is imposed for failing to meet job placement goals. If a recipient of funds fails to meet job placement goals in a self-sustaining job program, the Secretary will require repayment to the Treasury in proportion to the degree of failure. Repayments will be made over a 10-year period without accruing interest. The recipient of funds failing to meet job placement goals may elect to comply with performance goals instead of making payments. If a state fails and incurs a penalty, the Secretary may reduce the grant payable to that state. The Secretary may reduce the grant payable to a state under section 403(a)(1) over a 10-fiscal-year period. Subsections (c) and (d) do not apply to penalties under this provision, except for penalties with reductions under subparagraph (D). Section 409(b)(2) of the Social Security Act is amended to include penalty exclusion. The Secretary may reduce the grant payable to a state over a 10-fiscal-year period. Penalty exclusion is included in the Social Security Act."
