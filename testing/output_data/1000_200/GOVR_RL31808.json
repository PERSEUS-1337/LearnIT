The Senate passed its version of the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill, recommending $91.0 billion, $5.1 billion more than the Administration requested. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2989, providing $85.8 billion, with key differences including additional highway funding and the deletion of grants-in-aid to airports. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill allocated $91.0 billion, $5.1 billion more than requested. The House passed H.R. 2989 with $85.8 billion, excluding grants-in-aid to airports due to a point of order. Appropriations for DOT and Treasury were combined in FY2004 due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill allocated $91.0 billion, $5.1 billion more than requested. The House passed H.R. 2989 with $85.8 billion, excluding grants-in-aid to airports due to a point of order. The reorganization of the subcommittee structure of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations created new subcommittees for Homeland Security and combined former Transportation and Treasury subcommittees into one committee. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established, transferring agencies like the Coast Guard and Transportation Security Administration to DHS. Budget numbers for years prior to FY2004 have been adjusted for comparison. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill allocated $91.0 billion, $5.1 billion more than requested. The House passed H.R. 2989 with $85.8 billion. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission.

The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill allocated $85.9 billion, $740 million below the final FY2003 figure. The allocation of funding within the overall request is shown in Table 2. The Senate divides the budget differently from the House, putting the Postal Service into the \"Related Agencies\" Title. The Senate and House divided the budget differently in the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill. Funding for two programs was removed during House deliberations on H.R. 2989, reducing total transportation funding in the bill. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 included an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill saw a reduction in total funding from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion due to the removal of two programs during House deliberations. The bill also included an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. The FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill included adjustments to figures for various agencies and an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. The Department of the Treasury appropriations were adjusted for comparison with previous years, while the Administration's FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, 2.6% below the previous year's enacted level. The Administration's FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, which was 2.6% below the previous year's enacted level. The budget request aligned with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century and the Wendell Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act. Some changes were proposed to the highway and transit funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill Conference Report Budget Authority table provided details on Department of Transportation appropriations, with discrepancies in totals due to differing treatment of offsets. Funding for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border program was struck during House deliberations on H.R. 2989. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill reduced funding for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program. The total transportation funding was decreased by $3.425 billion and $47 million respectively. These reductions may be restored in conference. Additionally, there was a 0.65% rescission in P.L. 108-7 and a 0.59% rescission in H.R.2673. Funding for the Essential Air Service program was $50 million annually, with an additional $52 million provided in FY2004. Congress also allocated $111.5 million for grants to states for motor carrier safety activities under FHWA miscellaneous. The FY2004 FMCSA appropriation was $81 million less than requested, with an additional $111.5 million provided for grants to states for motor carrier safety activities. NHTSA's FY2004 request included $100 million transferred from FHWA. Congress postponed Amtrak's repayment of a $100 million loan from the DOT. The total resources for RSPA for FY2003 were $119 million, and for FY2004, $132 million. Rescissions of unobligated previous years' contract authority have been subtracted from the total. The total funding for RSPA in FY2003 was $119 million, and for FY2004 it was $132 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 provided the FAA with $13.93 billion, which was a $440 million increase from the previous year. The total resources available for FY2003 enacted were $55.9 billion. The FAA budget for FY2004, as outlined in various legislative proposals, including P.L 108-199, differed slightly from the House and Senate bills. The majority of the increased funding would be allocated to Operations & Maintenance expenses, with no major new initiatives proposed. Most FAA funding comes from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with O&M funding using a mix of trust fund and Treasury general fund monies. The Administration aimed to increase the general fund contribution for O&M funding in FY2003. The FY2004 Act increased the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion, a significant rise from previous years. This funding split has been a key aspect of the annual FAA budget debate, with the rationale being that the public benefits from aviation regardless of whether they use the system or not. The FY2004 Act increased the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion, emphasizing the public benefit from aviation. The FY2004 Act allocated $7.5 billion for Operations and Maintenance (O&M) spending, with a focus on air traffic control and safety. For Facilities and Equipment (F&E), $2.91 billion was provided, slightly less than the previous year. The FY2004 Act allocated $2.91 billion for Facilities and Equipment (F&E) spending, with no significant new initiatives but including project earmarking. Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) received $119.4 million, below previous levels. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program operates under the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST). The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, funded through user fees from foreign aircraft overflights, received $102 million in FY2003, with $50 million from its regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. This funding level was the same as proposed by the Senate and $11 million less than initially planned. The FY2004 Act provides $102 million for the Essential Air Service program, rejecting calls to reduce its size and require local contributions. It also excludes a provision for improved program coordination and funding reporting. The Airport Improvement Program requested $3.4 billion for airport development and planning. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants for airport development and planning. The House-reported bill recommended $3.425 billion for AIP, with $20 million allocated for the Small Community Air Service Program. The Senate-passed FY2004 appropriations bill provided $3.5 billion for AIP, including a $100 million transfer from facilities and equipment. The Senate-passed FY2004 appropriations bill (H.R. 2989 as amended by S. 1589; S.Rept. 108-146) provided $3.5 billion for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), including a $100 million transfer from the facilities and equipment account. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-199) provides $3.4 billion for AIP and prohibits certain uses of AIP grants for airport improvements related to bulk explosive detection systems. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-199) prohibits the use of AIP grants for certain airport improvements and the implementation of a ten-city Essential Air Service program. The FHWA budget for FY2004 requested $30.2 billion, a decrease from the previous year. The President requested $30.2 billion for FHWA in FY2004, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the previous year. The proposed budget included a new $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative for \"ready-to-go\" projects addressing congestion and infrastructure improvements. The House-passed FY2004 Appropriations bill (H.R. 2989; H.Rept.108-243) allocated $34.6 billion for FHWA, exceeding the President's request by $4.4 billion. This included redirecting revenues from the gasohol excise tax to the highway trust fund, projected to increase revenues by $600 million in FY2004. States were required to commit funds for \"ready-to-go\" projects addressing congestion within the first six months of the fiscal year. Unobligated funds would be reallocated among states. The House-passed FY2004 Appropriations bill (H.R. 2989; H.Rept.108-243) allocated $34.6 billion for FHWA, exceeding the President's request by $4.4 billion. The Senate-passed bill (H.R. 2989 as amended by S. 1589; S.Rept. 108-146) provided $34.8 billion for FHWA, with heavily earmarked discretionary programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provided $34.7 billion for FHWA, slightly higher than the House total and slightly lower than the Senate total. This is an increase of more than 6% over the FY2003 enacted total and more than 12% over the Administration's budget request. The limitation on obligations is similar to that of both the House and Senate bills. Project Earmarking continued as a practice in the annual appropriations bills during the TEA-21 authorization cycle. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act heavily earmarked discretionary programs under FHWA control, including Interstate Discretionary, Bridge Discretionary, and other programs. This was a departure from traditional practice as funds under core formula programs were also earmarked. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act earmarked over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds for various transportation programs, with a 100% federal share for eligible projects. This is a departure from past practices where federal shares were determined by the specific program. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds for transportation programs with a 100% federal share. This is a change from previous practices where the federal share was determined by the specific program. Additionally, the act includes funding for various projects such as transfers to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, construction of Pennsylvania Avenue, Amber Alert grants, and $150 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated over $1 billion for transportation programs with a 100% federal share. It includes funding for various projects and adds 65 miles to the Appalachian Development Highway System. The TEA-21 Funding Framework is extended until April 30, 2004, with expectations of retaining existing program funding. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) continued existing highway and transit programs from its predecessor legislation. Funding is primarily allocated to core programs like National Highway System, Interstate Maintenance, Surface Transportation Program, Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation, and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement. Additional funding includes a minimum guarantee amount and emergency funds. The \"exempt\" category of highway funding includes additional annual authorization of minimum guarantee funding and emergency relief, not subject to annual obligation limitations. The \"allocated\" programs, also known as discretionary programs, are under the direct control of FHWA or other governmental entities and include various specific programs. The FMCSA was established by the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 and became operational on January 1, 2000, assuming most responsibilities. FMCSA, established by the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999, became operational on January 1, 2000. It enforces federal motor carrier safety regulations for interstate truck and bus operations, administers grants for state safety activities, conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled drivers, and reviews carriers. Funding for FMCSA activities mainly comes from the federal Highway Trust Fund. The FMCSA, funded mainly by the federal Highway Trust Fund, has an appropriation of $366 million for FY2004, with $176 million for administrative expenses and $190 million for safety grants and information systems. This is an increase of $134 million from the previous year. The conference agreement provides $111.5 million for various FMCSA programs and activities, in addition to $176 million for administrative and operations expenses. This includes funding for enforcement, outreach efforts, and the establishment of a medical review board to assist FMCSA. The funds support core FMCSA activities such as rent, personnel compensation, outreach efforts, and grants to states for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program. The House approved $190 million, the Senate approved $237 million, and the final agreement was $190 million. The conferees agreed to allocate $190 million for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP), which funds state enforcement of commercial vehicle safety regulations. This includes grants covering up to 80% of program costs and supports over 10,000 law enforcement officers conducting millions of roadside inspections annually. Additionally, there is funding for border inspection stations and strategic safety initiatives, totaling $170 million for MCSAP and $20 million for other safety programs. The FHWA miscellaneous appropriation provides $111.5 million for strategic safety initiatives, including southern border inspection facilities, operations grants, and CDL improvement grants. NHTSA funding supports behavioral and vehicle programs to improve traffic safety by reducing impaired driving, increasing occupant protection, and ensuring compliance with federal vehicle safety regulations. NHTSA also provides grants to states for highway traffic safety programs. The Administration requested $665 million for NHTSA in FY2004, an increase of $231 million from FY2003. $447 million was designated for traffic safety grants to states, focusing on occupant protection and impaired driving, while $218 million was for NHTSA's operations and research to reduce highway fatalities. The Administration requested $665 million for NHTSA in FY2004, with $218 million allocated for operations and research activities to reduce highway fatalities and prevent injuries. This funding includes research and analysis, highway safety programs, safety assurance, and safety performance standards. The House approved $434.8 million, the Senate approved $448.7 million, and the conference agreement recommends $451.1 million for NHTSA, with $225 million for highway traffic safety grants and $222.5 million for operations and research. The Senate approved $448.7 million for NHTSA, with $225 million for highway traffic safety grants and $222.5 million for operations and research. The conference agreement recommends $451.1 million for NHTSA. For FY2004, the Administration requested $1.09 billion for the FRA, with most funding allocated for Amtrak. The House agreed to $1.09 billion, the Senate agreed to $1.57 billion, and P.L. 108-199 provides $1.455 billion. The Administration also requested $900 million for Amtrak, with the House agreeing to this amount and the Senate agreeing to $1.346 billion. The FRA budget for FY2004 is $131 million, with $34 million allocated for railroad research and development and $37 million for next generation high-speed rail. The focus is on Amtrak, agency safety activities, and how states can obtain additional funds for high-speed rail initiatives. The FRA budget for FY2004 is $131 million, with a focus on railroad safety, research, and next-generation high-speed rail initiatives. The proposed funding represents a 13% increase from the previous year, with most of the funds allocated for safety programs and operational activities. The conference agreement provides $130.8 million for FRA's safety program, mainly for salaries, travel, training, and information systems monitoring. The funding supports goals of reducing rail accidents, grade-crossing accidents, and hazardous materials incidents. Funding authority expired in FY1998, but FRA continues using existing authorities and annual appropriations. Deliberations since 1994 have not resulted in agreement on funding for regulatory and safety compliance activities. The deliberations since 1994 have not led to agreement on funding for FRA's safety activities. The FRA conducts R&D on topics like employee fatigue and train movement control. The FY2003 DOT appropriation provided $29.1 million for R&D, with a request for $35 million in FY2004. The House Committee recommended $28.2 million for R&D. The Administration requested $35 million for R&D activities in FY2004, with the House Committee recommending $28.2 million and the Senate Committee recommending $34.2 million. The conferees settled on $34 million. The Next Generation High-Speed Rail R&D program focuses on high-speed train control systems, track technology, corridor planning, grade crossing safety, and non-electric locomotives. The Administration requested $23.2 million for this program in FY2004, with the House agreeing to $28.3 million and the Senate agreeing to $29.3 million. The Senate agreed to $29.3 million for high-speed corridor planning and maglev projects in the transportation budget. The President requested $900 million for Amtrak in FY2004, which was $150 million less than the previous year's appropriation. Amtrak stated it could not survive on $900 million, with the DOT Inspector General supporting this assessment. The House also agreed to allocate $900 million for Amtrak. Amtrak requested $900 million for FY2004, stating it could not survive on that amount. The House and Administration agreed to $900 million, with a provision for states to transfer funds. The Senate approved $1.346 billion for Amtrak, extending funding requirements to all routes. P.L. 108-199 provided $1.225 billion, postponed loan repayment, and continued the new funding structure. It also directed the Secretary of Transportation to establish a competitive bidding procedure for state-supported routes. P.L. 108-199 directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish competitive bidding for state-supported routes currently operated by Amtrak. States can contract with non-Amtrak operators, with the Secretary having the power to compel Amtrak to provide necessary equipment and services if needed. Amtrak's appropriation now goes through the Secretary of Transportation, who funds Amtrak quarterly. In FY2003, Congress imposed requirements on Amtrak, including submitting a 5-year business plan requesting $1.6 billion annually for maintenance. Amtrak's authorization expired in FY2002, with bills proposed for reauthorization at $2 billion annually for three years. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has reported a bill authorizing $2 billion annually for Amtrak for three years, while the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee has approved a bill authorizing $2 billion annually for Amtrak for six years. Various bills have been introduced to change federal passenger rail policy, including plans to shift planning and financial responsibility to states or give more responsibility to the federal government. The federal government is considering plans to increase funding for Amtrak operations and finance capital improvements to the nation's passenger rail system. President Bush's FY2004 budget request for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) remained at $7.226 billion, with proposed changes to FTA's program structure. The Administration's request for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) remained at $7.226 billion for FY2004, with proposed changes to FTA's program structure. The House agreed to $7.231 billion, the Senate agreed to $7.305 billion, and P.L. 108-199 provides $7.309 billion. The proposed program changes are not reflected in the FTA appropriations due to the Administration's reauthorization proposal not being approved. For more information on FTA's programs and funding structure, refer to CRS Report RL31854, Transit Program Reauthorization in the 108th Congress. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 includes a $607 million budget for MARAD, supplemented with $70 million from other FTA programs, totaling $677 million. MARAD's mission is to support the U.S. merchant marine and administer programs benefiting vessel owners, shipyards, and crews. The President requested $219 million for MARAD in FY2004, slightly more than the previous year. The President requested $219 million for MARAD in FY2004, which is $12 million more than the previous request and $11 million less than Congress appropriated for FY2003. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $226.4 million for MARAD, with a focus on the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program. The Administration has requested no funds for additional loans in FY2004 but $4.5 million for the administration of existing loans. The Administration requested $4.5 million for the administration of existing loans in FY2004. The DOT Inspector General urged MARAD to improve loan application reviews and financial oversight following the bankruptcy of American Classic Voyages. The DOT Inspector General recommended improving financial oversight of borrowers and using an external financial advisor for loan applications after the bankruptcy of American Classic Voyages. The General Accounting Office identified weaknesses in the Title XI program and made recommendations for improvement. MARAD requested $104.4 million for operations and training, including funding for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and state maritime academies. The Administration requested funding for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, state maritime academies, and MARAD operations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $107 million for operations and training, including $98.7 million for the Maritime Security Program (MSP). Additionally, $11.4 million was requested for the disposal of obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF). MARAD has until 2006 to dispose of over 130 vessels in the NDRF due to age and environmental concerns. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $16.2 million for ship disposal. RSPA includes various operating entities and conducts research programs related to transportation. The Administration requested a budget of $118 million for RSPA in FY2004, with most funding allocated for transportation safety programs. Specifically, $67 million was proposed for pipeline transportation safety and $25 million for hazardous materials transportation safety. Additional funding was intended to enhance RSPA's ability to ensure compliance with federal regulations and oversee safety of containment systems for shipping spent nuclear materials. The House and Senate approved funding for RSPA in FY2004, with allocations for hazardous materials transportation safety and pipeline safety. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provided $112.9 million for RSPA, including $23.7 million for hazardous materials transportation safety and $66.3 million for pipeline safety. The Treasury Department in recent decades has performed four basic functions: formulating economic policies, serving as the financial agent for the government, enforcing financial laws, and producing currency. The Treasury Department's role has evolved with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. While still a key economic policymaker and financial manager, its law enforcement role has diminished. The Department consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus, with the bureaus handling specific duties and accounting for the majority of the Department's resources. The Treasury Department's bureaus handle financial responsibilities and law enforcement duties, with the exception of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which performs both. The Department's role has evolved with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 led to the transfer of various law enforcement functions from the Treasury Department to DHS. This included the Secret Service, Customs Service, and Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Additionally, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau was established to handle alcohol and tobacco-related laws and regulations previously managed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF). Its main responsibilities include collecting excise taxes and classifying products for tax purposes. The Bush Administration requested $11.408 billion in funding for the Treasury Department in FY2004, with top priorities including strengthening IRS tax law enforcement, improving efficiency, and combating money laundering and terrorism financing. IRS accounts for 91.5% of the proposed budget. The Bush Administration requested $11.408 billion in funding for the Treasury Department in FY2004, with top priorities including strengthening IRS tax law enforcement, improving efficiency, and combating money laundering and terrorism financing. The Administration sought increases in funding for FinCen and the Department's International Technical Assistance program. Additionally, a measure was approved to provide funding for Treasury operations in FY2004. The House Committee on Appropriations approved a measure (H.R. 2989) to provide funding for Treasury operations in FY2004. The measure authorized $11.273 billion in funding, $70 million less than the Bush Administration's request. Most of the difference concerned a smaller recommended budget for IRS operations, with less funding for processing, assistance, management, tax law enforcement, and information systems. Additionally, the measure provided $8.9 million more in funding for Treasury's departmental offices than requested by the Administration. The House Committee on Appropriations approved measure H.R. 2989 for FY2004 funding for Treasury operations. The measure provided $8.9 million more in funding for Treasury's departmental offices than the Administration had requested. Most of the increase was allocated to administrative costs related to the transfer of functions and personnel to the DHS, as well as increased funding for specific offices. The bill also denied the Administration's proposal to combine OIG and TIGTA functions into a new Treasury Inspector General. Instead, it added funding to OIG and TIGTA budgets for FY2003. The House approved measure H.R. 2989 for FY2004 funding for Treasury operations, matching the Administration's request for FinCen. Two key amendments were introduced during the debate, one aimed at reducing funding for an IRS pilot program and diverting savings to compliance programs, and the other to prevent the Treasury Department from using funds for certain purposes. The House approved measure H.R. 2989 for FY2004 funding for Treasury operations. Two key amendments were introduced during the debate. One aimed at reducing funding for an IRS pilot program and diverting savings to compliance programs. The other, introduced by Representative Bernie Sanders, would have barred the Treasury Department from using funds appropriated under H.R. 2989 to \"assist in overturning the judicial ruling\" in a case known as Cooper v. IBM. The amendment passed by a vote of 258 to 160. The House passed H.R. 2989 for FY2004 funding for Treasury operations, with amendments including reducing funding for an IRS pilot program. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill providing $11.196 billion for the Treasury Department, $202 million more than FY2003 but less than requested by the Bush Administration and approved by the House. The difference was mainly due to a smaller budget for IRS operations. The Senate's budget request for FY2004 differed from the House-passed version of H.R. 2989 due to reduced funding for IRS operations. Specifically, S. 1589 allocated $26 million less for tax processing, assistance, and management, and $79 million less for IRS information systems. Additionally, S. 1589 proposed merging IRS accounts for tax law enforcement and the EITC program, resulting in a $55 million decrease in funding for the initiative. The bill also allocated nearly $8 million more for Treasury's departmental offices, with a significant portion going to the Office of International Affairs and the Office of Terrorist Finance and Financial Crimes. S. 1589 rejected the Administration's proposal to merge the OIG and TIGTA into a new office. The Senate Appropriations Committee opposed the merger of the OIG and TIGTA into a new office due to their vastly different duties and responsibilities. Instead, it recommended increased funding for OIG by $1.6 million and for TIGTA by $3.8 million in FY2004. The bill also matched the Administration's recommended increase in funding for FinCen by $6.1 million to manage new responsibilities under the USA Patriot Act of 2001. FinCen, established under the USA Patriot Act of 2001, enforces regulations against money laundering and shares information for anti-terrorism efforts. The Senate passed amendments related to Treasury appropriations, including a study on pre-certifying eligibility for the EITC. The Senate passed amendments related to Treasury appropriations, including a study on pre-certifying eligibility for the EITC and preventing the Treasury Department from implementing a new regulation on pension plans. The House and Senate agreed to a conference to resolve differences in funding for IRS operations in H.R. 2989. The conferees reached an agreement on funding for Treasury Department operations in FY2004, totaling $11.166 billion. This amount was $317 million more than FY2003, but $177 million less than the Bush Administration's request. The majority of the difference was in funding for the IRS, accounting for 92% of total Treasury appropriations. In FY2004, funding for Treasury Department operations totaled $11.166 billion, with significant allocations to various agencies including the IRS. A consolidated appropriations bill (H.R. 2673) included funding for different programs such as TIGTA, FinCen, and the Bureau of Public Debt. An across-the-board cut of 0.59% on discretionary spending was imposed on non-defense appropriations bills. In FY2004, funding for Treasury Department operations totaled $11.166 billion, with significant allocations to various agencies including the IRS. An across-the-board cut of 0.59% on discretionary spending was imposed in non-defense appropriations bills. The House and Senate approved the conference report, and President Bush signed the measure into law (P.L. 108-199). The IRS administers various taxes and fees, processes tax returns, payments, and refunds, enforces compliance, and provides services to taxpayers. In FY2002, the IRS collected $2,017 billion in taxes, with individual income tax revenue of $1,038 billion. The Bush Administration requested $10.436 billion for IRS operations in FY2004, allocating funds for processing, tax law enforcement, information systems, and modernization programs. The FY2004 budget allocated funds for various IRS programs, including $500 million for business systems modernization, $251 million for fraud prevention in EITC claims, and $35 million for health insurance tax credit administration. Two enforcement initiatives sparked concern among some Members of Congress, one involving a pilot program for EITC claims and another hiring private collection agents for unpaid taxes. A new program aimed at curbing tax evasion received $133 million in funding. The FY2004 budget allocated funds for various IRS programs, including $500 million for business systems modernization, $251 million for fraud prevention in EITC claims, and $35 million for health insurance tax credit administration. A new program aimed at curbing tax evasion received $133 million in funding, targeting five sources of tax evasion. The program aims to increase audits for high-income individuals and businesses by 72%. Some concerns were raised about the adequacy of funding for IRS operations to enforce tax laws effectively. Key players in the appropriations process include the IRS Oversight Board. The IRS Oversight Board plays a crucial role in the annual appropriations process for the IRS, originating from the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. For FY2004, the Board recommended a budget of $10.724 billion for the IRS, including hiring an additional 2,120 full-time employees. Their recommendations aimed to achieve a 2% real growth rate in the next five years. The IRS Oversight Board recommended a budget of $10.724 billion for FY2004, including hiring 2,120 full-time employees. The budget aimed to achieve a 2% real growth rate in the next five years, focusing on resources for monitoring tax compliance, BSM, and restoring funds for customer service and enforcement. The difference between the Administration's request and the Board's recommendation was mainly due to funding for processing, assistance, management, and business systems modernization. The House Committee on Appropriations passed a measure providing $10.352 billion for the IRS in FY2004, $517 million more than FY2003 but $85 million less than requested. Funding was allocated for processing, assistance, management, tax law enforcement, information systems, BSM, and health insurance tax credit. The lower funding level approved by the Committee was spread over three appropriations accounts.

In FY2002, the President proposed a 10-year budget plan called A Blueprint for New Beginnings, which included the establishment of an electronic government account with initial funding of $10 million. The fund aimed to support interagency e-gov initiatives, implement digital signatures for secure online communications, and comply with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998. The Bush Administration decided to double the e-gov fund to $20 million, as part of the President's FY2002 budget. The fund supports interagency projects for electronic activities and innovative Internet use, in compliance with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998. The President's initial request for the e-gov fund was $20 million, but Congress only appropriated $5 million for FY2002. Transfers from the fund to federal agencies required a spending plan and justification. The President's budget for FY2003 recognized GSA as the operator of the official federal portal for citizen access to federal services. The President's budget for FY2003 sought $45 million for the e-gov fund, a significant increase from the previous year. The fund aimed to support 23 high priority Internet services for early development, as identified by the Administration's interagency Quicksilver E-Gov Task Force. This funding was crucial for implementing the President's e-gov vision of providing citizens, businesses, and state/local governments with easy access to federal services and electronic transactions. The President's budget for FY2003 requested $45 million for the e-gov fund to support 23 high priority Internet services. The House appropriators recommended $5 million for the fund and required a spending plan and justification for each project before transferring funds to federal agencies. The House Committee declined to recommend an appropriation for the e-gov fund as a GSA account but funded it under the Office of Management and Budget. Senate appropriators recommended the full $45 million, but final funding was $5 million. NARA is responsible for federal government records and provides guidance on federal records management. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) oversees federal records management, presidential libraries, and publication of government documents. It also supports organizations in preserving American history. The Senate and House allocated $316.3 million for NARA, with $256.7 million for operating expenses. The conferees recommended $256.7 million for NARA's operating expenses, with $600,000 designated for the preservation of Freedman's Bureau records. $35.9 million was recommended for the electronic records archive, with $22 million available until FY2006. $13.7 million was recommended for repairs and restoration, including funds for specific projects like a requirements study and repair of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library plaza. $10 million was recommended for the NHPRC. The Senate had initially approved $276.674 million for NARA for FY2004. The Senate initially approved $276.674 million for NARA for FY2004, with $258.191 million proposed for operating expenses, $13.483 million for repairs and restoration, $2.025 million for a regional archival facility in Alaska, $5 million for the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library plaza, and $5 million for the NHPRC. The House approved $299.8 million for NARA, with $255.2 million for operating expenses. The House approved $299.8 million for NARA, with $255.2 million for operating expenses, which was about $23 million more than recommended by Senate appropriators. The President's requested amount for repairs and restoration was approved, as was twice the amount requested for the NHPRC. The President's budget requested $305.6 million for FY2004, slightly more than $42 million above the FY2003 appropriation for NARA. The President's FY2004 budget proposed $35.5 million for the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), an 11.6% increase from the $31.8 million appropriated in FY2003. The MSPB serves as guardian of the federal government's merit-based system of employment, ensuring that personnel actions are processed within the law. The President's FY2004 budget proposed $35.5 million for the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), an 11.6% increase from the previous year. The budget includes funds for employee and managerial development opportunities, compliance with the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002, and a change in funding source for Civil Service Retirement appeals adjudication. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $32.9 million for the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), $2.6 million less than the President's request. Up to $2.6 million for administrative expenses could be transferred from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund to adjudicate retirement appeals. The conferees agreed to the trust fund transfer instead of a direct appropriation as requested by the President. The House committee report on H.R. 2989 agreed to transfer funds to MSPB from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund instead of providing a direct appropriation as requested by the President. The budget for OPM includes budget authority for current appropriations, with a focus on administering personnel functions and developing human resources policies and strategies. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) oversees merit-based human resources management accountability systems to support agency missions. It consists of divisions that design policies, assist in implementing human capital strategies, and provide various human resources services. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations, with a proposed budget of $18.0 billion in FY2004. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $18.0 billion for OPM, including discretionary and mandatory funding for various programs and expenses. This total also included trust fund transfers for salaries and expenses. The $118.7 million budget request for OPM includes funds for enhanced IT support, e-Government projects, and program evaluation. The OIG budget will finance more audit staff and improved information systems, aiming to reduce the audit cycle and increase recoveries. The budget request is 8.8% higher than the previous year's appropriation. The OPM budget request is 8.8% higher than the previous year, with increases in various areas such as salaries and expenses, government payments for annuitants, and payments to the civil service retirement and disability fund. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $119.498 million for salaries and expenses, including funds for specific projects like the enterprise human resources integration project. The Committee recommended appropriations for various projects and expenses, including $2 million for the enterprise human resources integration project, $2.5 million for modernizing federal payroll systems, and $2.5 million for program evaluation. They also recommended trust fund transfers for salaries and expenses, OIG salaries and expenses, and other government payments, totaling $126.9 million. The committee recommended appropriations for various projects and expenses, including funding for OIG salaries and expenses. They directed OPM to provide additional funding for the 'retirement readiness' project with InFRE and to report on its progress. The report also urged OPM to certify the impact of transferring DSS functions and to notify the Committees of any delays in research, audit, or investigation regarding PBMs. The Committee directs OPM to conduct a study to determine the number of Federal employees and retirees eligible for FEHBP but not covered, reasons for lack of coverage, and to complete an outside audit on the true cost of mandated services under FEHBP. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same appropriations as the President requested, with a focus on automating retirement recordkeeping systems. The Committee also addressed OPM's modernization program for the retirement system that began in 1997. The Committee directed OPM to modernize its retirement system in 1997. Despite recommendations for guidance from GAO, OPM did not act on them. Quarterly meetings with GAO did not occur as directed, leading to problems in the modernization project. The Committee now requests a comprehensive audit by GAO to address these issues. The Committee directs GAO to conduct a comprehensive audit on problems and mismanagement of the modernization project. An appropriation of $119.498 million is provided for salaries and expenses. OPM is directed to consider implementing the Federal Salary Council's recommendation for pay area inclusion. Senator Grassley's amendment prohibits funds from being used to implement OPM regulations regarding executive branch employee details to the legislative branch. Senator Grassley's amendment prohibits funds from being used to implement OPM regulations proposed on September 9, 2003, regarding executive branch employee details to the legislative branch. The regulation seeks to reduce the time detailees can spend in Congress to 6 months, limiting their activities and micro-managing from afar, which is deemed unacceptable. Additionally, the President's FY2004 budget proposed a $500 million appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund to create performance-driven pay systems for employees. The President's FY2004 budget proposed a $500 million appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund to create performance-driven pay systems for employees. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million, $497.5 million less than the President's request. Funding is contingent upon legislation authorizing the creation of the fund within OPM. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, contingent upon legislation authorizing its creation within OPM. The Senate did not pass an appropriation for the fund, believing it should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, pending legislation for its creation within OPM. The Senate believes the fund should be managed within individual agencies. The law allocates $1 million, with funds requiring OPM establishment before transfer to federal agencies. The Office of Special Counsel investigates federal employee allegations and enforces the Hatch Act. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) investigates federal employee allegations, enforces the Hatch Act, and provides whistle-blowing channels. The President's FY2004 budget proposed a $13.5 million appropriation for the OSC, with a focus on reducing case processing backlogs. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended and passed the same appropriation as requested by the President. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended, and the law provides the same appropriation as the President requested. This section discusses general provisions such as government-wide guidance on infrastructure policies, Buy America Act, drug-free federal workplaces, and agency payments to GSA for services. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, contains these provisions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, includes new or modified policies, with general provisions related to agencies and accounts. The Administration proposed government-wide general provisions found in the Appendix. Congress prefers reiterating language over permanent law for various reasons. The Administration recommended dropping several provisions, including General Schedule Pay adjustments. General Schedule Pay adjustments for federal white collar employees under the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990 will see an average 4.1% increase, retroactive to January 1, 2004, which includes a 2% adjustment. The adjustment is based on changes in private sector salaries reflected in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The rate of pay adjustment for federal civilian personnel in January 2003 was 4.1%, with an additional 1% applied to locality-based comparability payments. In January 2004, a 2.0% pay increase was proposed, later adjusted to 1.5%. The President's budget proposed a federal civilian pay increase of 2.0% in January 2004, later adjusted to 1.5% in basic pay and 0.5% in locality pay. Congress had not finalized legislation for pay rates, so the President's plan took effect. The FY2004 budget resolution aimed for parity in civilian and military pay increases. H.R. 2989 proposed a 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees in January 2004, matching the military increase, with the split between basic and locality pay at the President's discretion. The pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004 (H.R. 2673, Division F, Section 640) allows the President to decide how a 4.1% pay increase for federal employees will be split between basic and locality pay. The Office of Personnel Management states that 2.7% will go towards basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates. Adjustments in over 130 wage areas will vary based on labor costs and compensation in the private sector. The statutory system allows for wage rate adjustments in over 130 wage areas based on labor costs and compensation in the private sector. Congress has limited adjustments in recent years to prevent FWS wages from exceeding General Schedule supervisor salaries in high-cost areas. Lower cost area wages can increase based on wage surveys, while high-cost area wages are capped. P.L. 107-117 extended the Monroney Amendment out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel. Senior Executive Service Salaries are addressed in the President's proposed General Provisions. The President's proposed General Provisions requested changes to Senior Executive Service Salaries, including eliminating the six-tier system, transferring salary setting authority to the Office of Personnel Management, and capping rates at Level II of the Executive Schedule. The minimum pay rate for January 2004 is $103,700, with a maximum of $145,600 for most. Those in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems can receive up to $158,100, equal to Members of Congress and U.S. District Court judges. The Administration's FY2004 pay proposal includes a 2% across-the-board increase and a performance component with a $500 million fund for top-performing individuals. There are no provisions in the House-passed or Senate-reported versions addressing the pay of Members of Congress, Judges, or other federal officials, with a scheduled 2.2% pay adjustment for officials effective January 2004. A 2.2% pay adjustment for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, was scheduled for January 2004. However, due to limitations, the rate was initially set at 1.5% until the full adjustment of 2.2% was approved retroactively. The pay increase was not affected by an amendment tabled by the Senate in October 2003. Pay adjustments for federal officials are based on ECI calculations, with a 2.2% adjustment in January 2004. The pay adjustment for federal officials in January 2004 was initially set at 1.5% due to limitations, pending final approval for the full 2.2% adjustment. Unlike Members of Congress and executive branch officials, judges require specific authorization for annual pay increases. P.L. 108-167 was enacted for judges' pay adjustment in January 2004. President's pay adjustment was established by the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2000. The President's salary was increased to $400,000 per year in 2001, up from $200,000 since 1969. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay. The Federal Employees Compensation Act provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job, with costs covered by agency budgets. The Federal Employees Compensation Act provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees, with costs covered by agency budgets. The Administration proposed changes to charge administrative costs to each employing agency to improve workplace safety. The administrative surcharge would be around 3.5% of benefit costs. The Administration proposed changes to charge administrative costs to each employing agency to improve workplace safety, with most of the surcharge to be paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration reiterated its support for competitive sourcing and stated that the President would veto the bill if it contained a prohibition on funding for public-private competitions. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered competitive sourcing provisions in H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. Competitive sourcing, part of the President's Management Agenda, applies to federal executive agencies' commercial activities. OMB has implemented initiatives to promote competitive sourcing since February 2001, including revising Circular A-76. The enacted competitive sourcing provisions are in Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199), Division F, Title VI. Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199) outlines competitive sourcing provisions for departments and agencies funded by the Department of Transportation and Treasury. It requires agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) for competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. This may pose challenges in meeting the circular's deadlines for streamlined competitions. Additionally, consideration of conversion is also mandated. Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199) requires agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) for competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. This may pose challenges in meeting the circular's deadlines for streamlined competitions. Additionally, consideration of conversion is also mandated, with Section 647(a) directing the competitive sourcing official to consider how the conversion differential would affect the contractor's cost. The competitive sourcing official must consider the cost impact of conversion differentials on the contractor's cost, but the criteria for comparison are unclear. It is uncertain if performance decisions can be overridden based on this consideration. Standard competitions have stricter requirements compared to streamlined competitions. Section 647(a) applies to standard competitions, with a more stringent requirement found in the circular. Agencies must add the conversion differential to the non-incumbent's performance cost on the standard competition form as per Circular A-76. Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on competitive sourcing activities, including completed and ongoing competitions, costs, savings, and projected FTEs to be competed. The curr_chunk discusses the reporting requirements for agency competitive sourcing activities, including costs, savings, projected FTEs, and decision-making processes. It highlights the importance of establishing a methodology for collecting this information to inform OMB policy and agency decisions. Additionally, it mentions that agency heads are not required to limit the performance period in a letter of obligation issued to an MEO to five years or less. The curr_chunk discusses the flexibility for agency heads to issue letters of obligation to MEOs with performance periods longer than five years, potentially reducing recompetitions. This could impact government agencies and private sector sources differently, as contractors winning public-private competitions are subject to recompetition under FAR. This change may help address recruitment and retention concerns among federal government employees. Section 647(d) allows agency heads to use funds for monitoring activities after public-private competitions. This provision could enhance oversight and decision-making but may face reluctance due to costs. Section 647(e) prohibits moving contractor-performed work outside the United States. Section 647(e) prohibits moving contractor-performed work outside the United States, potentially impacting competitive bids and job retention in the country. Both House- and Senate-approved versions of the FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill had similar provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill, H.R. 2989, initially included provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions on Cuba. However, these provisions were dropped in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, due to the White House's threat of vetoing any legislation that weakened economic sanctions against Cuba. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill, H.R. 2989, initially included provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions on Cuba. The President's senior advisors would recommend a veto if the final bill weakened sanctions against Cuba, which have been in place since the early 1960s to isolate the Communist government of Fidel Castro. The sanctions were strengthened by congressional initiatives in 1992 and 1996, including the Cuban Democracy Act and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. Financial transaction sanctions with Cuba are governed by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Cuba sanctions, governed by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, have been controversial. Various initiatives in Congress aim to lift or ease restrictions. Different approaches exist on how to achieve the objective of promoting democracy and human rights in Cuba. The House-approved H.R. 2929 includes three Cuba provisions. The House-approved H.R. 2929 includes provisions to lift U.S. embargo restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba. H.Amdt. 375, approved by a vote of 227-188, would prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions. Restrictions on financial transactions have effectively banned travel to Cuba. Certain travelers may still visit under a general license. Certain categories of travelers may visit Cuba under a general license, including U.S. government officials, journalists, individuals with close relatives in Cuba, professionals for research or meetings, and athletes in international competitions. Various travelers engaging in educational, religious, and other activities may also be eligible for specific licenses. Supporters of the Flake amendment argue that U.S. policy towards Cuba restricts the rights of Americans to travel and that such travel can promote freedom and expose Cubans to new ideas. Supporters of the Delahunt amendment argued that allowing Americans to travel to Cuba can help spread the idea of freedom and expose Cubans to alternative information. Opponents believed that not enforcing travel restrictions would provide the Cuban government with tourist revenue while it suppresses democracy activists. H.Amdt. 377 aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances, which was included in the House bill. In March 2003, OFAC amended Cuba travel regulations to allow travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances. In March 2003, OFAC amended Cuba travel regulations to allow travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances, with a $300 per quarter limit for Cuban households. H.Amdt. 382 (Davis) aimed to preserve the travel category of people-to-people educational exchanges, but was not approved. Some groups praised the restrictions on non-academic people-to-people exchanges. The Senate approved a measure to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on Cuba travel, despite criticism of limiting non-academic educational exchanges. The Senate provision, similar to the House's Flake amendment, was defeated in a vote of 59-36. The Dorgan amendment, amended by S.Amdt. 1901 (Craig), would take effect one day after enactment. Momentum for easing U.S. sanctions on Cuba was impacted by Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 had less support compared to previous years. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved by a vote of 227-188, while a similar amendment in the FY2003 Treasury Department bill had a higher approval rate of 262-167. The curr_chunk discusses various acronyms related to transportation and aviation legislation, such as ARC, AIP, AIR21, ARAA, ATSA, BRR, BTS, CG, CMAQ, DOT, EAS, F&E, FAA. The curr_chunk provides a list of acronyms related to transportation and aviation legislation, including CMAQ, DOT, EAS, F&E, FAA, FAHP, FAIR21, FHWA, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, MCSAP, New Starts, NHS, and NHTSA. The curr_chunk lists acronyms related to transportation programs and agencies, including FTA, NHS, NHTSA, O&M, OIG, OST, RABA, RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, SCASD, STB, STP, TCSP, and TEA-21. The Department of Transportation (DOT) budget is funded by transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds include the highway trust fund, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways trust fund, derived from specific taxes. In FY2002, trust funds accounted for a significant portion of DOT funding. In FY2002, trust funds accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending, with highway and transit funding being the largest components of DOT appropriations. Contract authority from the highway trust fund allows for funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year, without the need for new budget authority. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, major legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund and gave special status to core highway and mass transit program funding in the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) created a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs in the federal budget. Funding guarantees were established to make it difficult to alter funding levels annually. Additional highway funds could be provided through Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA). However, in FY2003, the RABA adjustment would have led to a significant drop in highway obligational funding if left intact during the appropriations process. TEA-21 changed the role of House and Senate committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. TEA-21 altered the role of House and Senate appropriations committees in setting annual spending levels for highway and transit programs. The committees no longer have the authority to determine annual obligations, as these are now established by TEA-21 and adjusted annually through RABA computation. The appropriations committees have limited discretion in changing spending levels for specific programs or projects. In FY2000 and FY2001 appropriations acts, there were attempts to regain some control over highway spending by redistributing funds and adding significant projects. In FY2001, appropriators redistributed funds among programs and added significant spending projects. The FY2001 Act also included funds for earmarked projects and redirected a limited amount of funding between programs, with additional funding for some TEA-21 programs. In FY2002, appropriators made major redistributions of RABA funds and transferred funds to agencies not eligible for RABA funding under TEA-21. The FAIR21 provides a guarantee for FAA program spending, different from TEA-21. The FAIR21 guarantee for aviation spending differs from TEA-21 by relying on two point-of-order rules for Congress. Supporters believe it requires increased spending on aviation programs, leading to significant growth in appropriations for FY2001 and FY2002. However, FAIR21 guarantees are seen as weaker than TEA-21. Transportation appropriators now have control over spending for TSA, Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and smaller DOT agencies. Transportation budgeting involves a confusing lexicon of budget authority and contract authority, with contract authority providing obligational authority for trust fund-financed programs. Changes in the transportation budget are achieved by combining changes in budget/contract authority and placing limitations on obligations to control outlays in line with congressional budget agreements. Contract authority is similar to entering into a contract but does not actually involve it. TEA-21 limited the role of appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligations levels for FY1999-FY2003. States pay for projects upfront, and federal payments are made later upon completion. Highway and transit grant programs operate on a reimbursable basis. Highway and transit programs operate on a reimbursable basis, with states paying for projects upfront and federal payments made upon completion. Trust fund balances remain high to cover current and future commitments, including both short- and long-term obligations for projects. Unobligated amounts are still dedicated to projects but have not been committed yet. The distribution of contract authority funds to states and programs involves apportionments for formula-driven programs and allocations for programs under direct federal control. Apportionments are for state distribution, while allocations are for administrative distribution to various entities. These terms provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients. The terms apportionments and allocations are used in the distribution of contract authority funds for highway programs. Recipients may mistakenly assume that a state apportionment is part of the federal budget."
