    "content": "The \"Save America's Jobs Act of 2002\" prevents corporate expatriation to avoid US income tax. The \"Save America's Jobs Act of 2002\" amends the definition of \"domestic\" in the Internal Revenue Code to include corporations or partnerships created or organized in the United States. In a corporate expatriation transaction, the acquiring corporation is treated as a domestic corporation. In a corporate expatriation transaction, a nominally foreign corporation acquires substantially all properties of a domestic corporation, making the acquiring corporation treated as a domestic corporation. In a corporate expatriation transaction, a nominally foreign corporation acquires a domestic corporation, and more than 80 percent of the acquiring corporation's stock is held by former shareholders of the domestic corporation. In certain cases, the 80 percent requirement can be lowered to 50 percent for a nominally foreign corporation. In certain cases, the 80 percent ownership requirement can be lowered to 50 percent for a nominally foreign corporation if the corporation lacks substantial business activities in the foreign country where it is created or organized, and its stock is publicly traded in the United States. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' includes a transaction where a nominally foreign acquiring corporation acquires properties of a domestic partnership, resulting in more than 80 percent ownership of the stock in the United States. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' involves a situation where a foreign acquiring corporation obtains properties from a domestic partnership, leading to over 80 percent ownership of the stock in the US. Special rules apply to related transactions. The term 'nominally foreign corporation' refers to a corporation that would be considered foreign if not for certain rules, such as in a corporate expatriation transaction where a foreign acquiring corporation gains over 80 percent ownership of US stock from a domestic partnership. The term 'expanded affiliated group' refers to an affiliated group without certain restrictions. The Secretary of the Treasury will adjust corporate tax rates to offset any revenue changes resulting from the amendment. The amendment made by this section will result in a net decrease in revenues for taxable years equal to the net increase in revenue, with tax rates adjusted based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury. Effective dates apply to corporate expatriation transactions completed after September 11, 2001. The amendment made by this section applies to corporate expatriation transactions completed on or before September 11, 2001, for taxable years of the acquiring corporation beginning after December 31, 2003."
