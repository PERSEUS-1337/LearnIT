    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\". The Act aims to establish early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks for hearing loss in babies. It mandates screening for all newborns in hospitals or within 3 months of birth, with timely diagnostic testing and referral for treatment by 6 months of age. Universal newborn hearing screening programs should include a component for early intervention services and public policy should be based on research recognizing the unique needs of deaf or hard-of-hearing infants and children. Statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks are essential for ensuring timely support for deaf or hard-of-hearing infants and children. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes supporting newborn hearing detection, monitoring detection in birthing hospitals, and ensuring effective screening and referral services. The grants aim to establish statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss, including screening, referral, and linkage with appropriate services within the community. Data collection for research and policy development is also a key objective. \"Technical assistance, data management, and applied research are key components of the program.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection. This includes data collection, standardized procedures, cost-effectiveness studies, and identifying causes of congenital hearing loss. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, including data collection, standardized procedures, cost-effectiveness studies, and identifying causes of congenital hearing loss. State-based programs conduct studies to identify causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss, assess the effectiveness of early detection programs, and share data with monitoring programs to identify unknown causes of hearing loss. The National Institutes of Health, through the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, is involved in these efforts. The National Institutes of Health, under the Director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, will conduct research on new screening techniques and technology, including clinical trials and intervention efficacy studies. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with other agencies, state and local agencies, consumer groups, individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, qualified professionals, health and education professionals, and third-party payers. The Health Resources and Services Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health collaborate on policy recommendations for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. They also work on state networks and data collection for early intervention. The Health Resources and Services Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health collaborate to assist states in establishing early detection networks and developing data collection systems for intervention. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations:\n$5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 for Statewide Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Networks. For Technical Assistance, Data Management, and Applied Research, $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For National Institutes of Health, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for each fiscal year 2001 through 2003. The curr_chunk states that $3,000,000 was allocated for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and unspecified amounts for fiscal years 2001 through 2003."
