    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding to states for education of children with disabilities, requiring states to offer a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) to all such children. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of disabled children in private schools, with benefits comparable to those in public schools. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 addressed the vagueness of the statute regarding equitable participation in program benefits for children with disabilities in private schools, leading to differences among states and courts. Prior to the amendments, courts had divergent views on the issue, with some giving local authorities broad discretion resulting in fewer services for disabled children in private schools. The Supreme Court had granted certiorari in several cases, but Congress's rewrite of the law in 1997 led to vacating and remanding these cases. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 rejected the \"equitable participation\" standard and required provision for special education and related services to children with disabilities in private schools. Services were to be funded proportionately with federal funds under Part B of IDEA and could be provided on the premises of private schools. There was also a requirement for identifying children with disabilities through \"child find\" provisions. The 2004 reauthorization made changes to provisions regarding children with disabilities in private schools, clarifying responsibilities of local educational agencies to ensure fair and equitable services. These changes align with existing IDEA regulations and the No Child Left Behind Act. The 2004 reauthorization made changes to provisions regarding children with disabilities in private schools, clarifying responsibilities of local educational agencies to ensure fair and equitable services. These changes include resolving issues related to children with disabilities placed in private schools by their parents. The 2004 reauthorization made changes to provisions regarding children with disabilities in private schools, clarifying responsibilities of local educational agencies to ensure fair and equitable services. Children with disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents are to be provided special education and related services consistent with the number and location of such children in the school district served by a LEA. Specific requirements for parentally placed children were also outlined, including the requirement that they be located in the school district served by the LEA. The 2004 reauthorization clarified responsibilities for children with disabilities in private schools, requiring services to be provided based on the number and location of children in the school district served by the LEA. This change aimed to protect LEAs from working with private schools across district lines but has sparked controversy due to issues like funding formula discrepancies and potential conflicts with state laws. The 2004 reauthorization clarified responsibilities for children with disabilities in private schools, requiring services to be provided based on the number and location of children in the school district served by the LEA. This change aimed to protect LEAs from working with private schools across district lines but has sparked controversy due to issues like funding formula discrepancies and potential conflicts with state laws. Regarding parentally placed private school children, there are five requirements, including equal funds expenditure and emphasis on direct services over indirect services. The calculation of the proportionate amount must be done after consultation with private school representatives and a thorough child find process. The LEA must conduct a thorough child find process to determine the number of children with disabilities in private schools. Services may be provided on the premises of private, including religious schools. A provision on supplementing funds, not supplanting them, is added. LEAs must maintain records of children evaluated and determined to have disabilities. The LEA must maintain records of children evaluated and determined to have disabilities, ensuring federal funds are serving their intended purpose. Child find requirements remain the same as previous law, with new provisions added for equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period. The Child Find requirements include provisions for equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period. Private school children with disabilities must be accurately counted and have access to services comparable to those in public schools. LEAs must consult with private school officials and parents to ensure equitable participation in the Child Find process. The curr_chunk discusses the process for parentally placed private school children with disabilities to participate equitably in special education services, including determining federal funds allocation, consultation processes, service provision details, and decision-making procedures. The new law requires written affirmation of consultation with private school officials, signed by representatives, with compliance procedures added. Private school officials can submit complaints to the SEA if they believe the LEA did not engage in meaningful and timely consultation. Private school officials have the right to submit complaints to the SEA if they believe the LEA did not engage in meaningful consultation. The 2004 reauthorization specifies that services must be provided by public agency employees or through contracts, and must be secular, neutral, and nonideological. The new law requires services for pupils attending private schools to be provided by a public agency or through contract, to be secular, neutral, and nonideological. Funds available for private school pupils are to be controlled by a public agency. Reimbursement for private school placement of a child with a disability is not paid by the LEA unless certain findings are made. The cost of reimbursement cannot be reduced or denied for failure to provide. The new law regarding reimbursement for private school placement of a child with a disability contains exceptions to limitations. Reimbursement cannot be reduced or denied if the school prevented the parent from providing notice, if the parents had not received notice of the requirement, or if compliance would likely result in physical harm to the child. Additionally, reimbursement may not be reduced or denied if the parent is illiterate, cannot write in English, or if compliance with the notice requirement would likely result in serious emotional harm to the child. In a recent Supreme Court decision, parents of a child with a disability were granted private school reimbursement even though the student had never received special education services from the school district. This ruling does not set a precedent for lower courts, and the issue remains unsettled."
