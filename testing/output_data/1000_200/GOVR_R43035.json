    "content": "Since Burma's military junta transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in 2011, Congress has mostly deferred to the White House and relevant departments on U.S. policy towards Burma. Changes in policy have been made using executive authority, with some consultation with Congress. Additional changes may require direct congressional action. The Obama Administration has made changes in U.S. policy towards Burma, including engaging in direct dialogue with the ruling military junta to promote democracy and human rights. Congress may need to reassess its role in determining U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration's policy towards Burma involves engaging in direct dialogue with the ruling military junta to promote democracy and human rights. It also aims to cooperate on international security issues and press for the release of political prisoners and an end to human rights violations. The Obama Administration's policy towards Burma involves engaging in direct dialogue with the ruling military junta to promote democracy and human rights, including a credible internal political dialogue with the democratic opposition and ethnic minority leaders. The policy also calls for Burma to sever its ties to North Korea and abandon its alleged nuclear weapons program. Following the announcement of the new U.S. policy, Burma underwent a dramatic political transformation, holding parliamentary elections in November 2010 and transferring power to a quasi-civilian government in March 2011. Despite the 2010 elections in Burma being criticized for not meeting international standards, the ruling military junta, known as the SPDC, accepted the results. In March 2011, power was transferred to a quasi-civilian government, with many ex-generals in leadership roles. The new constitution, largely drafted by the SPDC, was supposedly approved by a public vote in 2008. The government, led by President Thein Sein, has implemented political and economic reforms, including releasing political prisoners and amending oppressive laws. In 2012, parliamentary by-elections were held, with Aung San Suu Kyi's party participating. In April 2012, Burma held parliamentary by-elections where Aung San Suu Kyi's party won 43 out of 46 seats. The results were accepted by the Thein Sein administration and the military, seen as a positive development. The Obama Administration responded by increasing high-level meetings and easing sanctions on Burma. Key visits included the appointment of the first U.S. ambassador in 20 years, Hillary Clinton's visit as the first Secretary of State in over 50 years, and President Obama's visit as the first U.S. President while in office. Plans are underway to increase U.S. assistance to Burma, including reopening the USAID mission after a 23-year hiatus. Despite reforms in Burma, the political and economic situation remains serious and fragile. Fighting continues despite ceasefire agreements. The political and economic situation in Burma remains serious and fragile, with ongoing fighting between the military and ethnic-based militias. Despite some reforms and ceasefire agreements, human rights violations persist, particularly in Kachin State. Ethnic tensions have been exposed by rioting in Rakhine State. While some laws have been passed to protect civil liberties, oppressive laws from colonial times are still in place. The NLD participated in the 2012 by-elections, but other political parties face registration challenges due to members being detained. Several political parties faced registration challenges for the April 2012 by-elections in Burma, with some members detained for political reasons. Despite prisoner releases, over 200 political prisoners remain in custody. The 113th Congress may consider issues regarding Burma's political and economic development, including the commitment of President Thein Sein's government to democracy and human rights, its ability to implement reforms, and collaboration with the Union Parliament and military for reform. Concerns are raised about U.S. policy being too closely tied to specific leaders, potentially neglecting relations with Burma's ethnic minorities. The United States is facing questions about its policy towards Burma, including its focus on specific leaders like President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi, while potentially neglecting relations with ethnic minorities. The Obama Administration's easing of sanctions is also under scrutiny, with concerns about the enforcement of current sanctions and the type of aid the U.S. should provide to support Burma. Additionally, the role of Burma in the geopolitical dynamic between China and India is being considered. The Obama Administration's policy towards Burma, influenced by a 2007 article in Foreign Affairs, focused on engaging with the country's military regime while maintaining sanctions. This approach aimed to push for political and economic reforms in Burma. The Obama Administration's policy towards Burma evolved over time, initially expressing skepticism towards the government but later becoming more optimistic and forming closer ties with President Thein Sein's administration. The Obama Administration's policy towards Burma shifted to a focus on promoting progressive forces within President Thein Sein's government and isolating anti-reform individuals and organizations, leading to a closer partnership with Thein Sein's government at the expense of relations with opposition parties and ethnic groups. The Obama Administration shifted its policy towards Burma to focus on promoting progressive forces within President Thein Sein's government and isolating anti-reform individuals and organizations. This led to a closer partnership with Thein Sein's government, potentially damaging relations with traditional opposition parties and ethnic organizations. The administration also changed its approach from responding to positive developments with gradual sanctions relief to actively promoting further reforms in Burma. This shift has sparked debate among Burma experts. The Obama Administration's Burma policy has sparked debate among experts and interest groups. Some believe the administration has moved too fast in rewarding modest progress, while others think it has been too slow in lifting sanctions, hindering reforms in Burma. Direct discussions with SPDC officials were held following the announcement of a new policy, including high-level meetings with President Obama and Prime Minister General Thein Sein. On November 15, 2009, President Obama and Prime Minister General Thein Sein attended the first ASEAN-U.S. leaders meeting in Singapore. The Obama Administration maintained U.S. sanctions on Burma until concrete progress towards reform is seen, with the possibility of implementing additional sanctions if needed. The decision was influenced by the tense political situation in Burma in 2010, with the NLD and other pro-democracy parties boycotting the November elections due to perceived unfairness. In 2010, the political situation in Burma was tense as the NLD and other pro-democracy parties boycotted the November elections due to unfair election laws. The SPDC transformed the USDA into a political party, the USDP, with Prime Minister Thein Sein as its leader. Additionally, ethnic militias were to be transformed into Border Guard Forces under the Burmese military's command. In 2009, ethnic militias faced transformation into Border Guard Forces under Burmese military command or risked ceasefire agreements being revoked. Conflict erupted with militias like Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and Shan State Army-North refusing transformation. Reports of Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea may have influenced the cautious response of the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration responded cautiously to Burma's political transition due to reports of Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea. In 2009, U.S. naval vessels monitored a cargo ship carrying arms and weapons materials from North Korea to Burma in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) warned in January 2010 that Burma was exploring nuclear weapons development. Al Jazeera's report in June 2010 claimed that Burma had an active nuclear weapons program with support from North Korea, raising concerns despite doubts about Burma's technical ability. The Obama Administration expressed concerns about Burma's nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea, responding cautiously to the country's political transition. President Obama criticized Burma's 2010 elections as neither free nor fair, highlighting the regime's repression and detention of political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The Obama Administration criticized Burma's 2010 elections for being unfair and repressive, with over 2,100 political prisoners detained, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The regime silenced the National League for Democracy and obstructed opposition candidates. The United States will maintain pressure on Burma to release political prisoners and improve conditions.

The Special Representative is responsible for coordinating U.S. policy towards Burma, consulting with foreign governments, and consulting with Congress. In the first few months of Burma's new government, there were positive developments such as the release of political prisoners and overtures made to opposition groups. In May 2011, 14,578 people were released from prison, including 55 political prisoners. President Thein Sein reached out to Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD for political reconciliation. However, tensions rose when a Navy destroyer intercepted a cargo ship suspected of carrying banned weapons technology from North Korea to Burma. The Burmese Army broke a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army, leading to fighting spreading in northern Burma. Former Assistant Secretary Campbell summarized Obama's stance on Burma in a speech on May 31, 2011. In a speech on May 31, 2011, former Assistant Secretary Campbell expressed disappointment with the new Burmese government's progress. Deputy Assistant Secretary Yun also disagreed with the assessment of a \"disciplined and flourishing democracy\" due to former SPDC officials holding key positions. The United States is skeptical about immediate policy changes in Burma due to former SPDC officials in key government positions. Ambassador Mitchell visited Burma in 2011, meeting with President Thein Sein, Aung San Suu Kyi, and ethnic group representatives. Discussions included human rights abuses and ceasefire negotiations with ethnic militias. President Thein Sein's announcement of a large-scale prisoner pardon in Burma in October 2011, which included the release of 6,359 people, including 241 political prisoners, was followed by a visit from Ambassador Mitchell and Assistant Secretary Michael Posner in November 2011 to discuss political reform, ongoing conflicts with ethnic militias, ceasefire talks, and human rights issues. President Obama sent Secretary Clinton to Burma in November 2011 to explore the potential for political reform, ceasefire talks, and human rights issues.

The Obama Administration waived a provision of the TVPA in 2012, allowing for potential technical support to Burma. In April 2012, Burma held a by-election with significant interest due to Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD participating after boycotting the 2010 elections. In April 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD participated in by-elections in Burma. Despite concerns about the election process, Suu Kyi and 42 NLD candidates won seats, with the remaining going to other parties. The Obama Administration and other countries congratulated Burma on the electoral process and Suu Kyi's strong showing.

U.S. investors in Burma can invest in all sectors and export financial services to any Burmese entity, as long as they are not on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals list. The SDN list will be regularly updated to prevent \"bad actors\" from benefiting. Criteria for listing on the SDN will likely include evaluations of business practices and attitudes towards Burma's reforms. The State Department is consulting with various stakeholders to develop voluntary corporate governance standards for U.S. companies operating in Burma. On July 11, 2012, the Obama Administration released documents to implement the easing of sanctions. On July 11, 2012, the Obama Administration eased sanctions on Burma, allowing U.S. investors to invest in all sectors and export financial services to Burmese entities.

The ban on new U.S. investments in Burma was lifted by Executive Order 13619, allowing U.S. investors to invest in all sectors and export financial services to Burmese entities. President Obama delegated authority to waive the investment ban to Secretary Clinton, which was then exercised by Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides. This waiver led to the creation of General License No. 17, permitting new investments in Burma with certain limitations. General License No. 17 allows new investments in Burma by U.S. persons with limitations, such as avoiding investments with certain entities and complying with State Department reporting requirements. Investments do not require pre-approval but must be reported if involving Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise or exceeding $500,000 in value. OFAC announced General License No. 16, allowing the exportation of financial services to Burma with restrictions. Investments in Burma over $500,000 must be reported to the State Department annually by April 1. The investment date is when parties enter a contract or a U.S. party buys ownership in a Burmese resource. General License No. 16 supersedes General License No. 14-C and 15, allowing the provision of financial services to Burma without pre-approval from OFAC. Sanctions on certain Burmese nationals were imposed by President Obama via E.O. 13619, prohibiting visas, asset freezes, and financial services for those involved in threatening Burma's stability or human rights abuses.

The Press Scrutiny and Registration Division warned publications about their coverage of the unrest. In Burma, civil unrest led to deaths, destruction of homes and businesses, and displacement of over 100,000 Rohingyas. President Thein Sein made progress in political rights and economic reform by pardoning prisoners and ending pre-publication censorship. Significant political developments occurred in the Burmese government in the summer of 2012, including a cabinet reshuffle. In August 2012, President Thein Sein reshuffled his cabinet, possibly to consolidate his political power. There was a debate over the oversight authority of the Union Parliament, which was brought before Burma's Constitutional Tribunal. The Tribunal ruled that parliamentary bodies did not have the authority to compel ministerial officials to appear before them. The Constitutional Tribunal ruled in August 2012 that parliamentary bodies lacked the authority to compel ministerial officials to testify. This decision led to protests and calls for impeachment of the tribunal members, who eventually resigned in September 2012. The Obama Administration eased sanctions on Burma in September 2012, coinciding with visits by Aung San Suu Kyi and President Thein Sein. President Thein Sein and Lower House Speaker Shwe Mann were removed from the list of Specially Designated Nationals by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.

USAID is developing programs in Burma covering democracy, human rights, rule of law, transparent governance, peace, reconciliation, food security, and health. President Obama delegated authority to waive U.S. opposition to IFI assistance to Secretary Clinton. Clinton determined it is in the national interest to support assistance for Burma, effectively waiving the requirement to oppose IFI assistance. This waiver was in reference to a pending vote by the World Bank's board for a $80 million grant to Burma. States opposed IFI assistance to Burma, but the World Bank approved an $80 million grant for community-driven development. Following the waiver, a U.S. delegation led by Assistant Secretary of State Michael Posner held a human rights dialogue in Naypyidaw with topics including rule of law and military conduct.

The Burmese government faced challenges in upholding commitments made to President Obama, with violent attacks on protesters and military assaults on ethnic armed groups. Despite some steps taken to protect rights, concerns remained about the government's commitment to political reform. Fighting between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army continued despite promises made. The Burmese Army broke a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army in 2011, leading to a major offensive named \"Operation Thunderbolt\" in December 2012. This operation involved a significant number of soldiers and aircraft, drawing international criticism for civilian casualties and human rights violations. The KIA offensive in Kachin State drew international criticism for violating instructions from President Thein Sein, reports of civilian casualties, human rights abuses, and the use of child soldiers. The Burmese government claimed self-defense, while the US urged dialogue and assistance for IDPs. The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon criticized the Burmese Army for breaking the ceasefire in Kachin State, leading to ongoing violence and civilian casualties. The U.S. called for immediate dialogue to address the conflict and provide assistance to internally displaced persons. The United States strongly opposes the ongoing fighting near the Kachin Independence Army headquarters in Laiza, resulting in civilian casualties and hindering national reconciliation efforts. Burma's Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the KIA of violating the ceasefire, labeling it as \"terrorist attacks.\" Negotiations between the Union Government and KIO/KIA took place in China, but fighting in Kachin State persists. It remains uncertain if the Tatmadaw supports the negotiations or will adhere to any agreements. The Union Government and Parliament made policy changes in early 2013 to improve civil liberties, including dissolving the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division and abolishing a military junta order restricting gatherings. The Ministry of Information in Burma repealed Order No. 2/88 for violating the constitution. A draft media legislation was sent to the Union Parliament, criticized for being more restrictive than the previous law. The move violated an agreement with the Myanmar Press Council. The draft legislation was published in the New Light of Myanmar. The draft media legislation published in the Burmese version of the New Light of Myanmar on February 27, 2013, faced criticism from journalist associations for its restrictive provisions, including prohibiting articles on ethnic conflicts and criticizing the constitution. The law also allows a MOI-appointed official to control publishing licenses, seen as a form of media censorship. Penalties for violations include imprisonment and fines, which are harsher than the previous law. The 2013 law in Burma imposes harsh penalties, including imprisonment and fines up to $12,000, which are more severe than the 1962 law.

Positive and negative developments have occurred since Burma's quasi-civilian government took power. Since Burma's quasi-civilian government took power, positive and negative developments have occurred. The Obama Administration may take credit for changes in Burma, but the political situation remains fragile. General Khin Kyunt announced a roadmap to a \"disciplined democracy\" in 2003, with the transfer of power to the Union Government in 2011. President Thein Sein has addressed critical issues in the nation. President Thein Sein has spoken about the ongoing development of democracy in Burma, but the concept of a \"disciplined democracy\" and the role of the military in a future democratic Burma are still subjects of intense political debate. The future of democracy in Burma raises questions about the balance of power between the government branches, citizenship conditions, civil liberties, and the role of the military. The military in Burma, led by Commander-in-Chief Vice Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, remains opaque and powerful. Little is known about senior military officers' attitudes towards political reforms or their role in Burma's \"disciplined democracy.\" The relationship between the military and the Union Government is also unclear, with recent ministerial changes appointing former generals to key positions. General Myat Hein was appointed as Minister for Telecommunications, and Lieutenant General Thet Niang Win as Minister of Border Affairs, with a significant number of cabinet ministers being current or former military officers. The Tatmadaw's actions suggest limited support for the Union Government and political reform, as Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hliang has not publicly confirmed orders to cease military operations against the KIO/KIA despite presidential instructions. Questions have been raised about General Min Aung Hlaing's political intentions due to his reassignment of top military personnel and the replacement of military members in the Union Parliament. General Min Aung Hlaing's political intentions have raised questions due to his reassignment of top military personnel and replacement of military members in the Union Parliament. Relations between the military and the Union Parliament are strained, with tensions highlighted by incidents such as questioning the military budget size and a parliamentary commission investigating land seizures by the military. The military in Burma has a significant presence in the economy, with regional commanders having extensive economic benefits from their political power. They are involved in sectors like mining, oil, and gas, allegedly owning major corporations. A parliamentary commission found that the military had seized over 247,000 acres of land between July 2012 and January 2013, recommending the return of most confiscated land and compensation for displaced persons. The military in Burma has a significant presence in lucrative sectors such as mining, oil, and gas, with companies like Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL) reportedly owned by the military or their associates. These conglomerates, including Myawaddy Bank and Innwa Bank, provide the military with independent revenue and control over the nation's economy. Burma's military has been involved in a civil war since 1948 due to grievances over autonomy. The military sees itself as the guardian of national integrity, as stated in the 2008 Constitution. The Union Government proposes a three-step peace process to end the civil war in Burma and reconcile with ethnic organizations. Steps include negotiating a ceasefire, broader agreements on development, and amending the 2008 Constitution. The Union Government's proposal aims to amend the 2008 Constitution while disbanding ethnic militias or merging them into the Tatmadaw. A \"peace committee\" has been established, led by President Thein Sein and Vice-President Sai Mauk Kham. Former Railway Minister Aung Min is the lead negotiator with ethnic organizations, although some prominent groups have rejected the three-step peace process. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) has proposed direct negotiations between the Union Government and the UNFC for national reconciliation. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) has proposed direct negotiations with the Union Government for national reconciliation, followed by a national conference and convention to establish a federal union of Burma. Talks with ethnic organizations have resulted in preliminary ceasefire agreements with 13 out of 21 groups, excluding the KIO/KIA. Informal discussions were held in Ruili, China in February 2013. Negotiations have been held with 13 out of 21 ethnic groups, excluding the KIO/KIA. Talks in Ruili, China in February 2013 led to an agreement for future discussions. However, no progress has been made in completing the second step of the Union Government's peace process. Key issues include disagreements over the powers of the central government versus ethnic States, and the need for approval from the Tatmadaw for any reconciliation agreement. The Burmese military's support for national reconciliation is crucial, but their participation in negotiations is lacking. The Union Government aims to incorporate ethnic groups into the governance system through the 2008 Constitution, while major ethnic groups prefer equal talks without accepting this approach. The future of the 2008 Constitution is a critical element for national reconciliation in Burma. The drafting process of the Constitution was politically problematic, with many opposition parties and ethnic organizations not participating, leading to concerns about its legitimacy and power preservation for the military. Limited public access to the Constitution before the 2008 referendum further raised doubts about its credibility. The Burmese military and Union Government consider the 2008 Constitution legitimate, despite concerns about its credibility. President Thein Sein is open to limited amendments, including potential changes to the Tatmadaw's privileged status in the Union Parliament. The Tatmadaw is open to limited changes to the constitution, but not ones that would fundamentally alter their special status. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD, seek amendments to the 2008 Constitution, including provisions that bar Aung San Suu Kyi from serving as President. Ethnic organizations do not accept the 2008 Constitution and prefer direct negotiations with the Union Government and Tatmadaw for changes. The opposition groups are unlikely to comply with the provisions for amending the constitution and prefer direct negotiations with the Union Government and Tatmadaw for changes. The requirements to amend the constitution may be too arduous to implement a negotiated agreement. The constitution requires the support of 75% of members and certain sections need approval from over 50% of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum. These sections include government structure, military's role, state of emergency, presidential eligibility, and amendment requirements. The Burmese military's requirements for amending the Constitution imply the need for their support, which could pose a challenge. Approval by over 50% of eligible voters is necessary, with voter turnout being a potential issue. The 113th Congress may play a more active role in U.S. policy towards Burma during this political transition. The 113th Congress may play a more active role in U.S. policy towards Burma during this political transition, with critics divided on the Obama Administration's approach towards Burma.

The reopening of the USAID mission in Rangoon and plans for expansion will require additional federal funding, which may be affected by budget constraints such as sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires a 5% reduction in funding for FY2013. Sequestration allows for reprogramming of funds by the Department of State and USAID. Post-sequestration funding levels for Burma are uncertain, but a rough estimate could be a 5% reduction from FY2012 estimates. Once final FY2013 funding legislation is passed, funding levels can be determined. The Department of State can determine country and program allocations after Congress passes final FY2013 funding legislation, including reprogramming to calculate sequestration at the country level. Burma is expected to undergo significant political and economic changes leading up to its 2015 parliamentary elections.
