    "content": "Pakistan is crucial to U.S. interests due to its role in combating religious militancy and addressing various policy concerns such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and regional tensions with India. Despite past cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, doubts about Islamabad's commitment to U.S. interests have deepened in recent years. Pakistan's mixed record on battling Islamist extremism includes ongoing tolerance of Afghan insurgents and anti-India militants. The country's troubled economic and political conditions, along with security challenges and difficult relations with neighbors, present serious challenges to U.S. decision makers. Islamist radicalism has spread in Pakistan, with the border region near Afghanistan serving as a haven for insurgents. Islamabad claims heavy losses in civilian lives, security forces, and financial losses in the \"war on extremism.\" The \"war on extremism\" in Pakistan has resulted in over 37,000 civilian deaths, 6,300 security forces casualties, and $78 billion in financial losses. The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center reported over 26 terrorist attacks per week in Pakistan in 2011, with only Afghanistan and Iraq experiencing more incidents. Relations between the U.S. and Pakistan became tense after the discovery of Osama bin Laden's presence in Pakistan, leading to accusations of Pakistani support for Afghan insurgents by Admiral Mike Mullen in 2011. In late November 2011, NATO troops in Afghanistan were attacked by Pakistani army outposts near the border at Salala, resulting in 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. A Pentagon investigation blamed poor coordination and miscommunication, leading to Pakistan's fury and the scrapping of bilateral agreements with the U.S. regarding supply lines into Afghanistan. Following the incident at Salala in late November 2011, Pakistani officials moved to scrap and renegotiate all existing bilateral agreements with the United States related to supply lines into Afghanistan. Islamabad demanded a full apology from Washington for restored cooperation, leading to the closure of the Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) that allow NATO supplies to transit into Afghanistan. Despite anticipation of a deal to reopen them, the GLOCs remain closed, with Pakistani negotiators seeking a significant increase in fees per truck. The Pakistani negotiators sought a significant fee increase for NATO supply trucks, leading to a deadlock in negotiations. A Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence, prompting backlash from the US, including a threat to dock $1 million from aid funding each year of the sentence. The US Administration expressed disbelief in the conviction of a Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation. Bilateral relations between the two countries have been strained, with anti-American sentiments prevalent in Pakistan and negative views of Pakistan increasing among Americans. Travel warnings have been issued for Americans in Pakistan due to high risks. The State Department warns of high travel risks in Pakistan, with American diplomats facing restrictions. American civilians, including Daniel Pearl, have been abducted in the past decade. Islamist extremism in Pakistan is a major concern for U.S. foreign policy, hindering progress on key goals like defeating terrorist groups and resolving regional conflicts. There are fears of American citizens being recruited for terrorism in Pakistan, where several top U.S. enemies are believed to be hiding. Several top U.S. enemies, including Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, Taliban chief Mullah Omar, and Haqqani Network leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, are believed to be residing in Pakistan. There is growing skepticism in Congress about the effectiveness of current U.S. policy towards Pakistan, with calls to reduce or eliminate foreign aid to the country. In FY2012, Congress allocated about $2 billion in direct aid to Pakistan, making it one of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign assistance. In May 2012, Congress allocated $2 billion in direct aid for Pakistan, making it a top recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States expressed concerns about restrictions on aid hindering cooperation. The closure of Pakistani GLOCs to Afghanistan did not have the expected impact, leading to potential diplomatic isolation. Working positively with the U.S. and NATO may be necessary to change this course. By bowing to domestic political pressures, Pakistan's negotiating strategy could result in losing foreign assistance and influence in post-war Afghanistan. President Obama urged Pakistan to expand its role in securing the region and neutralize terrorist safe havens. Despite complications, the U.S. acknowledged the necessity of maintaining a relationship with Pakistan. Until a potential breakdown in 2012, cooperation with the U.S. and NATO is crucial for Pakistan. The United States has no choice but to maintain a relationship with Pakistan, despite some advocating for a more confrontational approach. The US has increased nonmilitary aid to Pakistan while conditioning military aid on progress in combating militancy and promoting democratic institutions. In July 2011, the US suspended $800 million in security assistance to Pakistan, pending further evaluation of cooperation and progress. The US has suspended up to $800 million in security assistance to Pakistan and is rigorously evaluating cooperation before releasing further aid. $1 billion in approved coalition support fund reimbursements also remains undisbursed due to disagreements. Pakistani behavior is unlikely to change due to long-held geostrategic perspectives, leading to continued tolerance of safe havens for militant groups. Analysts suggest full support for Pakistan's civilian authorities. The Pakistan military's policy behavior is driven by perceived strategic interests, leading analysts to advocate for strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian authorities. Despite calls for a strong civilian government, there is little progress in addressing security policies and extremism within Pakistan. Civilian leaders continue to deflect blame onto the United States. The Pakistani civilian leaders deflect blame onto the United States for extremism, while also participating in supporting Islamist militancy. President Obama's decision to visit India without stopping in Pakistan raised concerns among Pakistani officials about a perceived \"pro-India\" tilt in Washington. The Administration's India policies, including U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation and alignment with New Delhi on regional terrorism, are seen as threatening by Pakistani leaders and citizens. Pakistan feels increasingly encircled by India and the U.S., leading to strained bilateral relations. The events of 2011, particularly the Salala incident, have led to a shift in bilateral relations between the U.S. and Pakistan. Analysts predict a more narrow, transactional engagement moving forward, with a focus on formal, business-like interactions and potential restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance to Pakistan. This marks a departure from the previous vision of a broad strategic partnership. The FY2013 congressional legislation may impose new restrictions on U.S. foreign aid to Pakistan. Analysts suggest a more transactional relationship to avoid noncooperation. Ambassador Sherry Rehman outlined Pakistan's conditions for resetting the bilateral relationship, including apologizing for the Salala incident and halting drone strikes. The current situation involves suspended CSF reimbursements, increasing counterterrorism intelligence sharing, halting drone strikes, and shifting to a \"trade not aid\" policy. Former U.S. diplomats suggest forging a more normal relationship by reducing mutual expectations, better targeting economic aid programs, fostering business ties, and supporting initiatives for regional stability. Another expert sees optimism in the Pakistani military's more humble status. Another South Asia expert and former advisor to Amb. Holbrooke is optimistic about the Pakistani military's humble domestic status and improvements in Pakistan-India relations. He warns against an overly security-focused approach by the Obama Administration, which could fuel anti-American sentiment and bolster the military's credibility. Some U.S. analysts criticize Pakistan's 2012 stance on GLOCs and the Salala incident, viewing it as a missed opportunity for cooperation. Pressure on Islamabad for counterterrorism is advised, given Pakistan's diminished leverage. Some commentators urge the U.S. government to pressure Islamabad on counterterrorism, with suggestions ranging from focused hostility to considering Pakistan an enemy of the United States. Calls for a more adversarial posture towards Pakistan have been made, including holding its military and intelligence services accountable and cutting military aid. Some suggest targeting individuals for sanction and cutting military aid to pressure Pakistan on counterterrorism. There are calls to consider Pakistan an enemy of the United States in terms of Afghanistan policy. Threatening to end all assistance and retaliate if Pakistan does not comply may convince Pakistani leaders to cooperate. However, others argue against a more adversarial approach, fearing it could jeopardize the U.S.-led project in Afghanistan. The Pakistani analyst opposes a \"two Pakistans\" approach, suggesting a more passive U.S. strategy focused on providing security assurances and strengthening civilian governance. The Pakistani military's cooperation with India may be tactical to ease pressure, but it's unclear if it signifies a strategic shift. Pakistan may benefit from a Pashtun-influenced government in Kabul, but the outcome remains uncertain. Pakistan's geostrategic status may suffer from international isolation despite potential tactical victories in Afghanistan. The country should prioritize energy and trade cooperation with neighbors over conflict with India and \"strategic depth\" in Afghanistan. Security services and public opinion hinder civilian leaders from pursuing more robust policies. On January 4, 2011, Governor Salman Taseer of Punjab province was assassinated for criticizing blasphemy laws in Pakistan. His killer, Malik Mumtaz Qadri, was hailed as a hero by some. The assassination dealt a blow to liberal forces in the country. The assassination of Minorities Minister Shabaz Bhatti in Pakistan on March 2, 2011, was another blow to liberal forces. Bhatti, a Christian member of the federal cabinet, was killed by gunmen for advocating tolerance towards religious minorities and reform of blasphemy laws. Secretary Clinton condemned the killing as an attack on values of tolerance and respect. President Zardari also addressed the assassinations, stating that a minority is trying to undermine Pakistan's founding principles of tolerance. The Taseer and Bhatti assassinations in Pakistan highlighted the rise of Islamist radicalism. In January 2011, Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor, shot and killed two men in Lahore, claiming self-defense. Despite diplomatic immunity claims, Pakistani authorities accused him of murder. President Obama referred to Davis as \"our diplomat.\" In January 2011, Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor, shot and killed two men in Lahore, claiming self-defense. Despite diplomatic immunity claims, Pakistani authorities accused him of murder. The U.S. government later admitted Davis was a CIA contractor tracking militant groups in Pakistan. The controversy around his legal status led to tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan, with some in Congress suggesting reduced assistance. Senator Kerry traveled to Islamabad to ease tensions, expressing sorrow for the loss of life. After weeks of negotiations and a pledge of $2.3 million in \"blood money,\" Davis was freed on March 16, 2011. After weeks of closed-door negotiations and political pressure by Pakistani officials, Raymond Davis was freed with a pledge of $2.3 million in \"blood money.\" Following this, Osama bin Laden was located and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, raising doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism and leading to calls to reduce U.S. assistance. The news of Osama bin Laden's whereabouts raised doubts about Pakistan's commitment to defeating extremism, leading to calls to curtail U.S. assistance. President Obama's advisor suggested that bin Laden must have had support in Pakistan, causing observers to question Pakistani officials' complicity or incompetence in the search for Al Qaeda leaders. Pakistan's credibility suffered a blow as a result. Pakistan's credibility suffered a serious blow when most-wanted extremist figures were found in the country. The military and intelligence services faced criticism for failing to detect a foreign military raid and the presence of the world's most-wanted terrorist. Army Chief Gen. Kayani warned against future incursions, leading to a strong condemnation by Parliament and threats to close vital supply lines to NATO troops in Afghanistan. Public demonstrations turned anti-American, fueling bilateral distrust and acrimony. The developments in Pakistan led to public demonstrations with an anti-American tone, fueling distrust and acrimony. Congress questioned the wisdom of continued engagement with a government possibly aware of Osama bin Laden's whereabouts. Despite calls for greater oversight, some senior Members advocated for more engagement with Pakistan. Independent observers noted the necessity of maintaining ties with Pakistan, likening it to a \"bad marriage.\" President Obama and top U.S. officials maintained a stance of continued engagement. Despite ample reasons for discouragement and distrust, the United States continued to engage with Pakistan post-Abbottabad raid. President Obama and top officials maintained a positive posture while acknowledging questions about bin Laden's refuge. There was no conclusive evidence of official Pakistan's awareness of bin Laden's whereabouts. Some senior Administration officials were divided on the future of the relationship, with calls for strong reprisals. In a separate incident, militants attacked Pakistan's naval base, resulting in casualties on both sides. Militants attacked Pakistan's naval base, killing ten security personnel and four militants in a 16-hour gun battle. They destroyed two U.S.-supplied aircraft, leading to criticism of the Pakistani military's security measures and raising concerns about the safety of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Suspicions of inside help for the attackers were raised. The attack on Pakistan's naval base raised concerns about the safety of the country's nuclear weapons. Suspicions of inside help for the attackers led to the arrest of a former navy commando. Three navy officers, including the base commander, are facing court-martial for negligence. The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who linked the attack to Al Qaeda infiltration in the navy. The journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad was allegedly murdered by senior ISI officials to silence critics, according to U.S. officials. The Pakistani government's Commission of Inquiry was unable to identify the culprits behind Shahzad's murder. In January 2012, a Commission of Inquiry in Pakistan recommended making intelligence agencies more law-abiding and accountable. The Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million in security-related aid to Pakistan due to reduced military trainer presence and obstacles in fulfilling agreements. The Obama Administration suspended aid to Pakistan due to reduced military presence and delays in visa processing, signaling a warning for improved cooperation. Pakistani military downplayed the impact, suggesting reprogramming security assistance towards development projects. In October 2011, Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz wrote an op-ed referencing a memo allegedly dictated to him by the Pakistani Ambassador, requesting US assistance to prevent a military coup and install friendly leaders for cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. In October 2011, a memo scandal known as \"Memogate\" erupted in Pakistan, implicating Ambassador Haqqani in seeking US help to prevent a military coup and install pro-US leaders. The investigation, led by the Pakistani Supreme Court, raised concerns of civil-military clashes and potential overthrow of President Zardari. Despite lack of concrete evidence, Haqqani faced pressure and eventually left Pakistan. The civil-military clash in Pakistan raised concerns of President Zardari facing overthrow by the military. In response to the memo scandal, army and intelligence officers confirmed the memo's authenticity, leading to tensions with the civilian government. Despite rumors of a military coup, the army publicly pledged support for democracy. Prime Minister Gilani criticized the military's actions as unconstitutional and illegal. The civil-military clash in Pakistan escalated as Prime Minister Gilani criticized the army and intelligence chiefs for engaging the court without government consent. Despite tensions, the Pakistani public is against military rule, with Parliament reaffirming its supremacy and urging all parties to stay within constitutional limits. The crisis atmosphere eased as Gilani softened his criticisms, and the likelihood of a military coup is considered low. In November 2011, U.S. ground forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border were attacked by Pakistani soldiers, leading to the death of 24 soldiers. The incident occurred as U.S. commanders were unaware of the presence of Pakistani army outposts in the area. In November 2011, Pakistani soldiers were killed during a U.S. air assault near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The incident led to Pakistani anger and the closure of NATO's ground logistics routes through Pakistan. Prime Minister Gilani condemned the attacks as a breach of sovereignty and violation of international law. Pakistani government rejected U.S. expressions of regret. The Pakistani government demands a formal apology from the U.S. for the 2011 air assault that led to the closure of NATO's ground logistics routes through Pakistan. The Pentagon's investigation concluded that U.S. forces acted in self-defense, but Pakistan's military called the blame on them unjustified and unacceptable. Pakistan's military criticized the blame placed on them for the 2011 air assault, releasing a document in January 2012 detailing their perspective. They admitted to firing first but justified it, blaming the incident on the failure of US/ISAF to share information with Pakistan. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the incident, hoping it would reopen the ground logistics routes through Pakistan. In response to the 2011 air assault incident, the Obama Administration considered issuing an apology to Pakistan to reopen ground logistics routes. Advocates believed it would mend relations, but opponents feared it would show weakness. Secretary Clinton planned to apologize in February, but it was canceled after Koran burnings in Afghanistan. Later, with insurgent attacks blamed on the Haqqani Network, calls for an apology quieted. Relations were further strained in February 2012 by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. In February 2012, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing on Baluchistan, a Pakistani province with a separatist conflict. A witness called for the partition of Pakistan, including Baluchistan. Subcommittee Chairman Dana Rohrabacher introduced a resolution supporting Baluchistan's right to self-determination, angering the Islamabad government and sparking criticism from the Pakistani media. Prime Minister Gilani called it an attack on Pakistani sovereignty. The resolution supporting Baluchistan's right to self-determination sparked criticism from the Pakistani media and led to a freeze in relations with the United States. The review process by the Islamabad government was seen as a sign of assertiveness by some, while others viewed it as a civilian facade for military policy making. The Islamabad government's review process was seen as a civilian facade for military policy making. The 14-point \"Guidelines for Revised Terms of Engagement with the United States\" included demands like the immediate cessation of U.S.-launched drone attacks in Pakistan and seeking an unconditional apology for the NATO/ISAF attack. The Islamabad government's review process resulted in 14-point guidelines for revised terms of engagement with the United States, including demands for an unconditional apology for the NATO/ISAF attack, cessation of drone attacks, and no foreign bases on Pakistani territory. Additionally, the review requested a civil nuclear deal similar to the one offered to India in 2005. The Obama Administration has emphasized respect for Pakistani sovereignty throughout this process. The Obama Administration has expressed respect for Pakistani sovereignty during the review process. U.S. Special Representative Marc Grossman visited Islamabad for talks but no breakthrough was achieved, especially regarding Pakistan's demand to cease drone strikes. The CIA's use of drone strikes, including \"signature strikes,\" remains a contentious issue. Pakistani leaders may refuse to open NATO supply lines until drone strikes cease. Pakistan also demands an apology for the accidental deaths of its soldiers at Salala. The U.S. government is withholding $1 billion in military reimbursements and counterterrorism funding. At present, major issues between the U.S. and Pakistan remain unresolved, with the U.S. withholding $1 billion in military reimbursements. Pakistan insists on following Parliament's recommendations. Pakistan boycotted a NATO summit in 2011 but attended the 2012 summit in Chicago after a personal invitation to President Zardari from the NATO Secretary-General. President Zardari received a personal call to attend the NATO summit in Chicago, but tensions with the U.S. overshadowed the event. President Obama refused to meet with Zardari, causing embarrassment for Pakistan. Despite this, Foreign Minister Khar remained positive about Pakistan's participation. On May 23, 2012, a tribal court in northwestern Pakistan convicted Shakil Afridi of treason and sentenced him to 33 years in prison for his involvement with the CIA in collecting DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. The sentence sparked outrage in the United States. The Obama Administration and Senate Armed Services Committee criticized the 33-year sentence of Shakil Afridi for treason in Pakistan, stating he should be praised, not punished. Islamabad defends the legal process but concerns remain about lack of legal representation and appeal rights. The Obama Administration and Senate Armed Services Committee criticized the 33-year sentence of Shakil Afridi for treason in Pakistan, stating he should be praised, not punished. Concerns remain about lack of legal representation and appeal rights as he was convicted in a court outside the original jurisdiction without legal representation. The Administration's assessment of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy in March 2011 noted static progress against key U.S. objectives, except for significant progress in combating Al Qaeda. Improved cooperation within Pakistani armed forces and with NATO was observed, but there was no progress in executing the counterinsurgency cycle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The lack of 'hold' and 'build' planning in ongoing clearing operations in Tribal Areas poses a challenge in defeating the insurgency in Pakistan. Despite a certification by Secretary Clinton in March 2011 confirming Pakistan's efforts against terrorist groups, concerns remain about Islamabad's support to extremists and terrorist groups. The certification by Secretary Clinton in March 2011 confirmed Pakistan's efforts against terrorist groups, focusing on ceasing support to extremist and terrorist groups, preventing Al Qaeda from operating in Pakistan, and dismantling terrorist bases. However, skepticism arose due to political considerations rather than ground realities. No similar certification was issued for FY2012. The Administration's September 2011 assessment for FY2012 showed little positive news in Pakistan. Indicators for civilian control, COIN capabilities, and international community involvement remained static or declined, attributed to decreased security cooperation. The international community's involvement in stabilizing Pakistan has seen limited progress, with the IMF Stand-By Arrangement on hold since August 2010. The Pentagon's report highlighted the Taliban insurgency in Pakistan as a critical threat to security in Afghanistan. Kabul continues to face security threats planned from Pakistan. The security situation in eastern Afghanistan is volatile, with Kabul facing persistent threats planned from Pakistan. Pakistan's counterinsurgency operations and support for insurgent safe havens undermine security in Afghanistan. U.S. leaders believe Pakistan's desire for a Pashtun-led Afghan government with limited Indian influence drives its support for insurgent sanctuaries. U.S.-Pakistan relations have also been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan. U.S.-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan and the revelation of U.S. citizens working for the ISI to influence U.S. Kashmir policy. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and the bilateral Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010. In October 2011, the Obama Administration sent a high-level delegation to Islamabad led by Secretary Clinton to address the issue of militant safe havens in western Pakistan. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue has been postponed indefinitely, with formal talks including Secretary Clinton not taking place as originally planned in March 2011. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue at the ministerial level has been postponed indefinitely, with formal talks involving Secretary Clinton not happening as scheduled in March 2011. However, engagement has continued at other levels, with Secretary Clinton meeting Foreign Minister Khar in February 2012 to discuss bilateral relations and areas of mutual interest such as counterterrorism and Afghanistan. Ambassador Grossman also emphasized the U.S.' commitment to a constructive relationship with Pakistan during a meeting with President Zardari in March. In Dushanbe, Tajikistan, the United States expressed its desire for a positive relationship with Pakistan, focusing on counterterrorism and stability in Afghanistan. President Obama and Prime Minister Gilani discussed shared interests at a nuclear security summit in Seoul. Military commanders from both countries met in Rawalpindi to address border coordination issues. In April, high-level U.S. officials engaged in talks with Pakistani counterparts to address border coordination issues and strengthen bilateral ties through civilian assistance and development support. The discussions aimed to achieve a balanced approach that respects Pakistan's sovereignty while addressing U.S. national security concerns. The Trilateral Core Group meeting between the United States, Pakistan, and Afghanistan focused on reopening GLOCs and Pakistan's opposition to drone strikes. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi in mid-May. Missile strikes by American UAVs in Pakistan have been controversial but effective against militants. The controversial drone strikes in Pakistan, launched by American UAVs, are overseen by the CIA with President Obama approving the targeting. These strikes have been effective against militants but criticized for civilian casualties and violating Pakistani sovereignty, fueling anti-American sentiment. The Pakistani government condemns drone strikes as a violation of sovereignty and international law, but some analysts see them as necessary and effective against militants. Despite official rejection, there is debate and evidence suggesting Pakistan's tacit approval and support for the strikes. The drone campaign against Al Qaeda and its allies in Pakistan has shown effectiveness, with strikes following key events like the release of Raymond Davis and the suspension of U.S. military aid. There are differing opinions within the Administration on the wisdom of continuing UAV strikes, with concerns about the strained relationship with Pakistan and the risk of destabilization. The White House review in mid-2011 reaffirmed support for the CIA drone campaign with changes to involve the State Department in strike decisions and provide more notice to Pakistani officials. The number of \"signature strikes\" against large groups of suspected militants decreased as a result. President Obama defended the drone program, claiming no collateral deaths due to its precision capabilities. President Obama defended the CIA drone program, claiming it had not caused many civilian casualties despite independent analysts estimating 145-535 civilian deaths. The violence in western Pakistan has not subsided despite the killing of militants and commanders. The U.S. government may have no better option than to continue using drones, given the upcoming NATO troop drawdown in Afghanistan. Close U.S. links with Pakistan's ISI date back to the 1980s. Close U.S. links with Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) date back to the 1980s, when American and Pakistani intelligence officers oversaw cooperative efforts to train Afghan \"freedom fighters\" against the Soviet Army. Mutual mistrust has been present, with doubts about ISI's activities and aims compounded in 2008. The agency, under army control, is implicated in extralegal abductions and manipulation of domestic politics. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam replaced Lt. Gen. Pasha as DG-ISI in March 2012. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam replaced Lt. Gen. Pasha as DG-ISI in March 2012. He is seen as a potential candidate for the Chief of Army Staff position after Kayani's retirement in 2012. U.S. officials have accused the ISI of supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance. There are concerns that ISI continues to support Afghan militants, with reports of increased direct contacts with the Taliban in late 2011. The ISI has been accused of increasing direct support to Afghan insurgents, encouraging violence, and supplying them with explosives. A leaked NATO report suggests that the ISI manipulates Taliban leadership and maintains regular contact with them for strategic advice. Despite these allegations, NATO officials downplay the report's significance, while Pakistan's foreign minister dismisses it as old news. The ISI is also linked to anti-India terrorist groups. The ISI has been accused of supporting Afghan insurgents and terrorist groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. Secretary of State Clinton stated that elements of the Pakistani government have connections with terrorist groups. Pakistani officials deny any cooperation with militants, but independent observers believe that Pakistan's security services are infiltrated by extremists. Pakistan's security services are believed to be infiltrated by Islamist extremists, with some military officers receiving biased training against the United States. The security services can be divided into two groups: one led by Gen. Kayani, which is nationalist, and the other driven by a revisionist Islamist ideology. CIA-ISI relations were strained even before the Raymond Davis incident, with American officials frustrated at the lack of Pakistani military cooperation and concerns about ISI support for militant groups. Following the Davis affair, Pakistani officials were angered by the presence of U.S. security officials and contractors in Pakistan. The ISI demanded accountability for all CIA operatives in the country after Davis was revealed to be a CIA contractor. OBL's death raised suspicions of ISI links to Islamist extremism, leading Pakistan to crack down on its citizens working with the CIA and eventually granting American investigators access to bin Laden's widows in Pakistani custody. After Osama bin Laden's death, a Pakistani newspaper revealed the name of the CIA's Islamabad station chief, the second time in six months. U.S. officials believed these disclosures were deliberate by the ISI to show its leverage and express anger at U.S. policies. The ISI leadership was increasingly confronted with evidence of collusion between Pakistani officials and Afghan insurgents, including instances where the CIA alerted Islamabad about bomb-making facilities in FATA that were found abandoned by Pakistani army units. After the ISI alerted Islamabad about bomb-making facilities in FATA, Pakistani army units found the sites abandoned, leading U.S. officials to suspect tip-offs. The Pakistani military denied the accusations, citing incorrect intelligence. Despite interagency discord, joint intelligence work continued, resulting in the arrest of a Yemeni Al Qaeda operative in Karachi with U.S. assistance. A Yemeni national, described as a senior Al Qaeda operative, was arrested in Karachi with U.S.-provided intelligence shortly after the OBL raid. Mohammed Ali Qasim Yaqub was a key courier between Al Qaeda leaders, and his capture was seen as a Pakistani effort to mend relations with the U.S. Additionally, Pakistan pledged to grant visas to CIA officers and reported the deaths of Ilyas Kashmiri and Atiyah Abd al-Rahman in drone strikes in June and August 2011. Pakistan also announced the arrest of three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta in September. In September, Pakistan announced the arrest of three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta with CIA assistance. Bilateral intelligence cooperation targeting Al Qaeda and the \"Pakistani Taliban\" has continued despite worsening government relations. The CIA has reportedly established a network of \"secret friends\" in Pakistan to counter less trustworthy army and ISI officials. Pakistani leaders aim for strategic depth with Central Asia and India through friendly relations with Afghanistan. Pakistan's policy of seeking \"strategic depth\" with India through friendly relations with Afghanistan has historical roots, including support for Afghan mujahideen fighters and the Taliban regime. The Durand Line, dividing Pashtun tribes, remains a point of contention between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both countries are key U.S. allies in combating Islamic militancy, but ongoing tensions between Islamabad and Kabul are detrimental to American interests. The relationship between Islamabad and Kabul is harmful to U.S. interests. American and Pakistani goals in Afghanistan are not fully compatible, with little agreement beyond a desire for a stable and secure Afghanistan. Pakistan aims for an Afghanistan dependent on Islamabad, while the U.S. coalition seeks an independent Afghanistan that may align more with India. Pakistan is believed to use proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network in dealings with Kabul. The US continues to rely on Pakistan for support in Afghan reconciliation talks, despite tensions over differing approaches. Americans want to \"fight, talk, build,\" while Pakistanis prefer a \"cease-fire, talk, wait for Americans to leave\" strategy. Pakistani officials are confused by unclear US goals for Afghanistan and pressure to use force against militants in North Waziristan. Washington risks rewarding Pakistan without clarity on objectives. Washington plans to use force against anti-Kabul militants in North Waziristan while seeking peace talks with other insurgent groups. Concerns arise about rewarding Pakistani intransigence and the ISI's alleged support for insurgent forces. Despite troubled relations, Pakistani cooperation is seen as crucial for Afghan reconciliation and long-term stability. Safe havens for Afghan insurgents are identified in Pakistani cities, hindering pacification efforts in southern and eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban's resurgence in mid-2000s was facilitated by sanctuaries in western Pakistan's tribal agencies. Afghan officials accuse Pakistan of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan, leading to wariness of Pakistani influence. Islamabad's use of \"Pashtun jihadi proxies\" and military dominance ambitions raise concerns. The U.S. presence in Afghanistan not being long-term discomfits Islamabad. The Pakistani military aims to dominate its Afghan neighbors, but is concerned about the U.S. potentially abandoning the region. President Obama's announcement of a military drawdown in 2011 signaled a focus on an exit strategy, causing unease among stakeholders. Pakistani leaders emphasize the importance of Afghan stability and have made efforts to accelerate the peace process. In 2011, Gilani aimed to strengthen ties between Kabul and Islamabad, moving away from the US and towards China. The Joint Commission meetings emphasized Afghan-led peace efforts, but tensions arose due to \"reverse infiltration.\" In 2011, tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan escalated due to \"reverse infiltration\" incidents, leading to accusations and counter-accusations of cross-border attacks and rocket firings. Pakistan denied involvement in any attacks, but some in Afghanistan viewed the actions as part of a larger effort to exert control over Afghanistan. Relations hit a low point in September 2011. In September 2011, Afghan-Pakistan relations deteriorated further after the assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani in Kabul. Afghan officials accused the ISI of involvement, leading to increased tensions between the two countries. Afghan intelligence also foiled a plot to assassinate President Karzai, with the alleged culprits based in the FATA region and linked to Al Qaeda and the Haqqani network. Islamabad denied any role in the attacks but Afghan President continued to accuse Pakistan of supporting terrorism. Pakistan strongly supports peace efforts with the Afghan Taliban, aiming to control which Taliban figures can negotiate to prevent Indian influence in post-conflict Afghanistan. In 2010, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a key Taliban commander, was captured in a joint ISI-CIA operation in Karachi, possibly orchestrated by Pakistani elements to facilitate talks with \"willing\" Taliban commanders. Pakistani elements orchestrated Baradar's arrest to facilitate talks with Taliban commanders for reconciliation negotiations. ISI's motives may have been to thwart negotiations. Pakistan aimed to exploit the political situation for maximal influence in post-conflict Kabul. NATO facilitated secret meetings between QST figures, Haqqani Network, and Afghan officials. Unclear if Pakistani officials were involved. In 2011, there were reports of ISI officials participating in talks with Afghan insurgents, indicating Islamabad's influence. The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan requested Pakistan's support for reconciliation talks, as Afghan President Karzai complained about insurgent leaders in Pakistan being controlled by Islamabad. By early 2012, Islamabad allowed U.S.-Taliban negotiations to proceed, with Karzai asking Pakistani leaders to influence the Taliban. The U.S.-Taliban negotiations were allowed to proceed with Afghan President Karzai requesting Pakistani leaders to influence the Taliban. Despite initial skepticism, Prime Minister Gilani made an appeal for Afghan Taliban leaders to participate in reconciliation efforts. Concerns remain about Pakistan's ties to Afghan insurgent groups. Observers fear U.S. transition planning in Afghanistan is a cover for a quick exit strategy. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, is seen as the most dangerous Afghan insurgent group. They pose a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. The group maintains close ties with al-Qaeda and is considered irreconcilable, requiring sustained military offensives beyond 2012. Islamabad officials have been hesitant to act on U.S. requests regarding the Haqqani Network. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, poses a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. Islamabad officials have been hesitant to launch operations against the Haqqanis in North Waziristan, citing stretched military forces. The Haqqanis have carried out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including the Intercontinental Hotel assault in June 2011 and a truck bomb attack on a U.S. military base in September. The Haqqani Network's attacks in Afghanistan, including the Intercontinental Hotel assault and a truck bomb attack on a U.S. military base, have raised concerns about Afghan stability and U.S. security. A well-planned attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul further strained U.S.-Pakistan relations, leading to calls for Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases. Days after the Haqqani Network's attacks in Afghanistan, Admiral Mullen urged General Kayani for Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases. Mullen escalated pressure on Pakistan, accusing the ISI of supporting the Haqqanis in a \"proxy war\" in Afghanistan. Secretary Panetta issued a warning to Pakistan, stating the US would protect its forces in Afghanistan from future Haqqani attacks. Mullen's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee highlighted the Haqqani network's ties to Pakistan's ISI. The Haqqani network, acting as an arm of Pakistan's ISI, was responsible for various attacks in Afghanistan, including a truck bomb attack and assault on the embassy. Secretary Panetta emphasized the need to pressure Pakistan to address the issue. The statements signaled a new level of U.S. intolerance for Pakistan's double-game in the region. President Obama did not fully align with Admiral Mullen's accusations. The Obama Administration did not fully align with Admiral Mullen's accusations regarding Pakistan's double-game in the region. President Obama mentioned unclear intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship but urged Pakistan to address the issue. Secretary Clinton's attitude towards the Haqqanis hardened after the Wardak truck bombing. Pakistan denies responsibility for attacks in Afghanistan and rejects claims of supporting the Haqqanis. Pakistani officials deny supporting the Haqqanis and conducting a proxy war in Afghanistan. President Zardari warns against damaging the bilateral relationship with verbal assaults. Pakistan has been trying to facilitate peace talks between the Haqqanis and the Kabul government, but their links with Al Qaeda remain a major obstacle. Pakistan is believed to have influence over the Haqqanis and could potentially push them towards negotiations. The Pakistani military claims they can bring the Haqqani Network to the negotiating table to avoid a military conflict. There is pressure on the Obama Administration to designate the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Islamabad's involvement in negotiations could give them a central role in the process, which some in Washington wish to avoid. The Obama Administration is under pressure to designate the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under U.S. law. Seven Haqqani leaders have been sanctioned since 2008, and there have been negotiations with the Haqqani leadership in the past. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate but has not progressed in the House committee. Congressional frustration is growing over the delay in making a decision on the FTO designation. The Senate passed the Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act in 2011, but it has not advanced in the House committee. Congressional frustration is increasing over the delay in designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Ammonium nitrate is a widely used fertilizer and explosive precursor in Afghanistan, with most IEDs using it. Illicit AN in Afghanistan is believed to come from Pakistan. Despite historic peaks in IED events in 2011, improved detection and clearing capabilities have reduced the effective IED attack rate. The historic peaks of IED events in Afghanistan in 2011 have seen a decline in effective IED attack rates due to improved detection and clearing capabilities. Legislation required a report on countering IED-related networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the US urging Islamabad to restrict access to ammonium nitrate (AN) or enhance border security to prevent its movement into Afghanistan. Washington's efforts focus on diplomatic, law enforcement, and scientific initiatives. Operation Global Shield is a multilateral law enforcement operation launched in late 2010 to combat the illicit cross-border diversion and trafficking of chemical explosives precursors, including AN. The program, a collaborative effort of various organizations, has achieved notable successes. Operation Global Shield, a multilateral law enforcement operation launched in late 2010 to combat the illicit trafficking of chemical explosives precursors, including ammonium nitrate (AN), has seen successes. Experts recommend adding urea fertilizer granules to AN to complicate processing for explosives. Other options include adding colored dyes or radio frequency identification tags for easier tracking. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, the country's largest fertilizer complex, has produced over 300,000 metric tons of AN annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad to further restrict AN and other precursors remains in draft stage, with no imminent changes expected. The Islamabad government has established a National Counter-IED Forum for Pakistani agencies to collaborate on an action plan. The United States relies on Pakistani authorities for anti-corruption efforts. NATO's supply routes through Pakistan have been closed for six months due to tensions with Washington. In 2008, insurgents targeted supply routes from Karachi to Kandahar, destroying trucks and killing drivers. Truck drivers often pay bribes to officials, and stolen cargo is sold in Peshawar markets. The U.S. military began testing alternative routes to reduce reliance on Pakistan. The U.S. military began testing alternative routes to reduce reliance on Pakistan for supply routes. The \"Northern Distribution Network\" (NDN) from Central Asia and Russia now carries over half of NATO's supplies, but only nonlethal cargo. Loss of Pakistani routes has not been as damaging as expected for Afghan operations. British deputy commander of ISAF forces mentioned managing well without Pakistani routes, but reopening them would be helpful. The closure of Pakistani supply routes has not had as much of a negative impact as anticipated. The Pentagon's report highlighted concerns about the backlog of equipment for Afghan security forces. NATO will need to remove a significant amount of equipment when withdrawing from Afghanistan. NATO needs to remove a large amount of equipment and vehicles worth $30 billion when withdrawing from Afghanistan. U.S. commanders pushed for reopening Pakistani supply routes before the spring fighting season in 2012. Pakistani officials indicated that the routes would reopen soon, with reports of a proposed fee per truck. Before the Chicago summit, Pakistani negotiators proposed a drastic fee increase of $5,000 per truck for NATO supply routes, causing controversy and labeled as \"extortion\" by some. Negotiations on this issue have not yet been resolved. Islamist extremism has been a significant issue in Pakistani society since 2007, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. Pakistani society has seen a rise in Islamist violence since 2007, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. There is also a separatist insurgency in Baluchistan and politically motivated violence in Karachi. Despite a decline in terrorist incidents since 2009, Pakistan still ranks third in the world for such incidents. Suicide bombings have increased significantly, with Pakistan accounting for nearly half of all such deaths globally. In 2009, suicide bombings in Pakistan rose to 84, dropping to 51 in 2010 and 41 in 2011. Despite a 20% decrease in Islamist attacks in 2011 due to military operations and drone strikes, Pakistan still faced significant violence. Islamist militant groups in Pakistan became more intertwined and supportive after 2009. Al Qaeda's presence in the country remains a concern for U.S. leaders. After 2009, Islamist militant groups in Pakistan became more intertwined and supportive. Al Qaeda's presence in the country remains a concern for U.S. leaders, despite recent weakening of the group. Notable groups include the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, Quetta Shura Taliban, Haqqani Network, and Lashkar-e-Taiba. Punjab province in Pakistan is a hub for Islamist militant groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which is seen as a growing threat to U.S. national security. The LeT is considered the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia and has ties to the ISI. The group's charity wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), has an extensive presence in Pakistan. Pakistan's former Ambassador to the U.S., Husain Haqqani, criticizes the country's focus on sovereignty violations over combating jihadist ideology. Husain Haqqani, former Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, criticizes his country's focus on U.S. sovereignty violations instead of combating jihadist ideology that has caused many Pakistani deaths. He believes this mindset was cultivated by military dictators to divert attention from social and economic issues. The Pakistan army has deployed over 150,000 troops in response to increased militancy in western Pakistan, resulting in over 3,000 soldier casualties. The Pakistan army has deployed over 150,000 troops in response to increased militancy in western Pakistan, resulting in over 3,000 soldier casualties. Military offensives in Swat Valley and South Waziristan have had mixed results, with some successes in the \"clearing\" phase but difficulties in the \"holding\" and \"building\" phases. Independent analyses show that while militants have been temporarily dislodged, sustained counterinsurgency progress has been limited. The Pakistani army has seen some success in dislodging militants in Swat and other areas, but sustained progress in counterinsurgency efforts has been limited. The air force has conducted numerous combat sorties and bombings in the FATA region. Despite some progress in degrading militant capabilities, a simmering insurgency still affects most FATA agencies. In FATA, despite some success in degrading militant capabilities, a simmering insurgency persists. TTP militants overran a fort in South Waziristan, Bajaur suffered a major attack, and North Waziristan remains a key haven for militants. Pakistani officials have not moved into North Waziristan despite U.S. requests. Pakistan's military has hesitated to enter North Waziristan, citing the need to consolidate control in other areas. They lack experience in counterinsurgency and face challenges in receiving necessary hardware. The expulsion of U.S. military trainers in 2011 has hindered efforts to enhance Pakistan's capabilities. Despite military operations and political strategies, the Pakistani Taliban has fragmented into smaller factions. The Pakistani Taliban splintered in 2011, leading to smaller factions not following orders from TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud. Mehsud has conflicts with other militant commanders and was reportedly targeted by his own deputy. Pakistani officials considered negotiations with TTP militants amidst a shift towards talks with the Afghan Taliban. The TTP militants were open to new negotiations, with meetings reportedly starting in November. Despite initial denials, negotiations seem to have occurred, leading to the removal of TTP chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammad. This move angered his lieutenants in the Bajaur agency. Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar may have pressured Pakistani militants to make peace with the Pakistani army. Mullah Omar has pressured Pakistani militants to make peace with the Pakistani army to reinforce his own ranks. Al Qaeda and Haqqani group mediators facilitated a pact to unify four major militant factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan. The Haqqanis aim to redirect FATA militants' focus towards Afghanistan, a move welcomed by the Pakistani military. Pakistan's role in terrorist activities remains a major concern for the U.S. and other governments. In April 2012, the U.S. government offered a $10 million reward for information leading to the conviction of Pakistani citizen Hafiz Saeed, leader of a terrorist group involved in the 2008 Mumbai attack. This move strained U.S.-Pakistan relations, with Prime Minister Gilani criticizing it as a negative message. Additionally, militants freed nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot to kill President-General Pervez Musharraf, from a prison in Bannu near the FATA. In April 2012, militants freed nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot to kill President-General Pervez Musharraf, from a prison in Bannu near the FATA. This raid bolstered Pakistani Taliban force levels and raised concerns about the effectiveness of Pakistan's security apparatus. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries during a visit to India in May 2012. U.S. officials are worried about the impunity of Pakistan-based extremist groups. In 2010, concerns grew over American citizens being recruited for Islamist terrorism by Pakistan-based groups. Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted a car bombing in Times Square, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban. U.S. officials are alarmed by the impunity of Pakistan-based extremist groups like the Afghan Taliban, Haqqani Network, LeT, and Jaish-e-Mohammed. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted a car bombing in Times Square, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban. Shahzad received a mandatory life sentence for the attempted bombing. Other cases involve U.S. citizens linked to Islamist extremism in Pakistan, including a Chicagoan convert to Islam charged with scouting for a terrorist attack in Mumbai. In a significant case, a former Pakistani military officer pleaded guilty to charges linked to terrorism suspects in the United States. He reported to a retired Pakistani major suspected of being an LeT contact and interacted with a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. Indian officials gained access to him in 2010, revealing an official Pakistani role in the Mumbai attack. In 2011, a Chicago court heard testimony in a trial related to material support of terrorism for the Mumbai attack. In May 2011, a Chicago court heard testimony in Rana's trial for charges related to material support of terrorism, including links between the ISI and terrorism. Rana was acquitted of charges related to the Mumbai attack but found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish newspaper. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, marked by three full-scale wars and constant military preparedness, has lasted for over six decades since the acrimonious partition of British India in 1947. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, stemming from the partition of British India in 1947 and the Kashmir issue, has led to decades of tension and military buildup. Despite some progress in the Composite Dialogue, relations deteriorated in 2008 after a terrorist attack in Mumbai. In 2008, Pakistan-India relations deteriorated following a terrorist attack in Mumbai, leading to unresolved territorial disputes over Kashmir, the Siachen Glacier, and the Sir Creek. Conflict over water resources also emerged as a factor. The U.S. has refrained from mediating the Kashmir dispute, while Pakistan and India are engaged in a \"shadow war\" in Afghanistan. Pakistan and India are engaged in a \"shadow war\" in Afghanistan with spies and proxies targeting Indian interests. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of interference in Pakistan's western regions, but there is little evidence to support these claims. Following the 2008 Mumbai attack, India held Pakistan responsible for supporting anti-India terrorist groups. Despite this, in early 2011, India agreed to resume peace talks without focusing on terrorism. Peace talks between the two countries were set to resume after a hiatus. In early 2011, India agreed to resume peace talks with Pakistan without emphasizing terrorism. High-level peace talks were announced after a two-year hiatus, following \"cricket diplomacy\" in March 2011. Bilateral talks led to the establishment of a \"terror hotline\" and discussions on economic cooperation. Foreign secretaries agreed to expand confidence-building measures and increase trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC. In July, a Joint Statement during Foreign Minister Khar's visit to New Delhi was seen as a successful representation of the peace process back on track after a two-year hiatus. Trade ministers from India and Pakistan met in September to further liberalize bilateral trade. India also dropped its opposition to an EU initiative waiving duties on Pakistani exports from flood-affected areas. The circumstances of OBL's death impacted relations between the two countries, with Indian PM Singh calling it a significant step forward. Relations between Pakistan and India improved after the killing of OBL, with Indian PM Singh calling it a significant step forward. However, New Delhi is concerned about a possible hastened U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and sees an opportunity to press Pakistan to extradite terrorists linked to the 2008 Mumbai attack. Afghanistan's new strategic framework with India in 2011 heightened Pakistan's fears of strategic encirclement. In October 2011, Afghanistan signed a new \"strategic framework\" agreement with India, causing Pakistan to feel more encircled. The pact aimed at closer ties with India due to Kabul's struggles with the Taliban. Some analysts viewed the agreement as provocative and potentially hindering efforts to reduce Pakistan's support for militant proxies in Afghanistan. Pakistan's relations with India have improved, with a decrease in separatist activities in Indian-held Kashmir since 1989. Pakistan-supported separatist rebellion in Indian-held Kashmir is at its lowest since 1989. Pakistan plans to grant MFN trade status to India by 2012, which could significantly boost bilateral trade and build peace constituencies. Islamabad's shift towards freer trade with India suggests progress on the Kashmir issue may not be a prerequisite. President Zardari's visit to India in 2012 marked a significant step in bilateral relations, with no terrorist attacks traced to Pakistan in over three years. The avalanche tragedy at Siachen Glacier highlighted the futility of conflict over Kashmir, a region with little military value. The avalanche tragedy in the Siachen Glacier region brought attention to the ongoing conflict over Kashmir, which is seen as having little military significance. Despite signing agreements with Turkmenistan for a gas pipeline through Afghanistan, both Pakistan and India remain adamant about their military presence in the region. The pipeline project, supported by the US as part of the New Silk Road Initiative, aims to bypass Iran, but concerns remain about the security situation in Afghanistan affecting investor confidence. Despite some analysts cautiously optimistic, security concerns in Afghanistan may hinder investor confidence. India's reluctance to make concessions is influenced by ongoing Islamist militancy from Pakistan. The unresolved issue of Mumbai terrorism masterminds and LeT chief Hafiz Saeed's freedom in Pakistan are major points of contention. India seeks extradition of suspects and economic progress could potentially improve relations. Pakistan and China have a close relationship with China being a primary arms supplier for Pakistan and involved in various economic projects. The future of relations between India and Pakistan hinges on the decisions made by Pakistan's generals. Chinese companies and workers are heavily involved in the Pakistani economy, with Beijing planning to construct two new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan. During a visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in late 2010, multiple cooperative agreements were signed, totaling around $35 billion in contracts. In August 2011, Pakistan responded promptly to accusations from Beijing regarding Islamist militants trained in Pakistan being involved in terrorist activities in China's Xinjiang province. In August 2011, Beijing blamed Islamist militants trained in Pakistan for terrorist activities in China's Xinjiang province. ISI Director Pasha was sent to Beijing to address the issue. China expressed concerns about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. As US-India ties strengthen and US-Pakistan ties worsen, Pakistan is increasingly reliant on its friendship with China. Pakistani leaders showed strong closeness with China in 2011. Prime Minister Gilani's visit to China in May 2011 did not result in a major new embrace, but China emphasized the need to respect Pakistan's sovereignty. In 2011, China emphasized the need to respect Pakistan's sovereignty and agreed to expedite delivery of 50 JF-17 fighter jets. The US and China share an interest in strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities to prevent Pakistan-based terrorist groups from triggering a crisis with India that could harm Chinese economic interests in the region. This provides a basis for greater US-China coordination. The dynamics between the US, China, Pakistan, and India could lead to a crisis that would harm Chinese economic interests in the region. This situation calls for greater coordination between the US and China to improve Pakistan's military and intelligence services and potentially pressure Islamabad to dismantle jihadist groups. Despite differing views on India's role, cooperation between the US and China could extend to areas like nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan. China's support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions, and as the US strengthens ties with India, China's reliance on Pakistan is expected to increase. However, China's own interests suggest that its policies towards Pakistan should not solely focus on balancing India. China's reliance on Pakistan is expected to grow, but its policies should not solely focus on balancing India. The \"all-weather friendship\" with Pakistan no longer guarantees blanket support, and China is unlikely to mediate in any US-Pakistani rift. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been troubled, but both countries aim to complete a natural gas pipeline. Iran and Pakistan aim to complete a natural gas pipeline despite opposition from the US due to sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program. Tehran claims construction on its side is complete and has offered $500 million to finance Pakistan's side after a Chinese consortium withdrew. Islamabad remains insistent on completing the project. The US has expressed concerns to Islamabad about completing the Iran-Pakistan natural gas pipeline project, citing violations of Iran sanctions. Tehran has tried to bypass sanctions by proposing barter deals with Pakistan for oil in exchange for wheat and rice. The security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is a top US concern, especially with the presence of Islamist militants and past illicit nuclear proliferation activities. The network allegedly led by A.Q. Khan was disrupted in 2004, but concerns remain about its potential reactivation. Pakistan's nuclear security is a top concern for the US, with worries about leakage of nuclear know-how. Recent reports suggest Pakistan is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, possibly in response to US-India civil nuclear cooperation. This growth raises concerns, especially as China plans to build reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating nonproliferation guidelines. The situation poses a dilemma for the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration is facing a dilemma as China plans to build two new nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating nonproliferation guidelines. Pakistan's economy is struggling with inflation, unemployment, food and energy shortages, exacerbated by devastating flooding in 2010 and 2011. Corruption is hindering economic development and foreign investment, with foreign direct investment dropping to under $2.2 billion in FY2010/2011. Foreign direct investment in Pakistan dropped to under $2.2 billion in FY2010/2011, attributed to increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad. Economic priorities include addressing inflation, containing the budget deficit, reviving growth, and managing higher global oil prices. Pakistan's GDP per capita was once higher than India's but India's growth surpassed Pakistan's in the early 2000s. In the early 2000s, India's growth surpassed Pakistan's, leading to higher national wealth figures even on a per capita basis. Pakistan sought multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF in 2008 due to a balance-of-payments crisis. The current IMF-supported program, a $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement, faces delays due to Islamabad's failure to implement required reforms. Security concerns in 2011 further complicated negotiations with the IMF. Pakistan's IMF loan repayment will strain the federal budget due to low revenue generation and high military spending. Officials have sought U.S. help to ease IMF conditions, but intervention is unlikely. Security concerns in 2011 delayed negotiations with the IMF. Pakistan's economic challenges include mass tax evasion by the elite, low tax-to-GDP ratio, failed tax reform initiatives, and political turmoil over fuel subsidies. Electricity shortages are causing economic decline, with businesses forced to shut down due to power outages lasting up to 20 hours a day. Electricity shortages in Pakistan are leading to businesses shutting down for up to 20 hours a day. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent, with citizens ransacking offices and torching vehicles. Despite economic growth, the country faces challenges like high inflation and energy shortages that continue to hinder progress. The State Bank of Pakistan acknowledges that onerous public debt, persistent double-digit inflation, and severe energy shortages will continue to hinder growth. Plans to reform taxes and subsidies are delayed, with power outages estimated to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. Poor governance is identified as the central cause of economic problems in Pakistan. International financial institutions regularly assess the Pakistani economy, with the World Bank recognizing these challenges in a recent report. The World Bank and IMF have issued negative assessments of the Pakistani economy, citing deteriorated fiscal situation, lack of governance improvements, and low growth prospects. They recommend focusing on human development sectors like education and health to prevent poverty alleviation gains from being at risk. The IMF report in February 2012 highlighted Pakistan's bleak economic prospects due to low growth, high inflation, and weakening external position. Urgent policy actions recommended include strengthening public finances, reforming the energy sector, and implementing financial measures to reduce inflation and ensure financial stability. Pakistani leaders aim to improve access to Western markets, with exports, especially from the textile sector, seen as crucial for future recovery efforts. The textile sector in Pakistan is crucial for economic recovery, with efforts to reduce tariffs on exports being a priority. The sector employs 3.5 million people and accounts for 40% of urban factory jobs. Pakistani officials seek to abolish American tariffs on cotton apparel to increase exports by $5 billion annually. Pakistan's democracy has faced challenges with power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs, with a bicameral Parliament holding federal power. Pakistan's bicameral Parliament, consisting of a 342-seat National Assembly and a 100-seat Senate, holds federal power. President Zardari was elected in September 2008. The military still influences foreign and national security policies, while the PPP-led coalition struggles to enact reforms and rein in security agencies. The judiciary, empowered by the 2008 \"Lawyer's Movement,\" continues to battle with the executive branch in Pakistan. President Zardari faces corruption charges and the country's political turmoil could lead to economic chaos. Threats to the PPP's majority status have arisen due to coalition politics. The JUI and MQM have withdrawn and rejoined the coalition in response to rising fuel prices. In response to rising fuel prices and government mismanagement, the JUI and MQM have withdrawn and rejoined the ruling coalition multiple times in 2011. The MQM's withdrawal jeopardized the coalition's parliamentary majority, leading to fears of government collapse. The PPP strengthened its position through a new alliance with the PML-Q faction, gaining support in Punjab and preparing for the next general elections. The PPP recently merged with a smaller PML group, reverting to the original PML name. Their considerable support in Punjab and alliance with the ANP bolstered their status. Senate elections in 2012 ensured PPP's control through 2015, giving them the power to block legislation even if they lose in future polls. OBL's death led to rare domestic criticism of the Pakistani military. The circumstances of OBL's death in 2011 were embarrassing for the Pakistani military, leading to domestic criticism and media scrutiny of the security establishment. Despite calls for civilian leaders to take control of foreign and national security policies, there has been little action taken. Parliament did form a commission to investigate how bin Laden found refuge in Pakistan and how American forces entered Pakistani territory. The commission formed by Parliament to investigate how bin Laden found refuge in Pakistan and the American forces' incursion into Pakistani territory lacked focus and cohesion. Civil-military tensions escalated after the bin Laden raid, nearly leading to a military coup in late 2011. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not complying with Supreme Court orders to reopen a corruption case against President Zardari. The court issued a contempt notice against Gilani in January. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not complying with Supreme Court orders to reopen a corruption case against President Zardari. The court found Gilani guilty of contempt in April but only sentenced him for the time it took to adjourn. Despite opposition demands for his resignation, legal scholars predict Gilani will be disqualified from office after the appeal period ends in June. The rise of a new political star, Imran Khan, and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party marked late 2011. In late 2011, former cricket hero Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party gained support from young and middle-class Pakistanis by focusing on anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan's rallies in Lahore and Karachi drew huge crowds, and the PTI has since attracted notable converts from other major parties, posing a threat to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League offshoot. While unlikely to win enough seats in parliamentary elections, Khan's strong support in Punjab is significant. Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party gained support in late 2011 by focusing on anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan's rise reflected the public's desire for honest politicians, with a strong support base in Punjab. He has vowed to cut off U.S. aid, end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban, and tackle corruption if he comes to power. Khan's popularity poses a threat to mainstream parties, with rumors of military backing and sympathy for Islamist causes. The emergence of Pakistan's conservative Islamist political forces under the Difa-e-Pakistan (DPC) has raised concerns among international observers. The DPC, comprised of over 40 Islamist and rightwing parties, opposes cooperation with the United States and any rapprochement with India. Leader Hafiz Saeed of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist group is openly involved in DPC rallies, which vehemently opposes reopening the GLOCs. The DPC, a coalition of Islamist parties in Pakistan, strongly opposes reopening the GLOCs, viewing it as support for the US presence in Afghanistan. They also accuse the US and India of involvement in Baluchistan's insurgency. Anti-American sentiment is popular among Pakistani politicians, with some analysts suggesting that Pakistan's security services may be supporting the DPC to gain leverage. Human rights abuses in Pakistan are a serious concern, despite some positive steps taken by the civilian government. According to the U.S. Department of State, Pakistan's human rights situation remains poor with lack of government accountability, leading to a culture of impunity. The main issues include extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances by security forces and militant groups, poor prison conditions, arbitrary detention, weak criminal justice system, lack of judicial independence, and restrictions on privacy rights and freedom of the press. The human rights situation in Pakistan remains poor with widespread violations including harassment of journalists, censorship, restrictions on freedom of assembly and movement, religious freedom violations, discrimination against minorities, corruption, gender-based violence, child abuse, human trafficking, and societal discrimination against various groups. The human rights situation in Pakistan is dire, with discrimination against minorities, lack of worker rights, violence by militant groups, and abuses by security forces. Pakistan is considered the most dangerous country for journalists, with concerns raised by the US over extrajudicial killings and disappearances. The Obama Administration has withheld funding for Pakistani army units implicated in human rights abuses. The Obama Administration has decided to withhold funding for Pakistani army units linked to human rights abuses, including those involved in enforcing blasphemy laws criticized for being discriminatory and arbitrary. International human rights groups have called for the repeal of these laws, especially after a Pakistani Christian woman was sentenced to death for a minor offense in 2010. President Zardari promised to review the case, but the government backed away from reform proposals due to pressure from Islamist hardline groups. The PPP-led government in Pakistan backed away from reform proposals to repeal discriminatory blasphemy laws after pressure from Islamist hardline groups. Despite promises from President Zardari to review the case, key government proponents of reform were assassinated in 2011. Congress renewed large U.S. assistance packages to Pakistan, totaling $15.3 billion in overt assistance over ten years, with a significant portion allocated for security-related programs. In 2009, Congress passed bills authorizing increased nonmilitary aid to Pakistan and placing conditions on security-related aid. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) allocated $1.5 billion per year for five years. The Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) was established to enhance Pakistani security forces' ability to combat militancy. Congress has also appropriated billions for coalition support funds to reimburse Pakistan for its support of U.S.-led counterterrorism operations. The U.S. has allocated nearly $9 billion in coalition support funds to reimburse Pakistan for its support of U.S.-led counterterrorism operations. Recent oversight has led to an increase in rejected claims. The Administration's Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report outlines objectives for nonmilitary aid to help build a stable, secure, and prosperous Pakistan, with a focus on high-impact infrastructure programs. The U.S. has allocated $3.5 billion for high-impact infrastructure programs in Pakistan, with a focus on energy and agriculture sectors. There are plans to help launch the construction of the Diamer Basha dam, a $12 billion project that could generate 4,500 megawatts of electricity. Approximately $855 million in civilian aid funds were disbursed in FY2011, with concerns about corruption hindering the spending of appropriated funds. The majority of allocated Kerry-Lugar-Berman (KLB) funds for aid in Pakistan have not been spent due to concerns about corruption and oversight. Security-related U.S. assistance includes arms transfers for counterterrorism operations and conventional warfare. Pakistani officials have raised complaints about the delay in receiving defense equipment from the U.S. Pakistan has received various defense equipment from the U.S., including helicopters and infantry arms. There have been delays in receiving crucial equipment for counterinsurgency operations. U.S. aid programs are being reevaluated following the circumstances of Osama bin Laden's death. The reevaluation of aid levels and the bilateral relationship with Pakistan began in 2011. Significant reductions and new restrictions in pending FY2013 legislation reflect growing recognition that U.S. military aid may not effectively combat Islamist militancy in Pakistan. Analysts suggest focusing on nonmilitary aid to strengthen Pakistan's civil society. Three major bills for FY2013 contain important Pakistan-related provisions with more stringent conditions.
