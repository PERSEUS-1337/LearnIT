    "content": "End-to-end neural models have advanced question answering, but recent studies suggest they assume answers and evidence are in close proximity in a single document. A new model called Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) combines evidence from multiple documents. CFC includes a coarse-grain module for interpreting documents with respect to the query and finding relevant answers, and a fine-grain module for scoring candidate answers by comparing occurrences across all documents with the query. Using hierarchies of coattention and self-attention, CFC achieves a state-of-the-art result of 70.6% accuracy on the Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task. The CFC achieves a new state-of-the-art result of 70.6% accuracy on the multi-evidence question answering task, outperforming previous models by 3%. This task involves aggregating evidence from multiple documents to answer questions, unlike existing datasets that focus on single document reasoning. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) is a multi-evidence QA model that selects answers from support documents based on coarse-grain and fine-grain reasoning. It achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 70.6% on the task, outperforming previous models by 3%. The model uses hierarchical attention to match candidate answers with the query. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) utilizes hierarchical attention to combine information from support documents based on the query and candidates. It achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 70.6% on the blind Qangaroo WikiHop test set, surpassing previous models by 3%. Additionally, using the CFC improves accuracy on the TriviaQA task by 3.1% for exact match and 3.0% for F1 score. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) improves accuracy by 3.1% for exact match and 3.0% for F1 score. The attention hierarchies of the modules focus on distinct parts of the input, enabling effective representation of long documents. Common errors in CFC include difficulty in aggregating references, noise in supervision, and challenging relation types. The coarse-grain module summarizes support documents independently of candidates, while the fine-grain module retrieves specific contexts for each candidate. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) improves accuracy by focusing on different parts of the input, allowing effective representation of long documents. It uses self-attention for a coarse-grain summary and coattention for fine-grain retrieval of specific contexts for each candidate. The model can handle a large number of potentially long support documents efficiently. The CFC model utilizes bidirectional GRUs to encode sequences and coattention to build codependent representations of support documents and queries. It then uses self-attention to compare the context to the candidate answer. These techniques are crucial for single-document question answering models. The candidate E c . Coattention and similar techniques are essential for single-document question answering models. The affinity matrix between the document and query is computed, and support summary vectors and query summary vectors are defined. The coattention context is obtained by concatenating the document context and document summary vector. Coattention is abbreviated as a process that produces the coattention context. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention, which compares the context of the supporting document and query. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention, creating a fixed-length summary vector. Scores for each position are computed using a multi-layer perceptron, normalized, and used to compute a weighted sum over the context. Parameters for the MLP scorer are defined, and self-attention is applied to produce the summary conditioned on the query. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention to create a fixed-length summary vector. Another self-attention layer computes a summary vector of all support documents, which is then multiplied with the candidate answer's summary to produce a coarse-grain score. The fine-grain module identifies the specific context in which the candidate occurs in the supporting documents using coreference resolution. The fine-grain module, illustrated in Figure 3, identifies the specific context of the candidate in supporting documents using coreference resolution. Each mention is summarized with self-attention to form a mention representation, followed by computing coattention with the query. This coattention context is summarized again via self-attention to generate a fine-grain summary for scoring the candidate. The document encoding corresponds to mentions, with multiple pieces of evidence needed to answer questions. Mention representations are extracted using self-attention, and a fine-grain score is determined for each candidate. The final score is a combination of coarse-grain and fine-grain scores, with the model trained using cross-entropy loss. The model combines candidate scores to form the final score vector Y. It is trained using cross-entropy loss and evaluated on multi-evidence question answering tasks on WikiHop and TriviaQA datasets. The CFC achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiHop and significant performance improvement on TriviaQA by reranking span-extraction model outputs. Qangaroo WikiHop task facilitates multi-evidence question answering study by linking entities in Wikipedia with Wikidata. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves multi-evidence question answering by linking entities in Wikipedia with Wikidata. It requires selecting the correct candidate answer from a set of plausible candidates based on support documents. The Qangaroo WikiHop task involves multi-evidence question answering by linking entities in Wikipedia with Wikidata. Candidates are selected as answers, with the unmasked version representing original text and the masked version using placeholders to remove correlation. Evaluation is done using the unmasked version. Data is tokenized using Stanford CoreNLP and models are trained using ADAM. The CFC achieves state-of-the-art results on both masked and unmasked versions of WikiHop. The CFC outperforms previous models on the WikiHop leaderboard, achieving a new best accuracy of 70.6% on the blind test set. It does not use pretrained contextual encoders but still surpasses the state-of-the-art result by 3%. The division of labor between coarse-grain and fine-grain modules allows for effective modeling of long documents in WikiHop. Additionally, experiments on TriviaQA show the effectiveness of the CFC model. The CFC model outperforms previous models on WikiHop, achieving 70.6% accuracy on the blind test set. Experiments on TriviaQA also demonstrate the model's effectiveness. The TriviaQA task is decomposed into proposing candidate answers and reranking them. BiDAF++ is used for span extraction, and CFC is used for reranking. Ablation study on WikiHop dev set shows the impact of different modules on performance. Using BiDAF++, a competitive span extraction question answering model by Clark & Gardner (2018) and the CFC, the top 50 answer candidates are obtained for reranking. Reranking with the CFC consistently improves performance over using only the span extraction model, regardless of correct answers in the candidate set. On the TriviaQA dev set, reranking with the CFC results in a 3.1% EM and 3.0% F1 gain, indicating its ability to refine outputs from question answering models. Performance contributions of the coarse-grain module, fine-grain module, and model decisions are shown in Table 3. The performance contributions of the coarse-grain module, fine-grain module, self-attention, and bidirectional GRUs are significant. Replacing certain layers with mean-pooling and unidirectional GRUs results in less performance degradation. Contextual encodings capturing positional information are crucial for model performance. The fine-grain-only model consistently under-performs the coarse-grain-only model across various dataset lengths. The fine-grain-only model consistently under-performs the coarse-grain-only model across different dataset lengths. However, the fine-grain-only model matches or outperforms the coarse-grain-only model on examples with a large number of support documents or with long support documents due to more precise entity-matching coreference resolution capturing intra-document and inter-document dependencies. The hierarchical attention maps produced by the CFC show that coattention layers focus on similar phrases between the document and the query, while lower level self-attention layers capture phrases. The coattention and self-attention layers in the WikiHop development set focus on similar phrases between the document and query, with fine-grain scores for the query \"Hampton Wick War Memorial\" aligning relation parts to context. The self-attention layers capture phrases characterizing the entity described in the document, with a mention of locations in Richmond upon Thames. The self-attention layers in the WikiHop development set focus on relevant documents for the query, with support documents providing information about the literary work \"The Troll\", its author Julia Donaldson, and Old Norse. The fine-grain coattention over mention representations focuses on the relation part of the query. The self-attention layers in the WikiHop development set focus on relevant documents for the query, including information about \"The Troll\", its author Julia Donaldson, and Old Norse. Fine-grain coattention over mention representations emphasizes the relationship part of the query. The model's errors on the development set are categorized into four types, with the first type (42% of errors) resulting from the model aggregating the wrong reference. The errors in the model on the development set are categorized into four types. The first type (42% of errors) results from aggregating the wrong reference. The second type (28% of errors) is due to questions that are not answerable, while the third type (22% of errors) comes from queries with multiple correct answers. Ways to reduce these errors include using more robust pretrained contextual encoders and coreference resolution. The model predicts specific details like \"archaeological site\" instead of \"town\", highlighting challenges in using distant supervision for creating datasets like WikiHop. Errors also stem from complex relation types and can be mitigated by using tunable symbolic embeddings. Question answering tasks involve various sources like Wikipedia, news articles, books, and trivia, with most tasks not requiring reasoning over multiple evidence pieces. The Qangaroo WikiHop dataset encourages reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence across documents, unlike most QA tasks that only require reasoning within a single document. Query-focused multi-document summarization also involves aggregating information from multiple documents. Recent developments in QA models include document attention models, multi-hop memory networks, and end-to-end QA models. Recent advances in QA models include various attention mechanisms such as cross-sequence attention, match-LSTM, coattention, bidirectional attention, and query-context attention. Reinforcement learning is used to explore imprecise span matches, while convolutions and self-attention model local and global interactions. Reranking models are also employed to refine span-extraction output. This work extends single-document QA to multi-evidence QA across documents. Our work extends single-document QA to multi-evidence QA by utilizing attention mechanisms for information aggregation. Various forms of attention, such as self-attention and coattention, have been successfully applied in tasks like machine translation, relation extraction, and visual question answering. In the CFC, a novel approach combines self-attention and coattention hierarchically to create effective representations of long documents. Hierarchical coarse-to-fine modeling gradually introduces complexity and has been successful in various tasks like parsing, speech recognition, and machine translation. Neural coarse-to-fine modeling has also been applied to question answering. The CFC is a state-of-the-art model for multi-evidence question answering, achieving 70.6% test accuracy on the WikiHop task. It combines coarse-grain reasoning and fine-grain reasoning modules that focus on different aspects of the input, outperforming previous methods by 3% accuracy. The CFC model combines coarse-grain and fine-grain modules to represent large collections of documents effectively. Simple lexical matching is used instead of full-scale coreference resolution systems.
