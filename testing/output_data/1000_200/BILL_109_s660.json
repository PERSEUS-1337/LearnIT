    "content": "The \"Lumbee Recognition Act\" is the short title of this Act. The preamble of the Act of June 7, 1956 is amended by making specific changes to the wording. The Lumbee Indians of North Carolina, descendants of coastal tribes, have been recognized by the state since 1885 and by Congress in 1956. They are seeking full federal recognition and the benefits that come with it. The Lumbee Tribe seeks full Federal recognition to receive benefits and privileges as an Indian tribe. Federal recognition is extended to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, allowing them to receive benefits and privileges as an Indian tribe. Any group of Indians in Robeson and adjoining counties, North Carolina, not enrolled in the Lumbee Tribe may petition for acknowledgment of tribal existence. Laws and regulations of the United States applicable to Indians and Indian tribes will apply to the Lumbee Tribe and its members. The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and its members are eligible for services and benefits provided to federally recognized Indian tribes. Members residing in specific counties are considered to be on or near a reservation. The Secretary of the Interior and Health and Human Services will work with the tribe to determine needs and budget after verifying the tribal roll. The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and Health and Human Services, will develop a budget for services eligible to tribe members. The tribal roll, verified by the Secretary of the Interior, defines the service population, ensuring compliance with membership criteria. The Secretary's verification is limited to confirming compliance with the membership criteria set out in the Tribe's constitution adopted on November 11, 2000, to be completed within 1 year of enactment of this section. The Tribe seeks to convey fee land to the United States for trust purposes in Robeson County, North Carolina. The Secretary of the Interior will treat the land as on-reservation trust acquisitions. State jurisdiction is addressed in the following section. The State of North Carolina has jurisdiction over criminal offenses and civil actions on land owned by the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. The Secretary of the Interior can accept a transfer of jurisdiction from the state under an agreement between the tribe and the state. Under an agreement between the Lumbee Tribe and the State of North Carolina, a transfer of jurisdiction shall not take effect until 2 years after the effective date of the agreement. This section will not affect the application of section 109 of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act."
