    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Air Force Science and Technology Reinvigoration Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of scientific research and technology development in ensuring America's aeronautical defenses. Maintaining air, space, and information superiority requires a strong research base, as envisioned by Air Force founder General Henry H. Arnold. Investment in Air Force research and development has benefited American industry, especially the aerospace sector, and made significant contributions to the economy. The Sense of Congress regarding the science and technology functions of the Department of the Air Force is highlighted in Section 3. The Sense of Congress emphasizes the allocation of funds for emerging technologies in the Air Force, separate management for science and technology from acquisition, increased investments in new technology areas, and maintaining a base of scientists and engineers for future challenges. To maintain a strong base of scientists and engineers for future challenges, the Air Force should increase the number of officers and civilian employees with doctorate degrees in technical fields, expand the variety of technical master's degrees granted, and eliminate 5% of science and technology programs annually to fund new programs. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. The text chunk discusses the separation of research and development functions from the equipping function of the Secretary of the Air Force, as well as the establishment of an Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology. The text chunk discusses the establishment of an Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology, as well as a Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology. Amendments are made to sections in title 10 and title 5 of the United States Code to accommodate these changes. Amendments are made to establish a Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology in section 8035 of title 10, United States Code. Amendments establish a Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology in section 8035 of title 10, United States Code. Additionally, a study is mandated. The Secretary of the Air Force is required to contract the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the Air Force's technology base. The study will recommend minimum requirements to maintain a technology base for superiority in air and space weapons systems, address effects on national defense and civilian industries by reducing funding, and recommend appropriate staff levels with specific degrees. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council to study the Air Force's technology base, recommend requirements for maintaining superiority in air and space weapons systems, and determine optimal staff levels with specific degrees. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 120 days."
