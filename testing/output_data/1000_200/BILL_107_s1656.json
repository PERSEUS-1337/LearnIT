    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veterans Benefits Administration Improvement Act of 2001\". The Veterans Benefits Administration is responsible for processing veterans' compensation and pension claims accurately and timely. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy of claims processing, with new measurements showing lower accuracy rates than previously reported. Additionally, the Administration may face a significant loss of workforce due to retirement by 2003. The Veterans Benefits Administration faces challenges with accuracy in claims processing and potential workforce loss due to retirement. Aggressive steps are needed to ensure timely processing of claims to avoid delays in providing benefits to veterans. The backlog of pending work in September 2001 was 533,029 claims, with an expected appeals processing time of 621 days in 2001. Improvement of processing of veterans benefits claims is crucial to address challenges in accuracy and potential workforce loss due to retirement. Aggressive steps are needed to ensure timely processing and avoid delays in providing benefits to veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must submit a plan within 90 days of this Act for improving claims processing, including training for adjudicators and accountability standards to prevent delays in benefit payments. The plan should also focus on identifying recurring errors to strengthen the Veterans Benefits Administration. The plan must include mechanisms to improve data collection, identify recurring errors in claims adjudications, implement a system for reviewing claims processing accuracy, and evaluate the impact of the Training and Performance Support System on claims processing. The plan must include mechanisms for evaluating the impact of the Training and Performance Support System on claims processing accuracy, quantifiable goals for these mechanisms, consultation with veterans organizations, and implementation and modification procedures by the Secretary. The Secretary must submit a notice to relevant committees before any modification takes effect, and provide reports every six months on the plan's implementation and goal achievement. Funding for the plan will be carried out using appropriated amounts. The Secretary will implement the plan using appropriated funds from the Veterans Benefits Administration to achieve the goals outlined in subsection (b)(5)."
