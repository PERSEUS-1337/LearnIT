    "content": "The \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\" amends the Public Health Service Act to allow services for substance abuse prevention and treatment to be provided through religious organizations. This Act is cited as the \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\". This part of the Act applies to programs providing federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. It does not apply to awards for other purposes. A designated award recipient is an entity that has received an award under a designated program. The Act applies to programs providing federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. A designated award recipient is an entity that has received an award under a designated program, whether it is a direct award from the Federal Government or a subaward from a non-Federal entity. Financial assistance includes grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or voucherized assistance. The terms defined in this section include financial assistance (grants, agreements, contracts, or vouchers), program beneficiaries (individuals receiving services), program participants, program services (substance abuse treatment or prevention), religious organizations, and voucherized assistance (a system for selecting and reimbursing services). Assistance refers to a method of selecting and reimbursing program services where the beneficiary receives authorization to pay for services, chooses the service provider according to specified rules, and the provider is reimbursed by the award recipient. The beneficiary determines the allocation of program funds by selecting one service provider from alternatives. SEC. 582. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. Religious organizations have the authority to be designated award recipients, make subawards to other entities, provide program services through voucherized assistance, and be service providers under designated programs. The term 'program participant' refers to entities that have received a direct award. The term 'program participant' refers to entities that have received a direct award or subaward, including those providing program services through voucherized assistance. Religious organizations are allowed to participate in designated programs without compromising their religious character or the religious freedom of beneficiaries. The Congress finds that the establishment clause of the first amendment does not require social-welfare programs to discriminate against faith-based providers or force them to abandon their religious character. Religious organizations can participate in programs on an equal basis with other nonprofits without facing discrimination based on their religious affiliation. Religious organizations participating in programs shall not be discriminated against based on their religious character. They are allowed to maintain independence from government control over their religious beliefs and are not required to change their internal governance or remove religious symbols to participate. Religious organizations in programs cannot be discriminated against for their religious nature. They can maintain independence in their beliefs and are not obligated to remove religious symbols. Program participants may require employees to adhere to their religious beliefs and rules on drugs/alcohol use. Religious organizations in programs cannot be discriminated against for their religious nature. Program beneficiaries objecting to a religious organization can receive services through an alternative entity or program participant. Religious organizations providing program services must ensure individuals can receive services through an alternative provider if they object. Arrangements with alternative entities must offer services of equal value to those provided by the religious organization. Non-discrimination is required in these arrangements. Religious organizations participating in programs must not discriminate against beneficiaries based on religion. However, they may require active participation in religious activities from beneficiaries who choose to receive services from them. Religious organizations participating in programs must adhere to fiscal accountability regulations similar to other recipients of Federal financial assistance. They are required to account for the use of funds provided under such awards in accordance with auditing principles. Religious organizations receiving Federal funds must maintain separate accounts for Federal and non-Federal funds to be subject to audit. They can seek judicial review of agency actions regarding compliance with this requirement. SEC. 583 limits the use of funds for sectarian worship or instruction, except when the beneficiary can choose where the assistance is redeemed. SEC. 584 addresses the administration of the program and treatment of funds. Federal financial assistance provided to program beneficiaries is considered aid to the beneficiary, not to the organization offering the services. States cannot discriminate in the use of Federal funds in religious facilities or by religious organizations participating in designated programs. If State laws prevent the use of public funds in such facilities, Federal funds must be segregated for program purposes. SEC. 585. EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PERSONNEL IN DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS. The Congress finds that formal educational qualifications for counselors in drug treatment programs may hinder the effectiveness and provision of services. States must recognize the importance of religious education and training for personnel in program services. The government must value religious education and training for personnel in program services, giving credit equivalent to secular coursework. States can establish educational qualifications for personnel in organizations providing services to reduce drug use among beneficiaries. The government may waive educational qualifications for personnel in religious organizations providing successful drug treatment for at least 3 years, if the qualifications have hindered their participation as program providers. The government can waive educational qualifications for personnel in religious organizations providing drug treatment if qualifications hinder their participation as program providers."
