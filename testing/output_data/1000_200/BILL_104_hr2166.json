    "content": "The \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" establishes a minimum tax on certain foreign and foreign-owned corporations under Subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This new part, titled \"Minimum Tax on Certain Foreign and Foreign-Owned Corporations,\" introduces Section 59B outlining the specifics of the minimum tax requirements. Section 59B of the \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" imposes a minimum tax on certain foreign and foreign-owned corporations based on their taxable income from different business activities. This applies to corporations that are either 25-percent foreign-owned domestic corporations or foreign corporations with income connected to US business activities and substantial foreign-related transactions. Section 59B of the \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" imposes a minimum tax on certain foreign and foreign-owned corporations with substantial foreign-related transactions during the taxable year. An exception exists if a qualified section 482 agreement is in effect with the corporation for the specific business category. The Secretary may enter into a qualified section 482 agreement with a corporation to ensure a clear reflection of taxable income from specific business activities. The agreement can have retroactive effects if deemed necessary by the Secretary. The agreement can have retroactive effects for prior taxable years without needing to be in effect when the corporation files its return. In cases where the Secretary cannot categorize a corporation's activities, a minimum tax of 35 percent is imposed on gross receipts from property sales or leasing. The IRS imposes a minimum tax of 35 percent on gross receipts from property sales or leasing. The Secretary determines waiver in cases of casualty or disaster, and foreign taxes are excluded from taxable income calculations. The Secretary prescribes an applicable profit percentage for different business activities each calendar year after 1995. The IRS imposes a minimum tax of 35 percent on gross receipts from property sales or leasing, with waivers for casualty or disaster cases. The applicable profit percentage for different business activities is determined annually based on average earnings rates of domestic corporations. The earnings rate of a domestic corporation is calculated as the ratio of adjusted book income to gross receipts from the activities. The term 'adjusted book income' refers to income reported for financial purposes without deductions for income, war profits, or excess profits taxes. Definitions and special rules include terms like '25-percent foreign-owned' and 'related party'. Substantial foreign-related person transactions occur when a corporation has a significant amount involved in such dealings. The corporation has substantial foreign-related person transactions if the amount involved with foreign related parties exceeds $2,000,000 or 10% of gross income. Business activities are categorized based on the Standard Industrial Classification Code. The Secretary can aggregate classifications when necessary. The table of parts for subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended to include classifications other than the Standard Industrial Classification Code when appropriate. Effective Date: The amendments for minimum tax on certain foreign and foreign-owned corporations apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1995."
