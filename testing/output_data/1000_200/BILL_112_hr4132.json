    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". Congress acknowledges the critical role of the FDA in ensuring the safety and efficacy of new medicines. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted treatments for serious diseases, supported by regulatory innovation. The FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative medicines for serious or life-threatening diseases, including rare conditions, using biomarkers, predictive toxicology, and adaptive clinical trials to potentially reduce the size and duration of clinical trials. The FDA should enhance its authority to expedite the development and approval of innovative therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases, allowing for fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials without compromising safety standards. Patients would benefit from quicker access to effective treatments for unmet medical needs. The FDA should apply accelerated approval and fast track provisions to expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases while maintaining safety standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amendment to Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary can designate a new drug as a fast track product to expedite its development and review if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease and addresses unmet medical needs. The sponsor of the drug can request this designation at any time after submitting an application for investigation under specific sections of the Act. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product within 60 days of receiving a request if it meets specific criteria. This designation allows for expedited development and review of the drug application for approval. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease, including a fast track product, based on its effect on a surrogate or clinical endpoint that predicts clinical benefit or earlier measurable effects on morbidity or mortality. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on its effect on a surrogate or clinical endpoint that predicts clinical benefit or earlier measurable effects on morbidity or mortality. Approval may be subject to post-approval studies to verify the predicted effect on clinical benefit. The Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on its effect on a surrogate or clinical endpoint that predicts clinical benefit. Approval may be subject to post-approval studies to verify the predicted effect on clinical benefit and submission of promotional materials for review. The Secretary can expedite withdrawal of approval if necessary. The Secretary can review incomplete applications for approval of a fast track product using expedited procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct required post-approval studies with due diligence, if a study fails to verify predicted effects, if other evidence shows the product is not safe or effective, or if false promotional materials are disseminated. The Secretary can review incomplete applications for fast track product approval if preliminary clinical data suggests effectiveness. The review can start before the complete application is submitted if the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays required fees. The Secretary can review incomplete applications for fast track product approval based on preliminary clinical data suggesting effectiveness. The review can begin before the complete application is submitted if the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays required fees. Awareness efforts will be made to inform relevant parties about the provisions of accelerated approval and fast track products. The Secretary will establish a program to encourage the development of surrogate and clinical endpoints, biomarkers, and scientific tools to predict clinical benefit for serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance within one year of the draft guidance, after public comment. This includes amending regulations for accelerated approval to align with the amendments made by section 3. The Secretary must consider issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases. Novel approaches to reviewing surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence should be incorporated, especially for diseases with low prevalence. The issuance of guidance or regulations implementing the amendments made by section 3 should not delay review or approval processes. The issuance of guidance or regulations implementing the amendments made by section 3 shall not hinder the review or action on requests for designation or applications for approval under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT REVIEW.\n\nThe Secretary will contract with an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. Consultation with various stakeholders will be included.\n\nSEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. The amendments to section 506(b) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
