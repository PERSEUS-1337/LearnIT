    "content": "The Constitution outlines the process for appointing a Justice to the Supreme Court, involving nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. The recent nomination of Merrick Garland followed the vacancy left by Justice Scalia's death in 2016. Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. Republican leaders argued that the vacancy should not be filled until after the next presidential election, while Democratic leaders urged for a nominee to be sent to the Senate immediately. Harry Reid (D-NV) and President Obama urged the Senate to consider Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities. Despite the lack of Senate action, the nomination was not withdrawn by the President, marking the first time since 1866 that no formal Senate action was taken on a Supreme Court nomination. The nomination was returned to President Obama at the end of the 114th Congress. President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court was not withdrawn by the President but was returned at the end of the 114th Congress. President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy left by Scalia, which is currently pending before the Senate. The report analyzes the frequency of Supreme Court vacancies, the length of the Scalia vacancy compared to past vacancies, and the occurrence of vacancies during presidential election years. Since President George Washington's initial six appointments to the Supreme Court in 1789 and 1790, vacancies on the Court have occurred on average every two years. In the post-War period (1946 to present), vacancies have occurred every 2.4 years, and since 1980, slightly less frequently at every 3.1 years. Since 1980, vacancies on the Supreme Court have occurred less frequently, on average every 3.1 years. Justices hold office for life, often serving until death or voluntary retirement. Since 1980, vacancies on the Supreme Court have occurred less frequently, with Justices often serving until death or voluntary retirement. Historically, 42% of vacancies have been due to a sitting Justice's death, while 58% have occurred for other reasons. Over the past 60 years, vacancies due to a Justice's death have been relatively rare, with only two instances since 1956. Since 1956, only 2 out of 25 vacancies on the Supreme Court were due to a Justice's death, making such occurrences rare in recent years. Prior to 1900, a higher percentage of vacancies were caused by a Justice's death. During the first half of the 20th century, 43% of Supreme Court vacancies were due to a Justice's death. Vacancies have varied in length, ranging from 1 day to 835 days. Vacancies lasted longer before the 20th century compared to the 20th and 21st centuries. Since 1900, vacancies on the Supreme Court have lasted an average of 77 days, with the Scalia vacancy currently at 382 days, making it the seventh longest in history. The vacancy created in 1969 by Justice Abe Fortas' resignation lasted 363 days, one of the 10 longest vacancies on the Court. The vacancy on the Supreme Court created in 1969 by Justice Abe Fortas' resignation lasted 363 days, one of the longest vacancies in history. Out of 147 nominations to the Court since 1791, the average time from nomination to final Senate action has been 28 days, with variations over time in the Senate's speed of approving or rejecting nominations. Since 1956, nominations have waited an average of 67 days for final Senate action. Since 1956, nominations for Supreme Court vacancies have waited an average of 67 days for final Senate action. The longest pending nomination for any Supreme Court vacancy since 1791 was Judge Garland's nomination, which was pending for 293 days. Currently, Judge Gorsuch's nomination to fill the Scalia vacancy has been pending for 28 days in the Senate. The current nomination to fill the Scalia vacancy, Judge Gorsuch, has been pending in the Senate for 28 days as of March 1, 2017. Out of 10 nominations, six were not approved by the Senate, while four were ultimately confirmed, with the longest-pending nomination being Louis Brandeis in 1916. Some vacancies have lasted a long time without a nomination pending in the Senate for a long period. For example, the vacancy after Justice John McLean's death in 1861 lasted 295 days, but the nomination of Noah H. Swayne was confirmed in just 3 days. The vacancy created by Justice Smith Thompson in 1843 lasted 424 days, with six nominations totaling 190 days pending before the Senate. There have been 16 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, with 3 occurring after the general election and 4 before. Since 1791, there have been a total of 9 vacancies on the Supreme Court during a presidential election year where the vacancy occurred before the general election and the President nominated a replacement before the election. The Scalia vacancy in 2016 was the first to occur under these circumstances since 1932. These 9 vacancies represent 8% of all vacancies on the Court since 1791. The Scalia vacancy in 2016 was one of three vacancies where the Senate did not approve a President's nominee for a vacancy that arose during a presidential election year. Since 1791, there have been nine vacancies on the Court during presidential election years where the vacancy rolled over from a preceding year. In 1987, a vacancy on the Supreme Court was filled during an election year when Anthony M. Kennedy was confirmed. In 1968, President Johnson nominated Abe Fortas and Homer Thornberry in anticipation of vacancies, but the nominations were withdrawn. This shows historical examples of nominations and vacancies on the Court during election years. President Johnson withdrew both nominations, and Chief Justice Warren did not step down from the Court until 1969, resulting in no vacancies on the Court in 1968. Prior to the Scalia vacancy, there have been seven vacancies on the Supreme Court filled during a different administration, representing approximately 6% of all vacancies since 1791. The last time a vacancy arose during one presidency and was filled during a different presidency was in 1881 when President Garfield was assassinated, and the vacancy created by Justice Nathan Clifford's death was eventually filled by President Arthur. The vacancy created by Justice Nathan Clifford's death in 1881 was eventually filled by President Arthur, marking one of the seven vacancies filled during a different administration. The last time a similar situation occurred was in 1862 when a vacancy arose during one presidency and was filled during a different administration. The Scalia vacancy on the Supreme Court, which occurred during one presidency and was filled during a different presidency, reflects the longest period of 342 days from the vacancy to when President Obama left office. This is one of eight vacancies that occurred during different political party systems, with five vacancies during the \"Modern Party System\" starting in 1854. The Scalia vacancy on the Supreme Court occurred during President Obama's term and lasted 342 days until he left office. Most departing Presidents nominated a replacement for vacancies during their presidencies, with six out of eight submitting nominations before leaving office. The number of days reported for each vacancy does not reflect the total duration before being filled. Since 1791, there have been 20 vacancies on the Supreme Court where more than one nomination was made before the vacancy was filled. Sometimes a vacancy is not filled after the initial nomination is rejected, not acted upon, or withdrawn. Multiple nominations may be made before a new Justice is appointed. Since 1791, there have been 20 vacancies on the Supreme Court requiring multiple nominations before being filled. The Scalia vacancy is the most recent example. Six vacancies occurred between 1860 and 1899, one between 1900 and 1955, and five between 1956 and 2016. Six vacancies involved Senate rejection of nominations, and four involved President withdrawal of nominations. The Scalia vacancy is distinctive among the 12 vacancies on the Supreme Court as it is the only one where a nomination was returned to the President after the Senate took no action. Vacancies requiring multiple nominations have generally lasted longer than the median length of a vacancy on the Court. The vacancies on the Supreme Court have generally lasted longer than the average length, with nominees receiving unanimous or nearly unanimous support at confirmation. Samuel Alito's nomination was an exception to this pattern. Samuel Alito's nomination in 2006 received 42 nay votes, an exception to the usual unanimous or nearly unanimous support for Supreme Court nominees."
