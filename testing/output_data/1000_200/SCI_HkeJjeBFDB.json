    "content": "Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique where a smaller model mimics a larger pretrained model. To deploy compact models effectively, reducing performance gap and enhancing robustness to perturbations is crucial. Noise plays a significant role in improving neural networks training by addressing generalization and robustness goals. Introducing variability through noise at input or supervision levels can improve generalization and robustness of a model. Techniques like \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\" show significant improvements in generalization by using noise sources. Adding Gaussian noise to the student model's output from the teacher on the original image enhances adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption also has a surprising impact on model robustness. This study emphasizes the benefits of incorporating constructive noise in knowledge distillation and encourages further research in this area. Designing Deep Neural Networks for real-world deployment requires consideration of memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security, especially in resource-constrained devices like self-driving cars. Developing compact models that generalize well is crucial due to constantly changing deployment environments. In the study, the focus is on knowledge distillation as a method for compressing models, which involves training a smaller network under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network. Techniques like model quantization, model pruning, and knowledge distillation are proposed for achieving high performance in compressed models. It is important to consider the performance of models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, as well as their robustness to malicious attacks. The study focuses on knowledge distillation, where a smaller network is trained under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network. While this method improves the student model's performance, there is still a significant gap between the student and teacher models. The goal is to find optimal ways to transfer knowledge from the larger network to the smaller model and enhance the student model's robustness to various perturbations. The proposed methods draw inspiration from neuroscience studies on human learning, emphasizing neuroplasticity and collaborative learning. Cognitive bias and trial-to-trial response variation are key theories guiding the approach, focusing on human decision-making heuristics and deviations from rationality. The study explores cognitive biases in decision-making and the impact of trial-to-trial response variation in the brain. Introducing constructive noise in collaborative learning can help deter cognitive bias, improving learning outcomes and model accuracy. In this work, the beneficial effects of noise in knowledge distillation are highlighted, showing how noise can improve model generalization and robustness. The study includes an analysis of different noise types in the teacher-student collaborative learning framework, introducing a method called \"Fickle Teacher\" using Dropout for generalization improvement. Additionally, Gaussian noise is used in a novel approach for enhancing model performance. The \"Fickle Teacher\" method utilizes Gaussian noise in knowledge distillation to improve generalization and adversarial robustness of the student model. Another approach, \"Soft Randomization\", enhances adversarial robustness while minimizing the drop in generalization. Random label corruption is shown to deter cognitive bias and improve adversarial robustness with minimal impact on generalization. Noise has been used as a regularization technique to enhance generalization performance in deep neural networks. Common regularization techniques have been used to improve generalization performance in deep neural networks by adding noise to the input data, weights, or hidden units. Various noise techniques, such as Dropout and injecting noise to the gradient, have been shown to be beneficial for non-convex optimization. Randomization techniques that inject noise during training and inference have proven effective against adversarial attacks. Randomized smoothing transforms classifiers into smooth classifiers with certifiable robustness guarantees. Incorporating noise in knowledge distillation may enhance model robustness. CIFAR-10 dataset was chosen for empirical analysis due to its relevance in distillation and robustness research. Noise addition in distillation could lead to lightweight models with improved generalization and resilience to adversarial attacks. Incorporating noise in knowledge distillation can enhance model robustness. The study uses the Hinton method to train the student model, with experiments conducted on Wide Residual Networks. Image normalization and standard training schemes are applied, with evaluation on ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset. Adversarial robustness is evaluated using the Projected Gradient Descent attack. In the student-teacher learning framework of knowledge distillation, noise is injected into the output logits of the teacher model to analyze its impact on model generalization and robustness. Gaussian noise with variance proportional to the output logits is added to each sample, studying the effects within the noise range [0 \u2212 0.5]. In the student-teacher learning framework of knowledge distillation, noise is injected into the output logits of the teacher model to analyze its impact on model generalization and robustness. Adding Gaussian noise with variance proportional to the output logits in each sample within the range [0 \u2212 0.5] improves generalization to CIFAR-10 test set. The method also enhances adversarial and natural robustness of the models, contrasting with previous findings on label smoothing's negative effect on knowledge distillation. Our method improves the distillation process by adding noise to the teacher model's softened logits during knowledge transfer to the student. Dropout is used in the teacher model to introduce variability in the supervision signal, resulting in different output predictions for the same input. This approach contrasts with previous methods that use noise injection in the output logits. Our method enhances knowledge distillation by incorporating dropout as a source of uncertainty encoding noise for transferring knowledge to a compact student model. Unlike previous approaches, we utilize the teacher model's logits with activated dropout to train the student for more epochs, enabling direct capture of the teacher's uncertainty. This method improves generalization on unseen and out-of-distribution data, as well as enhances robustness against PGD attacks. Performance comparison is conducted for dropout rates ranging from 0 to 0.5 in steps of 0.1. The proposed method enhances knowledge distillation by incorporating dropout as a source of uncertainty encoding noise for transferring knowledge to a compact student model. Training the student model with dropout using this scheme significantly improves generalization and robustness over previous methods. Dropout rates up to 0.2 increase both PGD Robustness and natural robustness, suggesting that trial-to-trial variability helps distill knowledge to the student model. The curr_chunk discusses a novel method for adding Gaussian noise to input images during knowledge distillation to improve adversarial robustness. The method aims to retain robustness gains while mitigating generalization loss. The method involves minimizing a loss function in the knowledge distillation framework, using Gaussian noise levels to increase adversarial robustness and decrease generalization. The proposed method outperforms models trained with Gaussian noise alone, achieving significant improvements in both generalization and robustness. Our method improves adversarial robustness at lower noise intensity, achieving 33.85% compared to 3.53% for the student model trained alone. It also enhances robustness to common corruptions, such as noise and blurring, while showing improvements in weather and digital corruptions. The method allows for increased robustness with lower noise intensity, maintaining low generalization loss compared to other training methods. Based on the previous paragraphs discussing improvements in adversarial robustness and generalization loss, a regularization technique based on label noise is proposed. This technique involves randomly changing target labels to prevent overgeneralization and encourage model confidence. The technique involves randomly relabeling samples to prevent overgeneralization and encourage model confidence. Previous studies have focused on improving DNNs' tolerance to noisy labels, but using random label noise for constructive noise has not been explored. The effect of random label corruption is extensively studied on various levels and p values for both teacher and student models. The effect of random label corruption on knowledge distillation and adversarial robustness is extensively studied. When label corruption is used during knowledge distillation to the student model, generalization improves. However, when label corruption is used for training both teacher and student models, generalization drops. Interestingly, random label corruption significantly increases adversarial robustness, with even a small percentage of random labels leading to a notable increase in robustness. By training with 5% random labels, the PGD-20 robustness of the teacher model increases to 10.89%. This increase in robustness is observed for Corrupted-T and Corrupted-TS. Adversarial robustness increases with up to 40% random label corruption, then slightly decreases at 50%. Introducing variability in the knowledge distillation framework through noise at different levels improves generalization and robustness. The Fickle teacher and soft randomization methods enhance in-distribution and out of distribution generalization, as well as adversarial robustness significantly. Soft randomization improves adversarial robustness and generalization in the knowledge distillation framework by injecting noises to increase trial-to-trial variability. Hinton et al. proposed using final softmax function with raised temperature and smooth logits as soft targets for student model training. The method involves using the final softmax function with a raised temperature and smooth logits of the teacher model as soft targets for the student model, minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence between output probabilities. Neural networks generalize well when test data matches training data distribution, but real-world models often face domain shift, impacting generalization performance. Test set performance alone is not the best metric for evaluating model generalization in a test environment. The out-of-distribution performance of models can be measured using ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing a threat to their deployment in real-world scenarios. Adversarial attacks on deep learning models are a real threat, leading to a focus on evaluating and improving robustness. The Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack is used to assess model robustness by adding random noise within an epsilon bound to the original image and adjusting the image based on loss direction. The Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack assesses model robustness by adjusting the input image based on loss direction within an epsilon bound and valid image range. Adversarial robustness is crucial for security, but models also need to withstand natural perturbations encountered in real-world environments. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to both adversarial and commonly occurring perturbations. Neural Networks are vulnerable to real-world perturbations, not just adversarial examples. Studies have shown that models can significantly degrade in accuracy due to natural occurrences. It is important to balance robustness to adversarial attacks with generalization to common perturbations. In balancing model robustness, it is crucial to consider generalization to common perturbations alongside adversarial attacks. Recent studies have shown that adversarially trained models may negatively impact natural robustness and performance under semantics-preserving transformations. Additionally, these models may improve robustness to certain perturbations at the expense of others more common in real-world scenarios. In the adversarial literature, studies have shown a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization. To exploit the uncertainty of the teacher model, random swapping noise methods are proposed to swap softmax logits based on a threshold. Two variants are suggested: Swap Top 2 and Swap All for consecutive pairs with low differences. The training scheme for distillation with dropout involves training the student model for more epochs to capture the uncertainty of the teacher model. Different dropout rates require varying numbers of epochs and learning rate reductions for convergence. The training scheme for distillation with dropout involves training the student model for more epochs with varying dropout rates and learning rate reductions for convergence. Adversarial Robustness techniques improve accuracy on unseen data but not generalization to out-of-distribution data. The curr_chunk contains various noise and blur effects such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, shot noise, speckle noise, defocus blur, Gaussian blur, glass blur, motion blur, zoom blur, brightness, fog, frost, snow, spatter, contrast, elastic transform, JPEG compression, pixelate, and saturate."
