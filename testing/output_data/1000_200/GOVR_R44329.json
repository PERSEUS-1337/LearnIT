    "content": "In FY2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) obligated over $280 billion for federal contracts, more than all other federal agencies combined, equal to 8% of federal spending. Analysts and officials believe that using data more effectively in acquisition decision-making could save billions, allocate resources efficiently, and improve military operations. The National Defense Industrial Association emphasized data as a critical step in improving defense acquisitions. Congress has taken steps to enhance DOD's efficiency, including requiring auditability and implementing acquisition reform provisions in National Defense Authorization Acts. The report examines DOD's use of data for decision-making in defense acquisitions, highlighting the need for more effective data analysis. Congress has taken steps to improve DOD's efficiency, including requiring auditability and implementing acquisition reform provisions. The report focuses on DOD's use of data for decision-making in defense acquisitions, emphasizing the importance of effective data analysis in informing policy decisions and measuring program effectiveness. Effective data analysis is crucial for informing policy decisions and measuring program effectiveness in government operations. A lack of data can lead to incorrect conclusions and wastage of resources. Reports have highlighted instances where officials lacked access to data, leading to inefficiencies and excess inventories in military operations. The Army's audit readiness was at risk due to unreliable data, hindering supply chain management in Afghanistan and impacting operations. Despite the importance of data, the DOD does not effectively incorporate it into decision-making, leading to inefficiencies and excess inventories in military operations. Despite the general consensus among government officials and analysts that the Department of Defense (DOD) does not sufficiently incorporate data into decision-making, many major policy decisions are made without substantive data. Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz emphasized the importance of data-driven decisions in both the private sector and government settings. Congress has also recognized the significance of data in improving government operations. In 2014, Congress enacted the DATA Act to improve government operations by establishing data standards for financial data and providing searchable spending data. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain emphasized the importance of basic data for addressing management problems in the Department of Defense. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain highlighted the challenges faced by the Department of Defense in addressing management problems due to a lack of essential data. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates also noted the difficulty in obtaining accurate information on spending and personnel. This information shortfall not only leads to inefficiency and wasted resources but also hinders the effectiveness of the Department of Defense and national security. Leaders and Congress overseers struggle to assess national security policies, military priorities, and tradeoffs effectively due to a lack of critical data elements. The Department of Defense needs proper information systems, comprehensive and accurate data, and data-driven decision-making. In some cases, decision-makers lack even a basic database, leading to inefficiencies in managing multibillion-dollar programs. The importance of sound systems in managing weapon system portfolios is highlighted, as manual processes can be labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. The lack of effective systems can hinder leaders from utilizing valuable program information. It is crucial for existing systems to be capable of performing required functions, as some DOD systems have been found to be flawed, impacting budgetary accounting improvement efforts. The Department of Defense's budgetary accounting improvement efforts have been hindered by flawed financial management systems and transaction control weaknesses, as highlighted by the GAO. Despite ongoing efforts to enhance financial management systems, completion is not expected until 2017. The presence of multiple IT systems and databases with conflicting data poses challenges in determining the agreed source for specific data sets, prompting calls for architectural improvements. Calls to improve data systems used for collecting, managing, and analyzing DOD acquisition data have been made due to conflicts in data from various systems. Existing systems lack reliable or complete information, with instances of insufficient or nonexistent data in DOD data sets. The challenges with data reliability and sufficiency are illustrated by the costs of the Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation (FPDS) and Operations and Support. FPDS is a central database relied upon by Congress, legislative and executive branch agencies, analysts, and the public for procurement information. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) is a crucial database for U.S. government-wide procurement, used by Congress, executive branch agencies, analysts, and the public. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy and reliability of the data in FPDS, with efforts being made to improve its quality based on recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of Management and Budget has mandated executive branch agencies to implement GAO recommendations to enhance FPDS data quality. Concerns persist about FPDS data reliability, leading analysts to use it for general trends and rough estimates. The General Services Administration is revamping data systems, including FPDS, to improve reliability and usefulness. Stakeholder feedback is being sought to enhance data systems' reliability, usability, and relevance. Upgrades are expected to be completed by 2017 or 2018. The Department of Defense (DOD) is working on updating its systems to improve data quality and reliability, including tracking Operations and Support (O&S) costs. The upgrades are expected to be completed in 2017 or 2018. GAO found that DOD reports on weapon system O&S costs were inconsistent and unreliable, hindering effective oversight. Insufficient data also limited DOD officials' ability to analyze cost growth, identify drivers, and develop cost management plans. The Department of Defense (DOD) is addressing inconsistencies in reporting O&S costs. DOD components have not consistently tracked costs against final estimates post-fielding. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is enforcing more uniform unit calculations for O&S, but building a data bank will take time. Data access, quality, and availability issues persist in other acquisition phases. Reliable data may not always reach decision-makers, leading to decisions based on perceptions or anecdotes. Some policies and acquisition decisions in the Department of Defense are driven by perceptions or anecdotal evidence due to a lack of sufficient data analysis. Institutional and cultural barriers, as well as bureaucratic incentives, restrict data access and sharing, leading to a conservative bias in labeling and decision-making. The Department of Defense faces challenges in data access and utilization, with a conservative bias in labeling and decision-making. There is a lack of people capable of complex data analysis, hindering effective use of existing data. Senior leaders may not understand how to use data for informed decisions, leading to unchecked statistics influencing decision-making. Some government officials and DOD analysts emphasize the importance of understanding data limitations and avoiding collecting data without a clear purpose. They caution against gathering data just for the sake of it, as it may lead to limited usefulness and excessive time spent on data calls and reporting requirements. Some DOD officials caution against excessive time spent on data calls and reporting requirements that lack a useful analytical purpose. They emphasize the need to ensure that the benefit of data analyses outweighs the cost of collecting and analyzing data. Striving for more and better data can sometimes hinder effective data analysis, as data do not need to be perfect to be useful. Decisionmakers should focus on whether sufficient data exist from which to draw reasonable conclusions. Critical questions to ask when working with data include: What useful analysis can be developed now? How can we model correctly? What are the uncertainty bounds of the data? Imperfect data can still be useful, and even perfect data is unlikely to yield perfect analysis. Cost estimating, for example, is imprecise but can still aid in decision-making. Cost estimating is imprecise but can aid decision-makers. DOD struggled to track data for strategic contracting decisions in Afghanistan due to unreliable information and inadequate IT systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) faced challenges in tracking and managing its supply chain in Afghanistan over the past decade. Lack of IT systems and conflicting information hindered the ability to effectively distribute supplies and equipment to the warfighter. This impacted operations in Afghanistan and limited DOD's visibility and oversight of the supply chain. In 2009, Greg Gardner, then-Deputy Chief Information Officer (DCIO) for the Director of National Intelligence, highlighted issues with the U.S. government's 23 different network information technology systems in Afghanistan. These systems were often duplicative, not interoperable, leading to wasteful spending and poor data sharing. Data reliability was questionable, with information often kept at the local level and not flowing up to the central database, resulting in incomplete and unreliable data. Data reliability in the theatre-wide database was poor, with only about 10% of all data records eventually making it into the central database. The error rate of data in the system was approximately 50%, and information was often not shared due to lack of experience in handling tasks. DOD officials faced challenges with data reliability and awareness of existing data sources, leading to inexperienced personnel being assigned tasks without necessary information. Efforts have been made to improve data quality and identify necessary information for better contract decisions. DOD has made progress in identifying data for better contract decisions and leveraging data systems from Afghanistan for future operations. However, there are gaps in data availability and reliability, with efforts underway to improve IT systems and gather data for policy decisions. Efforts to integrate data gathering and analysis into DOD culture for informed policy decisions are crucial. Leadership support is key for a successful analytics program, with a focus on transitioning to a more data-informed decision-making process. The focus on data-driven decision-making in DOD is evident in various initiatives, such as the annual reports analyzing defense acquisitions. Senior leadership is promoting a more data-driven process for supply chain management, but some argue that more than just statements are needed. DOD is investing billions in information technology systems to support this data-based decision-making approach. DOD is investing billions in information technology systems and tools for data-based decision-making. Efforts are being made to improve data quality and reliability, with systems like FPDS undergoing significant overhauls. An analytics center was established in 2013 to analyze data for measuring acquisitions' effectiveness and policy crafting. The Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation office also launched a cost assessment data initiative. The Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation office (CAPE) launched the cost assessment data enterprise (CADE) project to consolidate historical acquisition data into an online system for decision-makers and cost analysts. The military services are also integrating data into decision-making processes, with the Navy reevaluating IT systems to determine data needs and justifying necessary investments. The Air Force IT Business Analytics Office has identified over $500 million in potential cost savings. Congress has helped improve the use of data in decision-making, with examples like The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act focusing on using data early in the acquisition process. The establishment of CAPE has strengthened independent cost analysis. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act focused on using data early in the acquisition process, strengthening cost analysis through CAPE, and requiring DOD to be audit-ready for financial statements. This act aimed to improve cost estimates and bring greater control to DOD's business operations. The DOD aims to improve efficiency and management through auditability, which will enhance awareness and control of business operations. Despite past failures in data-based decision-making, there have been some successful examples like the Navy's Air System Command. Implementing and improving data systems will take years, with both successes and failures expected along the way. The DOD aims to improve efficiency and management through auditability, which will enhance awareness and control of business operations. Implementing and improving data systems will take years, with both successes and failures expected along the way. Our ability to affect decisions with data may take years to accomplish, as historic data is often sparse, making it difficult to assess contemporary observations. Building a robust historical database is crucial to understanding the performance of the acquisition system and avoiding knee-jerk reactions to short-term events. Former Under Secretary of Defense Robert Hale emphasized the importance of promoting efficiency in the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense aims to improve efficiency through data analysis and decision-making. Congressional action is crucial in allocating resources for building necessary systems and workforce. Congress may need to invest in IT and analytical capability to enhance defense acquisitions. Congress may need to invest in IT systems and analytical capability within the Department of Defense to improve data analysis and decision-making. This includes building the capacity of offices like Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation and Service Acquisition Executives. Key considerations include assessing DOD's strategy for data needs, technology deployment, in-house analytical capability, and hiring qualified personnel for data analysis. The Department of Defense (DOD) needs to focus on building a culture that values data-driven decision-making and integrates data analysis into its standard routines. Congress could consider legislation to promote the use of data in decision-making within DOD. Key questions to consider include assessing DOD's culture for using data, incentives that promote or inhibit data use, and steps to incorporate data analysis into routine processes. The recent RAND report on DOD's access to acquisition data highlighted inefficiencies in data access and information delivery. Balancing the benefits of data-sharing with information security concerns is a key challenge for DOD. Congress may need to consider how DOD can improve data access while protecting sensitive information."
