    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act\" and includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The Secretary of Transportation will make a grant to a nonprofit entity for designing a pilot program to improve air quality through telecommuting. The program will be administered in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Energy. The proposed Ozone Precursor Credit-Trading Pilot Program involves participating employers authorizing telecommuting to reduce emissions of ozone precursors. Regulated entities under the Clean Air Act would be involved in this program. The proposed pilot program aims to evaluate methods for calculating reductions in emissions of ozone precursors by telecommuting employees to reduce vehicle-miles traveled. The proposed pilot program involves telecommuting employees reducing emissions through vehicle-miles traveled. Employers can transfer emission credits and participate in a trading forum to obtain credits. Regulated entities can obtain emission credits through direct trades or exchanges with credit holders. These credits can be presented to the Federal Government or State for compliance with the Clean Air Act. The government will explore ways to facilitate credit transfers between employers and entities. The Secretary will designate sites for the pilot program's operation. The Secretary will designate sites for the pilot program's operation in specific geographic areas, including the greater metropolitan regions of the District of Columbia and Los Angeles, as well as three additional areas to be selected in consultation with the grantee. The Secretary requires consultation with local governments and business organizations in designated geographic areas for the pilot program. The grantee must study and report on the potential impact of the program on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and reducing vehicle miles traveled. The pilot program requires consultation with local governments and business organizations in designated areas. The grantee must study the impact on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life. Authorization of $250,000 for fiscal year 2000 is available for the grant."
