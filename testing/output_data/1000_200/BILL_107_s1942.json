    "content": "The Act titled \"Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002\" provides incentives for biodiesel use as fuel through a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 introduces a biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. The credit is based on the biodiesel mixture rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures and the number of gallons of the mixture used by the taxpayer. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 establishes a biodiesel fuels credit based on the percentage of biodiesel in a qualified mixture. This credit applies to mixtures sold for use as fuel or used by the taxpayer producing the mixture. The biodiesel fuels credit applies to biodiesel mixtures sold for use in a taxpayer's trade or business for the taxable year. No credit is allowed for casual off-farm production. The credit amount may be reduced to account for any benefit from excise tax exemptions. The biodiesel fuels credit applies to biodiesel mixtures used in a taxpayer's trade or business. The definition of biodiesel includes esters derived from various vegetable oils. The biodiesel must meet registration requirements set by the EPA and ASTM D6751 to qualify for the tax credit. The tax is imposed on any person who separates biodiesel from a mixture or uses the mixture other than as a fuel, based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons. All applicable laws and penalties apply to this tax. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, rules similar to subsection (d) of section 52 shall apply for estates and trusts. A taxpayer may elect to have the biodiesel fuels credit not apply for any taxable year, with the election period lasting up to 3 years from the last date for filing the return. The biodiesel fuels credit election must be made by the last date for filing the return, as per regulations. The section does not apply to fuel sold after December 31, 2012. The credit is treated as part of the general business credit under Section 38(b) of the Code. Conforming amendments are made to Section 39(d) of the Code. Conforming amendments are made to Section 39(d) of the Code regarding the biodiesel fuels credit determined under section 40A. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 40A is amended in the Code, with changes to section 6501(m) and the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made by this subsection apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2002. Section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new subsection regarding reduction of motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures. The rate of tax for qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced under prescribed regulations by the Secretary. The rate of tax for qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. The tax rate for biodiesel mixtures is reduced based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture, with specific rules and definitions provided in the code. The tax rate for biodiesel mixtures is reduced based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture, as defined in the code. The Secretary will pay an amount to a person who uses diesel fuel to produce a qualified biodiesel mixture for their trade or business. The amendments made by this subsection apply to fuel sold between December 31, 2002, and January 1, 2013. Transfers from the Commodity Credit Corporation to the Highway Trust Fund will offset any reductions in fund receipts due to these changes."
