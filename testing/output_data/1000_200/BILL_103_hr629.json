    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improvement of Information Access Act of 1993\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of a well-informed citizenry, access to Government information, and the use of modern technology for citizen benefit. Government information is a national resource and economic asset that belongs to the public, funded by taxpayers who should have affordable access without excessive fees. Taxpayers should not have to pay excessive fees for Government information. It is difficult for citizens to provide feedback on Federal information policies, leading to agencies not considering public interest. Federal agencies are slow in developing standards to make Government information easier to access. Many agencies do not provide timely access to Government information at reasonable costs. Improved public access to government information is addressed in a new chapter added to Title 44 of the United States Code. The new chapter in Title 44 of the United States Code requires executive departments to provide annual reports on their information dissemination policies and practices, including plans for new products and services, and efforts to improve information accessibility. The annual reports required by Title 44 of the United States Code must include progress on creating comprehensive indexes and bibliographies, methods for public access to information, provisions for protecting outdated records, public awareness strategies, and a summary of public comments received.

The public can provide comments on the information dissemination policies and practices of a department or establishment, including the types of information collected, methods of storage and dissemination, pricing, and the validity, reliability, timeliness, and usefulness of the information. Comments received will be available for public inspection, and the department or establishment must provide a summary of these comments each year. The agency must allow public dialogue through hearings and forums on information policies. Before discontinuing a service, the agency must publish a notice for public comments with reasons for the discontinuation. Each agency must disseminate information in diverse modes and through appropriate outlets to reinforce statutory requirements for distribution. They should ensure the timeliness, usefulness, and reliability of the information for the public, store and disseminate information in standardized formats. The agency must disseminate information in diverse modes and through appropriate outlets to ensure free or low-cost public access to Government information. Agencies are prohibited from charging depository libraries for distributing information products, charging more than the incremental cost of distribution, or imposing royalties for the use of Government information. The Archivist of the United States and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will issue model performance standards for agencies to provide public access to records. Agencies must provide public documents upon request within a specified timeframe.
