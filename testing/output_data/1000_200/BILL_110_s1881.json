    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was intended to establish a clear prohibition of discrimination based on disability, provide broad coverage, and effective remedies. However, Supreme Court decisions have narrowed the scope of protection, excluding individuals Congress aimed to protect. Disabilities are seen as natural parts of human experience that should not limit participation in all aspects of life. Congress recognized that disabilities are natural parts of the human experience and should not limit participation in society. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was modeled after the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to encompass both actual and perceived limitations imposed by society. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 broadened the definition of disability to include actual and perceived limitations, as well as those imposed by society. This concept was underscored by the Supreme Court's decision in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, acknowledging that societal myths and fears about disability can be as limiting as physical impairments. Congress understood that adverse actions based on physical or mental impairments are often unrelated to the limitations caused by the impairment itself. The Supreme Court has interpreted the term \"disability\" strictly, creating a demanding standard for qualification as disabled, contrary to congressional expectations in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Supreme Court has narrowed the coverage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by excluding individuals who have mitigated their impairments. The Act aims to restore broad protection and address Supreme Court decisions that have limited its scope.

FINDINGS IN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 emphasizes that individuals with disabilities have the right to fully participate in society and have historically faced discrimination. Individuals with disabilities have faced purposeful unequal treatment, restrictions, and political powerlessness in society. Classifications excluding them should be strongly disfavored and only permitted for compelling reasons, not based on prejudice or stereotypes about disability. The definition of disability is outlined in Section 4. Individuals with disabilities have historically faced discrimination and exclusion in society, and classifications excluding them should only be allowed for compelling reasons, not based on prejudice or stereotypes. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) defines disability as a physical or mental impairment, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having an impairment. The determination of impairment should not consider the use of mitigating measures. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 defines disability as a physical or mental impairment, without regard to the use of mitigating measures. Mitigating measures refer to treatments or devices used to lessen the impact of an impairment.
