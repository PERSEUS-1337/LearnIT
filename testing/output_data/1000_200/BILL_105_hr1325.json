The State Administrator shall establish a Problem Resolution Office with officers authorized to investigate taxpayer complaints and halt collection activity if deemed non-compliant with the law. Only the highest official in the relevant taxing authority can reverse such injunctions based on clear evidence, and officers cannot be penalized unless issuing manifestly unreasonable injunctions. The State Administrator can issue administrative injunctions to halt collection activity if deemed non-compliant with the law, but only the highest official can reverse them based on clear evidence. Taxpayers and State Administrators can pursue legal remedies in court if needed. SEC. 53. JURISDICTION AND INTERSTATE ALLOCATION. Allocation of revenue between administering states from taxes imposed by this subtitle is based on the destination of taxable property or services. The Secretary will establish an Office of Revenue Allocation to resolve disputes regarding destination determination. The Administrator's decision can be reviewed in federal court under an abuse of discretion standard. The destination of taxable property or services for revenue allocation is determined based on specific criteria: tangible personal property goes to the state of delivery, real property to its location state, other property to the purchaser's residence, and services to the state of use, consumption, or enjoyment. Judicial review in federal court is available under an abuse of discretion standard. The destination of services is determined based on where the use, consumption, or enjoyment occurred. Telecommunications services are allocated to the purchaser's residence, while domestic transportation services go to the final destination of the trip within the United States. The destination of transportation services is the final destination of the trip within the United States. For international transportation services, 50 percent of the service amount is attributed to the United States. Financial intermediation services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence. State Tax Administrators have jurisdiction over gross payments with a destination within their state. The jurisdiction of State Tax Administrators extends to gross payments with a destination within their state, including rents and royalties for tangible property leases. The destination for rent and lease payments on vehicles depends on the term length, either where the vehicle was delivered or the residence of the lessee. \"Tax must be stated and charged separately according to Section 54.\" The sales tax for taxable property or services must be charged separately by the vendor, and a receipt provided to the purchaser with specific details including price exclusive of tax, amount of tax paid, price inclusive of tax, tax rate, date of sale, vendor's name, and registration number. The vendor's name and registration number are required for sales tax purposes. Vending machines are exempt from these requirements if they dispense taxable items for coins or bills up to $20, with no single item exceeding $10 in price. The State Administrator or Secretary can enter installment agreements with taxpayers to facilitate tax collection. Agreements remain valid unless inaccurate information is provided. The Secretary and Administrator have the authority to compromise on amounts due. SEC. 56. ACCOUNTING. Vendors must remit taxes based on when payment is received. An accrual method can be elected for reporting transactions based on invoicing. For bad debts under the accrual method, refer to section 11(g). SEC. 57. HOBBY ACTIVITIES. \"Section 57 states that the exemption for hobby activities is not available if the trade or business is not for profit. If gross payments exceed certain expenses in 2 of the last 4 years, the business is deemed for profit. Section 5 discusses the phase-out of the Internal Revenue Service.\" The Internal Revenue Service expenses are not authorized for processing income tax returns before the repeal of the income tax. New subsections are added for the Excise Tax Bureau and Sales Tax Bureau within the Department of Treasury to administer excise and national sales taxes. The Office of Revenue Allocation shall be within the Sales Tax Bureau. Section 7801(b)(2) is amended to allow the Secretary of the Treasury to appoint up to 5 Assistant General Counsels. Modifications to the tax imposed by sections 1 and 11 for taxable years ending June 30, 1999 are outlined, including reductions for calendar year and fiscal year taxpayers. For fiscal year taxpayers, the dollar figures in sections 1 and 11 are adjusted based on the taxpayer's taxable year ending June 30, 1999. The Secretary is required to publish tax rate schedules in accordance with this adjustment. Starting January 1, 1999, the Social Security Administration will collect and manage payroll taxes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 7 of the Act addresses self-employment tax rules. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define 'self-employment income' as gross payments received in a calendar year from the sale of taxable property or services, minus purchases of taxable property or services, wages paid in furtherance of a business purpose, unused transition amounts, and undeducted negative self-employment income amounts from prior periods. Transition amounts for the ten calendar years starting in 1999 will be calculated based on the unrecovered basis amount as of December 31, 1998. The unrecovered basis amount for calendar years starting in 1999 is calculated by dividing the basis amount as of December 31, 1998 by ten. This amount pertains to prior law section 167 property placed in service before January 1, 1999, and inventory held at the end of 1998. Conforming amendments are made to subsections 1402(b) and 1402(c), with renumbering of subsections 1402(d) et seq. to 1402(b) et seq. SEC. 8. SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS INDEXED ON SALES TAX INCLUSIVE BASIS. The amendment to the Social Security Act includes defining the CPI increase percentage based on the Consumer Price Index for cost-of-living adjustments. The CPI increase percentage is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index and the national sales tax factor, as defined by the Department of Labor. The tax factor is calculated as one plus the sales tax rate divided by one minus the sales tax rate. SEC. 9. COMPENSATING PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN PERSONS ON FIXED INCOME. Compensating Payment Defined: Eligible persons entitled to Social Security benefits and qualified fixed income payments will receive a compensating payment based on a fixed income payment amount and excess inflation rate. Eligible Person Defined: Any person receiving Social Security benefits and qualified fixed income payments. Qualified Fixed Income Payment Defined: Payment received by a beneficiary under a defined benefit plan. A qualified fixed income payment is received by a beneficiary under a defined benefit plan or by an annuitant under an annuity contract with a bona fide insurance company. Such payments do not vary with investment performance, interest rates, or inflation. Payments under an annuity contract entered into after June 30, 1999, are not considered qualified fixed income payments. Additionally, payments from a defined benefit plan to a beneficiary who was a participant for less than 5 years are not qualified fixed income payments. The qualified fixed income payment amount is \\1/12\\ of qualified fixed income payments that an eligible person is entitled to receive during the subsequent calendar year, not exceeding $5,000. The term \"excess inflation rate\" refers to the difference between the consumer price index (all urban) during a specific 18-month period and the projected increase reported in the Budget of the United States for Fiscal Year 1999. The Office of Management and Budget baseline assumption for compensating payments in 1999 requires eligible individuals to apply and provide documentation. Payments will be received with Social Security benefits and funded from the general fund. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may require insurers and defined benefit plan sponsors to participate. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may require insurers and defined benefit plan sponsors to issue a statement to annuitants or plan participants with information needed to determine the qualified fixed income payment amount. SEC. 10. INTEREST. Amends section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code by adjusting interest rates.\n\nSEC. 11. SUPERMAJORITY REQUIRED TO RAISE RATE. Prohibits any bill that increases federal sales tax rate and reduces federal revenues without a two-thirds majority vote in the House of Representatives or the Senate."
