Congress finds that diabetes is a major public health threat in the US, with 21 million people currently living with diabetes and 54 million with pre-diabetes. Diabetes is the 6th leading cause of death, with the prevalence of the most common type tripling in the last 30 years. Diabetes self-management training is crucial for patients to identify barriers and acquire necessary skills and knowledge. Diabetes self-management education provides critical knowledge and skills training to patients, helping them identify barriers, problem solve, and develop coping skills to manage their diabetes effectively. Certified diabetes educators, such as nurses, dietitians, or pharmacists, specialize in assisting individuals with diabetes in developing self-management skills to stay healthy and prevent complications. Studies have shown that diabetes self-management training can reduce risks and complications associated with the condition. Studies conducted by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58%, with even greater effectiveness in people aged 60 and older at 71%. Certified diabetes educators help patients better control their diabetes and improve their health status through lifestyle interventions. Lifestyle changes taught by these educators lead to improved glycemic control and reduced complications from diabetes. Certified diabetes educators play a crucial role in helping patients control diabetes and improve health through lifestyle interventions. Evidence suggests that proper medical treatment and active self-management can prevent serious complications from diabetes, such as blindness, amputations, heart disease, and stroke, with high success rates. There are over 20,000 diabetes educators in the US, most of whom are certified by the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators. Eligibility for certification requires specific health care credentials and professional experience in diabetes self-management. Certified diabetes educators, licensed health professionals with extensive experience in diabetes self-management, must pass a national exam and renew their credentials. They are uniquely qualified to provide training under Medicare. Certified diabetes educators are recognized as certified providers for Medicare diabetes outpatient self-management training services. Certified diabetes educators are health care professionals licensed by the state, specializing in teaching individuals with diabetes to manage their condition. They must be certified by a recognized certifying body. Certified diabetes educators must be certified by a recognized certifying body, such as the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators or a certifying body recognized by the Secretary. The National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators or a certifying body for diabetes educators must meet specific requirements for certifying individuals, including having a qualifying credential in a healthcare profession, professional practice experience in diabetes self-management training, and passing a national certification examination. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to identify barriers for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes in accessing self-management training services, including economic and geographic obstacles, availability of referrals, and qualified providers. A report on these barriers is due within one year of the enactment of this Act. The Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will develop recommendations on effective outreach methods to educate primary care physicians and the public about the benefits of diabetes self-management training. A report on these recommendations is due within one year of the enactment of this Act. The Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will submit a report to Congress on recommendations for diabetes self-management training services. The amendments will apply to services provided at least 6 months after the enactment of this Act."
