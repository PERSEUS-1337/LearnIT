Various policies, including tax incentives, have been adopted since the 1970s to increase conservation and energy efficiency. The federal government is still deciding on the best policy tools to meet energy-efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the United States was by the residential sector. Residential energy consumption has slightly decreased in recent years, both as a percentage of total energy consumption and on a per capita basis. Despite some efficiency gains, experts believe there is still significant potential for increased energy efficiency in the residential sector. Despite recent gains in residential energy efficiency, experts believe there is still significant potential for improvement. There are concerns that consumers may not invest in optimal energy efficiency levels, leading to debates on the best investment levels. Increasing energy efficiency could reduce per capita residential energy use over time, but population growth may offset these gains. This report explores the use of tax credits as a policy option to promote residential energy efficiency. The report discusses the use of tax credits to promote residential energy efficiency by addressing market failures and barriers. Taxpayers can claim credits for energy-efficient improvements in the 2017 tax year. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit (IRC \u00a725C) allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for energy-efficiency improvements to their primary residence, including building envelope upgrades and high-efficiency appliances. The credit is calculated as 10% of expenditures on improvements plus the cost of energy-efficient property, capped at $500. Taxpayers typically claim the maximum credit amount for energy-efficient property. The Section 25C credit for energy-efficiency improvements to primary residences is capped at $500 and expired at the end of 2017. Taxpayers cannot claim the credit if they have already claimed $500 or more before 2017. The Section 25D credit allows for a 30% tax credit on renewable energy technologies installed on residences, with rates decreasing in future years. The Section 25D credit offers a 30% tax credit for renewable energy technologies, with rates decreasing in future years and expiring after 2021. The maximum value of the credit is not capped, and a rational consumer would invest in energy-efficient technology if the savings outweigh the costs. For more details, refer to Appendices A and B for specifications and legislative history. The \"energy-efficiency paradox\" refers to consumers not investing in optimal residential energy efficiency despite potential cost savings. Market failures and barriers contribute to this phenomenon. Section 25C and Section 25D credits aim to incentivize energy-efficient technology investments. Market failures and barriers, such as externalities and informational issues, hinder optimal investments in residential energy efficiency. Section 25C and Section 25D credits do not fully address these issues, limiting their impact on increasing energy efficiency. Energy consumption externalities can lead to underallocation of resources for energy-efficient investments. Residential energy-efficiency investments may be underallocated due to externalities, such as pollution costs not reflected in electricity prices. Lower prices lead to overconsumption and underinvestment in energy efficiency. Adoption of energy-efficient technologies can have positive spillover effects, increasing knowledge and adoption among neighbors. The adoption of emerging technologies, such as solar panels, can lead to knowledge spillover effects among neighbors, increasing adoption rates. Market failures, such as not considering these spillover effects, can result in underinvestment in energy efficiency. The principal-agent problem can also occur, where incentives for energy-efficient property decisions may not align between landlords and tenants. Non-owner-occupied housing and builders may underinvest in energy efficiency due to uncertainty about recovering costs. Capital market imperfections and credit constraints can also lead to suboptimal energy-efficiency investments, especially for low-income households. Consumers may settle for less energy-efficient alternatives if they cannot obtain funds upfront. Low-income households, being more credit constrained, are more likely to do so. Lack of information about energy-saving technologies can also hinder investments. Government policies, such as tax incentives, can help address market failures or barriers. Tax incentives, grants, rebates, credit enhancements, regulations, mandates, informational programs, and tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D can help address market failures in energy efficiency investments. Tax incentives like Section 25C and Section 25D credits lower the cost of energy-efficiency investments, encouraging additional investment in these technologies. Other incentives, such as the energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit (IRC \u00a745M), reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products. Governments can also increase awareness about energy-efficient technologies through programs like the Energy Star labeling program. Tax credits may not be the most efficient policy for increasing energy-efficiency investment if markets underinvest due to low electricity prices. Allowing electricity prices to fully reflect costs could be more effective by removing federal financial support or taxing electricity production to encourage investment in energy-efficient technologies. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency do not directly address the principal-agent problem, as they are not available to renters or landlords investing in rental properties. Other tax incentives, like the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes, are more effective in addressing potential market inefficiencies. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively address capital market imperfections for homeowners unable to secure credit for upfront costs. While they reduce investment costs, they may not provide immediate savings for credit-constrained consumers. Subsidizing efficiency through tax credits could increase adoption of energy-efficient technologies, but recent research suggests it may decrease total welfare if adopted. Recent research suggests that tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not be beneficial for well-informed consumers, as they may not need incentives to invest in energy-efficient technologies. Tax credits are most effective when targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies. However, these credits may not address all market failures and may not increase the usage of energy-efficient technologies to optimal levels. The economic analysis of residential energy-efficiency tax credits evaluates their impact on increasing investment, fairness, and administrative issues. Tax incentives are effective if they influence desired behavior, but it is unclear how effective these credits are at causing additional investment. They tend to benefit higher-income taxpayers, raising equity concerns. Administrative issues have also been identified with the current tax benefits for residential energy. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has identified administrative issues with current tax benefits for residential energy efficiency. The goal of residential energy-efficiency tax credits is to encourage individuals to increase investments in energy efficiency. Tax credits should lead to additional investments, not just reward consumers for investments they would have made anyway. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not lead to additional investments as intended, raising concerns since the 1970s. In 1979, Members of Congress expressed reservations about the lack of incentive in the marketplace for these tax credits. Representative Bill Frenzel noted the limited impact of previous tax credit bills on energy efficiency investments. The tax credit bill passed last year did not provide the expected incentive in the marketplace. The drain on Treasury was less than anticipated as people did not take advantage of it. The tax credit is seen as a reward for actions already taken, rather than a motivator. Empirical evidence on residential energy tax credits from the late 1970s and early 1980s shows mixed results on their impact on energy-efficiency investments. Some researchers suggest that the tax credits led to additional investments, while others believe they mainly resulted in windfall gains for recipients. Tax credits for residential energy-efficiency investments may not significantly impact purchasing decisions for consumers. Some researchers suggest they lead to additional investment, while others believe they result in windfall gains for recipients. Policymakers need to consider whether tax credits truly encourage enhanced energy-efficiency investment. Tax credits for residential energy-efficiency investments may not provide a significant financial incentive for all taxpayers. In 2017, 44% of U.S. households had no federal income tax liability, meaning that tax credits do not motivate investments for these taxpayers. Higher-income taxpayers with tax liability are more likely to benefit from tax incentives for energy efficiency. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers with tax liability, motivating them to invest in energy-efficient equipment. These incentives aim to increase investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency target homeowners, who tend to be higher-income taxpayers. In 2015, over three-quarters of residential energy tax credits were claimed by taxpayers with an adjusted gross income above $50,000, benefiting middle- and upper-income individuals. In 2015, 77.6% of tax claims were made by individuals with adjusted gross income above $50,000, who also claimed 89.0% of the total residential credits value. Tax units with incomes below $50,000, making up 61.4% of all units, claimed 22.4% of residential energy tax credits, receiving 11.0% of the total value. As income rises, the average credit amount increases, with the highest income units receiving seven times more than the lowest income units. Nonrefundable tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D may limit who can claim these benefits. The Section 25C tax credit cannot be carried forward if a taxpayer lacks sufficient tax liability in the current year. This limitation excludes taxpayers who eliminate their tax liability through other incentives, such as those for the working poor or education. Residential energy-efficiency tax incentives primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers, potentially undermining the goal of motivating energy-efficiency investments through tax credits. Tax credits can motivate energy-efficiency investments by reducing up-front costs for credit-constrained households. However, if tax credits are only available to higher-income households, they may not be effective in addressing market barriers. A simple tax code with low compliance costs can increase taxpayer participation in claiming benefits. Compliance burdens may lead eligible taxpayers to forgo certain tax benefits and incentives. The Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found opportunities for fraud in the processing of residential energy tax credits. The IRS was unable to verify if claimants made qualifying energy modifications to their homes or if they were eligible for the credits due to lack of required information. The TIGTA found that the IRS was unable to confirm the eligibility of claimants for residential energy tax credits due to lack of required information, such as proof of homeownership. IRS Form 5695 did not request necessary details prior to 2011, leading to potential fraud in claiming these credits. The IRS updated Form 5695 in 2011 to gather more information about taxpayers' homes for energy efficiency credits. TIGTA found that nearly 800 eligible taxpayers were wrongly denied $1.5 million in credits due to errors in applying the limits. Congress may choose to let these temporary tax credits expire. Section 25D tax credits are temporary provisions set to expire, and Congress has the option to let them expire as scheduled. Future policy options for residential energy efficiency incentives could include modifying or replacing the credits with a grant program. Allowing the credits to expire may impact taxpayers who base purchasing decisions on their availability, but it could also eliminate windfall tax benefits without incurring revenue loss. The expiration of Section 25D tax credits would eliminate a windfall tax benefit without incurring revenue loss. Policymakers may consider extending, expanding, or modifying residential energy-efficiency incentives. This could include increasing the credit amount, expanding eligible technologies, and removing caps to provide additional incentives for homeowners. Expanding residential energy-efficiency incentives by removing caps and expanding eligible technologies could provide additional incentives for homeowners. Policymakers could consider scaling back these provisions to potentially increase tax revenue. Policymakers may consider changes to tax credits for energy-efficient technologies, such as reducing caps or phasing out credits for higher-income taxpayers. Extending or modifying these credits would have a higher budgetary cost than letting them expire. One alternative could be replacing tax credits with a rebate program to incentivize consumer purchases. A rebate program could be a more beneficial way to incentivize consumer purchases of energy-efficient technologies, especially for those with limited funds or little tax liability. Legislation introduced in 2010 aimed to create a rebate program called Home Star, but it was not passed by the Senate. The legislation introduced in 2010 aimed to create a rebate program called Home Star, but it was not passed by the Senate. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency were first introduced in the late 1970s and were allowed to expire in the mid-1980s. Present-day residential energy tax incentives, introduced in 2005, are similar to those from the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the late 1970s, tax credits were introduced for conservation and renewable-energy generation. The credit had two components, with a maximum value of $2,500. In 1980, the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act increased the credit amount for renewable energy to a maximum of $4,000. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58) created two new temporary tax credits for homeowners who made energy-efficiency improvements to their homes. Under EPACT05, both credits were in effect for 2006 and 2007. The first credit was the nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C), allowing taxpayers a nonrefundable tax credit equal to 10% of qualified expenditures, with specific limits for different types of property. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) established two temporary tax credits for homeowners in 2006 and 2007. The first credit, IRC \u00a725C, offered nonrefundable tax credits for specific energy-efficient improvements to the taxpayer's principal residence. The second credit, IRC \u00a725D, provided a 30% credit for qualified photovoltaic properties and solar water-heating systems. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established tax credits for homeowners in 2006 and 2007. IRC \u00a725D provided a 30% credit for qualified photovoltaic properties, solar water-heating systems, and fuel-cell generators. The credit for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties was capped at $2,000 per year, while fuel cells were capped at $500 per year. Section 25C expired in 2007, but Section 25D was extended for the 2008 tax year. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended Section 25D for the 2008 tax year, allowing all solar energy properties to qualify for the credit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for 2009, adding biomass fuel stoves and removing geothermal heat pumps. EESA also extended the Section 25D tax credit through 2016, eliminating the $2,000 annual credit limit. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended Section 25D for the 2008 tax year, allowing all solar energy properties to qualify for the credit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for 2009, adding biomass fuel stoves and removing geothermal heat pumps. It eliminated the $2,000 annual credit limit for qualified solar-electric property expenditures starting in 2009 and expanded the credit to include small wind-energy and geothermal heat pump property expenditures. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for energy-efficient improvements and energy property. The credit was equal to 30% of qualified expenditures, with an increased cap of $1,500 for 2009 and 2010. The $200 cap for windows was eliminated, and if taxpayers used $1,000 of credit in 2009, their credit would be limited to $500 in 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for energy-efficient improvements and energy property. The removal of the aggregate cap for windows allowed taxpayers to claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows in 2009 and 2010. ARRA also increased the efficiency standards for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property, expanding the availability of the credit to additional products. Changes were made to the Section 25D tax credit, removing maximum credit caps for every technology except fuel cells, effective from 2009 through 2016. These changes resulted in an increase in the number and total dollar amount of credits being claimed. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended tax credits for energy-efficient improvements and energy property, increasing the number and total dollar amount of credits being claimed. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit for one year, but returned to the previous credit structure with reinstated lifetime limits. The Section 25C credit for energy-efficient improvements had a lifetime limit of $200 reinstated, making taxpayers ineligible if they had already claimed $500 in credits or $200 for windows in previous years. Efficiency standards were restored to prior levels, and technology-specific credit limits were reinstated. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the credit for 2012 and 2013, while the Tax Increase Prevention Act extended it for 2014. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended the Section 25C credit for 2014, while the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) extended it for 2015 and 2016. The PATH Act also introduced more stringent Energy Star 6.0 standards for windows and doors starting in 2016. Additionally, Division P of P.L. 114-113 extended the 25D credit for solar technologies through 2021. The 25D credit for solar technologies was extended through 2021 with modified credit formulas. The credit will be 30% of qualifying expenditures from 2017-2019, 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25C credit retroactively for 2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021, with credit rates of 30% for property placed in service before 2019, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021. The credit formula for nonsolar technologies was harmonized with solar technologies."
