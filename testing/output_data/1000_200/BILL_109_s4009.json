    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". The Act is necessary due to a Supreme Court decision in Alexander v. Sandoval that weakens statutory protections against discrimination established by Congress over almost 4 decades. The decision undermines these protections by denying victims the right to bring discrimination cases to Federal court and questioning the validity of regulations. The Sandoval decision undermines protections against discrimination established by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which aimed to prevent federal funding from supporting discriminatory programs. Congress and the executive branch emphasized using regulations to ensure broad protections for beneficiaries, forbidding discriminatory criteria or methods of administration. The regulations under section 80.3 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations prohibit discrimination and retaliation in cases of discrimination charges. These regulations, drafted by executive branch officials involved in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, have never been invalidated, as Congress rejected a proposal to do so in 1966. The Supreme Court has recognized that this implies the regulations accurately reflect congressional intent. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was designed to benefit those discriminated against, relying on private attorneys for enforcement. The Supreme Court affirmed individuals' right to sue for discrimination under Title VI in Federal courts for effective protection of the law. The Supreme Court affirmed the right to sue for discrimination under Title VI in Federal courts, recognizing an implied right of action despite the need for explicit statutory statements. Congress has consistently provided means for enforcing the statutes, including establishing a right to attorney's fees in private actions under Title VI. The Supreme Court affirmed the right to sue for discrimination under Title VI in Federal courts, recognizing an implied right of action despite the need for explicit statutory statements. Regulations promulgated under Title VI were congressionally mandated to effectuate antidiscrimination provisions, emphasizing their importance. Regulations prohibiting discriminatory practices align with prohibitions of disparate treatment, requiring intent to be shown. The Supreme Court has acknowledged in various decisions that the effect of discrimination aligns with prohibitions of disparate treatment, requiring intent to be shown. Cases such as Griggs v. Duke Power Co. and Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp. highlight how evidence of disproportionate burden and invidious purpose can indicate unlawful discrimination. The interpretation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact, reinforced by enforcing Title VII. Disparate impact method is crucial in uncovering stereotypes underlying intentional discrimination. Congress reinstated the disparate impact standard in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to enforce Title VII, ensuring entities are not unfairly accused of discrimination. Failure to confirm a private right of action would hinder rights vindication. Congress reinstated the disparate impact standard in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to enforce Title VII, ensuring entities are not unfairly accused of discrimination. Failure to confirm a private right of action would hinder rights vindication, leaving it solely to Federal agencies, which may not take necessary action due to administrative overburden. Congress must specify a private right of action to ensure individuals have a remedy if denied equal access to various programs and services due to discriminatory practices. Courts have dismissed claims challenging actions with discriminatory effects under regulations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A waiver of sovereign immunity is needed to maintain a private right of action under this Act. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must demonstrate that a covered entity's policy or practice causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and the entity fails to show that the policy or practice is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The aggrieved person must show that a policy or practice causes a disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and that it is not necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. If a less discriminatory alternative exists and the entity refuses to adopt it, the person can demonstrate this to the court. In the United States, a covered entity must demonstrate that a specific policy or practice does not cause a disparate impact. If proven, the entity is not required to show that the policy is necessary for achieving program goals. The term 'demonstrates' refers to meeting burdens of production and persuasion. \"In the United States, no person shall face discrimination or retaliation for opposing prohibited policies, making charges, or participating in investigations under this title.\" SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Amends Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the title to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Amends Title VI to allow aggrieved persons to bring actions in court. In actions under this title, aggrieved persons can seek legal relief for intentional discrimination, including compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Punitive damages are not available against government entities. For discrimination based on disparate impact, equitable relief is available. If a covered entity engages in unlawful discrimination based on disparate impact, the aggrieved person may seek equitable relief, attorney's fees, and costs. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and apply to actions pending on or after that date, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard, which have the effective date of the Act's enactment."
