    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Social Security Administration Services Preservation Act\". The Congress recognizes the importance of public goodwill for effective administration of Social Security programs. The accessibility of Social Security Administration offices is crucial for public confidence and cooperation. Offices need to be easily accessible to all citizens, especially the handicapped and elderly who require personal attention. The procedures for closing, consolidating, and relocating Social Security Administration offices are inconsistent and often informal. Changes should consider the needs of individuals, especially the elderly and handicapped, to maintain public confidence in the program. The Act aims to protect public interest in decisions regarding Social Security Administration office closures, consolidations, or recategorizations, and establish fair procedures for such decisions. The Social Security Act is amended to include procedures for the consolidation, closing, or recategorization of Social Security Administration offices. The Social Security Act is amended to include procedures for the consolidation, closing, or recategorization of Social Security Administration offices. Section 712 defines \"adequate public notice\" and \"move\" in relation to office changes. The Social Security Administration can close, consolidate, or recategorize offices within the same political subdivision due to lease loss or space needs. \"Office\" includes field, district, and hearings/appeals offices. \"Political subdivision\" refers to a county or city component with a common identity. \"Recategorize\" means scaling down office status. The SSA must give adequate public notice for any office changes. The Social Security Administration must provide 90 days notice before closing, consolidating, or recategorizing offices. Factors considered include community impact, public transportation availability, caseload, and need for personal service. The Social Security Administration considers factors such as community need, impact on employees, and cost savings when making decisions to close offices. The Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner must approve closures of full-service offices, with the option to delegate this authority. Preliminary determinations to close, consolidate, or reclassify offices require a 90-day notice period. The Social Security Administration may delegate final determinations regarding office closures. Any preliminary determination to close, consolidate, or reclassify an office must be in writing and include findings. A public hearing must be held upon request, with adequate notice, on all proposals to consolidate, close, or reclassify the affected office. The hearing must be conducted at or near the location of the office by an official designated by the regional or central office. Within 30 days after a public hearing or the 90-day period, the Social Security Administration must issue a final report incorporating all testimony and written comments, send copies to the press and Members of Congress, and provide public notice of the final determination regarding office status. A final determination by the Social Security Administration to close, consolidate, or recategorize an office may be appealed to the Commissioner of Social Security within 30 days of public notice. The Commissioner will review the appeal based on the record and may set aside any decision that is arbitrary, not in accordance with the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. The Social Security Administration prohibits any closure, relocation, or reclassification of offices for 30 days after a decision is announced or during any pending appeals. The agency must report all closed or planned closures in its annual budget submission to Congress."
