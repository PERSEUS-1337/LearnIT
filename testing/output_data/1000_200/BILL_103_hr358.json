The Congress finds that law enforcement officers face increasing challenges in the war against drugs and crime, with a rise in violent crime and drug use. The support from the Federal Government has not kept pace with these evolving issues, and a review is needed to evaluate current problems. A review twenty-five years later would help evaluate current problems in law enforcement, including drug-related crime, violence, racial conflict, and decreased funding. A comprehensive study of law enforcement issues, including the role of the Federal Government in supporting officers, working conditions, and responsibility for crime control, would assist in redefining relationships between the Federal Government, the public, and law enforcement officials. Establishment of the \"National Commission to Support Law Enforcement\" (referred to as the \"Commission\") with duties outlined. The Commission will study and recommend changes related to law enforcement agencies at all levels, including funding, employment conditions, information-sharing systems, research and training, equipment and resources, and cooperation among different agencies. The Commission will conduct surveys and consult with law enforcement officers, officials, and community leaders nationwide to gather information on important law enforcement issues. SEC. 5.
