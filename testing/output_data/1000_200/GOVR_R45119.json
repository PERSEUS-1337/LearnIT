    "content": "In October 2017, the U.S. EPA proposed repealing the CPP, a rule finalized in 2015 to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants. The CPP has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Disagreements revolve around legal justification, design, and cost-benefit analysis. The rule set national CO2 emission rates for power plants under the Clean Air Act Section 111(d). States were given compliance options. The EPA proposed repealing the CPP, a rule to limit CO2 emissions from power plants. States had options to comply through rate-based or mass-based approaches, providing flexibility in achieving emission goals. EPA's regulatory analysis in 2015 projected a 32% reduction in CO2 emissions from the power sector. The EPA proposed repealing the CPP, a rule to limit CO2 emissions from power plants, citing a change in interpretation of its authority under the Clean Air Act. The repeal marks a significant shift from the previous Administration's stance on the issue. EPA projected a 32% reduction in CO2 emissions from the power sector by 2030 under the CPP. The EPA estimated the benefits and costs of the proposed repeal of the CPP, which is considered an economically significant regulatory action. The benefit-cost analysis of the repeal reveals methodological changes from the 2015 analysis, potentially impacting how EPA estimates benefits and costs of other regulations. Members of Congress may be interested in understanding these changes and how they differ from the previous analysis. The EPA conducted a benefit-cost analysis of the proposed repeal of the CPP, revealing methodological changes from the 2015 analysis. Senators requested more information on these changes, which could impact how federal agencies account for climate and human health benefits in future regulations. The EPA conducted a benefit-cost analysis of the proposed repeal of the CPP, highlighting methodological changes from the 2015 analysis. The report compares the conclusions of EPA's 2015 and 2017 benefit-cost analyses, focusing on climate benefits, human health co-benefits, and energy savings impact. For more details on EPA's rationale for the repeal, refer to CRS Report R44992, and for legal aspects, see CRS Legal Sidebar LSB10016. The EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions, such as the Clean Power Plan, in accordance with Executive Order 12866. This order directs federal agencies to examine the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions to ensure that the benefits justify the costs. The EPA follows Executive Order 12866 to analyze the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions, which are defined as rules with a $100 million annual impact on the economy or that create inconsistencies with other agency actions, alter budget impacts, or raise novel legal or policy issues. OMB Circular A-4 provides guidance on developing a good regulatory analysis. The OMB Circular A-4 defines a good regulatory analysis as explicitly stating the need for the proposed action, analyzing alternative approaches, and assessing benefits and costs. It aims to standardize measurement and reporting of economically significant regulatory actions across federal agencies, informing whether benefits justify costs. Monetized benefits do not need to outweigh costs, as quantified estimates may not capture all anticipated impacts. The EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the CPP in 2015, following E.O. 12866 and Circular A-4 guidelines to quantify benefits and costs of economically significant regulations. State-specific emission rate goals were calculated for the rate-based scenario. EPA calculated state-specific emission rate goals and emission goals for the rate-based and mass-based scenarios of the CPP. The analysis, done using the Integrated Planning Model, estimated emission reductions and compliance costs, emphasizing the illustrative nature of the scenarios. Compliance costs were reported as the additional cost of complying with the CPP in a given year. The EPA estimated compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan (CPP) based on changes in capital investment, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, and energy efficiency measures. The plan aimed to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions, with costs including monitoring and reporting. The EPA used the IPM model to project CO2 reductions and applied the social cost of carbon (SCC) to assess the economic value of climate benefits. The EPA estimated the economic value of climate benefits by applying the social cost of carbon (SCC) to reductions in CO2 emissions. They also quantified human health benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions like SO2 and NOx, monetizing the benefits of reduced exposure to PM and ozone. EPA monetized human health benefits from reduced exposure to PM and ozone using a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach. The estimates represented the value of reductions in premature deaths and illnesses associated with exposure to PM and ozone, with PM health effects accounting for most of the monetized health co-benefits estimates. The EPA estimated that reductions in SO2 emissions accounted for 80-85% of the health co-benefits from PM exposure in 2030. Ozone health effects made up a smaller share, around 6-12%. The Trump Administration proposed to repeal the CPP two years after its finalization under the Obama Administration, following the same rulemaking process mandated by the Clean Air Act Section 307(d). The EPA is required to follow the same rulemaking process for promulgating, revising, or repealing a rule. The regulatory analysis for the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan focused on data and methodology. The benefits of repealing a rule are avoiding costs, while the costs are forgone benefits. The EPA defined the benefits of repealing the Clean Power Plan as avoided compliance costs, while the costs are forgone reductions in emissions and associated climate and health benefits. EPA plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the repeal. The EPA plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan. The benefit-cost estimates for the repeal were based on power sector modeling results from 2015 and more recent projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2017. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) showed a shift in accounting treatment for cost savings from energy efficiency measures, now counted as a positive benefit. This change resulted in less favorable benefit-cost comparisons for the CPP compared to the 2015 analysis. EPA plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the proposed repeal of the CPP. The 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) showed less favorable benefit-cost comparisons, with estimates ranging from costs outweighing benefits to benefits outweighing costs. The net impact estimates in 2015 all showed benefits outweighing costs, while in 2017, estimates ranged from net costs to net benefits of the proposed repeal. The 2017 analysis did not explicitly state the agency's view on whether the benefits of the repeal are likely to outweigh the costs. The 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) showed varying benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal, ranging from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits for 2030. The analysis did not clearly state if the benefits of the repeal would outweigh the costs. The 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) indicated varying benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal in 2030, ranging from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. EPA noted that changes in the power sector, such as shifts to lower-emitting sources, could impact CO2 emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP. The EPA's analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) in 2017 showed varying benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal in 2030. Changes in the power sector, such as shifts from higher-emitting sources to lower-emitting sources, could affect CO2 emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP. The AEO 2017 projections indicated greater SO2 reductions under the CPP compared to EPA's 2015 estimates, with higher human health co-benefits. Studies have shown a potential greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP in 2030 than previously estimated by EPA in 2015. EPA plans to update its power sector modeling and seek public input before finalizing the proposed repeal. The study found a greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP in 2030 compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. EPA made three primary changes in its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs, including revising estimates of the SCC and excluding international impacts, assuming no human health co-benefits below pollution thresholds, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits. These changes led to differences in conclusions between EPA's 2015 and 2017 analyses. The EPA made three primary changes in its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs, including revising estimates of the SCC, excluding international impacts, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits. The SCC is used to value the climate benefits of CO2 reductions, estimating the monetary value of impacts from changes in emissions. The EPA revised estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to value climate benefits of CO2 reductions. SCC values were calculated using models to estimate economic impacts of emissions changes. In 2015, EPA estimated climate benefits of the CPP using SCC values developed by an interagency working group (IWG), which were later withdrawn by the Trump Administration in 2017. The Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates in 2017 as part of E.O. 13783, directing agencies to use discount rates of 3% and 7% for valuing climate change impacts in regulatory analysis. EPA developed new SCC values based on this directive. EPA developed new interim SCC values based on E.O. 13783, using models and assumptions similar to the IWG but adjusting for domestic scope and discount rates. The domestic SCC estimates from three models are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at 3% discount rates. The DICE 2010 model author's paper presents domestic SCC estimates of $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. The United States emits CO2 and other GHGs, contributing to global GHG concentrations and affecting the global climate. Stakeholders debate using domestic or global SCC values, with the IWG recommending global values due to the global nature of GHG emissions' damages. EPA developed new interim SCC values based on E.O. 13783, adjusting for domestic scope and discount rates. The SCC must incorporate global damages caused by GHG emissions to address the global nature of the problem. Stakeholders debate using domestic or global SCC values, with some supporting the use of global SCC estimates due to spillover effects on national security, international trade, and public health. Recommendations for a global SCC are based on economic, strategic, ethical, and legal justifications. Some stakeholders recommend using global social cost of carbon (SCC) values, arguing that emissions cause damages beyond U.S. borders. Others suggest using domestic SCC estimates, citing OMB Circular A-4 guidance to focus on domestic benefits and costs. Critics argue that using a global SCC may overstate the benefits of U.S. climate regulations by comparing global benefits to domestic costs. The EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal, citing guidance from E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4. While Circular A-4 emphasizes benefits and costs for U.S. citizens, it does not prohibit consideration of global values. EPA included global estimates in a sensitivity analysis but did not compare them to the avoided costs of the proposed regulation. The EPA presented global estimates in a sensitivity analysis in the appendix of the 2017 regulatory analysis, without comparing them to the avoided costs of the proposed repeal. Experts and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine acknowledge challenges in accurately estimating the domestic Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) due to difficulties in capturing relevant regional interactions. OMB Circular A-4 discusses discount rate selection for benefit-cost analysis, recommending rates of 3% and 7%. OMB Circular A-4 recommends discount rates of 3% and 7% for benefit-cost analysis based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The 3% rate, known as the \"consumption rate,\" reflects the average saver's discount rate for future consumption, while the 7% rate represents the opportunity cost of capital. Discounting is the final step in calculating the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). Discounting in the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation allows for comparisons of economic impacts occurring at different times. Selecting a discount rate for SCC is challenging due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change, as it involves valuing impacts on future generations without their input. The selection of a discount rate for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation is crucial for valuing climate change impacts on future generations. Higher discount rates lead to lower present values, while lower discount rates result in higher present values. The sensitivity of SCC estimates to discount rate selection highlights the ethical implications of comparing benefits and costs across generations, as acknowledged in OMB Circular A-4. Conducting sensitivity analysis is recommended to address these challenges. The OMB Circular A-4 recommends considering sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates for intergenerational benefits and costs. The Council of Economic Advisers suggested reducing the 3% rate to 2% and lowering the 7% rate. Stakeholders have differing views on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental groups advocating for lower rates over time. Environmental and public interest groups recommend lower discount rates for intergenerational considerations, while industry groups prefer higher rates like 7%. The majority of climate change studies use rates of no more than 5%. The IWG did not apply the 7% rate and discounted the SCC at rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5%. EPA agreed with the IWG's selection of discount rates in the 2015 CPP analysis. The IWG discounted the SCC at rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5%, which EPA agreed with in the 2015 CPP analysis. Academics have recommended different ways to calculate discount rates, with the NAS suggesting a new approach to better capture uncertainty over long periods of time. The NAS criticized the OMB Circular A-4 guidance as insufficient for choosing SCC discount rates. The EPA used interim SCC estimates to estimate the forgone climate benefits of the proposed repeal, resulting in lower benefit estimates compared to previous analyses. The use of a 7% discount rate and domestic perspective lowered the SCC estimates and reduced the estimates of climate benefits under the CPP. EPA acknowledged limitations of the interim SCC estimates and conducted a sensitivity analysis on the scope and discount rate. EPA conducted a sensitivity analysis on global values and a 2.5% discount rate for forgone climate benefits. The 2017 analysis excluded some human health co-benefits from benefit-cost comparisons, using thresholds to reduce their inclusion. EPA excluded some health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons, focusing on CO2 reductions. This approach may deviate from OMB guidance but aims to evaluate regulatory actions more effectively. EPA seeks public input on this targeted pollutant approach. The EPA requested public comment on the consideration of benefits versus costs in regulatory decision-making, specifically regarding co-benefits from reduced exposure to PM. Stakeholders raised concerns about double-counting benefits in the analysis of regulations targeting pollutants. EPA's 2015 analysis clarified that human health co-benefits were incremental to existing regulations. EPA's 2015 analysis highlighted the importance of considering co-benefits in regulatory decision-making, in line with federal guidance. OMB Circular A-4 directs agencies to quantify and monetize co-benefits and adverse impacts not already included in direct cost estimates. EPA's economic analysis guidelines recommend including both intended effects and ancillary benefits and costs. OMB reports show that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses often monetize co-benefits towards the total benefits of regulations. OMB's recent reports to Congress on federal regulations noted that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses include co-benefits in the total benefits estimate, following standard accounting practices. EPA applied a threshold to forgone health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons, counting only those exceeding a defined threshold for ambient PM levels. EPA used thresholds to calculate PM mortality impacts, assuming no deaths below certain levels. One threshold was based on the federal air quality standard for PM, while the second was based on the \"lowest measured level\" from two long-term studies. EPA diverged from past practice by using these thresholds in benefit-cost comparisons. The PM air quality standard threshold and the LML threshold had implications for benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal. The comparisons were mostly favorable to the repeal using the PM air quality standard threshold and less favorable using the LML threshold. EPA used these thresholds to enhance transparency and provide insight into the uncertainty in estimated PM benefits at lower levels. EPA referenced the agency's 2012 analysis of the rule updating the federal air quality standard. EPA justified using the LML threshold to examine uncertainty in PM-related mortality benefits, citing scientific evidence and peer-reviewed studies. The agency acknowledged the lack of a clear dividing line for setting a threshold, referencing the NAS and its own Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter. EPA's 2009 Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter found that a no-threshold model best represents the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship. In 2015, EPA acknowledged lower confidence in benefits at lower PM concentrations but did not apply a threshold. The agency stated that federal air quality standards are not risk-free, with some health risks even at compliant pollution levels. EPA's 2015 analysis concluded that benefits exist both above and below the federal air quality standard levels, aligning with scientific evidence and reviews from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. EPA's 2017 analysis sought feedback on this approach. EPA's 2017 analysis focused on estimating and reporting PM impacts using the benefit-per-ton approach. The agency plans to evaluate the uncertainty associated with this approach and compare it to other techniques in the literature. Additionally, EPA intends to conduct detailed air quality modeling to inform threshold-based analysis of PM benefits. EPA also changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in its 2015 analysis. EPA's 2015 and 2017 analyses differed in the treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings. In 2015, savings were considered a negative cost, reducing compliance cost estimates. In 2017, they were seen as a benefit, following OMB guidance. The proposed repeal shifted energy savings from cost to benefits, increasing both cost and benefits estimates. EPA moved energy savings from cost savings to forgone benefits in the repeal analysis. EPA's 2017 analysis shifted energy savings from cost to benefits in the proposed repeal, resulting in higher estimates of costs and benefits. This change did not alter the net impact of the repeal but played a significant role in the cost analysis conducted under E.O. 13771. The EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 focused on cost savings from repealing regulations without considering the benefits. The cost analysis excluded demand-side energy efficiency savings, which were previously viewed as benefits. This approach resulted in higher cost estimates compared to the 2015 benefit-cost analysis. Benefit-cost analysis is crucial for informing policy decisions and enhancing the effectiveness of policymaking. Benefit-cost analysis is essential for informing policy decisions by providing decisionmakers with a consistent framework for evaluating regulatory options. While monetized benefits exceeding costs do not solely drive decisions, qualitative impacts and various factors such as legal, technical, and ethical considerations are also taken into account. For example, the EPA's proposed CPP repeal was based on a change in legal interpretation of the Clean Air Act. The EPA's benefit-cost analysis plays a crucial role in informing policy decisions by evaluating regulatory options. The agency's proposed CPP repeal was influenced by a change in legal interpretation of the Clean Air Act, leading to differences in economic impact estimation between the 2015 and 2017 analyses. The quantification and monetization of benefits and costs involve complex tasks drawing upon scientific data and policy decisions, with changes in policy priorities and technical information affecting the estimation process. The EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis differed from the 2015 analysis due to changes in estimating economic impacts. This included using new SCC estimates that lowered climate benefits and thresholds that reduced human health co-benefits. Congress has varying views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations like the CPP. Decisions on regulations can impact major industries and the health of U.S. citizens. The report discussed how the assessment of the CPP's benefits and costs changed between two Administrations. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the benefits and costs of the CPP differed from the 2015 analysis, reflecting policy changes between the Trump and Obama Administrations. The use of interim SCC estimates and a domestic perspective with a 7% discount rate lowered the estimated climate benefits of the CPP repeal. Congress may need to consider the withdrawal of the IWG SCC estimates, which harmonized global measures of climate change impacts. The EPA's 2017 analysis provided few details about next steps for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and its implications for federal agencies' decisions on GHG-related regulations. It is uncertain if other agencies will use the same interim SCC estimates in their regulatory analyses. Other agencies like the U.S. Bureau of Land Management have adopted the EPA's approach in using interim estimates for regulatory analyses. The Department of Energy, however, continued to use the IWG SCC estimates in a rulemaking despite the Administration withdrawing those estimates. Congress may consider if EPA's changes to health co-benefits analysis will influence future air pollution rulemakings, with differences in policy determinations between the 2015 and 2017 analyses. EPA noted lower confidence in benefits from PM reductions at lower concentrations but no clear threshold for setting a dividing line. The 2017 EPA analysis used a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts, departing from previous analyses. It excluded health co-benefits from one benefit-cost comparison, contrary to federal guidance."
