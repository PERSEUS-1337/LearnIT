    "content": "The 9/11 Commission report highlighted that key officials responsible for alien admissions were not fully involved in counterterrorism efforts before September 11, 2001, leading to missed opportunities to intercept the terrorists. The report emphasized that there were chances for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities, including watchlisting known operatives, detecting fraudulent passports, and identifying false statements on visa applications and at border crossings. The 9/11 Commission issued recommendations related to immigration law and policy, emphasizing the importance of targeting terrorist travel, integrating border security into a larger screening network, and implementing a biometric entry-exit system. The Department of Homeland Security, with support from Congress, should expedite the implementation of a biometric entry-exit screening system to prevent terrorists from entering the country. Collaboration with other governments is crucial for national security. Immigration-related reforms have been a key focus in legislative proposals, with two bills in the 108th Congress proposing revisions to immigration law. Two bills in the 108th Congress proposed revisions to immigration law, with certain provisions causing contention among lawmakers. The compromise bill, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, signed on December 17, 2004, included some immigration provisions. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) included some immigration provisions, addressing the need to identify and intercept terrorists entering or leaving the United States. Congress had previously required an automated entry and exit data system for aliens, but full implementation has not occurred. Additional measures were enacted after the 9/11 attacks, including the USA PATRIOT Act. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congress enacted measures such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2002 to expedite the development of an automated entry and exit data system with biometric identifiers. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 required a pre-inspection program at selected overseas locations to inspect aliens before their departure to the United States. Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress enacted measures to expedite the development of an automated entry and exit data system with biometric identifiers. Proposals in the 108th Congress aimed to improve monitoring of persons entering and exiting the United States, including the development of a biometric entry and exit data system integrated with various databases. The 108th Congress enacted measures to improve monitoring of persons entering and exiting the United States post-9/11 attacks. This included integrating the terrorist watch list with flight records, implementing a watchlist for cruise ship passengers, establishing pre-enrollment programs for expedited screenings at ports of entry, enhancing passport security, and promoting international standards for name translations on travel documents. The 108th Congress enacted measures to improve monitoring of persons entering and exiting the United States post-9/11 attacks, including integrating the terrorist watch list with flight records, implementing a watchlist for cruise ship passengers, and enhancing passport security. Additionally, they focused on improving the security of the visa issuance process by providing training in detecting terrorist indicators, fraudulent documents, and establishing an Office of Visa and Passport Security within the State Department. The 108th Congress enacted measures to improve monitoring of persons entering and exiting the United States post-9/11 attacks. The State Department is developing a strategic plan to disrupt travel document fraud operations, increasing consular officers, and providing training in detecting fraudulent documents. Nonimmigrant visa applicants aged 12-65 must be interviewed by a consular officer. The President is authorized to enter into agreements to curtail terrorist travel. The House and Senate passed systems limiting the President's ability to waive statutory requirements for U.S. citizens traveling abroad or entering the U.S. to only apply to those with valid U.S. passports or designated identification documents. Waiver authority for document requirements for arriving foreign nationals is amended to require a joint determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State based on reciprocity and secure identification documents. The House and Senate passed systems limiting the President's ability to waive statutory requirements for U.S. citizens traveling abroad or entering the U.S. to only apply to those with valid U.S. passports or designated identification documents. Arriving foreign nationals must have secure identification documents approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State based on reciprocity. The Secretary of State, in consultation with DHS, must develop a plan for the use of biometric passports for U.S. citizens and foreign nationals from contiguous territories or adjacent islands.

A primary area of difference between House-passed and Senate-passed versions of S. 2845 concerned grounds for alien exclusion, removal, and relief from removal, as only the House-passed bill dealt extensively with these areas. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) establishes admission and removal criteria for all foreign nationals seeking to enter and/or remain in the United States, and also provides certain discretionary and non-discretionary forms of relief from removal, such as granting asylum or withholding removal to a country where an alien is likely to face serious persecution or torture. Congress has expanded grounds of inadmissibility and deportation, while also restricting relief from removal and judicial review of removal decisions. The Supreme Court has upheld judicial review of administrative actions, including habeas review, without a clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas corpus jurisdiction over removal-related matters. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress expanded terrorism grounds for inadmissibility, removal, and detention in response to concerns about loopholes in immigration laws aiding terrorists. Proposals included barring aliens engaged in terrorist activity from relief from removal. Proposals post-9/11 aimed to tighten immigration laws by barring aliens engaged in terrorist activity from relief and expanding grounds for inadmissibility and deportability related to terrorism. The House-passed proposals aim to broaden grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, including acts related to terrorism, genocide, torture, and religious freedom violations. It also allows for removal of aliens to their country of citizenship, birth, or residence, unless prevented or prejudicial to the United States. Additionally, it grants the Secretary of Homeland Security more discretion in choosing countries for removal of inadmissible or deportable aliens. The House-passed proposals aim to broaden grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, including acts related to terrorism, genocide, torture, and religious freedom violations. It grants the Secretary of Homeland Security more discretion in choosing countries for removal of inadmissible or deportable aliens. Additionally, it expands the class of aliens subject to immediate removal without further hearing or review, and eliminates habeas review for certain removal decisions. The House-passed proposals aim to broaden grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, including acts related to terrorism, genocide, torture, and religious freedom violations. It grants the Secretary of Homeland Security more discretion in choosing countries for removal of inadmissible or deportable aliens. Additionally, it expands the class of aliens subject to immediate removal without further hearing or review, and eliminates habeas review for certain removal decisions. Judicial review restrictions include precluding courts from staying a removal order pending judicial review unless the alien shows clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited by law. Aliens seeking asylum must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific characteristics. The House-passed proposals aim to establish more stringent standards for asylum applicants accused of terrorist or guerrilla-related activities, requiring them to prove that their persecution is based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion. The House-passed proposals aim to establish stricter standards for asylum applicants accused of terrorist activities, requiring them to prove persecution based on specific criteria. Concerns have been raised about terrorist aliens obtaining U.S. identification documents to facilitate terrorist activities. The 9/11 Commission recommended national standards for the issuance of birth certificates and drivers' licenses to prevent fraudulent acquisition by terrorist aliens. This issue has been controversial and linked with immigration legislation. The concern over breeder documents in immigration policy has been linked with legislation. Congress provided standards for state IDs and birth certificates under IIRIRA, but this provision was repealed in 2000. After 9/11, proposals were made to improve federal oversight and security of identification documents, including drivers' licenses and birth certificates. Additionally, measures were suggested to enhance the security of Social Security documents and verify identities for benefits under the INA. The proposals aim to enhance identification verification procedures and security of personal identification documents by setting federal security requirements for state-issued drivers' licenses and other identification cards. Federal agencies would be prohibited from accepting state-issued documents that do not meet national minimum standards for information, features, issuance, and record-keeping. The proposals aim to set federal security requirements for state-issued drivers' licenses and identification cards, ensuring compliance through audits and grants to states. Federal agencies would be barred from accepting documents that do not meet national standards for accuracy and verification. The curr_chunk discusses federal requirements for driver's licenses, identification cards, and birth certificates, grants to states linked to an interstate compact for motor vehicle databases, electronic birth and death registration systems, an electronic interface for verifying vital records, restrictions on replacement Social Security cards, and prohibiting displaying Social Security numbers on licenses or registrations. The curr_chunk discusses various House-passed measures related to Social Security numbers, including improving the application process for newborns, studying photographic identification requirements, independent verification of birth records, and identity verification for aliens. The DHS is responsible for enforcing immigration laws and securing the border, with the CBP patrolling the U.S. border and conducting immigration and customs inspections. Various reports provide background on national standards for drivers' licenses, social security cards, and birth certificates, as well as state laws on driver's licenses for undocumented aliens, consular identification cards, national identification cards, and legal developments affecting the social security number. The DHS, through its agencies like CBP and ICE, enforces immigration laws and border security. Other federal agencies, like the State Department, also play a role in screening aliens seeking visas. Recommendations from the 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for a robust border security system to identify individuals entering the U.S. Proposals following the Commission's findings called for increased resources to enhance border security. Proposals post-9/11 Commission called for increased resources to improve border security, including more border patrol agents, immigration investigators, and consular officers. Other measures included enhancing training for immigration enforcement officials and deploying technologies like biometrics for document authentication. The proposed measures include using technologies like biometrics for document authentication, increasing appropriations for pre-inspection at foreign airports, expediting construction of barriers at the San Diego border, implementing continuous surveillance of the Southwest border with remotely piloted aircraft, and carrying out an advanced technology security pilot program on the Northern border. The INA outlines rules for aliens entering and staying in the US, with penalties for activities like smuggling and document fraud. Various agencies play roles in border security, as detailed in CRS reports. The House-passed S. 2845 aimed to increase penalties for immigration-related document fraud and alien smuggling to strengthen the legal immigration system. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 incorporated some provisions of S. 2845 into law. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 included some immigration provisions from S. 2845. It requires biometric entry and exit system deployment, in-person consular interviews for nonimmigrant visa applicants aged 14-79, and accurate information disclosure. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 includes provisions for biometric entry and exit systems, in-person consular interviews for nonimmigrant visa applicants, and accurate information disclosure. It also expands pre-inspection programs at foreign airports, requires individuals entering the U.S. to have proper documentation, and establishes measures to detect and combat terrorist travel. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 establishes a program to oversee DHS's responsibilities with respect to terrorist travel and a Visa and Passport Security Program. It makes any alien deportable who has received military training from a designated terrorist organization and allows for review in removal proceedings for visa revocation cases. It also makes inadmissible and deportable any alien involved in terrorist activities. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 establishes grounds for removal based on visa revocation. It deems aliens inadmissible and deportable for genocide, torture, extrajudicial killing, or severe violations of religious freedom. The act also mandates a study on weaknesses in the U.S. asylum system exploited by terrorists. Additionally, it requires new standards for the security of personal identification documents. The Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act establishes new standards for birth certificates, driver's licenses, and social security cards. It allocates additional resources for enforcement, including increasing consular officers and border patrol agents. ICE investigators will also see an increase in numbers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act increases penalties for alien smuggling and requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a plan for surveillance of the southwest border using advanced technologies. It also establishes a pilot program for border security along the northern border and increases the number of ICE investigators and beds for immigration detention. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act increases penalties for alien smuggling and mandates an outreach program to educate the public about the consequences of illegally bringing in and harboring aliens."
