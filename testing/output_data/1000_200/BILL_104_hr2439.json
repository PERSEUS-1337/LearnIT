    "content": "The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" allows states to use State infrastructure banks for financing transportation projects, providing more freedom in developing low-cost support for public-private transportation partnerships. The \"State Infrastructure Banks Act of 1995\" defines key terms such as Secretary, State, and State infrastructure bank. State infrastructure banks are created at the State or multi-State level to finance transportation projects. Congress grants consent to States to establish State infrastructure banks and enter into interstate compacts to promote regional investment in transportation infrastructure. State infrastructure banks can provide loans, issue debt, and offer assistance to entities constructing eligible transportation projects under federal laws. State infrastructure banks can provide financial assistance for transportation projects under federal laws, including loans and other forms of assistance to cover construction costs. Assistance received can be subordinated to other project financing, and may include credit enhancements, capital reserves, and subsidizing interest rates. The State infrastructure bank can provide financial assistance for transportation projects through various means such as subsidizing interest rates, credit instruments, and leveraging tools approved by the Secretary. Participating States must maintain an investment grade rating on debt issuances or have sufficient insurance. Investment income generated by the bank's funds will be credited to the bank for providing loans and assistance to qualifying projects. The State infrastructure bank can provide financial assistance for transportation projects by crediting funds to the bank, making them available for loans, investments in Treasury securities, or other financing instruments. Repayments can be credited back to the bank or used for the same purpose as the loaned funds. Loans from the bank will bear positive interest as determined appropriate. The State infrastructure bank can provide financial assistance for transportation projects by offering loans with positive interest, repayment starting within 5 years of project completion, repayment term not exceeding 30 years, limiting loan amounts, and requiring annual reports to the Secretary. The Secretary must report annually on the status of the Act. The Secretary is required to ensure consistent disbursements for capital reserves and establish guidelines for State infrastructure bank operations. States can transfer up to 15% of Federal funds to the infrastructure bank from certain apportionments. The State can transfer funds to a State infrastructure bank but cannot transfer suballocated funds. Disbursements must not exceed the traditional rate for the Federal-aid highway program. Depositing Federal apportionments does not create any obligation for the United States. The State infrastructure bank does not create a commitment from the United States. Federal funds used as a capital reserve are exempt from certain regulations. States can contribute up to 2% of Federal funds for bank administration costs."
