    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act\". The Congress finds that in the 10 years from 1987 to 1996, nearly 2,200 children aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings in the United States. The US leads in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related death compared to other industrialized countries. In the 10 years from 1987 to 1996, nearly 2,200 children aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings in the United States, which was 9 times greater than in 25 other industrialized countries combined. Additionally, nearly 8 times that number are treated annually in hospital emergency rooms in the United States for nonfatal unintentional gunshot wounds. Gunshot wounds most often involve handguns, and children as young as 3 years old are strong enough to fire most commercially available firearms. Children as young as 3 years old are strong enough to fire most commercially available handguns, with 25% of 3- to 4-year-olds and 70% of 5- to 6-year-olds having sufficient finger strength. Firearms are not subject to minimum safety standards in the United States, despite 74% of the population supporting safety regulation. States support safety regulation of the firearms industry, as many trigger locks are inadequate to prevent accidental discharge or children from accessing firearms. Regulation of handgun discharge protection products is addressed in Section 3. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of injury to children. Regulations will establish a minimum safety standard for these products, including those permanently installed in handguns. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of injury to children by establishing a minimum safety standard for these products. This standard will ensure that the products are of adequate quality and construction to prevent children from operating a handgun, and can only be removed with specific access methods provided by the manufacturer. Additionally, test protocols related to poison prevention packaging standards may be considered in developing this standard, with a deadline of 12 months for issuance. The Secretary will establish a safety standard for handgun discharge protection products within 12 months of this Act's enactment. The standard must be issued in final form within that timeframe and will take effect 6 months after issuance. SEC. 4. ORDERS; INSPECTIONS.

Compliance with the Act is not necessary for private remedies. The Act allows for private enforcement through lawsuits in US district courts, with the possibility of attorney's fees awarded to the prevailing party. Compliance with the Act or any orders issued does not exempt liability under common law or State statutory law.

Criminal penalties may be imposed for knowingly violating provisions of the Act or regulations related to handgun discharge protection products. Violation of the Act regarding handgun discharge protection products can result in fines, imprisonment for up to 2 years, or both under title 18, United States Code. SEC. 9. NO EFFECT ON STATE LAW.
