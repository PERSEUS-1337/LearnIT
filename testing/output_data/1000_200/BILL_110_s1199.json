The \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" acknowledges the benefits of nanotechnology in improving design, security, economy, and health. It emphasizes the need for the US to maintain leadership in nanotechnology to maximize its benefits for individuals. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the US must invest in educating students for research and development. Foreign students earn a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the US, with many intending to return to their home countries after study. The Act aims to enhance US schools and higher education institutions' capacity to prepare students for careers in nanotechnology by providing grants for necessary tools and training.

The term \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" refers to equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the United States with at least 50% domestic materials. SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to enhance eligible institutions' capacity to teach nanotechnology. Grants of up to $150,000 will be awarded for acquiring equipment, software, and providing educational services for students and faculty. The nanotechnology in schools program aims to enhance institutions' capacity to teach nanotechnology by providing grants for equipment, software, and educational services. Funds from the grant can be used for faculty development, degree/certificate programs approved by accrediting bodies, and teacher education/certification for technology skills related to nanotechnology. A limitation states that only a quarter of the grant funds can be used for software, educational services, or teacher education/certification. Teacher education and certification are essential components of the grant program. Funds can only be used in undergraduate programs at community colleges or higher education institutions. Eligible institutions must submit an application to the Director for consideration. A procedure for accepting applications will be established within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Director will select eligible institutions for grants under the Act, prioritizing geographic diversity and encouraging historically Black colleges, minority institutions, and those that include teacher education programs.

Eligible institutions must agree to provide non-Federal contributions equal to 1/4 of the grant amount. The Director may waive the matching requirement for institutions with low endowment. Branches receiving grants over $100,000 cannot apply for another grant under the Act for 2 years. If an eligible institution other than a branch receives a grant exceeding $100,000 under this Act, they cannot apply for another grant until 2 years after receiving the initial grant. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND EVALUATION. Each institution receiving a grant must submit a report on grant fund usage within 1 year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year for its impact on students, faculty, and staff. A report to Congress must be made within 6 months after evaluation. The Director will review annual reports on grant fund usage from institutions receiving grants. Every third year, an evaluation will be conducted on the program's impact on students, faculty, and staff. A report with recommendations for Federal support will be submitted to Congress within 6 months after evaluation. Authorization of appropriations for the Director to carry out the Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
