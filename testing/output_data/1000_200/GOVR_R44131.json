Members of Congress have proposed actions to resolve the issue and move the program forward. This report details the history of UCLASS requirements development and changes over time. In 1999, the Navy and DARPA began research into an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV). The Navy's UCAV was designed for reconnaissance missions and to identify targets for manned aircraft attack waves. Northrop Grumman built a single X-47A air vehicle for testing under the N-UCAV program, with the first flight in February 2003. The Navy and DARPA started researching unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV) in 1999. Northrop Grumman independently built a single X-47A air vehicle for testing under the N-UCAV program, with the first flight in February 2003. The Defense Department mandated the consolidation of Navy and Air Force UCAV development efforts into a joint program, resulting in the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program in 2003. This program aimed to demonstrate the technical feasibility and military utility of a networked system of high-performance unmanned air vehicles for various missions. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program focused on high-performance unmanned air vehicles for missions in denied enemy territory. The program was terminated in 2006, leading to the development of the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) for carrier-based operations. The Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) program, a follow-on effort from the terminated J-UCAS program, aimed to operate unmanned air combat systems from aircraft carriers. In 2013, the Navy successfully demonstrated the technical feasibility of launching and landing a UCAS-D on an aircraft carrier, investing over $1.4 billion in the program. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in the UCAS-D program to develop an unmanned vehicle for carrier-based operations. The UCLASS program was initiated to address a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhance Navy operations in contested environments. The JROC approved the UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document in 2011, defining it as a persistent, survivable carrier-based Intelligence, Surveillance platform. The JROC approved the UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document in 2011, defining it as a carrier-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance asset. In 2012, the JROC revisited the UCLASS requirements, favoring permissive airspace ISR capabilities due to budget constraints. This change reduced the strike capability of the Navy's next-generation unmanned aerial vehicle. The Navy redefined the scope of the UCLASS program to support missions from counter-terrorism to high-end denied operations, emphasizing affordability as the top priority. The CDD established a $150 million cost limit for air vehicles, with limited funding pressuring industry to deliver mature systems. The Navy set a $150 million cost limit for air vehicles in the UCLASS program, emphasizing affordability and mature system delivery. The draft RFP focused on affordability, timely fielding, and endurance, with goals to provide intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance orbits and light strike capability. The UCLASS program aims to provide an autonomous aircraft with precision strike capabilities in contested environments. It will also have the ability to conduct intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, tanking, and maritime domain awareness missions. The Navy has set a $150 million cost limit for air vehicles in the program, focusing on affordability and mature system delivery. The procurement timeline for UCLASS is unclear, with ongoing delays due to changes in requirements. The Navy now expects to award the air system contract in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years. Early operational capability is now expected in fiscal year 2022, a delay of around 2 years. The Navy's UCLASS program is facing delays, with the air system contract expected to be awarded in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years. Early operational capability on at least one aircraft carrier is now expected in fiscal year 2022, a delay of around 2 years. Further delays are possible due to evolving requirements and changes in DOD priorities."
