    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009\". It includes findings related to the Federal Reserve. The Congress found that in August 2007, liquidity dried up in credit and securities markets, initially affecting financial firms with interests in mortgage-backed securities. This lack of credit access spread globally, leading to the Federal Reserve setting a target range of 0 to 0.25 percent for the Federal funds rate in December 2008. The Federal Reserve established a target range of 0 to 0.25 percent for the Federal funds rate in response to the financial crisis. The Board of Governors exercised its authority to address unusual circumstances multiple times since the crisis began, with the last instance before that being in 1934. During the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve provided assistance to nonmember institutions for the first time since 1959 and purchased debt obligations from government-sponsored enterprises for the first time since 1981. Additionally, joint programs were established with the Department of the Treasury to aid financial markets, including guaranteeing assets of Citigroup and Bank of America, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility, and the Public-Private Partnership Investment Program. Chairman Ben Bernanke affirmed his commitment to transparency regarding the Federal Reserve's lending programs and balance sheet during a testimony to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives on February 10, 2009.
