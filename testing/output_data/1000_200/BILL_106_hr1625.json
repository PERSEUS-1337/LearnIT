    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Human Rights Information Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of protecting and promoting human rights, as enshrined in the Bill of Rights. Federal agencies possess documents on human rights violations abroad, which foreign authorities need for investigation and prosecution. The US will continue to assist foreign authorities in legal matters related to human rights. The United States receives requests from foreign authorities for legal assistance on human rights violations, including declassification of documents. Requests have been made by Guatemala, Honduras, and a Spanish court magistrate for information on General Augusto Pinochet. Current declassification procedures need to be strengthened to uphold human rights nationally and internationally. The expedient declassification of human rights documents will protect global human rights by strengthening the rule of law internationally and holding Federal agencies accountable, leading to significant savings in Government resources. The United States' commitment to promoting and protecting human rights and democracy globally has driven diplomatic, economic, and military efforts to end systematic gross human rights violations abroad. Efforts to end systematic gross human rights violations abroad are crucial for the United States' national interests and international leadership role. Countless US NGOs and citizens promote human rights and democracy in foreign countries, but these efforts are hindered without breaking the cycle of impunity for violations. The US has a significant interest in newly established democratic societies taking credible steps to investigate and prosecute human rights violations, which may involve truth commissions or tribunals. The United States has played a key role in ending impunity for human rights violations globally by supporting international tribunals like the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. Additionally, the US has ratified the Convention against Torture to combat cruel treatment. The United States has ratified the Convention against Torture, obligating parties to assist in criminal proceedings related to acts of torture. As a member State of the Organization of American States, the US should adopt measures for free access to information in investigations. The Guatemalan peace accords, supported by the US, included an investigation by the Clarification Commission to uncover human rights violations. Despite the investigation's conclusion, many questions remain unanswered regarding perpetrators and the whereabouts of the disappeared. The Clarification Commission recommended utilizing all resources to clarify the whereabouts of the disappeared and deliver remains to relatives. Two days later, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, director of the Historical Memory Recovery Project, was assassinated. President Clinton emphasized the importance of not supporting military forces engaged in repression during his visit to Guatemala in 1999. The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights in Honduras has requested documentation from the United States regarding human rights violations in Honduras since 1993. Some aspects of the request have been fulfilled, but others are still pending. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"human rights record\" refers to information on gross violations of human rights post-1944 held by the US Government. \"Agency\" includes entities like the Department of State, CIA, and National Security Council. The term \"gross violations of internationally recognized human rights\" is defined in section 502B(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. SEC. 4. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS REGARDING GUATEMALA AND HONDURAS. The Act governs the declassification and public disclosure of human rights records by agencies, specifically focusing on activities in Guatemala and Honduras after 1944. Agencies must identify, review, and organize these records for declassification within 120 days. The President must report to Congress on agency compliance within 150 days. Grounds for postponement of public disclosure of records are outlined in Section 5. An agency can delay public disclosure of a human rights record if there is clear evidence that the threat to national security outweighs the public interest, especially if it involves revealing sensitive intelligence agents or sources. The public disclosure of a human rights record can be delayed if it relates to military defense, intelligence operations, or foreign relations of the United States and would impair national security. Additionally, if revealing the record would harm individuals who provided confidential information to the US, it can also be withheld. The public disclosure of a human rights record can be delayed if it would pose a substantial risk of harm to individuals, constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, or compromise confidentiality agreements with government agents or foreign governments. It shall not be grounds for postponement that an individual named in the record was an intelligence asset. Grounds for postponement of disclosure of a human rights record include the individual being an intelligence asset of the United States Government, with the term \"intelligence asset\" defined as a covert agent. SEC. 6. REQUEST FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS FROM OFFICIAL ENTITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES. If a US agency receives a request for human rights records from certain international entities or countries investigating human rights violations, they must review and disclose the records according to the standards in this Act. SEC. 7. REVIEW OF DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD RECORDS. The Appeals Panel reviews agency determinations to postpone public disclosure of human rights records. They direct disclosure unless there is clear evidence the record is not a human rights record or qualifies for postponement. The Appeals Panel reviews agency decisions to postpone disclosure of human rights records. If the Panel agrees with the agency's decision, they determine alternative forms of disclosure, such as releasing a redacted version of the record. The Appeals Panel reviews agency decisions on disclosing human rights records, determining alternative forms of disclosure if necessary. They notify the agency head of their determination and publish it in the Federal Register within 14 days. The Appeals Panel reviews agency decisions on disclosing human rights records and notifies the President of its determination. The President has the authority to review any determination of the Appeals Panel and must base the review on the standards set forth in the Act. The President reviews the Appeals Panel's determination on disclosing human rights records based on set standards. Within 30 days, the President provides a written certification with reasons for the decision, including if disclosure is postponed. The Appeals Panel then publishes the President's certification in the Federal Register. The President's written certification regarding the postponement of disclosure of a human rights record is published in the Federal Register. The Information Security Policy Advisory Council will report to Congress on the declassification of human rights records from other countries. The report will be made public. Nothing in this Act limits the right to request information from executive agencies or seek judicial review. Judicial review of final actions under this Act is allowed. Positions will be created as necessary. SEC. 10. CREATION OF POSITIONS. Two additional positions in the Appeals Panel will be created for individuals with substantial human rights expertise appointed by the President. Recommendations for these positions will be sought from nongovernmental human rights organizations."
