    "content": "We investigate the suitability of self-attention models for character-level neural machine translation, comparing a novel transformer variant with a standard transformer model. Our experiments on WMT and UN datasets show that our variant outperforms the standard transformer, converges faster, and learns more robust character-level alignments. Character-level models offer a more memory-efficient approach compared to word or subword-level models. Character-level models are more memory-efficient and suitable for multilingual translation. Self-attention models have achieved success in various tasks but have not been explored for character-level translation. In this work, the suitability of self-attention models for character-level translation is investigated. Two models are considered: the standard transformer and a novel variant called convtransformer. Evaluation is done on bilingual and multilingual translation to English using French, Spanish, and Chinese as input languages. Translation performance is compared on close and distant input languages, and learned character alignments are analyzed. Self-attention models are found to work well for character-level translation. The study investigates the effectiveness of self-attention models for character-level translation, comparing a standard transformer with a convtransformer. The convtransformer outperforms the standard transformer, converging faster and producing more robust alignments. Lee et al. (2017) previously tackled fully character-level translation using a recurrent encoder-decoder model. The network generates output translations character by character with attention on encoded representations. Multilingual training improves performance without architectural changes, even for distant languages with common character-level representations. Recent studies compare character and subword-level models, showing character-level models can outperform with sufficient resources. Character-level models can outperform subword-level models in sequence modelling tasks in NLP, thanks to their flexibility in processing and segmenting input and output sequences. The transformer model, known for its attention-driven encoder-decoder architecture, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks. Recent research has shown that attention can be effective for encoding characters, contrary to previous beliefs. Recent research has shown that attention can be effective for encoding characters, contrary to previous beliefs. The convtransformer architecture is proposed to facilitate character-level interactions in the transformer, using a modified encoder block with additional sub-blocks consisting of parallel 1D convolutional layers. The convtransformer architecture, proposed to enhance character-level interactions in the transformer, includes three parallel 1D convolutional layers with different context window sizes. Unlike previous approaches, the input character sequence resolution remains unchanged, and a residual connection is added for flexibility. Experiments are conducted on the WMT15 DE\u2192EN dataset to compare results with previous work on character-level translation. The study conducts experiments on two datasets: WMT15 DE\u2192EN and United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN). The UN dataset allows for multilingual experiments due to its diverse language pairs and domain consistency. Training corpora are constructed by sampling from FR, ES, and ZH parts of the UN dataset for translation to English. Evaluation is done using BLEU scores on different test sets. The study conducts experiments on the UN dataset with different input training languages and evaluates on three test sets (t-FR, t-ES, t-ZH) with English as the target language. Bilingual and multilingual scenarios are tested without language identifiers or increased parameters. Chinese dataset is latinized using Wubi encoding. Testing is done on original UN test sets for each pair. The study compares character-level architectures trained on the WMT dataset, showing that character-level training is slower but achieves strong performance. The models were trained on Nvidia GTX 1080X GPUs for 20 epochs. The convtransformer variant performs similarly to the standard transformer on longer sequence lengths, outperforming previous models. Multilingual experiments show that the convtransformer consistently outperforms the transformer on the UN dataset, with improvements in bilingual and multilingual translations. Training multilingual models on similar input languages leads to enhanced performance for both languages. The convtransformer variant outperforms the standard transformer on longer sequences, showing improvements in bilingual and multilingual translations. Training on similar input languages enhances performance for both languages, while distant-language training is only effective when the input language is closer to the target translation language. The convtransformer is slower to train but reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, leading to an overall training speedup compared to the transformer. The multilingual models are analyzed for learned character alignments through attention probabilities. Bilingual models are seen to have greater flexibility in learning high-quality alignments compared to multilingual models, which may struggle due to architecture limitations or dissimilar languages. The alignments are quantified using canonical correlation. The alignments in multilingual models are analyzed using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to learn alternative strategies for accommodating all languages. Results show strong positive correlation for similar source and target languages, but a drop in correlation when introducing a distant source language. The convtransformer is more robust to distant languages than the transformer, as shown by a drop in correlation when introducing a distant source language. Self-attention models perform well on character-level translation, requiring fewer parameters and competing with subword-level models. Training on multiple input languages is also effective. The convtransformer is robust to distant languages, outperforming the transformer. Character-level translation performs well, competing with subword-level models and requiring fewer parameters. Training on multiple input languages is effective, with improvements seen in similar languages. Future work will include analyzing more languages and improving training efficiency. Model outputs and alignments are provided as examples. In Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7, alignments from bilingual and multilingual models trained on UN datasets are shown. The convtransformer has sharper word distributions for bilingual translation, while for multilingual translation, it produces slightly less noisy alignments compared to the transformer. Distant language translations show noisier alignments with the transformer. The convtransformer shows better word alignments for multilingual translation of distant languages compared to the transformer. The convtransformer is more robust for multilingual translation, preserving word alignments better in scenarios with close languages.
