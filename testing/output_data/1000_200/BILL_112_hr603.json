    "content": "The Transition toward Excellence, Achievement, and Mobility through Empowerment Act of 2011, also known as the TEAM-Empowerment Act of 2011, includes provisions for individualized transition plans and transition planning services administrative units. Congress finds that evidence-based research has shown that youth with significant disabilities benefit from inclusive education, work experience, and paid work while in school, leading to better postsecondary outcomes. Higher rates of self-determination and flexibility in blending government funds also contribute to improved transition strategies for individuals with disabilities. The blending and braiding of government funds for seamless, collaborative transition strategies benefit individuals with significant disabilities. Agency officials providing supports during youth transition need additional training. The Act aims to create a holistic system for successful transition of youth with disabilities into adulthood, focusing on high expectations and equality of opportunity. The Act aims to achieve high expectations for youth with disabilities, promote inclusion and integration into the community, define specific transition services, and encourage collaboration among stakeholders to improve opportunities for these individuals. Subtitle F--Adult Transition System is added to Title I of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000, including definitions in Section 171. The term 'asset development' refers to a strategy to help low-income workers and job seekers, including individuals with disabilities, achieve economic security through various means such as effective money management, education, home ownership, and retirement planning. The term 'individualized education program' is defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and 'integrated employment' involves work at minimum or competitive wages with benefits in a typical work setting for employees with disabilities. The term 'ITP' refers to an individual transition plan developed under section 173, while 'local educational agency' and 'secondary school' have meanings as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term 'State intellectual and developmental' is also mentioned. The term 'transition services' refers to activities designed to help students move from school to post-school activities, including postsecondary education. The 'State intellectual and developmental disabilities agency' is the primary agency responsible for services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, while the 'TPS administrative unit' is the transition planning and services unit of a State. The transition services aim to facilitate the movement of students from school to post-school activities, such as postsecondary education, vocational training, integrated employment, adult services, and independent living. These activities are tailored to individual student needs, preferences, and interests, encompassing instruction, community experiences, employment objectives, career preparation, and work-based learning experiences. The transition services include work-based learning experiences, youth development, leadership training, self-advocacy skills, family involvement, and daily living skills. It does not involve facility-based employment settings. The activities aim to lead to post-secondary education or long-term integrated employment. The transition services aim to lead to post-secondary education, long-term integrated employment, asset development, independent living, and community participation. The Secretary provides state assistance through competitive grants to carry out required activities under this subtitle. Payments to states are allocated based on a formula considering the number of individuals to be served. Individualized transition plans are also outlined. Each State receiving assistance under this subtitle must develop an individual transition plan for individuals with developmental disabilities transitioning from secondary school to adulthood. The plan aims to coordinate services for integrated employment, postsecondary education, independent living, and community engagement. The plan should be formulated within 30 days and coordinated with existing transition services. Individual transition plans for individuals with developmental disabilities must be developed by each State receiving assistance under this subtitle. The plan should be formulated within 30 days of exiting secondary school, be applicable until age 26, reviewed annually, and developed in in-person meetings led by the State intellectual and developmental disabilities agency. Stakeholders involved in the meetings include the individual, family, transition broker, and State vocational rehabilitation representative. An Individual Transition Plan (ITP) for individuals with developmental disabilities involves a transition broker, State vocational rehabilitation representative, service providers, transition coordinator, assistive technology experts, and workforce development representatives. The ITP must include strategies for postsecondary educational experiences and career preparation. The Individual Transition Plan (ITP) for individuals with developmental disabilities should address 5 key areas: postsecondary educational experiences, career preparation, work-based learning experiences, development and leadership, connecting activities, and family involvement. It should identify individual needs in each area and how the State will meet those needs, with a focus on advancing economic self-sufficiency through asset development goals and tools like tax benefits, work incentives, savings plans, education financing, and budget management strategies. \"SEC. 174. TRANSITION PLANNING AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT.\" Each State receiving assistance under this subtitle must establish a transition planning and services (TPS) administrative unit within the State intellectual and developmental disabilities agency. The primary focus of the TPS unit is to help individuals with developmental disabilities transition from the secondary school system to adulthood. Responsibilities include developing and implementing individual transition plans (ITPs) and employing transition brokers. The TPS administrative unit must employ transition brokers to assist individuals with developmental disabilities in navigating support services. Transition brokers facilitate coordination among State agencies and possess specific qualifications. To qualify as a transition broker in the TPS administrative unit, individuals must have expertise in developmental disabilities, benefits planning, transition services, employment, job development, and stakeholder negotiation. They should also have experience in workforce development, vocational rehabilitation, and asset development tools for economic self-sufficiency. The TPS administrative unit provides tools for asset development and economic self-sufficiency, such as tax benefits, work incentives, matched savings plans, education financing, budget management, and person-centered planning processes.

The TPS administrative unit offers strategies for self-advocacy, self-determination skills, and peer mentoring to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. They also provide information on Federal and State services, supports, and regulations, including asset development and insurance programs. The State intellectual and developmental disabilities agency facilitates collaboration among key State agencies to improve services for individuals with developmental disabilities during the transition into adulthood. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of the subtitle, including the number of individuals with Individual Transition Plans (ITPs) developed, progress made in implementing ITP objectives, and demographic information of individuals with ITPs. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to carry out this subtitle."
