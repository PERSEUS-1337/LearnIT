Each state can appoint a compact administrator responsible for forest fire control and coordination with other member states. Member states can organize to coordinate services and implement forest fire prevention plans. ARTICLE IV states that if a state's forest fire control agency requests aid from another state's agency to combat forest fires, the requested state can provide assistance while ensuring protection at home. ARTICLE V is not summarized. \"If member states provide outside aid to each other under this compact, the employees rendering aid will have the same powers, duties, and immunities as employees of the receiving state. There is no liability for acts or omissions of the aiding state's forces while providing aid, except as specified in the compact.\" The requesting state is responsible for any liabilities arising from aid requests under this compact. Member states providing aid will be reimbursed for expenses incurred, but can also choose to donate services without charge. Each member state must ensure workers' compensation benefits. The compact administrators may establish procedures for claims and reimbursement under this agreement, ensuring workers' compensation benefits for all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers or auxiliary members of the forest fire fighting forces. \"ARTICLE VI outlines procedures for claims and reimbursement under the agreement, ensuring workers' compensation benefits for all employees and contract firefighters, including volunteers or auxiliary members of the forest fire fighting forces.\" The compact does not allow any member state to reduce their forest fire fighting forces, equipment, or services. Each state must maintain adequate resources for fire protection as if the compact was not in place. States are still empowered to prevent, control, and extinguish forest fires and enact laws for fire prevention. The compact does not affect existing or future cooperative relationships between the US Forest Service and member states regarding forest fire prevention, control, and extinguishment. \"Representatives of the United States Forest Service may attend meetings of the compact administrators. The provisions of Articles IV and V of this compact regarding reciprocal aid in combating forest fires apply between states party to this compact and those in other regional compacts with mutual aid provisions approved by their legislatures.\" The compact remains binding until a state takes action to withdraw, which becomes effective six months after notice is sent to all parties."
