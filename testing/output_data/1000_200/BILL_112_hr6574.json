    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Servicemember Mental Health Review Act\". Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans are then restricted from accessing various disability benefits and often struggle to find employment due to the label on their discharge paperwork. The Department of Defense's compliance in separating members based on these disorders has been questioned by the Government Accountability Office. The Department of Defense had a low compliance rate of 40% in separating Armed Forces members based on personality or adjustment disorders between 2001 and 2007. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is needed to ensure veterans wrongly separated on these grounds can access disability benefits and employment opportunities. The Department of Defense is reviewing military separations based on mental conditions that do not amount to disability. The Department of Defense is amending Chapter 79 of title 10, United States Code to establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within each military department to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. Each board will consist of at least five members appointed by the Secretary of Defense, including a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is established within each military department to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. Covered individuals are members and former members of the armed forces separated since September 11, 2001, due to mental conditions. The Secretary of Defense ensures that each covered individual receives notification of the right to review. The Defense Department must ensure that covered individuals are notified of their right to have their separation from the armed forces reviewed by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review. The Secretary of the military department responsible for the individual's service before separation is tasked with providing this notification. Failure to receive notification allows the individual or their representative to request a review by the Board. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review allows for a review of the separation of covered individuals from the armed forces. They have the right to obtain private counsel and the Board reviews the findings of the Department of Defense psychologist or psychiatrist, as well as the decisions of the separation authority. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review reviews the separation of covered individuals from the armed forces, considering the Department of Defense's findings and decisions, and ensuring the correct process was followed. The review is based on records from the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs, as well as any other evidence presented. The Board may also consider private mental health records submitted by the individual. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review notifies and seeks consent from covered individuals or their representatives before conducting a review. After completing the review, the board provides a statement of reasons for their decision and allows the individual to request reconsideration with new evidence. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review allows covered individuals to request reconsideration with new evidence if they can address the issues raised in the board's statement of reasons. The board may recommend no negative recharacterization of separation, retirement for disability, or separation for disability with entitlement to receive severance pay for a covered individual. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend different types of separation for covered individuals, including separation for disability with severance pay entitlement, separation upon term expiration, or separation for government convenience. If the board does not recommend retirement for disability, they must provide a brief statement explaining why. This recommendation is then sent to the individual or their next of kin. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review recommends different types of separation for covered individuals, including disability separation with severance pay entitlement. The military department corrects the individual's records based on the recommendation, effective from the separation date. If a lump-sum payment was received at separation, future benefits will be adjusted accordingly. The military department will adjust future benefits if a lump-sum payment was received at separation, as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Regulations for this section will be set by the Secretary of Defense, including deadlines for required reviews. Implementation of Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review required under section 1554b of title 10, United States Code, must be completed within 90 days of this Act's enactment by the Secretary of Defense. Regulations for this section will also be prescribed by the Secretary."
