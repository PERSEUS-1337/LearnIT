    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation Act. The Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters as authorized by Public Law 99-625. National defense-related activities at San Nicolas Island have not adversely affected sea otters, but further expansion into the designated management zone may pose national security risks. Public Law 99-625 designated a management zone with potential national security impacts for military training programs. Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans in California address endangered species' needs and provide conservation benefits. The law allowed otters at San Nicolas Island to be a nonessential experimental population. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas were established to enhance conservation of the otter population while allowing for military readiness activities as defined in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act. The Secretary of Defense shall establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including specific coordinates within Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, and Naval Base Coronado San. The Secretary of Defense established Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including specific coordinates within Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, and Naval Base Coronado San. Additionally, designated safety zones include Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton with specific coordinates outlined. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas exempt incidental takings of southern sea otters from the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act during military activities. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas allow for the incidental taking of southern sea otters during military activities without requiring their removal from the designated areas. The Secretary of the Interior may revise or terminate exceptions for military activities in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas if they impede otter conservation. The Secretary of the Navy must monitor otter population growth every three years. The Secretary of the Navy must report to Congress every three years on monitoring the southern sea otter population. This section does not affect other federal laws and includes an ecosystem management plan involving various agencies. The Director of the National Marine Fisheries Service, in collaboration with the Marine Mammal Commission, will develop an ecosystem management plan for waters off California to ensure the recovery of the southern sea otter, black abalone, and white abalone, as well as maintain shellfish fisheries at current levels. The US Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the habitat's carrying capacity for southern sea otters within one year, including the impact of water quality and causes of degradation. The Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service will continue implementing the relocation and management plan for southern sea otters until the completion of the management plan and assessment required. Definitions for incidental taking and optimum sustainable population are provided in this section. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the management of southern sea otters, including \"optimum sustainable population\" and \"take\" in the context of activities regulated by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The curr_chunk defines the term \"military readiness activity\" in relation to the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. The curr_chunk amends the table of sections by adding details related to realistic testing of military equipment for combat use. The curr_chunk establishes the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas, while the prev_chunk mentions amending the table of sections for realistic testing of military equipment."
