    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Montana Mineral Conveyance Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Secretary of the Interior has conveyed mineral rights in large coal tracts near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation to the State of Montana. The development of these tracts and other energy resources in the surrounding areas generates significant public revenues for the State, helping to address the impacts of development on the Northern Cheyenne tribal community. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe faces economic challenges and lacks revenue sources to address development impacts. In 2002, the Tribe sued the Secretary over the conveyance of Federal coal tracts to the State, alleging violations of Federal laws. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe withdrew a lawsuit against the Secretary with prejudice, based on commitments for legislation and funding to address coal development impacts. The Tribe asserts claims against the United States for failing to acquire mineral rights.
