    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Motor Vehicle Advanced Safety Technology Tax Act of 2007\". Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the United States, especially with the increasing number of trucks and their role in transporting hazardous materials. A 2004 report showed that crashes involving large trucks are 2.6 times more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. In 2005, 5,212 individuals died and 114,000 were injured in large truck-related crashes in the US. From 2001 to 2005, 25,533 individuals died in large truck-related crashes in the United States, costing society $230.6 billion annually. The estimated cost of each crash involving a truck over 10,000 pounds is $91,112, with an average cost of a fatal crash being $3,604,518. Investments in research and design by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers aim to improve safety. Investments in research and innovative design by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers have led to the development of advanced safety systems and technologies. These technologies aim to address and mitigate commercial motor vehicle crash scenarios, with the Department of Transportation setting a goal to reduce the traffic fatality rate. Accelerated production and deployment of these advanced safety technologies can help achieve this goal, reducing injuries and fatalities on the nation's roads and highways and mitigating the societal cost of crashes. Congress aims to increase the deployment of advanced vehicle safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles through tax incentives to reduce injuries and fatalities on the nation's roads and highways. The IRS Code is amended to include a new section providing a tax credit for advanced commercial vehicle safety systems. The IRS Code is amended to include a new section that allows a tax credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems. The credit is 50% of the system's cost, not exceeding $1,500 per system or $3,500 per vehicle. The tax credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $350,000 per taxpayer for the taxable year. A qualified system includes brake stroke monitoring, lane departure warning, collision warning, or vehicle stability systems identified by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The tax credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $350,000 per taxpayer for the taxable year. The system must be certified by the manufacturer to be appropriate for the vehicle and function as designed. The tax credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $350,000 per taxpayer for the taxable year. The system must be certified by the manufacturer or an authorized installer, properly installed, and functioning as designed on the vehicle before use. Depreciation or amortization is allowable for the system. A qualified commercial vehicle is defined as any highway motor vehicle meeting specific criteria. The term 'qualified commercial vehicle' refers to a highway motor vehicle used for transporting persons or property in commerce, with a gross weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more, a seating capacity of at least 15 individuals, or at least 11 individuals for school buses. The term 'qualified commercial vehicle' refers to a highway motor vehicle used for transporting persons or property in commerce, with a gross weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more, a seating capacity of at least 15 individuals, or at least 11 individuals for school buses. In addition, a brake stroke monitoring system for air-braked vehicles is defined as using electronic sensors to detect brake issues and alert the driver, while a lane departure warning system is also mentioned. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of different safety systems in vehicles, including lane departure warning, collision warning, and vehicle stability systems. These systems provide alerts to drivers about potential dangers on the road. The curr_chunk explains how a vehicle's safety system automatically intervenes to prevent rollover or instability by adjusting speed or applying brakes. It also discusses how controlled groups are treated as a single taxpayer for tax purposes. The curr_chunk discusses special rules related to the basis reduction and recapture of credits for eligible properties under subsection (a). It also specifies that no credit is allowed for properties used outside the United States or by tax-exempt entities. The curr_chunk explains that for qualified commercial vehicles with advanced safety systems used by tax-exempt entities, the seller must disclose the allowable credit to the user and is treated as the taxpayer placing the property in service. This exempts the seller from certain subsections regarding the property. The curr_chunk discusses the election not to take credit for a qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system and the supporting documentation required for the credit under subsection (a). The curr_chunk outlines the documentation needed for the installation of vehicle safety systems and certifications required under subsections (c)(2) and (c)(3).
