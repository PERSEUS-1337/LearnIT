    "content": "The Public Broadcasting Financial Independence and Family Viewing Act of 1995 aims to ensure that programs suitable for family viewing are broadcasted throughout the day without the use of federal funds for indecent or nudity-inclusive content. Public broadcasting is required to provide educational, cultural, informational, and entertaining programming in the public interest. The Commission will allow public broadcast license holders to use their spectrum for ancillary services while still providing free public broadcast programming. Regulations will ensure that proceeds benefit public broadcasting, commitments to public broadcasting are maintained, and fees for non-public broadcasting use are at market rates. The Commission will adopt regulations to allow public broadcast license holders to use their broadcast schedule between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. for non-public broadcast programming for a fee. Proceeds must benefit public broadcasting, commitments to public broadcasting must be maintained, and fees for non-public broadcasting must be at market rates. SEC. 7. ENHANCED UNDERWRITING. Amends sections of title 47 to allow for calls to action, inducements to buy, sell, rent, or lease, and provision of price information. SEC. 8. SATELLITE, COMMON CARRIER AND OTHER FORMS OF PROGRAM DISTRIBUTION. Public Broadcasting programming can be distributed via satellite, common carrier, or other telecommunications technology for a fee, with proceeds benefiting public broadcasting. The Commission can approve frequency exchanges between public and commercial broadcasters for the benefit of the national public broadcasting system. Agreements for programming should include provisions for public broadcasting to share in benefits from ancillary products. The General Accounting Office will review the operations of public broadcasting entities and make recommendations for improvement. They will also study the feasibility of merging public broadcasting with international broadcasting operations. Additionally, educational rates will be addressed. Public broadcast licensees qualify for educational telecommunications service rates for providing public broadcasting."
