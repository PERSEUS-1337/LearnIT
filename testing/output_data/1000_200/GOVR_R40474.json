    "content": "This report examines recent laws and congressional proposals regarding gun regulation in the District of Columbia. Key statutes and bills include federal provisions like the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act. Congressional proposals often coincide with discussions on voting rights for the District. The report analyzes recent laws and congressional proposals on gun regulation in the District of Columbia, focusing on Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress. It discusses the impact of these proposals on DC firearms laws post the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. After the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, congressional activity on DC firearms laws focused on the Second Amendment's protection of an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home. The decision in Heller invalidated three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act. After the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to comply with the ruling, amending the city's gun laws temporarily. This attempt was met with criticism for not fully complying with the Heller decision. The Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008 was met with criticism for not fully complying with the Heller decision. In response, H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in Congress but did not become law. In the 111th Congress, Senator John Ensign introduced S.Amdt. 575 to S. 160, which became Title II of S. 160. Despite Senate approval, movement on the legislation was stalled. The DC Council passed emergency legislation until permanent legislation could take effect, incorporating language from the emergency acts. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 (FCAA) and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 (IPAA) were passed by the DC Council and transmitted to Congress for approval. These acts amended firearms provisions in the DC Code and imposed new restrictions on firearm regulation and ownership. The legislation was challenged but upheld in court. Congressional legislation, H.R. 645, also aimed to impact DC's gun laws. Congress passed H.R. 645 to amend firearms provisions in the DC Code, limiting the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repealing the registration scheme. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards, allowing states and territories to supplement them. The District of Columbia may supplement federal firearms laws with their own more restrictive regulations under the Home Rule Act, allowing the DC Council to make necessary firearm regulations. The District of Columbia has the power to amend laws passed by Congress regarding firearms regulations under the Home Rule Act. Congress can still legislate for the District and impose limits on its legislative authority. The District of Columbia can amend laws passed by Congress on firearms regulations under the Home Rule Act, but Congress can still impose limits on its legislative authority. The District of Columbia is not allowed to enact laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms, as stated in H.R. 645. This restriction aims to prevent the authority from prohibiting or burdening individuals from acquiring, possessing, transporting, or using firearms for lawful purposes. The proposed language in H.R. 645 emphasizes that the District of Columbia cannot enact laws that restrict private ownership or use of firearms. It aims to prevent any undue burden on individuals acquiring firearms and prohibits the possession of firearms not already regulated under federal law. The proposed language in H.R. 645 aims to prevent the District of Columbia from enacting laws that restrict private ownership or use of firearms, with the exception of carrying firearms. It limits the District's ability to create stricter provisions beyond federal firearms laws and does not clearly define what would violate the prohibition against discouraging private firearm ownership. Additionally, it restricts the District's authority to regulate the carrying of firearms outside of specific locations. The proposed language in H.R. 645 aims to prevent the District of Columbia from enacting laws that restrict private ownership or use of firearms, with the exception of carrying firearms. It limits the District's ability to create stricter provisions beyond federal firearms laws and does not clearly define what would violate the prohibition against discouraging private firearm ownership. The District could regulate concealed or open carry, but it would not be explicitly empowered to prohibit individuals from carrying firearms altogether. The proposed language in H.R. 645 aims to prevent the District of Columbia from enacting laws that restrict private ownership or use of firearms, with the exception of carrying firearms. Prior to Heller, the DC Code's definition of \"machine gun\" included any semiautomatic weapon that could shoot more than 12 shots without manual reloading, which was prohibited from being registered. This limited registration of pistols to revolvers. Under the NFA and FCAA, the District amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with federal law, allowing semiautomatic firearms to be registered. The District also adopted laws similar to California, creating a list of prohibited firearms. The District of Columbia amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with federal law, allowing semiautomatic firearms to be registered. However, they also enacted a list of prohibited firearms, similar to California. If H.R. 645 is enacted, the definition of \"machine gun\" would revert to its pre-Heller state, continuing to conform with the federal definition. The pre-Heller provisions prohibited registration of certain firearms, acting as a virtual prohibition on handguns, which was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The District of Columbia now allows the registration of semiautomatic handguns for self-defense under the FCAA, aligning with federal law. The FCAA also includes exemptions for temporary possession of registered firearms for self-defense in the home. Amendments have been made to the qualification and information requirements for firearm registration. The FCAA amends provisions for firearm registration, prohibiting those with certain criminal histories or violent behavior from registering. Applicants must complete a firearms training course and provide an affidavit signed by a certified instructor. The FCAA prohibits certain individuals from registering a firearm and requires completion of a firearms training course. The Chief of Police must conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols and limit registrations to one per person every 30 days. H.R. 645 maintains the ban on certain weapons but expands the firearms competency test. H.R. 645 would repeal registration requirements for firearms in DC, including the need for a registration certificate or licensing of gun owners. It would also eliminate restrictions on the number of handguns an individual can purchase per month. H.R. 645 would amend DC law to allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents, and eliminate the requirement for licensed dealers to track ammunition sales. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(b)(3), firearms dealers are generally prohibited from selling handguns to out-of-state persons. H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 propose different ways to permit interstate purchase of firearms. Title II- S. 160 would amend federal law to allow licensed dealers in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to residents of the District of Columbia. H.R. 645 would amend the DC Code to facilitate interstate firearms transfers for federally licensed dealers in Maryland or Virginia. Under the proposed legislation, federally licensed firearms dealers in Maryland or Virginia would be allowed to sell handguns to District residents if certain legal conditions are met. The District's trigger lock requirement, which was deemed unconstitutional, went beyond federal law by mandating the use of trigger locks for all firearms in possession of registrants. The District's trigger lock requirement, declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, was amended under the FCAA to mandate that any firearm in lawful possession be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock to prevent access by minors without parental permission. The FCAA mandates secure storage of firearms to prevent minors from accessing them without permission, with penalties for negligent storage. H.R. 645 creates penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury. H.R. 645 mandates secure storage of firearms to prevent minors from accessing them without permission. Violators would face fines and imprisonment if a minor gains access to a loaded firearm and causes injury. Exceptions include securely locked containers or trigger locks without informing the minor of their location. The secure storage of firearms to prevent minors from accessing them without permission is mandated by H.R. 645. Violators could face fines and imprisonment if a minor gains access to a loaded firearm and causes injury. Exceptions include securely locked containers or trigger locks without informing the minor of their location. Under DC law, a violation of the registration scheme for firearms can result in fines or imprisonment. H.R. 645 aims to repeal this provision, removing criminal penalties for certain offenses related to firearms. Title II- S. 160 would remove criminal penalties for selling firearms to minors under 18. The FCAA and IPAA aim to harmonize definitions in Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. H.R. 645 continues this harmonization by aligning definitions like \"firearm,\" \"machine gun,\" and \"sawed off shotgun.\" The IPAA allows DC to restrict firearm possession on its property and permits private entities to do the same. H.R. 645 allows DC to restrict firearm possession on its property and permits private entities to do the same, with exceptions for law enforcement personnel. The provision in H.R. 645 would further limit private landlords from restricting tenants' possession of firearms on their premises. The District of Columbia could also restrict firearms on public property with enhanced security measures, excluding residential or business lessees. The proposed language in H.R. 645 would limit the District of Columbia's authority to regulate firearms on buildings or structures under its control, excluding residential or business lessees. It is unclear if the District could regulate firearms on other real property under its control. The District of Columbia's authority to regulate firearms in buildings under its control, excluding residential or business lessees, would be limited by H.R. 645. The Chief would regain the authority to issue licenses for concealed carry, and carrying a rifle or shotgun would still be prohibited. H.R. 645 would allow the Chief to issue licenses for concealed carry within her discretion, while still prohibiting carrying a rifle or shotgun in the District of Columbia. The District currently permits carrying firearms for specific purposes such as at home, for recreational use, at a place of business, or while being transported for lawful purposes. States can also impose their own laws on carrying firearms. H.R. 645 would modify the provision granting authority to carry firearms without a license. It would allow carrying firearms in certain places for specific purposes without needing a license, such as in a person's dwelling house, place of business, or on land owned by the person. It also allows carrying for recreational, sporting, education, or training purposes, as well as while being transported for lawful purposes. H.R. 645 would allow carrying firearms without a license in specific places and for certain purposes, such as in a person's dwelling, place of business, or while being transported for lawful reasons. The Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses would be restored if the bill is enacted, potentially allowing firearm owners to carry concealed weapons outside of these circumstances. The bill would also maintain provisions for the lawful transportation of firearms. The bill H.R. 645 allows carrying firearms without a license in specific places and for lawful purposes, including transportation. Firearms must be unloaded and secured during transportation. The bill also includes toy and antique pistols in the types of firearms prohibited from being used in violent crimes, with violators facing criminal penalties. H.R. 645 grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for firearms dealer license cases. The bill repeals the registration scheme, making it unnecessary for the office to have jurisdiction over it. Provisions in the DC Code related to previous acts would be repealed under H.R. 645. H.R. 645 would repeal the District's registration scheme, allowing individuals not prohibited from possessing firearms to qualify for a dealer's license or engage in purchasing or transferring firearms. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime, fugitives, drug users, mentally defective individuals, and those unlawfully in the country. Duties such as reporting lost or stolen firearms would be repealed under H.R. 645. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime, fugitives, drug users, mentally defective individuals, and those unlawfully in the country. It is unlawful to sell or transfer a firearm to individuals falling within specific categories, such as those with a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence conviction. The FCAA imposes new eligibility requirements for registration certificates. Under the FCAA, new eligibility requirements are imposed for registration certificates. Non-licensed individuals can only sell or transfer firearms to licensed dealers under DC law. H.R. 645 maintains restrictions on licensed dealers transferring firearms to prohibited individuals under federal or DC law. The bill would remove registration requirements under DC law for firearm transfers, allowing transfers only to those prohibited under federal law. The FCAA's assault weapons ban includes specific firearms and characteristics, restricting certain types of weapons. The definition of an assault weapon includes specific firearms and characteristics, with the Chief having the power to designate additional firearms. Antique firearms and certain pistols for Olympic target shooting are excluded. The FCAA also holds manufacturers, importers, or dealers strictly liable for damages caused by assault weapons. The FCAA in the District of Columbia holds individuals strictly liable for damages caused by assault weapons, including bodily injury or death. H.R. 645 would repeal these provisions. Additionally, the FCAA prohibits possession, sale, or transfer of large capacity ammunition feeding devices in DC. The FCAA in DC prohibits possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, which would be repealed by H.R. 645. Licensed dealers must run background checks before transferring firearms under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The DC Code imposes a waiting period of 48 hours for pistol transfers, but under the IPAA, the waiting period for all firearms is now 10 days. Non-licensed persons are not required to perform background checks under federal law. The IPAA extends the waiting period for all firearms to 10 days, not just pistols. If repealed, the waiting period for handguns would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA adds provisions for microstamping on semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011. The FCAA requires that all semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011, must be microstamp-ready as per sec. 503. Manufacturers must provide the Chief with pistol details when presented with a cartridge code from a law enforcement investigation. Section 504 prohibits the sale or possession of pistols not on the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale in the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia prohibits the sale, transfer, or import of pistols not on the California Roster after January 1, 2009. Ownership is only allowed if the pistol was lawfully owned and registered before that date. Residents can only sell or transfer such pistols through licensed firearms dealers. The Chief must review the California Roster annually and can revise the list of handguns deemed unsafe. Discharging a firearm without a permit is unlawful, except for legitimate self-defense. The District of Columbia prohibits the sale, transfer, or import of pistols not on the California Roster after January 1, 2009. Ownership is only allowed if the pistol was lawfully owned and registered before that date. Discharging a firearm without a permit is unlawful, except for legitimate self-defense. The District can prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on its property, and private property owners can do the same, except for law enforcement personnel."
