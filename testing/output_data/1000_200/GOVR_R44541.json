The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines TBML as disguising proceeds of crime through trade transactions. TBML schemes, also known as TBML/FT when used by terrorist groups, involve misrepresenting prices, quantities, or quality of imports/exports. Financial institutions can be unwittingly involved in TBML and TBML/FT schemes when used to settle or finance international trade transactions. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves exploiting the international trade system to transfer value and obscure the origins of illicit wealth. Financial institutions can be implicated in TBML and TBML/FT schemes when used to settle, facilitate, or finance international trade transactions. In June 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued reports on money laundering risks, identifying TBML as a challenging form of money laundering. Treasury described TBML schemes as capable of laundering billions of dollars annually. The Treasury Department's FinCEN advisory in February 2010 highlighted over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports related to trade-based money laundering (TBML) from 2004 to 2009, totaling $276 billion. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers utilize the international financial system and cash couriers to conceal their activities, taking advantage of the complexities of international trade and finance to obscure transactions. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves trade financing arrangements, co-mingling of funds, and exploiting vulnerabilities in financial arrangements for cross-border trade. Money launderers use TBML techniques to obscure the money trail, including over- and under-invoicing goods and services. This method is commonly used to launder funds across borders. According to the FATF, money laundering through over- and under-invoicing goods and services is a common method used to shift funds across borders. Collusion between parties is required for these transactions, which can have significant tax implications. Complex products and those in supply chains are more likely to be used in these activities. Money laundering through over- and under-invoicing involves providing multiple invoices for the same transaction, using multiple financial institutions to complicate detection efforts. Launderers can offer plausible explanations if detected, increasing the complexity of the transaction. Additionally, misstating the prices of goods and services can also be used to shift funds across borders. Money launderers manipulate prices, quantities, and descriptions of goods and services to hide illicit activities. They may collude to create \"phantom\" transactions or use the Black Market Peso Exchange scheme to launder drug proceeds. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) is a common TBML technique used to launder drug proceeds from Latin America. Colombian drug traffickers disguised $4 billion in annual narcotics profits in the 1980s through sophisticated trade-based schemes. TBML is recognized as a prevalent form of international money laundering and a method used by terrorist organizations. Despite being less understood than traditional money laundering methods, TBML can have significant consequences for global trade and government. Transnational criminal organizations engage in trade-based money laundering (TBML) by dumping underpriced goods purchased with illicit proceeds into the market to expedite the money laundering process. This practice not only puts legitimate businesses at a competitive disadvantage but also robs governments of tax revenue and duties collected on undervalued imports. TBML can have a more destructive impact on legitimate commerce than other money laundering schemes, hindering entrepreneurship and crowding out legitimate economic activity. Transnational criminal organizations engage in trade-based money laundering (TBML) by dumping underpriced goods purchased with illicit proceeds into the market. This robs governments of tax revenue and duties collected on undervalued imports. Global trends in trade have facilitated a quadrupling of global trade, creating new market opportunities for criminal organizations to hide gains from illegal activities. Organized crime has expanded into new markets following advances in communications, lower transportation costs, and the digital revolution. According to a report by the OECD, global markets provide criminal organizations with opportunities to diversify into profitable activities with low detection risks. Criminal groups have adapted to new types of trade to connect production to distant consumers, creating economies of scale and the chance to enter new illicit markets. This illicit trade poses challenges for law enforcement and could have wide-ranging economic consequences. Financial flows pose challenges for law enforcement and could have economic consequences, especially as illegal transfers out of developing countries may reduce domestic expenditure and investment. Criminal organizations and terrorist groups can exploit the international trade system with low detection risks, as highlighted by FATF's concerns about the system's vulnerabilities. According to FinCEN, trade-based money laundering (TBML) activity is increasing in volume and global reach. TBML was most frequently identified in transactions involving Mexico and China, with Panama ranked third possibly due to activity in the Colon Free Trade Zone. The Dominican Republic and Venezuela showed rapid growth in potential TBML activity. Limited resources and verification procedures in customs agencies contribute to the challenge of detecting illegal trade transactions. According to the U.S. Department of State's 2016 report on money laundering, trade-based money laundering (TBML) concerns have been identified in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Mexico, Panama, the Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, and Venezuela. TBML is linked to significant losses in customs revenue, tax evasion, and corruption. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is associated with significant losses in customs and tax revenue, corruption of customs authorities, and exploitation of free trade zones. While some known terrorist groups have used TBML, it is not a dominant method for terrorist financing according to the Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment. Since 2001, U.S. law enforcement investigations on terrorist financing have shown that cash movement and banking system transfers are the primary methods used. Cash movement accounted for 28% of cases, while bank transfers were 22%, licensed MSBs 17%, and unlicensed money transmitters 18%. The remaining 15% involved checks, wire transfers, and TBML. TBML is a concern in Tunisia and Syria, particularly with hawala brokers. The State Department identified TBML as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria, involving hawala brokers and corrupt officials. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method used in regions with limited banking presence, relying on trusted money brokers to disburse funds. Unregulated hawala systems lack transparency but are preferred for their quickness, reliability, and lower cost. Unregulated hawala systems are preferred for their quickness, reliability, and lower cost but are perceived as lacking transparency by government authorities. The State Department's 2016 report identified specific countries vulnerable to TBML/FT schemes, such as Afghanistan and Lebanon where TBML schemes involving trade and money laundering are linked to terrorist groups like Hezbollah. TBML schemes involving trade in vehicles, sometimes with weapons, are used to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. U.S. law enforcement traced money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships, with funds used to buy vehicles exported to Lebanon and Jordan. Some vehicles contain hidden weapons. TBML schemes are prevalent in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area, where a lucrative cross-border cigarette smuggling market is exploited for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations and corrupt officials. The cigarette smuggling market, valued at around $1 billion annually, is utilized for money-laundering, benefiting criminal organizations, corrupt officials, and potentially terrorist groups. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was designated as a primary money-laundering concern by the Department of the Treasury in connection with Hezbollah's financial support derived from drug and money laundering schemes involving trade-based money laundering. The narcotics trafficking and money laundering network moved illegal drugs from South America to Europe and the Middle East via West Africa, laundering hundreds of millions of dollars monthly through accounts at LCB. They also used trade-based money laundering involving consumer goods worldwide, including through US used car dealerships. Funds were repatriated back to Lebanon through bulk cash deposits among exchange houses. Additionally, Asian-supplied consumer goods were shipped to Latin America, and the proceeds were laundered through a BMPE-styled scheme. In a drug trafficking network, Asian-supplied consumer goods were shipped to Latin America and proceeds laundered through a BMPE-styled scheme. Funds for the goods were funneled through LCB's U.S. correspondent accounts. LCB's banking license was revoked in 2011, and its assets were sold to Lebanese Societ\u00e9 Generale de Banque au Liban. Individuals and entities linked to this network faced financial sanctions and law enforcement investigations in the U.S. Woody Toys, Inc. owners received cash payments from narcotics trafficking, laundering funds through a BMPE scheme. Woody Toys, Inc. received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican narcotics trafficking, laundering the funds through a BMPE scheme. The company used the cash to buy toys from China, which were then exported to Colombia. Employees had ties to Angel Toy Company, also involved in a similar scheme. Law enforcement cooperation between the U.S. and Colombia aided in the investigation. The investigation into this case benefitted from information sharing between the United States and Colombia on trade data through Trade Transparency Units (TTUs). A scheme to launder funds involved cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance mechanisms managed by an Indian national in Dubai with businesses and affiliates worldwide. In Dubai, an individual used letters of credit (LCs) to launder drug trafficking funds through inflated export values to India. The scheme involved bogus trade documents and money transfers disguised as trade financing. The funds were then distributed to affiliates and the exports sold at market value in India. An individual in Dubai used letters of credit to launder drug proceeds through inflated export values to India. The funds were distributed to affiliates and exports sold at market value. In India, the same individual used various techniques to move funds offshore through hawala operators, including facilitating trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents. U.S. government policy responses to trade-based money laundering include participation in the Financial Action Task Force and regulatory measures by the Treasury Department. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established to develop AML/CFT guidelines and currently has 34 member countries. FATF relies on self-assessments and mutual evaluations to ensure compliance with its guidelines and can suspend non-compliant members. Since 1989, FATF has been focused on combating money laundering, issuing 40 recommendations in 1990. The Treasury Department plays a role in regulatory responses to money laundering. The FATF issued 40 recommendations in 1990 to combat money laundering. The U.S. delegation, led by the Treasury Department's TFFC, supports the FATF's global efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing. The delegation includes members from various U.S. government agencies and implements domestic actions to combat these threats. The FATF, supported by the U.S. delegation, implements actions to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The revised FATF 40 Recommendations integrate CFT guidelines and address new threats to deepen global surveillance and raise standards. The revised FATF 40 Recommendations strengthen requirements for higher-risk situations and focus on areas with high risks or where implementation can be improved. They also address transparency requirements for beneficial ownership and control of legal entities to combat tax transparency, corporate governance, and criminal activities. However, specific recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering are not included in the current set of FATF 40 Recommendations. The FATF has identified a lack of comprehensive data on trade-based money laundering (TBML) due to jurisdictions not recognizing TBML as a separate activity under money laundering. They also found that most jurisdictions do not provide specific training on TBML detection. FATF recommends developing training programs to address this issue. The FATF recommends jurisdictions develop specific training programs for detecting TBML, focusing on financial and trade data analysis. FinCEN issues advisories and special measures to combat TBML, red flagging activities indicative of money laundering for financial institutions to assist in filing SARs. In February 2010, FinCEN issued an advisory on trade-based money laundering (TBML) to aid financial institutions in reporting suspicious activity. The advisory highlighted basic TBML schemes, specific red flags, and requested the inclusion of TBML or BMPE on SARs. FinCEN also noted delays in reporting suspected TBML activity. The advisory warns about funnel accounts used by Mexican criminal organizations to evade currency restrictions in the U.S. FinCEN also utilizes Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) to track suspicious financial activities, with a maximum duration of 180 days. In April 2015, FinCEN issued a Geographic Targeting Order (GTO) in Miami to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML) by lowering cash reporting thresholds for certain businesses. The GTO required reporting of transactions over $3,000 in cash to target schemes by criminal organizations like Sinaloa and Los Zetas. Violators of GTOs may face civil or criminal penalties. FinCEN renewed the GTO in October 2015 to combat TBML schemes by Sinaloa and Los Zetas. Another GTO in the same month targeted businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District to disrupt drug traffickers. FinCEN can require special measures under BSA to combat money laundering concerns. The Treasury Department can impose special measures against foreign entities involved in money laundering, ranging from enhanced due diligence to prohibiting certain financial transactions. FinCEN designated two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, as primary money laundering concerns in April 2013. In April 2013, FinCEN designated Lebanese exchange houses Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a TBML scheme and money laundering network linked to Hezbollah. ICE/HSI established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004 to examine trade anomalies using specialized computer systems. The Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) were established by ICE/HSI in 2004 in Washington, DC to investigate trade anomalies and financial irregularities related to TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion. These units receive funding from the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) and aim to create an international network of TTUs similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy prioritizes combating TBML both domestically and internationally, calling for the deployment of ICE-led TTUs for enhanced exchange and analysis of information. The Money Laundering Strategy established the goal of attacking TBML at home and abroad, deploying ICE-led TTUs to exchange and analyze trade data. The State Department reports a growing number of TBML investigations from TTU activity, with over $1 billion seized. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings focusing on terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security priorities, particularly in Latin America. Several hearing witnesses have questioned the issue. The 114th Congress has focused on the links between trade-based money laundering (TBML) and terrorist financing. Some policymakers have raised concerns about these connections, despite the Treasury Department downplaying the relationship in its national risk assessments. Witnesses in hearings have questioned the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML, including the role of Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) and resources allocated to them. Discussions have also touched on the potential for U.S. trade policy, free trade agreements, and the establishment of TTUs to help combat TBML. The 114th Congress enacted the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to address concerns about the links between terrorism and trade-based money laundering (TBML). The Act directed additional financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions and required reporting on Hezbollah's financing operations, including its use of TBML. OFAC issued a final rule for implementing the Act on April 15, 2016. The 114th Congress enacted the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to address concerns about terrorism and trade-based money laundering. OFAC issued a final rule on April 15, 2016, to implement the Act. President Obama is committed to imposing sanctions on Hezbollah operatives. The Treasury Department aims to implement the Act robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress may monitor the Act's implementation and other financial tools for addressing TBML. The 114th Congress enacted the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to address terrorism and trade-based money laundering. Hearings in the 114th Congress discussed TBML, including a specific hearing on Trading with the Enemy: Trade-Based Money Laundering. Various committees addressed the issue, such as the House Armed Services Committee and the House Financial Services Committee. The House Financial Services Committee and House Homeland Security Committee have held hearings on terrorist financing trends and efforts to prevent funding streams from South America. The House Financial Services Committee also focused on countering the plunder and sale of cultural antiquities by ISIS. The Financial Services Committee and Task Force investigate terrorism financing and prevent cultural genocide by countering the plunder and sale of priceless cultural antiquities by ISIS. They also focus on helping the developing world fight terror finance. House committees investigate terrorism financing, trade-based money laundering, terrorist financing methods like kidnapping and antiquities trafficking, and the impact of immigration enforcement policies on public safety. House committees investigate terrorism financing, trade-based money laundering, terrorist financing methods like kidnapping and antiquities trafficking, and the impact of immigration enforcement policies on public safety through various hearings and task forces. House committees investigate terrorism financing, trade-based money laundering, terrorist financing methods, and the impact of immigration enforcement policies through hearings and task forces. House committees investigate terrorism financing, trade-based money laundering, and terrorist financing methods in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as Iran and Hezbollah's activities in the Western Hemisphere. Annual testimony of the Secretary of the Treasury on the international financial system was presented on March 17, 2015."
