    "title": "AB 1366",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to boost enrollment and graduation rates for AB 540 students by mandating the establishment of Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high schools each year, but only 20 percent attend college. Many are unaware of laws like Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA that make college more accessible. Most college campuses lack centralized support services for students eligible under AB 540. The creation of Dream Resource Centers would streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students eligible under Assembly Bill 540, aiming to empower and support this population to increase enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates. Several college campuses have established Dream Resource Centers to support undocumented students, offering workshops, legal clinics, information on available programs, and peer mentoring to enhance awareness, professional development, and employment opportunities. Chapter 3.67 is added to the Education Code, encouraging California Community Colleges to designate Dream Resource Liaisons on campus to assist students, including undocumented students, in accessing financial aid and academic opportunities. Each campus is encouraged to have a staff person knowledgeable in these areas placed in the extended opportunity programs and services office or financial aid office. Each campus of the California State University is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements, including undocumented students. The University of California is also encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each campus. Dream Resource Centers may offer various support services such as financial aid assistance, academic counseling, peer support, psychological counseling, referral services, and legal services. The section allows Dream Resource Centers to be housed within existing student service or academic centers, and the space where the Dream Resource Liaison is located can be considered a Dream Resource Center. The Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and the Regents of the University of California are permitted to seek and accept gifts to aid in the creation and operation of Dream Resource Centers. The act mandates reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
