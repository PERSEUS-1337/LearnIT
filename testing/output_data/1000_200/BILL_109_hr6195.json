Automation and digitization in industries will rely on NSF-funded researchers for information processing. NSF's research and assistance are crucial for industry to benefit from advanced technology. Information management is projected to grow by 49% in some biology-related sectors by 2010. Information management is projected to grow by 49% in some biology-related sectors by 2010. There is no systematic plan for designing and implementing information tools for the workforce to transition to the information age. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation. \"Information\" pertains to data in sectors where the Federal Government is involved and transitioning to digital data use. \"Institution of higher education\" is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Director, in consultation with other Federal agencies, awards grants for research on improving information systems in areas like information studies, population informatics, translational informatics, and data security. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with authorized appropriations of $3.5 million for 2008, $3.6 million for 2009, and $3.7 million for 2010. The Director awards multiyear grants to institutions of higher education to establish Centers for Informatics Research, with authorized appropriations of $3.5 million for 2008, $3.6 million for 2009, $3.7 million for 2010, and $3.8 million for 2011. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive. The Centers for Informatics Research are established by the Director through multiyear grants to institutions of higher education. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis for innovative research projects in information technology. Applications must be submitted by higher education institutions or consortia, detailing the research projects and contributions of participating entities. The Center for Informatics Research will undertake research projects and promote collaboration among professionals from various disciplines to increase the number of information researchers and professionals. The Director will evaluate applications based on the applicant's ability to generate innovative research projects in information technology. The Director will evaluate applications based on the applicant's ability to generate innovative approaches to information research, experience in the field, capacity for collaborations, support for students, and partnerships with government or other entities. The Director will convene an annual meeting of the Centers to foster collaboration and communication. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation is as follows: $4,500,000 for fiscal year 2008, $4,600,000 for fiscal year 2009, $4,700,000 for fiscal year 2010, and $4,800,000 for fiscal year 2011. SEC. 5. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION INFORMATION PROGRAMS. The Director will establish a program to award grants to institutions of higher education to improve undergraduate and master's degree information programs, increase student enrollment in information fields, provide industry experience, and utilize distance learning. Grants will be awarded based on merit and competition, and funds must be used for activities enhancing program abilities. Grants awarded under this program will enhance higher education institutions' information education programs by developing curriculum, establishing degree programs, creating research opportunities, and acquiring necessary equipment for students. The curr_chunk focuses on creating opportunities for undergraduate students in information research, acquiring equipment for student instruction, providing faculty opportunities to collaborate with government agencies and industry, collaborating with other academic institutions, and establishing student internships at various levels of government. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing programs by establishing student internships, bridge programs between community colleges and universities, and other activities determined by the Director. Institutions of higher education can apply for funding under this subsection. The curr_chunk outlines the application requirements for institutions of higher education seeking funding to enhance instructional capacity in information fields. This includes submitting a comprehensive plan and describing the research and instructional capacity of the applicant or consortium. The curr_chunk focuses on the requirements for institutions seeking funding to enhance instructional capacity in information fields. It includes details on collaborations with government agencies or private industry, student enrollment and placement data, and a plan to evaluate program success. The Director will evaluate the program established for enhancing instructional capacity in information fields, including assessing graduate school and job placement rates, relevance of the program to graduate study and the workplace, and geographic diversity of grant awards. The evaluation will occur no later than 3 years after the program's establishment to determine if objectives have been met. The Director will evaluate grants aimed at increasing students pursuing degrees in information fields, with appropriations authorized for fiscal years 2008 to 2011. Grants under the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992 will support activities outlined in the Act. The National Science Foundation is authorized to appropriate funds for improving education in information-related fields, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2008 to 2011. SEC. 6. REPORT ON STANDARDIZATION OF MEASURES RELATED TO DIGITAL INFORMATION. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology must report to specific committees on efforts related to informatics, including standards harmonization and support for executive orders on digitization. The report should include timetables for information standards, challenges in promulgation, and ensuring usability for scientists and researchers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology must report on efforts related to informatics, including standards harmonization and support for digitization. This report should include actions to ensure digital information usability for scientists and researchers, in line with Public Law 104-113."
