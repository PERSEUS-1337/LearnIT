The EU aims to harmonize policies among its member states to enhance internal security while safeguarding citizens' rights and promoting free movement within the union. The EU's response to terrorism post-9/11 led to increased cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence matters, aiming to harmonize policies among member states for internal security while safeguarding citizens' rights and promoting free movement. JHA encompasses countering terrorism, police and judicial cooperation, migration and asylum issues, and border control policies for the Schengen area. EU attempts to forge common JHA policies were initially hindered by member state concerns about national sovereignty and insufficient resources, but the 2001 terrorist attacks prompted a shift towards greater collaboration and trust among law enforcement agencies. The 2001 terrorist attacks served as a wake-up call for EU leaders and member state governments, leading to increased law enforcement efforts to track down terrorist suspects and freeze financial assets. European leaders recognized the need for stronger anti-terrorist legislation and cooperation due to the ease of movement across open borders within the EU. Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, EU leaders recognized the need to harmonize national laws against terrorism and improve cooperation among member states' law enforcement authorities to facilitate the sharing of information and expedite the apprehension of suspects fleeing across borders. The EU took steps to enhance counterterrorism capabilities, including establishing a common definition of terrorism, a list of terrorist groups, an EU arrest warrant, tools to combat terrorist financing, and measures to improve border controls and aviation security. Europol and Eurojust were strengthened to handle criminal intelligence and prosecutorial coordination. Subsequent incidents, like the 2004 Madrid bombings, further drove EU initiatives to enhance travel document security and impede terrorist travel. The Madrid attacks and the 2005 London bombings prompted the EU to establish a Counterterrorism Coordinator to enhance intelligence sharing and implement anti-radicalization policies. The London attacks raised concerns about integrating Muslims into European society and countering violent extremism. In response, the EU adopted its first plan to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment in December 2005. The EU adopted its first plan in December 2005 to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, with goals to disrupt terrorist networks, promote mainstream opinions, and enhance security. In 2008, the EU expanded its definition of terrorism to include new criminal offenses to prosecute individuals involved in terrorist activities and counter terrorist propaganda. EU officials hoped that the decision to facilitate prosecution of those involved in terrorist activities and counter terrorist propaganda by demanding cooperation from Internet providers. The EU established a Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. Despite political commitment to enhancing EU-wide cooperation against terrorism, common EU policies remain a work in progress due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states and EU institutions on sensitive issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. Sovereignty concerns and differing views among EU member states and institutions complicate harmonizing laws and policies in the JHA field, particularly on issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. National authorities are hesitant to share information with each other or with EU bodies like Europol, hindering efforts to address threats from terrorist organizations like ISIL. EU policymakers are alarmed by the increasing number of European citizens joining terrorist groups in the Middle East and North Africa. EU authorities estimate that up to 5,000 European citizens have traveled to fight in conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa since 2011. Security services are concerned about the potential threat posed by trained militants returning to Europe, as well as individuals inspired by Islamist extremist propaganda to carry out \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have been linked to or influenced by groups like the Islamic State. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have been linked to or influenced by groups like the Islamic State. These attacks include the May 24, 2014, killing of four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, Belgium, the January 7-9, 2015, attacks in Paris, France, and the February 14-15, 2015, shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark. The perpetrators were French-born Muslims with possible ties to Al Qaeda in Yemen or the Islamic State. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have been linked to groups like the Islamic State. This includes the thwarted August 21, 2015, train attack from Amsterdam to Paris and the coordinated November 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 dead. The assailants were French or Belgian citizens, with at least six having ties to the Islamic State in Syria-Iraq. European authorities have struggled with monitoring foreign fighters and weaknesses in domestic security and border controls. Recent attacks in Europe have exposed weaknesses in domestic security and border controls, hindering authorities in monitoring potential assailants. The Schengen system and migrant influxes have been exploited by perpetrators, allowing them to travel between European countries. The November Paris attackers and the Brussels gunman traveled extensively within Europe, despite being known to security services. Some attackers entered Europe through Greece in early October. The EU faces challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat due to issues related to sovereignty and balancing security with human rights and civil liberties. The EU has faced challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat, balancing security with human rights and civil liberties. Key steps include enhancing information sharing among national authorities and utilizing common EU databases like the Schengen Information System and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. Europol's Focal Point Travellers database, established in 2013, collects and analyzes information on European fighters. In January 2016, Europol launched the European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) for information sharing and operational cooperation among member states. Success of these initiatives depends on receiving information from national authorities. EU officials report an increase in alerts entered into SIS and information contributed to Europol databases, but some experts believe EU-wide information sharing on terrorism still falls short. EU is working on finalizing the EU-wide system for collecting airline Passenger Name Record (PNR) data. EU-wide information sharing related to terrorism falls short. Finalizing the EU-wide system for collecting airline Passenger Name Record (PNR) data has been delayed since 2013 due to data privacy concerns. Pressure to adopt an EU PNR system increased after the 2015 Paris attacks. The system would aid in sharing information on foreign fighters and identifying terrorist suspects. Harmonization across the EU on PNR collection is necessary. The EU PNR proposal aims to harmonize PNR collection practices across member states. A provisional agreement was reached in December 2015, requiring airlines to provide PNR data for flights into and out of EU territory. Member states can also collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier operators. Critics raise privacy concerns, while others argue for more meaningful data sharing. The EU PNR system proposal aims to harmonize data collection practices across member states. Critics argue it infringes on data privacy rights, while others believe it doesn't go far enough in ensuring meaningful data sharing. EU governments will have two years to implement the agreement's provisions once formally adopted. EU officials urged national authorities to strengthen external border controls in response to the foreign fighter threat. In mid-December 2015, the European Commission proposed a \"targeted modification\" of the Schengen Borders Code to introduce mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at the Schengen area's external borders. This proposal was made in response to the surge of migrants and refugees into Europe and the attacks in Paris, putting pressure on the Schengen system. Additionally, the European Commission suggested establishing a new European Border and Coast Guard to strengthen member states' capacities at the EU's external borders. The European Commission proposed establishing a new European Border and Coast Guard to reinforce member states' capacities at the EU's external borders through joint operations and rapid interventions. The EU has been working to detect and remove Internet content promoting terrorism and to develop communication strategies to counter terrorist ideologies, including the establishment of an Internet Referral Unit (IRU) and an Internet Forum. The EU launched an Internet Forum in December 2015 to counter terrorist propaganda online and called on member states to address societal factors contributing to radicalization. The EU is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training throughout the EU. Harmonizing criminal laws in the EU has faced challenges due to varying national policies and fears of EU-wide measures. The EU is revising its common terrorism definition to address the foreign fighter threat and comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The European Commission proposed amendments to harmonize criminal laws across member states, aiming to prevent gaps in prosecution of foreign fighter-related offenses. The EU is revising its common terrorism definition to address the foreign fighter threat and comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The proposal will be considered by EU member states and the European Parliament, as part of efforts to combat terrorism since September 11, 2001. U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism has improved law enforcement and intelligence cooperation, leading to positive views on the evolving partnership in these areas. The Obama Administration has supported U.S. cooperation with the EU in counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security. The EU is a key partner in the Global Counterterrorism Forum, aiming to counter violent extremism and strengthen rule-of-law capacities. Counterterrorism Forum was established in 2011 to combat violent extremism and enhance international cooperation against terrorism. U.S.-EU cooperation has focused on addressing the foreign fighter phenomenon, with concerns about European and American Muslims joining Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. U.S. policymakers are worried about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements between the U.S. and most EU countries. Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized the need for shared strategies to confront the influx of U.S. and European-born violent extremists in Syria. The U.S. and EU are working together to combat the influx of U.S. and European-born violent extremists in Syria. They are enhancing counter-radicalization, border security, and information sharing to address the foreign fighter threat. EU countries support U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 and are providing support to the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. The EU and U.S. are collaborating to combat the foreign fighter threat, with EU member states supporting the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. Following the Paris attacks, there have been discussions on enhancing information sharing and establishing an EU PNR system. Following the Paris attacks in November 2015, President Obama urged the EU to implement an agreement requiring airlines to share passenger information to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering countries undetected. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are crucial in combating the foreign fighter threat. However, challenges such as data privacy and protection concerns continue to complicate negotiations in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship. The U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship faces challenges such as data privacy concerns, detainee policies, and differences in terrorist designation lists. Legislation passed in December 2015 to strengthen the U.S. Visa Waiver Program has raised concerns in the EU. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials are ongoing at various levels. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased since 2001, playing a crucial role in developing closer ties. The U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and Treasury are actively engaged in this process, with high-level meetings between U.S. and EU counterparts occurring regularly to discuss cooperation against terrorism, terrorist financing, and border security. The United States and the EU have established dialogues on terrorist financing, border and transport security, critical infrastructure protection, and preventing violent extremism. U.S. and EU agencies have reciprocal liaison relationships, with Europol and U.S. federal law enforcement agencies collaborating on counterterrorism, counterfeiting, and cybercrime. Since 2006, U.S. liaison has worked at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague to facilitate cooperation between European and U.S. prosecutors on terrorism and cross-border criminal cases. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have led to agreements improving police and judicial cooperation, including sharing strategic information between U.S. law enforcement authorities and Europol. In 2001 and 2002, U.S. and Europol agreements allowed sharing of strategic and personal information. Negotiations were challenging due to EU data protection concerns. In 2007, a common security agreement was signed for classified information exchange. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance entered into force to simplify the extradition process and promote better information-sharing and prosecutorial cooperation in combating terrorism and transnational crimes. The U.S. and EU negotiated extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements in 2010 to combat terrorism and transnational crimes. Challenges included the U.S. agreeing not to extradite suspects facing the death penalty and not guaranteeing extradition of any EU national. The agreements modernize existing bilateral agreements, streamline information exchange, and set rules for competing extradition requests. The mutual legal assistance treaty allows U.S. access to European financial information and speeds up request processing. The MLA treaty will provide U.S. authorities access to European bank account and financial information in criminal investigations, speed up request processing, allow evidence acquisition by video conferencing, and permit U.S. participation in joint EU investigations. Critics question the utility of collaborating with EU-wide bodies due to existing bilateral relations between agencies and national services in EU member states. Europol's lack of enforcement capabilities and dependence on national services for information is noted. European officials criticize the U.S. for expecting intelligence sharing without reciprocating. European officials criticize the United States for expecting intelligence sharing without reciprocating, while some European opposition to the U.S. death penalty may hinder legal assistance and extradition of terrorist suspects. However, most U.S. and European officials are committed to enhancing cooperation with EU law enforcement entities like Europol. In early 2015, new agreements were signed to improve U.S.-Europol cooperation against foreign fighters and illegal immigration, with both sides actively partnering in efforts to track and stem terrorist financing. The United States and the EU cooperate in global forums to suppress terrorist financing and improve financial investigative tools. They benefit from an agreement allowing U.S. access to SWIFT data, generating investigative leads for EU governments. This cooperation has helped prevent or investigate terrorist attacks in Europe. The TFTP and the U.S.-EU agreement on sharing SWIFT data have been beneficial in preventing terrorist attacks in Europe, despite ongoing privacy concerns. U.S. and EU officials have collaborated since 2001 to bridge gaps in their lists of terrorist individuals and groups, presenting a united front and curbing terrorist financing. The EU maintains separate lists focusing on Al Qaeda, Taliban, and post-9/11 U.N. Security Council sanctions. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist individuals and groups associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as those not affiliated with Al Qaeda. The \"common terrorist list\" or \"blacklist\" includes over 80 entities worldwide, with law enforcement measures varying based on whether they are considered \"external\" to the EU. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist individuals and groups associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, as well as those not affiliated with Al Qaeda. Law enforcement measures vary based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. For \"external\" persons and groups, all EU member states are legally obligated to freeze assets, restrict financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance. For \"internal\" persons and groups, inclusion on the EU's common terrorist list subjects them to strengthened police cooperation measures. The EU's common terrorist list includes individuals and entities subject to strengthened police cooperation measures. National governments apply sanctions to cut off financing for these entities. The process for adding or removing someone from the list requires unanimous agreement among all EU member states. The US and other countries have influenced the EU to add organizations like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah to the list. The US has also added members of ETA to its terrorist designation lists, aligning with the EU's efforts. The EU's common terrorist list includes individuals and entities subject to police cooperation measures. There are frictions in fully harmonizing the U.S. and EU terrorist designation lists, with the EU hesitant to add suspected Hamas-related charities due to differing views among member states. Some charities designated by the U.S. as Hamas fronts, like Interpal, have been cleared by European national authorities. EU member states have been divided on including Hezbollah on the common terrorist list. The EU member states have been divided on whether to include the Lebanese-based Hezbollah organization on the EU's common terrorist list. The United States considers Hezbollah a foreign terrorist organization and applies sanctions to the group. Some EU countries support adding Hezbollah to the list, while others argue it could harm relations with Lebanon due to Hezbollah's role in the government. In 2012-2013, events like the Burgas airport bombing and Hezbollah's involvement in Syria's civil war prompted calls for the EU to add Hezbollah to its terrorist list. In late July 2013, the EU announced the addition of Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, following appeals due to their involvement in Syria's civil war. This decision was seen as a compromise to avoid destabilizing Lebanon and maintain EU influence in the region. The EU emphasized that dialogue with political parties in Lebanon and humanitarian assistance would continue. The EU's decision to add Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list was largely symbolic, sending a message that terrorist activities would endanger its legitimacy. Some experts hoped this would lead to enhanced intelligence investigations into Hezbollah's activities in Europe. Critics argued that only listing the military wing was insufficient as fundraising would still be allowed. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, seen as symbolic. Critics argued it was insufficient as fundraising was still allowed. US urged EU to include Hezbollah on the list after Bulgaria implicated them in the Burgas bombing. Obama Administration called for action to disrupt Hezbollah's financing and operational networks. Members of Congress passed resolutions urging EU to add Hezbollah to its terrorist list. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list after US pressure. Data privacy remains a key issue between the US and EU. EU regulations prioritize privacy rights and restrict data transfer to certain countries. EU data privacy regulations set common rules for entities holding personal data, prohibiting transfers to countries without adequate legal protections. Concerns have been raised in U.S.-EU information-sharing accords about the protection of European citizens' data, with some MEPs and civil liberty groups arguing that privacy rights are violated. Unauthorized disclosures of NSA surveillance programs have fueled these concerns. The allegations of U.S. collection activities in Europe, including monitoring EU diplomatic offices and Angela Merkel's phone, have strained transatlantic trust and raised concerns about data protection. Analysts worry about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements, especially with opposition from MEPs. The European Parliament has expressed concerns about U.S. surveillance programs and established a special working group. In July 2013, the European Parliament passed a resolution expressing concerns about U.S. surveillance programs. A special working group was established to investigate alleged U.S. collection activities and similar surveillance practices in certain EU member states. The group, chaired by Claude Moraes, adopted the critical \"Moraes report\" in March 2014, which included recommendations on U.S.-EU security and economic issues. Concerns were raised about the U.S.-EU PNR accord and calls to suspend the SWIFT agreement. The \"Moraes report\" highlighted concerns about U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements, urging the conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement. The European Parliament resolution, while not binding, expressed the Parliament's stance on the need for the United States to recognize the privacy rights of EU citizens and provide judicial remedies for any violations. The report also called for EU data protection reforms in response to reported NSA programs and alleged U.S. spying activities. The European Parliament demanded stronger data protection reforms in response to alleged U.S. spying activities. New data protection rules were agreed upon in December 2015, with concerns raised by U.S. officials about potential impacts on law enforcement cooperation and U.S. companies. U.S. officials reassured EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and oversight mechanisms. The United States operates within U.S. law and is subject to oversight by all three branches of the government. Efforts have been made to address EU concerns and improve transparency to maintain European support for agreements like SWIFT and PNR. A U.S.-EU working group was established to discuss NSA surveillance operations, including the PRISM program, and assess the impact on privacy rights of EU citizens. The European Commission issued a report with recommendations to address European concerns about U.S.-EU data flows and restore transatlantic trust. In June 2014, the Obama Administration announced plans to work with Congress to provide EU citizens with the right to pursue redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act was passed in the 114th Congress to address European concerns about U.S.-EU data flows and restore transatlantic trust. Controversy arose in 2006 over Europe's involvement in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, which allowed U.S. access to SWIFT financial data. Despite assurances from U.S. officials that the data was only used for counterterrorism purposes, concerns remained about compliance with EU data protection standards. In 2009, changes were made to SWIFT's systems architecture to address these concerns. In 2009, changes to SWIFT's systems architecture were made to address concerns about data protection standards. A new U.S.-EU agreement was needed for data sharing, leading to a new accord in November 2009. However, the European Parliament rejected the agreement in February 2010 due to insufficient protections for personal data and privacy rights of EU citizens. MEPs who opposed the SWIFT accord in 2010 cited concerns over data privacy and civil liberties. Negotiations for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement began to address EP's concerns, including judicial remedy for data abuse and bulk data transfers. In 2010, MEPs raised concerns about data privacy and civil liberties regarding the SWIFT agreement. Negotiations led to a new draft agreement allowing for legal redress for EU citizens in the U.S. and giving Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. Some MEPs remained dissatisfied with certain provisions, prompting additional changes to the draft. The EU and U.S. officials made two changes to the draft SWIFT agreement to secure approval from the European Parliament. The first change involved appointing an independent observer in Washington, DC, to oversee SWIFT data extraction. The second change required the European Commission to develop plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP within a year. The final version of the agreement was approved by the European Parliament on July 8, 2010, and entered into force on August 1, 2010, for a five-year period. The U.S.-EU SWIFT accord was approved by the European Parliament on July 8, 2010, and entered into force on August 1, 2010, for a five-year period. Concerns were raised about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the implementation of the SWIFT accord. The European Commission recommended measures to make the TFTP more transparent in reviews conducted in March 2011 and December 2012. In December 2012, the Commission released the results of a second review of the TFTP agreement, concluding that it had provided concrete benefits in fighting terrorism. European concerns about U.S. surveillance activities were renewed in June 2013, leading to increased scrutiny by the European Parliament. The European Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord due to NSA monitoring allegations. Reviews of the SWIFT data in 2013 and 2014 showed it was beneficial in combating terrorist threats. During the 2012 London Olympics, the US and EU agreed on sharing passenger data for security reasons, but the European Parliament challenged the agreement in court due to privacy concerns. In 2006, the EU Court of Justice annulled the PNR agreement due to improper legal basis, but did not find it in violation of privacy rights. In 2007, a new seven-year agreement was reached between the United States and the EU, allowing for extended storage of PNR data and access to sensitive passenger information in exceptional circumstances. The 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement allowed access to sensitive passenger information in exceptional circumstances, with data sent to U.S. authorities 72 hours before a flight. The agreement reduced data fields from 34 to 19, but faced objections from MEPs over data transfer, retention period, and redress for misuse concerns. Some MEPs feared U.S. authorities might use PNR data for data mining or profiling. In May 2010, the European Parliament postponed its vote on the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement due to concerns about data misuse and potential data mining by U.S. authorities. The Parliament called for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission to set general requirements for all EU PNR agreements. In September 2010, the Commission issued the strategy, urging renegotiation of PNR agreements with the United States, Australia, and Canada, emphasizing that PNR data should only be used for combating terrorism and serious crimes. The European Commission proposed general principles for the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, emphasizing its use for combating terrorism and serious crimes. The Commission highlighted the importance of passenger rights, limited data exchange, and data retention limits. In November 2010, the European Parliament supported the Commission's PNR strategy and endorsed new negotiations with the United States, stressing the necessity and proportionality of data exchange. The European Parliament supported new negotiations with the United States on Passenger Name Record (PNR) data exchange, emphasizing the need for data to be \"necessary\" and \"proportional.\" The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the 2007 PNR accord, leading to negotiations in December 2010. U.S. officials maintained that the data collected was protected and not misused, citing joint reviews by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the European Commission. Negotiations between the United States and the European Commission on a revised Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement were concluded in late May 2011, following resolutions in the House and Senate supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord. U.S. officials emphasized the importance of maintaining the operational effectiveness of the current PNR program and not invalidating bilateral PNR deals with EU member states. In 2011, the US and the European Commission finalized a revised PNR agreement with new provisions to enhance passenger data protection. The agreement included depersonalizing passenger records after six months, reducing data storage time, and limiting access to authorized personnel. It also clarified passenger rights and ensured decisions on boarding denial would not be solely based on automated data processing. Additionally, it allowed for consultation if the EU developed its own PNR system in the future. The 2011 revised PNR agreement between the US and the European Commission included provisions to enhance passenger data protection, such as depersonalizing records after six months and limiting access to authorized personnel. Despite revisions, some MEPs were unsatisfied with the accord, citing concerns about data retention for up to 15 years, increased data transfer requirements, and broadened use of PNR data for criminal offenses. In 2011, the US and the European Commission revised the PNR agreement to enhance passenger data protection, including depersonalizing records after six months and limiting access. Some MEPs were still concerned about data retention for up to 15 years and expanded use of PNR data for criminal offenses. U.S. officials testified that the new draft addressed EU concerns on data security, offenses covered, and passenger rights, but negotiations continued to further address European worries. In November 2011, a new draft PNR agreement was concluded between the United States and the EU, with improvements over the previous version. Changes included limiting PNR data use to serious crimes and varying retention time based on the type of crime. EU member states approved the agreement in December 2011, with some abstentions due to concerns over data retention and redress. In December 2011, EU member states approved the new U.S.-EU PNR agreement, with some abstentions from Germany and Austria due to concerns over data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs had reservations about the changes in the agreement but others supported it, citing stronger data protection guarantees compared to the 2007 version. Despite some misgivings, a number of MEPs were willing to vote for the 2011 accord to provide airlines with legal certainty. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament on April 19, 2012, with U.S. officials welcoming the endorsement. The accord was officially adopted by the EU on April 26, 2012, and entered into force on August 8, 2012, valid for seven years and renewable for another seven years unless a party notifies the other in advance. The European Commission published the results of a U.S.-EU joint review of the PNR program in November 2013, stating that the agreement is effective in fighting terrorism and serious crimes. However, concerns have been raised about U.S. data protection safeguards, leading to questions about the program's adequacy. The Parliament's resolution in March 2014 called for clarification on whether U.S. laws provide sufficient protection for PNR data stored in cloud systems on U.S. soil. Many U.S. and EU leaders believe that law enforcement information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and PNR are crucial in combating terrorism. U.S. officials seek an umbrella agreement with the EU to streamline data-sharing negotiations. In 2009, the European Parliament called for a U.S.-EU framework agreement to enhance data protection in counterterrorism efforts. The European Commission proposed a draft mandate for negotiating an accord to protect personal data in the fight against terrorism and crime. The agreement aimed to bridge differences in privacy rights between the U.S. and EU, ensuring high standards of data protection. However, the framework agreement would not facilitate the actual transfer of personal data, requiring specific agreements like SWIFT or PNR. EU member states approved the Commission's mandate in December 2010. In early December 2010, EU member states approved the Commission's mandate for negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) with the United States. The DPPA aimed to protect personal information exchanged in a law enforcement context, based on the principle of mutual recognition of data protection systems. The negotiations were expected to result in an EU finding of \"adequacy\" for U.S. data protection standards, building on common principles adopted in 2009. The DPPA aimed to build on common data protection principles adopted by the US and EU in 2009. Progress was made on data security, transparency, and oversight provisions, but controversial issues remained. EU officials pushed for judicial redress rights for European citizens in the US. The DPPA negotiations between the US and EU were stalled due to issues with judicial redress. However, the revelations of US surveillance activities in 2013 reignited discussions. The European Parliament urged the resumption of DPPA talks for transatlantic trust restoration. The EP's \"Moraes report\" in March 2014 emphasized the need for the DPPA to restore transatlantic trust and urged the US to provide EU citizens with judicial redress rights. In June 2014, then-US Attorney General Holder announced the Obama Administration's commitment to seeking legislation for EU citizens to have the same redress rights as US citizens under the Privacy Act. This decision aimed to facilitate final agreement on the DPPA negotiations. On September 8, 2015, U.S. and EU negotiators finalized the text of the DPPA, aiming to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. The EU required U.S. judicial redress legislation before signing the DPPA. Legislation like H.R. 1428 and S. 1600 was introduced to extend judicial redress provisions to EU citizens. The Judicial Redress Act, introduced through H.R. 1428 and S. 1600, aimed to extend privacy protections to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations like the EU. This legislative action became crucial following the CJEU's ruling invalidating the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate data protection. The CJEU invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement in 2015 due to inadequate data protection, citing U.S. surveillance programs as a major concern. The Judicial Redress Act was introduced to address European concerns and strengthen confidence in the new \"Privacy Shield\" agreement. The Judicial Redress Act, passed in the U.S., aims to address European concerns about data protection and strengthen confidence in the Privacy Shield agreement. It includes provisions related to information transfer in a law enforcement context and specifies conditions for its applicability to citizens of certain countries. The Judicial Redress Act, signed into law in February 2016, aims to address European concerns about data protection and strengthen confidence in the Privacy Shield agreement. The EU warmly welcomed the act's enactment, stating that it will pave the way for the signature of the U.S.-EU Data Protection and Privacy Agreement (DPPA). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported that daily arrivals from Europe to U.S. ports of entry include 30,000 passengers and over 3,000 commercial containers. The U.S. and EU have collaborated on border control, aviation, and maritime security, with agreements on information exchange and biometric identifiers for travel document security. The process for the DPPA to enter into force involves approval from EU member states and the European Parliament, which could take several months. The United States and the EU have collaborated on improving aviation and cargo security, as well as global supply chain security. They have pledged to strengthen security measures worldwide and have worked on finding a balance between border security and facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, the US and EU have implemented measures to enhance aviation security. Recent incidents, such as the 2009 underwear bomb attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot, have reignited discussions on air cargo security. In July 2014, the US tightened rules for carrying electronic devices. The US and EU have implemented measures to enhance aviation security since the 2001 terrorist attacks. In July 2014, the US tightened rules for carrying electronic devices on international U.S.-bound flights due to fears of terrorist threats. The two sides have worked together to bridge gaps in their policies regarding transatlantic flights. In 2008, the US and EU agreed on coordinating air cargo security measures, including 100% screening of cargo on passenger flights. In 2012, they reached an air cargo security partnership to eliminate duplication of security controls. The US and EU have agreed on an air cargo security partnership to recognize each other's security regimes, eliminating duplication of controls. This will enhance cargo security, save time and money for operators, improve transatlantic shipments, and exchange information on security regime evolution. EU operators can meet the US requirement for 100% cargo screening on passenger planes bound for the US. European operators are working to meet the U.S. requirement for 100% cargo screening on passenger planes bound for the United States. Despite a commitment to cooperation, differences in perspective exist. Some EU countries hesitated to install body scanners at airports due to privacy and health concerns. However, the European Parliament supported the use of body scanners at EU airports with privacy safeguards in place. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with privacy safeguards, including producing stick figure images only. The scanners are voluntary, with passengers able to opt for a manual search. The European Commission adopted these conditions for common standards, but deployment is not mandatory for member states. Some EU officials are concerned about the use of body scanners at U.S. airports due to the high number of European visitors. Some EU officials and European Parliamentarians have expressed concerns about body scanners at U.S. airports, especially regarding privacy and health issues. In January 2013, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration announced the removal of full-body scanners that produce revealing images by June 2013. The remaining scanners at U.S. airports will only produce generic body images, with most using millimeter wave technology instead of low-dose x-rays. Members of Congress and European Parliament have both raised privacy concerns about the revealing body scanners. The EU and U.S. have had concerns about body scanners violating privacy rights. After a plot involving liquid explosives in 2006, restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage were implemented. The EU planned to lift these restrictions by 2013, but U.S. officials questioned the effectiveness of liquid-screening technology. In 2013, EU airports introduced liquid screening equipment. US policymakers raised concerns about the technology's effectiveness and opposed easing liquid and gel restrictions. Some EU governments and airlines also worried about security and potential flight delays. The EU postponed the 2013 deadline for lifting restrictions but aims to end all restrictions by January 2016. In January 2014, duty-free liquids and gels were allowed in cabin baggage as a first phase towards this goal. In April 2004, the US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord to extend the US Container Security Initiative (CSI) throughout the EU. CSI stations US customs officers in foreign ports to pre-screen maritime cargo containers for dangerous substances. In May 2012, the US and EU agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to improve supply chain security for trusted traders designated by either the US C-TPAT program. The US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord in April 2004 to extend the US Container Security Initiative throughout the EU. In May 2012, they agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs for trusted traders designated by either the US C-TPAT program or the EU's AEO regime. This agreement aims to speed up customs procedures for trusted traders, lower costs, simplify procedures, and allow customs authorities to focus on risky consignments while facilitating legitimate transatlantic trade. EU officials opposed a provision in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 that required scanning all containers bound for the US for nuclear devices, citing concerns about trade disruption and financial burdens on EU ports and businesses. In May 2012, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extended the 100% scanning deadline by two years, citing concerns about cost and effectiveness. Proponents argue for full implementation, stating that current manifest data is insufficient for identifying high-risk cargo. The U.S. and European authorities disagree on the effectiveness of current manifest data for determining high-risk cargo. Tensions arise over the U.S. Visa Waiver Program and the EU's desire for equal application to all member states. New EU members seek inclusion in the VWP for visa-free travel to the U.S., but face challenges meeting requirements. Calls for full visa reciprocity between the U.S. and EU persist, especially from central and eastern European countries. In July 2007, Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53), which included changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to strengthen security and allow more EU members to qualify. Concerns were raised post-9/11 about security risks, as terrorists with European citizenship had exploited the VWP to enter the United States. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) strengthened the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by setting security and passport standards for participant countries. It required biographical information submission through ESTA for visitors entering the US under the VWP. The Act allowed the US Department of Homeland Security to waive admission requirements for new EU member states to join the VWP. Currently, 23 out of 28 EU member states are part of the VWP, with the EU urging the US to admit the remaining five members soon. The EU has implemented a reciprocity mechanism to achieve full visa reciprocity with the US and other countries exempt from EU visa requirements. The European Commission may suspend visa-free travel for a third country's citizens if full reciprocity is not met, but no suspensions have occurred yet. The next assessment is due in April 2016. US officials are concerned about the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and its implications. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) is a concern for US officials due to reports of Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for transatlantic commerce and tourism, but has implemented enhanced security measures for VWP travelers. The next assessment of the VWP is due in April 2016. The Obama Administration implemented enhanced security measures for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) following the November 2015 attacks in Paris. Changes included capturing past travel to terrorist safe havens in ESTA and evaluating cooperation with VWP countries. Congress was also involved in discussions regarding VWP security. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was enhanced in response to the 2015 Paris attacks. Legislation passed in December 2015 prohibits certain individuals from VWP entry and mandates security measures for all participant countries. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was enhanced in response to the 2015 Paris attacks, with legislation mandating security measures for participant countries. In February 2016, DHS expanded VWP travel restrictions to individuals who visited Libya, Somalia, and Yemen since March 1, 2011. EU officials are concerned about the new requirements, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. Many European policymakers question the effectiveness of new legislation for the Visa Waiver Program, stating it may impact legitimate travelers more than detecting clandestine terrorist travelers. U.S. officials mention exemptions for government and military personnel, with the Secretary of DHS having authority to waive exclusions on a case-by-case basis. EU leaders warn of potential reciprocal measures, while Members of Congress express concerns about the provisions in the new VWP. The possibility of reciprocal measures, such as restricting visa-free travel to Europe for U.S. citizens, has raised concerns among Members of Congress. Legislation has been introduced to eliminate VWP restrictions on dual nationals, aiming to prevent discrimination based on ethnicity. U.S. and European officials emphasize the importance of balancing freedom and security without compromising civil liberties and human rights standards. The treatment of suspected terrorist detainees has been a point of tension between the U.S. and Europe, with criticism of U.S. policies such as Guantanamo Bay, military commissions, and enhanced interrogation techniques. European media focused on extraordinary rendition and CIA detention facilities in Europe, leading to investigations by the European Parliament. The presence of CIA detention facilities in Europe and the treatment of individuals held at Guant\u00e1namo sparked investigations by European bodies. European leaders criticized U.S. detainee and interrogation policies as violating international law and human rights values, impacting efforts to counter terrorism. The Bush Administration defended these policies as crucial in the fight against terrorism. The Bush Administration defended its detainee and rendition policies as crucial in the fight against terrorism, denying allegations of human rights violations. They acknowledged European concerns about Guant\u00e1namo and sought agreements with foreign governments to accept detainees deemed too dangerous to release. U.S.-EU tensions over detainee policies eased with the Obama Administration, which announced plans to close Guant\u00e1namo and banned torture. EU officials welcomed these initiatives. Obama's executive order banned torture and initiated a review of Bush Administration legal opinions on detention and interrogation methods. The U.S. State Department appointed a special envoy in 2009 to close the detention facility, facing challenges in persuading countries to accept detainees cleared for release. Some EU members accepted released detainees, while others declined. Congressional opposition and restrictions hindered the Obama Administration's efforts to close Guant\u00e1namo. The Obama Administration faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to Congressional opposition and restrictions. In March 2011, an executive order created indefinite detention for dangerous detainees. Concerns about released detainees engaging in terrorist activity led to a freeze on new military commission trials. European policymakers worry that Guant\u00e1namo serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups. European policymakers are concerned about Guant\u00e1namo serving as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups and the well-being of detainees. In 2013, the European Parliament expressed worry for hunger-striking detainees and urged the US to close the facility. President Obama renewed his commitment to shutting down Guant\u00e1namo, and in December 2013, Congress eased restrictions on transferring low-risk detainees to other countries. Obama called it a \"welcome step\" towards closing the detention facility. President Obama signed a bill into law to close the Guant\u00e1namo detention facility, urging Congress to lift restrictions on transferring detainees to US prisons for trial. Congress maintained restrictions but required a plan for closure. Obama sent a proposal to Congress in February 2016 and called for cooperation to close the facility before the end of his term. As of February 2016, 91 detainees remain at Guant\u00e1namo out of almost 800 individuals detained since 2002. Since early 2002, 147 detainees have been resettled overseas during the Obama Administration, with 91 detainees remaining at Guant\u00e1namo as of February 2016. European concerns persist regarding the past involvement of European governments in U.S. terrorist detainee policies. The European Parliament has been vocal in investigating the role of EU member states in hosting alleged CIA detention facilities and aiding CIA flights related to terrorism suspects. In February 2015, the European Parliament passed a resolution directing member states to fully investigate the existence of CIA detention facilities on their territories and disclose relevant information on suspected CIA rendition flights. The European Parliament passed a resolution in February 2015 directing member states to investigate CIA detention facilities on their territories and disclose information on suspected rendition flights. The resolution also called for the US to investigate and prosecute human rights violations related to CIA programs. Some officials worry about allegations of US wrongdoing and criminal proceedings against CIA officers in EU states. Some U.S. and European officials fear that allegations of U.S. wrongdoing and criminal proceedings against CIA officers in EU states could jeopardize U.S.-European intelligence cooperation against terrorism. Despite initial concerns, U.S. Administrations have supported enhancing U.S.-EU collaboration since the 2001 attacks. Improved cooperation on border controls and transport security was seen as beneficial. Improved U.S.-EU cooperation on border controls and transport security is seen as beneficial for tracking suspected terrorists and preventing them from entering the United States or finding sanctuary in Europe. However, differences in competencies and policy preferences between the EU and the United States can complicate counterterrorism efforts. The United States and the EU prefer bilateral negotiations on certain issues like the Visa Waiver Program, leading to potential frictions. Despite occasional tensions, both are committed to closer cooperation in counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. U.S.-EU collaboration against terrorism is crucial in combating threats from citizens fighting with Islamist groups. Aviation and cargo security, border control measures, and visa policy are key issues for Congress affecting future cooperation. Control measures, visa policy, and intelligence-gathering reforms are key issues for Congress that could impact U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. The Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 was passed to strengthen security controls in response to concerns about European foreign fighters. Changes to U.S. surveillance laws will be closely monitored in Europe, with potential implications for future collaboration. EU officials have welcomed these efforts. EU officials have welcomed the U.S. Judicial Redress Act as a positive step towards the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement. The European Parliament's influence in counterterrorism areas may be shaped by Members of Congress engaging in dialogue on surveillance issues. In late 2013, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner and Senator Chris Murphy engaged in dialogue with European Parliamentarians on U.S. surveillance practices, emphasizing the importance of U.S.-European relations. In recent years, Members of Congress and European Parliamentarians have shown interest in strengthening ties and cooperation between the two bodies through the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD), which brings them together twice a year to discuss foreign policy and economic issues. This exchange could enhance transatlantic dialogue on counterterrorism issues."
