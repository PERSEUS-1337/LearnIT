    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. Tactical aircraft are crucial for U.S. military capability and defense spending. Efforts focus on three main aircraft acquisition programs: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. Congress faces decisions in FY2010 regarding these programs, such as whether to terminate the alternate engine development for the F-35 and whether to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft. The report discusses the proposal to terminate the alternate engine program for the F-35, deciding on ending F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, and funding requests for F/A-18E/Fs in FY2010. It also covers program-specific issues for the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs in detail. The CRS reports RL30563, RL31673, and RL30624 discuss FY2010 legislative activity on U.S. tactical aircraft, focusing on affordability and the future of the U.S. industrial base. Tactical aircraft are combat planes that operate within a regional theater of operations without in-flight refueling. Aircraft are categorized as tactical or strategic based on their range and mission capabilities. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters and attack planes, operate within a single regional theater of operations. In contrast, strategic aircraft like B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers are designed for longer-range missions, including intercontinental flights. Tactical aircraft are primarily used for air-to-air combat, with some air-to-ground capabilities. Fighters (e.g., F-22) are for air-to-air combat, while strike fighters (e.g., F-35) have dual roles in air-to-ground and air-to-air operations. Attack planes (e.g., A-10) focus on air-to-ground missions. Tactical aircraft, or tac air, operate from land bases for Air Force and carriers for Navy, with Marine Corps using both. Marine Corps tactical aircraft, including VSTOL and STOVL planes, operate from Navy ships, land bases, and expeditionary bases with short runways. They are used for air-to-air combat, air-to-ground missions like close air support and interdiction, and deep strike operations. Strike fighters can engage in both air-to-air and air-to-ground operations. The Air Force and Navy operate various tactical aircraft for air-to-air and air-to-ground operations. The Air Force has F-22, F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft, while the Navy has F/A-18A-D and F/A-18E/F fighters. The Marine Corps operates F/A-18 A-D and AV-8B VSTOL planes. In early 2009, the DOD had around 3,500 tactical aircraft in its inventory. In early 2009, the DOD had approximately 3,500 tactical aircraft, with 2,375 in the Air Force and 1,125 in the Navy and Marine Corps. Modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, F-22 fighter, and F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. The F-35 is being procured for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy as a cost-effective fifth-generation strike fighter. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, with plans to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is getting the F-35A to replace F-16s and A-10s, while the Marine Corps is getting the F-35B as a replacement. The F-35 program includes different variants for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The Air Force is receiving the F-35A to replace older aircraft, while the Marine Corps is getting the F-35B as a replacement. The Navy is procuring the F-35C for carrier operations. The proposed FY2010 budget includes funding for the procurement of 30 F-35s. The F-22 fighter, known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities. The F-22 fighter, also known as the Raptor, incorporates stealth, supercruise, thrust-vectoring, and integrated avionics. Procurement of F-22s began in FY1999, with a total of 187 aircraft procured through FY2009. The administration plans to end procurement at 187, with no additional funding requested in FY2010. Supporters aim for 243 to 250 aircraft. The F/A-18E/F, or Super Hornet, is a Navy strike fighter, considered a fourth-generation aircraft. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornets are fourth-generation aircraft that incorporate some fifth-generation technology. They are a core part of the Navy's aircraft carrier air wings, with over 40 Hornets and Super Hornets in each wing. The Navy has been procuring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The administration requested funding for nine F/A-18E/Fs in FY2010. Air Force officials projected a fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials projected a strike fighter shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. The projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall could peak at over 100 aircraft by 2018, possibly exceeding 200. Some question the Air Force's 800-aircraft shortfall projection, suggesting it's influenced by assumptions on military threats and organizational constraints rather than actual warfighting needs. The peak size of the shortfall depends on service life extensions for Hornets and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. On May 18, 2009, the Air Force announced a plan to retire 249 older aircraft. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan in 2009, accelerating the retirement of 249 older tactical aircraft to generate savings for other program needs. This plan includes retiring 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and three A-10s, but not the five fighters proposed in the FY2010 budget submission. The goal is to fund a smaller and more capable force for higher priority missions. The Combat Air Forces restructuring plan aims to retire 250 older aircraft, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, to create cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five years. This will allow for a more flexible and lethal transition to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley emphasized the importance of converting legacy fighters into a smaller, more capable force for higher priority missions. The Combat Air Forces restructuring plan aims to retire 250 older aircraft, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, to create cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five years. Air Force officials plan to invest most of the funds in advanced capability modifications to remaining fighters and bombers, procure munitions for joint warfighters, and sustain critical intelligence capabilities. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz emphasized the importance of modernizing the fighter force to maintain an advantage over potential adversaries. The Air Force Chief of Staff emphasizes the need to modernize the fighter force to maintain an advantage over potential adversaries. The Combat Air Forces restructuring plan involves retiring older aircraft to create cost savings and invest in advanced capabilities for remaining fighters and bombers. The plan includes reassigning manpower to priority missions such as surveillance operations and nuclear deterrence. The Air Force is making adjustments to its aircraft fleet, including adding a fourth B-52 squadron and expanding capabilities for combatant commander support in Afghanistan and Iraq. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to revitalizing the nuclear enterprise and deploying 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11. Congress is concerned about the affordability of modernizing the tactical aircraft force. The affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing the tactical aircraft force has been a long-standing concern in Congress and elsewhere. Observers fear a budget \"train wreck\" as funding may not be sufficient for tactical aircraft acquisition. The issue was previously focused on the affordability of the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, but as production of the F-22 and F/A-18E/F decreases, the focus may shift to the affordability of the F-35 program. DOD aims to increase F-35 procurement to 130 aircraft per year by 2014-2015. DOD plans to increase F-35 procurement to 130 aircraft per year by 2014-2015, including 80 F-35As for the Air Force and 50 F-35Bs and Cs for the Marine Corps and Navy. Reductions in planned aircraft acquisitions were made through post-Cold War adjustments and integration of Navy and Marine Corps strike fighter inventories. The F-35 program is a major initiative to limit tactical aircraft modernization costs. The F-35 program aims to reduce costs for developing, procuring, and operating U.S. tactical aircraft through the acquisition of a versatile strike fighter. However, the affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plan is uncertain, especially considering potential budget constraints and projected fighter shortfalls for the Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plan is uncertain due to potential budget constraints and projected fighter shortfalls. This could lead to funding tradeoffs between tactical aircraft acquisition programs and other non-aircraft systems or aircraft that can perform similar missions. Examples include surface-to-air missile systems, surface-to-surface missiles, long-range bombers, and helicopters. Some argue for less funding on tactical aircraft and more on long-range aircraft due to regional anti-access threats. This includes comparing funding for tactical aircraft against other aircraft like airlift, refueling tankers, electronic attack, surveillance, and control aircraft. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans is part of a larger concern about overall DOD affordability. DOD plans to prioritize funding for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) over traditional tactical aircraft like the F-22 and F-35A. This shift is aimed at enhancing U.S. capabilities for irregular warfare operations, including counterinsurgency efforts and precision attacks on terrorist targets. The administration's proposal to prioritize funding for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) for irregular warfare operations, such as counterinsurgency efforts and precision attacks on terrorist targets, over traditional land-based Air Force tactical aircraft like the F-22 and F-35A, as well as sea-based Navy and Marine Corps tactical aircraft acquisition programs like the F/A-18E/F and F-35Bs and Cs. This includes ending F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focusing on the F-35A for future Air Force tactical aircraft procurement. The DOD is considering tradeoffs in funding for procurement of F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs versus service life extensions or new models of older-design tactical aircraft like upgraded F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18A-Ds. These tradeoffs involve complex questions of costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility. The U.S. military is reviewing its goals and objectives in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), focusing on preparing for irregular warfare operations and conventional interstate conflict. The need for high-capability tactical aircraft is being questioned in the post-Cold War era. In the post-Cold War era, the U.S. military is reevaluating its need for high-capability tactical aircraft due to the shift towards irregular warfare operations and conventional interstate conflict. Some argue for reduced procurement of these aircraft in favor of investing in UAVs, special operations helicopters, and other equipment, while others believe large numbers of high-capability tactical aircraft are still necessary to counter potential threats from Russian aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. Companies may soon market advanced aircraft and SAMs to potential adversaries, despite the end of the Cold War. Recent acquisitions by China and India raise concerns about challenging U.S. airpower. Large numbers of advanced aircraft are seen as crucial for operational success in future conflicts. The Government Accountability Office examined DOD's investment planning for modernizing its tactical fighter and attack aircraft force portfolio. The Government Accountability Office's report in April 2007 highlighted the challenges in modernizing the tactical fighter and attack aircraft force portfolio. The military services plan to spend $109.3 billion on acquiring 570 new tactical aircraft and modernizing existing ones over the next 7 years. However, cost increases, schedule delays, and changing requirements have led to reduced procurement quantities of new aircraft. The F-22A development period doubled, unit costs more than doubled, and the number of aircraft the Air Force can procure has declined. Similar challenges are emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), which is crucial for future modernization efforts. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is essential for future modernization efforts, but development costs have increased by $31.6 billion since 2004, with procurement schedules slipping. Uncertainty about new systems costs and deliveries makes planning and implementing modernization efforts challenging. Legacy systems must be sustained until new systems are ready to replace them, requiring more money if new aircraft quantities are reduced or deliveries delayed. Funding needs for new and legacy aircraft are interdependent for ensuring a capable and sufficient total force. The services are investing an average of about $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications over the next seven years, with pent up demands for billions more in unfunded requirements. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft must be made soon. DOD lacks a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft, leading to difficulty in determining capability gaps and duplication of capability. Each military service operates largely independently without an integrated DOD-wide view of requirements. The military services struggle to determine capability gaps and duplication of capability due to operating independently without an integrated view of requirements. They have underperformed in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities, and future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels. Individual service plans rely on unrealistic assumptions about cost, quantity, and funding levels. The military services struggle with unrealistic assumptions about funding levels and delivery schedules for new acquisitions. GAO recommends DOD take decisive actions to shorten cycle times in developing and executing plans for tactical air forces. GAO recommends DOD take decisive actions to shorten cycle times in developing and delivering new tactical aircraft and develop an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. CBO conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of the fighter force under DOD's fiscal year 2009 plans and compared alternative approaches to modernize fighter forces. The CBO study compared alternative approaches to modernize fighter forces, including options to satisfy inventory requirements, maintain weapons capacity with fewer aircraft, or replace portions of the fighter force with longer-range aircraft. The report highlighted the potential for significant capability increase with modernized fleets equipped with state-of-the-art aircraft offering technological advances like increased payload capacity and greater stealth capabilities. The DoD's fiscal year 2009 procurement plans may lead to fighter inventories falling below stated goals, but new aircraft offer technological advances like increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities for enhanced survivability. Despite potential offset by adversaries' capabilities, aggregate capabilities are expected to improve due to the enhanced lethality and survivability of the new fighters. The DoD's fiscal year 2009 procurement plans may lead to fighter inventories falling below goals. Alternative approaches like purchasing upgraded legacy aircraft could offer short-term relief and cost savings, but with lesser capability improvements compared to JSFs. Forces with a mix of fighters and attack aircraft would provide improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Forces with a mix of fighters and attack aircraft could offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs can impact employment levels in the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry. Decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs can impact employment levels in the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry. The reduction of active prime contractors for tactical aircraft production could limit competition, potentially affecting innovation, pricing, schedule adherence, and production quality in the future. Congress may need to consider the implications of having only one prime contractor for tactical aircraft production. The text discusses the importance of having multiple tactical aircraft prime contractors to support U.S. military needs and the value of competition in development and procurement. It also raises questions about how decisions on tactical aircraft programs could impact U.S. export earnings and the aerospace industry's international competitiveness. Legislative activity for FY2010 related to tactical aircraft modernization is presented. The section presents legislative activity for FY2010 regarding tactical aircraft modernization. Section 133 of H.R. 2647 requires DOD to report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. The report must detail the number of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft for procurement from 2011 to 2025. The report on 4.5 generation fighter aircraft procurement includes the number of aircraft needed to maintain 2,200 tactical fighter aircraft, estimated procurement costs for single and multiyear contracts, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a comparison of costs and benefits between annual and multiyear procurement. The report discusses the availability and feasibility of F-35s for Air National Guard recapitalization and recommendations on authorizing a multiyear procurement contract for 4.5 generation fighter aircraft. If authorized, the Secretary must submit required certifications to Congress. The budget for fiscal year 2011 includes a definition of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft with advanced capabilities. Section 1032 requires a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects detailed analyses on the fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The QDR report discusses factors informing decisions on fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, including threat capabilities, modeling simulations, unmanned aerial vehicles, and operational risks. Section 1047 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft until a report is submitted to Congress. Section 1047 of the Combat Air Forces Restructuring plan prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft until a report is submitted to Congress. The Secretary of the Air Force is also restricted from reassigning personnel associated with the restructuring plan. The Combat Air Forces Restructuring plan prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft until a report is submitted to Congress and restricts the reassignment of Air Force personnel. At least $344,600,000 from the operations and maintenance funds and $10,500,000 from the procurement funds are allocated for the continued operation and maintenance of 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. A detailed plan must be submitted to Congress outlining the force structure. The report on Combat Air Forces Restructuring must be submitted to Congress, detailing the plan to address force structure and capability gaps, assessment of threat environment, follow-on mission assignments, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, personnel reassignment, and funding needed for fiscal years 2010-2015. The report on Combat Air Forces Restructuring must be submitted to Congress, detailing the plan to address force structure and capability gaps, assessment of threat environment, follow-on mission assignments, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, personnel reassignment, and funding needed in fiscal years 2010-2015. The sense of Congress regarding Navy carrier air wing force structure is also expressed in Section 1051. Section 1051 of the report expresses Congress's findings on Navy carrier air wing force structure, stating the requirement for not less than 10 carrier air wings with at least 44 strike fighter aircraft each. Despite the potential benefits of fifth-generation assets, the majority of strike fighter aircraft in carrier air wings will not be fifth-generation for the foreseeable future. The House Armed Services Committee report emphasizes the need for not less than 10 carrier air wings with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft each, even if the number of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced. The majority of strike fighter aircraft in carrier air wings will not be fifth-generation assets. The House Armed Services Committee report expresses concerns about the Air Force's plans to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-16s, and 3 A-10s. The committee is worried about potential gaps in force structure and capability as replacement aircraft are still being tested and not yet available. Additionally, they are concerned about the lack of identified follow-on missions for affected bases. The committee has identified $143.7 million in unjustified program growth in the Air Force operation and maintenance. The committee has identified $344.6 million in unjustified program growth in the Air Force operation and maintenance budget. They recommend using these funds to maintain 249 legacy fighters slated for retirement in fiscal year 2010 until reporting requirements are met. Additionally, $10.5 million is recommended for necessary aircraft modifications. The committee recommends using $10.5 million for aircraft modifications to sustain 249 fighter aircraft. The Air Force projects a shortfall of approximately 800 fighter aircraft by 2024, which could impact future mission requirements. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report on this issue. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report by March 1, 2010, addressing the \"fighter gap\" issue with alternative solutions for long- and short-term, including accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters, interim procurement of \"4.5 generation\" fighters, and fleet management options. The report should analyze the impact of any shortfalls on the Air National Guard and the air sovereignty alert mission. The report must include a detailed analysis of the effect that any shortfalls will have on the Air National Guard and the air sovereignty alert mission specifically, including the loss of Air National Guard flying missions throughout the United States and the resultant loss of Air National Guard pilot and maintenance capability. The committee is concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with potential peak strike-fighter shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018, which is deemed unacceptable. The committee is concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike-fighter shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to the shortfall include decisions to reduce F/A-18A through D inventory, delays in the F-35B/C program, and early service life expiration of F/A-18A through D aircraft. The committee emphasizes the importance of viewing naval strike-fighter shortfalls in the context of overall Department of Defense strike-fighter inventory to support carrier air wings effectively. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall and recommends a multi-year procurement contract for cost-effectiveness. This provision authorizes the purchase of additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft. The Secretary of the Navy is authorized to enter a multi-year procurement contract for more F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft. Congress recommends maintaining at least ten carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighters each. A report is requested to evaluate extending the service-life of F/A-18A through D aircraft versus procuring additional F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee expresses concern about the Navy facing a significant aircraft inventory gap as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. They are disappointed that the Navy has not provided a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's aircraft inventory gap due to retiring older F/A-18A-D Hornets before the F-35C variant is available. The Navy failed to provide a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated. The committee questions the Navy's projections of a shortfall in tactical aircraft and believes the Navy has not taken effective action to address the increased projected gap. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's failure to address the increased projected shortfall in the Department of the Navy's tactical air fleet, which poses potential risks to national security. The Navy's delay in taking action raises concerns about security risks, reliance on costly service life extension programs for legacy aircraft, and lack of consideration for long-term fiscal responsibility. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's failure to address the increased projected shortfall in the Department of the Navy's tactical air fleet. The Navy is relying on costly service life extension programs for legacy aircraft, such as extending the life of select legacy F/A-18s from 8,600 to 10,000 flight hours through a SLEP. It is unclear how many planes are capable of reaching 10,000 flight hours even with a SLEP. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's plan to extend the life of legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a costly SLEP. The committee questions the efficiency of this plan compared to procuring new F/A-18E/F aircraft, which could cost less and provide more flight hours per dollar. The Senate Armed Services Committee questions the Navy's plan to extend the life of legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a costly SLEP. They suggest evaluating the costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements, which offer improved technological capabilities over legacy aircraft. The Navy projects the F/A-18E/F will remain in the fleet until at least 2040. The Navy plans to extend the life of legacy F/A-18s through a costly SLEP, but the Senate Armed Services Committee questions this approach. They suggest evaluating the benefits of purchasing new F/A-18E/Fs, which offer improved technological capabilities and are projected to remain in the fleet until at least 2040. The Department of Defense will review tactical aircraft forces in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review, including analyzing multiyear procurement for the F/A-18 and comparing cost differentials between single year and multiyear strategies. The committee expects the Department to consider tradeoffs between SLEP and new procurements of the F/A-18E/F in implementing the results of the ongoing Quadrennial Defense Review on tactical aviation procurement. The committee expects the Department of Defense to base tactical aviation procurement strategies on the Quadrennial Defense Review. Addressing the strike-fighter shortfall is urgent, as highlighted in the testimony before the committee. A provision in H.R. 2647 requires a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft, while another section mandates a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review. The House report on H.R. 2647 highlighted the findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, including the need for a report on 4.5-generation fighter aircraft procurement. Sections 1075 and 1076 of the bill address the Air Force's fighter aircraft retirement and Navy carrier air wing force structure, respectively. Section 131 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The report will detail the number of aircraft needed, estimated procurement costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost-benefit analysis. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The report will detail the number of aircraft needed, estimated procurement costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost-benefit analysis. The report will also discuss the availability and feasibility of procuring F-35 aircraft to re-capitalize the Air National Guard from 2015 to 2025. The term \"4.5 generation fighter aircraft\" refers to current fighter aircraft with advanced capabilities and the ability to deploy advanced armaments. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report on the force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, including analyses supporting the findings and any changes to minimum military requirements for major military capabilities. This report must be delivered concurrently with the report on the 2009 quadrennial defense review. SEC. 1075 of the report prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft and reassignment of Air Force personnel until a report is submitted by the Secretary of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from reassigning any Air Force personnel associated with a restructuring plan until a detailed report is submitted to the Committees on Armed Services. The report must address force structure and capability gaps, current threat environment assessment, follow-on mission assignments, criteria for base and fighter selection for retirement, environmental analyses, and base identification. The report must include criteria for base and fighter selection for retirement, environmental analyses, reassignment and manpower authorizations, funding needed for operation and maintenance costs, and cost avoidance estimates for the restructuring plan. The text discusses the requirement for the Department of the Navy to maintain 11 operational aircraft carriers and 10 carrier air wings, each composed of 44 strike-fighter aircraft. The sense of Congress is in support of this commitment. The sense of Congress supports the Navy's requirement for 10 carrier air wings, each with 44 strike-fighter aircraft. Congress and the Secretary of the Navy are urged to ensure this requirement is met until modifications are justified. The conference report supports the Air Force's investment strategy to transition to a smaller, more flexible, and capable strike fighter force. It expects the Air Force to analyze the possibility of procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract and submit a proposal to Congress if conditions are met. The conferees intend for the Air Force to analyze the potential purchase of additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft with advanced capabilities and armaments. This provision does not alter existing requirements under Section 2306b of title 10, United States Code. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided to Congress regarding the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. They directed that reports stipulated in the House-passed version of the Fiscal Year 2010 Defense Authorization Act be transmitted to the Defense Appropriations Committees. The Committee is concerned about the Air Force proposal to remove F-15 pilot training from Tyndall Air Force Base and directs the Department to provide a cost benefit analysis within 180 days. The analysis should include factors impacting training quantity and quality at Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field in Oregon. The Committee requests a report on F-15 training quantity and quality at different locations, including training synergies, airspace access, and simulator training access. The report should also identify where F-15 Basic Crew Chief Training, Air Control Squadron Training, and Intelligence Formal Training will be established and maintained. Additionally, the Department is asked to identify airfields with shared runways for Air Force and commercial operations within the continental United States and provide analysis on the training and operational mission impacts at these bases. The Committee requests an independent review on the impact of the restructure on the Nation's combat air forces. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to provide reports on air force policy and analysis of training impacts at bases with shared runways. No funds may be obligated on executing the Combat Air Force restructure until all reports are submitted. The report addresses the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to sustained overseas operations. The Department of the Navy is facing a critical shortfall in its strike fighter inventory, with over 200 aircraft now needed due to sustained overseas operations and delays in the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. Last year, the shortfall was predicted to peak at 125 aircraft in fiscal year 2017. The Navy is facing a shortfall of over 200 aircraft, mainly due to issues with extending the life of older F-18 aircraft. Despite this, the production line for the F/A-18E/F variant is still open and producing cost-effective aircraft. The procurement strategy for fiscal year 2010 has shifted to standalone, annually priced purchases. The Navy is facing a shortfall of over 200 aircraft, mainly due to issues with extending the life of older F-18 aircraft. The procurement strategy for fiscal year 2010 has shifted to standalone, annually priced purchases. The Committee believes the Navy is missing out on savings by not entering into a multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft. They recommend $108,000,000 above the request for a five-year, 150 aircraft multi-year procurement for the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends a multi-year procurement strategy for F/A-18E/F and EA-18G programs to address the Navy's strike fighter shortfall. An additional $495,000,000 is allocated for the procurement of nine F/A-18E/F Aircraft. The shortfall is currently estimated to be at least 129 aircraft due to aging F/A-18 models and delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends a multi-year procurement strategy for F/A-18E/F and EA-18G programs to address the Navy's strike fighter shortfall. An additional $512,280,000 is allocated for the procurement of nine F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010. The Senate approved an amendment prohibiting the Air Force from retiring any tactical aircraft until a detailed plan is submitted to fill force structure and capability gaps. The Air Force must submit a detailed plan to fill force structure and capability gaps resulting from the retirement of tactical aircraft before any early retirement can take place, as mandated by an amendment approved by the Senate. The Air Force must submit a detailed plan to fill force structure and capability gaps resulting from the retirement of tactical aircraft before any early retirement can take place, as mandated by an amendment approved by the Senate.
