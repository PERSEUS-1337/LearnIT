    "content": "The Howard M. Metzenbaum ``Menu Education and Labeling Act'' or the ``MEAL Act'' is the short title of this legislation. Congress acknowledges the strong link between diet and health, with diet-related diseases starting early in life. Increased caloric intake is a key factor contributing to the rise in obesity rates in the United States, with two-thirds of American adults being overweight or obese. Obesity poses risks such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, costing the US $117 billion annually. Over the past 2 decades, there has been a significant increase in meals eaten outside the home, with a third of calories and half of food dollars spent on restaurant food. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the US. Heart disease costs $142 billion annually in healthcare and lost productivity. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires food manufacturers to provide nutrition information on packaged foods, but restaurant foods are exempt unless a nutrient content or health claim is made. Approximately 75% of adults use food labels on packaged foods, leading to healthier diets. Consumers want nutrition information at restaurants to make informed decisions about their food choices, as studies show it can influence their purchasing decisions. Surgeon General and Secretary of Health recommend increased availability of nutrition information to reduce obesity rates. SEC. 3. NUTRITION LABELING OF STANDARD MENU ITEMS AT CHAIN RESTAURANTS.
