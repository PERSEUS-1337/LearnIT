    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. Recent concerns have led to proposals to amend FISA and the practices of the FISC, focusing on the selection process for FISA court judges. The FISC is an Article III court established by Congress to issue orders related to foreign intelligence investigations. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and their salaries cannot be diminished during their terms in office to ensure impartial administration of the laws. The FISC is authorized to issue orders for foreign intelligence investigations, including electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen register/trap and trace device use, and access to business records. The FISA Court of Review can review FISC denials. Judges serve seven-year terms and are designated by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The FISC has 11 district court judges, while the FISA Court of Review has three judges selected from district or circuit courts. Some critics argue that the process of selecting FISA judges, designated by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, is too partisan and should be altered. Bills introduced in the 113th Congress propose changes such as transferring selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts or allowing the President to choose FISA judges with Senate advice and consent. The 113th Congress introduced bills proposing changes to the selection of FISA judges, including transferring authority to chief judges of circuit courts or allowing the President to choose with Senate advice and consent. The constitutionality of these proposals, shifting selection away from the Chief Justice, has raised concerns from the judicial branch. The report reviews the constitutional method for appointing Article III judges, discusses the process of \"designation,\" and explores how the constitutionality of these proposals may be assessed by a reviewing court. The report examines proposals to shift designation authority for appointing Article III judges away from the Chief Justice to other officials in different branches of government. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates the appointment process for principal officers, including judges of the Supreme Court and other Article III judges. The constitutionality of these proposals is being questioned, as they involve significant authority under the laws of the United States. The Appointments Clause requires principal officers to adhere to its strictures, exercising significant authority under U.S. laws. If Congress expands an office's duties, a second appointment may not be necessary if the new duties are related to the original post, as seen in Weiss v. United States. The principle of \"germaneness\" allows for increased powers and duties without requiring a second appointment. Based on the Weiss v. United States case, Congress can increase the power and duties of an existing office without requiring a new appointment. The Supreme Court has addressed the constitutionality of designations within the judicial branch, allowing for federal judges to serve in separate positions. Congress has a history of using designations for Article III courts and giving the Chief Justice authority to assign judges to other federal courts. The creation of specialized tribunals, like the now-defunct Commerce Court, allowed Congress to vest the Chief Justice with authority to designate federal judges. This process, seen in cases like McDowell v. United States, has been upheld by the Supreme Court. Lower federal court judges also have designation authority, with the Commerce Court's Chief Justice-based model influencing future specialized courts like the FISA courts. The Supreme Court has upheld the authority of the Chief Justice to designate federal judges, as seen in cases like McDowell v. United States and Lamar v. United States. This process involves statutory construction and does not violate the Appointments Clause. The Supreme Court has upheld the Chief Justice's authority to designate federal judges, rejecting arguments that it violates the Appointments Clause. Courts have also upheld the constitutionality of the process for designating FISA judges. The court has upheld the Chief Justice's authority to assign federal judges, including FISA judges, to specialized courts. Proposals to change the selection process for FISA judges raise questions about constitutionality. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act would disperse selection authority among chief judges of circuit courts and the Chief Justice. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes to disperse the selection process for the FISC among the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice. It would increase the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would have the final authority in designating district court judges to the FISC, with input from chief judges of the circuit courts and associate justices of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice would have the final authority in designating district court judges to the FISA courts under the proposal, with input from other judicial officials. Judicial precedent suggests that Congress has the power to authorize others within the judicial branch to designate judges, as seen in the McDowell case. The proposal suggests giving the Chief Justice final authority to designate district court judges to the FISA courts, with input from other judicial officials. Judicial precedent from the McDowell case indicates that Congress has the power to authorize others within the judicial branch to designate judges. The McDowell case was based on an 1871 statute that may not support providing chief judges with broader designation authority. Other proposals include shifting the authority to designate FISA court judges to the President. The Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761) proposes giving the President authority to \"designate\" judges for the FISC and FISA Court of Review, potentially constituting a second constitutional appointment. This arrangement raises questions about the FISA courts' status as Article III courts due to the judges' seven-year terms instead of life tenure. The FISA judges are appointed for seven-year terms, unlike Article III judges who have life tenure. There is a debate on whether serving on the FISA courts affects a judge's overall Article III status and protections. A proposal to allow the President to select federal judges for the FISA courts raises separation-of-powers concerns. The proposal to vest authority in the President to select federal judges for the FISA courts raises separation-of-powers concerns regarding executive encroachment on the judiciary's independence. However, the Mistretta v. United States case established that the President can appoint judges to certain judicial branch agencies without undermining judicial duties. The President's power to select federal judges for FISA courts may raise separation-of-powers concerns if it allows for coercive influence, compromising judges' impartiality. Proposals suggest vesting designation authority with congressional leadership to address these concerns. The FISA Court Accountability Act proposes allowing congressional leadership to make designations to the FISC and FISA Court of Review, which could raise concerns under the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles. The FISA Court Accountability Act proposes congressional designations to the FISC and FISA Court of Review, raising legal concerns under the principles of I.N.S. v. Chadha regarding legislative acts altering legal rights without proper approval."
