The agreement was concluded in late 2015 and signed in February 2016. Congress played an active role in the negotiations, and implementing legislation would be required for the TPP to take effect in the U.S. The TPP agreement, concluded in late 2015 and signed in February 2016, would require implementing legislation from Congress to take effect in the U.S. Proponents argue that the TPP's significance goes beyond economic benefits, encompassing strategic aspects that aim to strengthen U.S. influence in the region and beyond. The TPP aims to strengthen regional alliances, maintain U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance national security, liberalize trade, drive economic growth, and establish trade rules consistent with U.S. interests. China's economic rise is a key factor in analyzing U.S. influence in the region. China's rapid economic growth has positioned it as a key trade partner in Asia, leading to initiatives that some view as an attempt to diminish U.S. influence in the region. The TPP is seen as a way for the U.S. to maintain leadership in Asia and establish trade norms, with differing opinions on whether it should be framed as a response to Chinese initiatives. The TPP, seen as a response to Chinese initiatives, may create negative perceptions of U.S. intentions. U.S. and Chinese trade goals may actually complement each other. Balancing economic and political elements in trade agreements can be challenging for policymakers. Critics argue that focusing on the strategic aspects of the TPP distracts from its economic impact. The report examines strategic arguments for and against the TPP, focusing on its potential impact on the U.S. economy and broader foreign policy goals. It also highlights the challenges policymakers face in balancing economic and political elements in trade agreements. The United States has advanced trade agreements like FTAs to promote foreign policy goals, with some agreements driven by political solidarity or security objectives. The Obama Administration emphasized the geostrategic importance of trade policy initiatives in Asia, such as the TPP. The Obama Administration emphasized the geostrategic importance of trade policy initiatives in Asia, particularly the TPP, as a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader. The Administration's National Security Strategy highlighted the need to shape a global economic order reflecting U.S. interests and values, stressing the importance of setting new rules of the road and promoting inclusive development. Failure to approve the TPP could weaken the U.S. rebalancing strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP agreement is seen as crucial for the U.S. to maintain its leadership role in Asia. Administration officials argue that it signals active integration into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures. Many in the Asia-Pacific region support the agreement for its wider strategic implications. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized the strategic significance of the TPP in May 2015, stating that its completion would strengthen links across the Pacific. Proponents believe that the agreement is essential for the U.S. to enhance regional institutions and promote cooperation through respect for rules and norms. National Security Advisor Tom Donilon also highlighted the importance of U.S. economic diplomacy in advancing global prosperity by upholding international trade rules and norms. The TPP is seen as crucial for advancing global prosperity and strengthening international rules and norms. Proponents argue that it will reinforce U.S. alliances in East Asia, but critics question how it will enhance security partnerships in the region. A successful TPP deal would boost U.S. security partnerships in the region. Critics argue that bilateral political and security relationships are more influenced by countries' security interests than by trade agreements. The KORUS FTA and TPP are not seen as major factors in determining the strength of alliances like U.S.-South Korea and U.S.-Japan. The future of U.S. security partnerships in the region is not heavily dependent on trade agreements like the KORUS FTA or TPP. Japan's strategic decisions drive its cooperation with the U.S., while the TPP may have a larger impact on countries like Vietnam, encouraging market-oriented reforms and closer ties with the U.S. The approval of the TPP by Vietnam could signal closer ties with the United States and impact perceptions of reliability. Proponents believe the agreement will help promote a global order reflecting U.S. interests and values, including a rules-based trading system. The link between TPP's trade rules and security relationships is less clear but could indirectly affect them. Implementing the TPP could strengthen U.S. security relationships in the Pacific by signaling key partnerships and priorities, while a failure to do so may be seen as a decline in U.S. interest and leadership in the region. A failed TPP in the United States could signal a decline in U.S. interest and leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, creating an influence vacuum that China may fill. This could lead to questioning of U.S. credibility in Asia, especially with challenges from China's rise and North Korea's capabilities. Rejection of the TPP agreement by Congress could strain relationships and cooperation between the United States and Japan. The rejection of the TPP agreement by Congress could strain relationships and cooperation between the United States and Japan, leading to a period of mutual recriminations and loss of trust. The TPP's failure may also impact U.S. influence on regional and global trade efforts, potentially allowing China to fill the influence vacuum in the Asia-Pacific region. Asia-Pacific nations are urged to align with the preferential access of TPP members in key markets like the US and Japan. The goal of the TPP is to update trade rules and address new barriers, aiming to influence future negotiations and fill gaps in existing rules. The US aims to modernize the rules-based trading system through multilateral engagement, building on its post-WWII efforts to promote economic growth through trade liberalization. The United States played a key role in liberalizing trade through GATT and establishing the WTO. The current WTO Doha Round has stalled, leading to a focus on new trade rules for digital trade and state-owned enterprises through bilateral and regional agreements. The United States has pursued new trade rules and liberalization through agreements like the TPP, which aims to create an economically significant bloc of nations. The TPP's economic significance could grow as new countries join and domestic reformers use it as political cover to push forward with their own agendas. The TPP aims to create an economically significant bloc of nations, with incentives for reforms to gain access to the U.S. market. Proponents believe it will promote U.S. goals like worker rights and environmental protection. The agreement could draw interest from other countries, leading to further trade liberalization. However, some note that major Asian economies like China, India, and Indonesia are not part of the TPP. The TPP aims to create an economically significant bloc of nations, with incentives for reforms to gain access to the U.S. market. Some experts argue that the TPP's influence may depend on whether new members seek to join it in the future, with several large Asian countries expressing interest in joining a \"second round\" of TPP members. Many Asian nations face domestic opposition to joining TPP, as do some current TPP parties debating ratification. Many Asian nations and current TPP parties face domestic opposition to joining the TPP. Analysts suggest that countries like South Korea and Colombia may be likely to seek entry in the near future. Proponents believe that mega-regionals like the TPP could influence multilateral negotiations and set new trade rules beyond existing WTO commitments. Critics argue that bilateral and regional trade negotiations may divert attention from the WTO. New trade barriers could impact future WTO negotiations, potentially hindering multilateral initiatives. Shifting focus away from the WTO may undermine its legitimacy and dampen its role in trade liberalization. Mega-regionals could complicate the trading system with differing rules, contrasting with the multilateral approach of the WTO. TPP negotiations are part of various ongoing trade talks in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP negotiations are part of ongoing trade talks in the Asia-Pacific region, which may differ from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations. RCEP would include ASEAN members and six other nations in a collective FTA, while the United States has not shown interest in joining. Potential differences between RCEP and TPP can be seen in the ASEAN trade agreements and finalized TPP components. The finalized TPP includes more comprehensive trade liberalization measures compared to ASEAN trade agreements. The TPP also covers intellectual property rights, investment, labor, environmental provisions, and disciplines on state-owned enterprises, which may not be addressed in RCEP. Some view RCEP as an alternative or challenge to the TPP, while others believe both agreements can complement each other for regional economic growth. Seven countries are part of both RCEP and the TPP, indicating a potential for compatibility and synergy. The RCEP and TPP agreements may affect each other and the existing trade architecture in the region, especially for the countries that are members of both. The timing of ratification and implementation processes for the TPP and RCEP will play a crucial role in determining their impact. All 12 TPP countries and 11 RCEP countries are also part of the APEC forum, which aims for open and free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. The APEC forum aims for open and free trade in the Asia-Pacific region. China's inclusion in the TPP and RCEP agreements could impact the region's trade architecture. The TPP and RCEP's ratification timing will determine their influence. President Obama and TPP proponents argue completing the TPP is strategically important due to China's growing international influence. The proposed TPP is seen as a way for the United States to counter China's regional influence and shape economic development in line with U.S. interests. The agreement's size and economic importance are believed to help influence China's actions in the region. The TPP aims to influence China's economic and diplomatic decisions in favor of U.S. interests by setting enforceable standards and norms. It could prompt China to liberalize its trade regime and potentially join the agreement, providing political cover for reformers within China. China is urged to further liberalize its economic and trade regime to potentially join the TPP. Arguments suggest that portraying China as an outlier in regional economic development may not accurately reflect its influence on regional trade rules. Concerns are raised that using the TPP to constrain Chinese interests could lead to responses detrimental to U.S. interests. Additionally, China's economic initiatives in the region are seen as beneficial for overall economic development. China's leaders aim to strengthen their nation economically and militarily to become a respected global power. They are pursuing policies to boost their economy and enhance their global role, emphasizing the importance of a strong economy, defense, and global influence. Other Asian nations are unlikely to adopt policies that do not align with their interests, regardless of whether they are American, Chinese, or otherwise. If the United States is perceived as obstructing regional development initiatives in Asia, it risks being seen as an obstacle to progress in the region. China is pursuing policies to strengthen its economy and increase its global role through initiatives like the \"One Belt, One Road\" project, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and promoting the overseas use of the renminbi. These efforts aim to facilitate trade, foster economic development, and enhance China's influence on the global stage. China's efforts to increase the overseas use of the renminbi aim to simplify transactions, reduce commercial risk for Chinese companies, and enhance China's global economic stature. Chinese leaders also seek to reform multilateral institutions and promote regional rules and norms through initiatives like the RCEP and FTAAP. The establishment of the AIIB offers an alternative model for multilateral development banks. The AIIB was established as an alternative model for multilateral development banks, like the ADB, but it is uncertain if it will be distinct from or aligned with existing international institutions. China's efforts to reshape economic institutions are mirrored in diplomatic and security spheres to reduce U.S. influence, such as refashioning CICA into a new Asian security system. China's actions include extensive reclamation efforts. China is working to establish a new Asian continental security system to counter the U.S. alliance network and is reclaiming disputed reefs in the South China Sea to challenge U.S. naval power in the Western Pacific. China's views on the TPP have evolved over time, with initial portrayals of the agreement as U.S.-dominated and aimed at isolating China. President Obama clarified that the TPP was not intended to contain or disadvantage China. China's views on the TPP have evolved over time, with initial portrayals of the agreement as U.S.-dominated and aimed at isolating China. President Obama clarified that the TPP was not intended to contain or disadvantage China. China's criticisms of the U.S. role in the TPP process softened after Japan joined the talks. Chinese officials have expressed openness to negotiations on the TPP, with China's Vice Finance Minister stating that an agreement would be incomplete without China. U.S. officials have welcomed China to join the TPP. FTA arrangements can play a positive role in fostering a just and free international and regional trade order. U.S. officials have expressed willingness for China to join the TPP, although Chinese officials have concerns about implementing the standards. President Obama mentioned China's interest in participating in the TPP. Analysts believe the U.S. aims to integrate China more deeply into trade liberalization and establish new rules not covered by the WTO. This could subject China to higher standards and discourage attempts to weaken trade rules. One former Obama Administration official argues that the TPP could subject China to new, higher-standard rules and discourage attempts to weaken trade rules. The United States is negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China to boost investment flows and potentially join the TPP. Congress has played a direct role in guiding TPP negotiations and will have a role in considering and implementing the agreement. The TPP agreement is part of a broader foreign policy strategy to promote respect for international rules in the Asia-Pacific region. Proponents argue that it will reinforce U.S. leadership, encourage economic and political reform, and strengthen diplomatic and security goals. The TPP agreement aims to reinforce U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, promote economic and political reform, and encourage a more U.S.-supportive foreign policy outlook among nations. Congress should consider the strategic implications of the agreement and how it aligns with broader foreign policy goals. The TPP agreement aims to reinforce U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region and promote economic growth. The strategic benefits of the agreement depend on its ability to drive prosperity and attract more nations to join. The balance between trade liberalization and U.S. economic interests is a key consideration for supporters of the agreement. The TPP agreement aims to reinforce U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region and promote economic growth. Congress must consider the implications of failed ratification on U.S. leadership and influence in the region. Delays or failure to ratify could set back these goals and impact foreign governments' views on U.S. leadership and credibility. The TPP agreement aims to reinforce U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region and promote economic growth. Congress must consider the implications of failed ratification on U.S. leadership and influence in the region. Some urge the U.S. to engage economically with countries outside the TPP to avoid neglecting them. Congress should assess if current economic initiatives in Asia are enough to further U.S. influence or if additional initiatives are needed to show commitment to the region. The TPP agreement aims to reinforce U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region and promote economic growth. Congress must consider whether other economic initiatives are advisable to show commitment to the region. Analysts have mixed views on how \"mega-regional\" negotiations may impact the multilateral trading system. Congress may need to assess if the proposed TPP will further eventual WTO multilateral trade. The proposed TPP agreement may impact countries not involved in negotiations and Congress must consider its effect on global trade liberalization. Congress may need to seek new global trade initiatives to ensure the TPP does not shift focus away from the WTO."
