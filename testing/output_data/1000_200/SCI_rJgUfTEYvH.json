Recent works have explored probabilistic models, but they are computationally expensive or do not optimize data likelihood directly. This study introduces multi-frame video prediction using normalizing flows, enabling direct data likelihood optimization and high-quality stochastic predictions. The approach models latent space dynamics and demonstrates the effectiveness of flow-based generative models in video prediction. Flow-based generative models offer a competitive approach to video generative modeling, leveraging exponential progress in computational hardware capabilities. Machine learning advancements have led to improvements in various fields, such as image classification, machine translation, and game-playing agents. However, the application of machine learning has been limited to scenarios with ample supervision or accurate environment simulations. An alternative to supervised learning is using large unlabeled datasets with predictive generative models to build an internal representation of the world. This approach allows for the training of complex generative models on plentiful video sequences without labeled examples. Large generative models can be trained on large unlabeled datasets with video sequences to learn about real-world phenomena. These models can be used for downstream tasks or directly in applications like robotics for predicting the future. The challenge in video prediction is the high uncertainty of future outcomes. Existing probabilistic models are either computationally expensive or do not optimize data likelihood directly. This paper addresses the problem of uncertain future prediction. In this paper, the focus is on stochastic prediction, particularly in conditional video prediction. The proposed video prediction models aim to generate diverse stochastic futures with accurate and realistic video frames by extending flow-based generative models into the realm of conditional video prediction. This approach allows for exact likelihoods and high-quality video frame synthesis.

Additionally, VideoFlow optimizes the likelihood of training videos directly, allowing for evaluation based on likelihood values. VideoFlow is a flow-based model for conditional video prediction that competes with state-of-the-art models on the BAIR dataset. It focuses on deterministic predictive models and architectural changes to improve performance. Building on deterministic predictive models, the challenge now is to address stochastic environments in video representations. Real-world videos are inherently stochastic, requiring models to effectively reason over uncertain futures. Various methods, including variational auto-encoders, have been used to incorporate stochasticity in modeling these environments. Various approaches have been used to incorporate stochasticity in video prediction models, including variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, and autoregressive models. Among these, variational autoencoders have been widely explored for optimizing log-likelihood. Auto-regressive models are the only class that directly maximizes log-likelihood, generating videos pixel by pixel. However, synthesis with these models is typically sequential. The text discusses the limitations of sequential synthesis in video prediction models and introduces a proposed VAE model that produces better predictions with faster sampling. The model utilizes a multi-scale architecture and autoregressive latent-dynamic prior for improved long-term predictions.

Actnorm applies a learnable per-channel scale and shift with data-dependent parameters. The proposed generative flow model for video utilizes a multi-scale architecture with invertible transformations to maximize log-likelihood. The determinant for triangular and diagonal Jacobian matrices is the product of diagonal terms. Various operations like Actnorm, Coupling, SoftPermute, and Squeeze are applied to manipulate the input data for efficient flow operation.

VideoFlow models the Stochastic Movement Dataset, where shapes move in eight directions with constant speed. A deterministic model averages out all directions, allowing for predicting shape positions using only the previous step. Random temporal patches of 2 frames are extracted and used to maximize loglikelihood with VideoFlow. The model uses VideoFlow to predict the future trajectory of shapes in videos by looking back at just one frame. It achieves a low bits-per-pixel of 0.04 on the holdout set. Comparisons with other models are made using a real vs fake test on Amazon Mechanical Turk. VideoFlow outperforms baselines in a real vs fake Amazon Mechanical Turk test by generating plausible \"real\" trajectories at a higher rate. The model uses unsupervised video generation on a robot pushing dataset, training on 3 input frames to predict 10 target frames. Bits-per-pixel for VideoFlow is 1.87, SAVP-VAE is \u2264 6.73, and SV2P is \u2264 6.78. VideoFlow outperforms SAVP-VAE and SV2P models in bits-per-pixel on a robot pushing dataset by training on 3 input frames to predict 10 target frames. The model ensures all models have seen a total of 13 frames during training and uses importance sampling to estimate the variational bound on the test set. The high bits-per-pixel values of the baselines are attributed to their optimization objective, which does not directly optimize the variational bound on the log-likelihood. Stochastic video generation models are evaluated based on PSNR, SSIM, and VGG perceptual metrics, with the best sample chosen for each metric. The BAIR robot-pushing dataset is highly stochastic, with each generated video representing a plausible future. The BAIR robot-pushing dataset is stochastic, generating realistic videos that may not match the ground truth. Evaluation metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and cosine similarity are used to compare generated videos to the ground truth. In prior work, researchers effectively tune pixel-level variance as a hyperparameter to improve sample quality and training stability in video models. By removing pixel-level noise, higher quality videos can be generated at the cost of diversity. Sampling videos at a lower temperature can achieve this, similar to a procedure in another study. For a network with additive coupling layers, frames can be sampled with a temperature scaling factor applied to the latent gaussian distribution. Results are reported with both a temperature of 1.0 and the optimal temperature. In prior work, researchers tune pixel-level variance to improve video sample quality and training stability. Sampling videos at a lower temperature can achieve higher quality but lower diversity. Results show that applying a temperature scaling factor to the latent gaussian distribution improves performance on VGG-based similarity metrics. Our model with temperature T = 1.0 performs well on VGG-based similarity metrics and competes with state-of-the-art video generation models. VideoFlow, which models the conditional probability of frames, underperforms on PSNR. Diversity and quality of generated samples are assessed by computing mean distances in VGG perceptual space and conducting real vs fake tests. VideoFlow shows higher diversity values. VideoFlow outperforms diversity values from prior work and competes well in realism. At T = 0.6, it has the highest fooling rate and is on par with VAE models in diversity. Lower temperatures result in less random arm behavior and clearer background objects, leading to higher realism scores. Higher temperatures produce more stochastic arm motion, increased diversity, but noisier background objects. Interpolations between different shapes are displayed in Figure 6. In Figure 6, interpolations between different shapes are displayed using the BAIR robot pushing dataset. The motion of the arm is interpolated in a cohesive manner between initial and final positions. Multi-level latent representation is used to interpolate representations at specific levels while keeping others fixed. The bottom level interpolates background object motion, while the top level interpolates arm motion. Shapes with fixed type but varying size and color are encoded. In the experiment, shapes with fixed type but varying size and color are encoded into the latent space. The size of the shape smoothly interpolates, and colors are sampled from a uniform distribution. VideoFlow is used to detect the plausibility of temporally inconsistent frames in the future. Our VideoFlow model can generate 100 frames into the future with temporal consistency, even in the presence of occlusions. The latent state z t is limited to storing information from frame x t, leading to potential forgetting of occluded objects. Future work aims to address this by incorporating longer memory in the model. Our VideoFlow model uses memory-efficient techniques and a recurrent neural network to detect the plausibility of future frames. By conditioning on the first three frames of a video, we compute the likelihood of a frame occurring in the future. The model assigns decreasing log-likelihood to frames further in the future, as shown in our findings.
