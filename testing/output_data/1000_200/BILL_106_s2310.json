    "content": "The \"Firearms Dealer Penalty Flexibility Act of 2000\" allows for the suspension of a firearms dealer's license and imposes civil penalties. Section 923 of title 18, United States Code, allows the Secretary to suspend or revoke a license or impose civil penalties up to $10,000 for willful violations related to armor-piercing ammunition transfers. The Secretary has the authority to revoke a dealer's license or impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for willful transfer of armor-piercing ammunition. The Secretary can also compromise, mitigate, or remit liability for violations. Actions taken by the Secretary can only be reviewed as provided in subsection (f), which outlines the rights of applicants and licensees in case of denial, revocation, suspension, or penalty assessment. The Secretary can deny, revoke, suspend a license, or impose a civil penalty under this section. The affected party must receive written notice stating the grounds for the action, and for license revocation or suspension, the notice must be given before the effective date. An appeal process is available, including a hearing for denied applications or penalties assessed. Upon request, the Secretary will hold a hearing to review denials, revocations, suspensions, or civil penalties. If the decision is not reversed after the hearing, the aggrieved party will be notified. The Secretary provides notice of the decision to the aggrieved party, who can file a petition for judicial review within 60 days. The district court may consider any evidence in the judicial proceeding. The court may consider evidence submitted by parties in a petition for judicial review. If the court finds the Secretary's action unauthorized, they will order compliance with the court's judgment. The court may stay the suspension or revocation of a license or civil penalty pending an appeal under this section. Section 925(b) of title 18, United States Code, is amended to terminate a firearms dealer's license upon felony conviction."
