    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion for DHS in FY2013, a slight decrease from the previous year. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a net discretionary appropriation of $39.514 million for DHS for FY2013. The Senate bill approved a net discretionary appropriation of $39,514 million for DHS for FY2013, excluding overseas contingency operations and disaster relief. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments, providing a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS for FY2013, 27% below the requested level. The Senate approved a $39,514 million appropriation for DHS for FY2013, while the House passed a bill with a $39,114 million appropriation, 27% below the requested level. The President signed a continuing resolution into law to fund government operations through March 27, 2013, at an annualized rate of $1.047 trillion. The FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law as P.L. 113-6, allocated $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security. After two across-the-board cuts, the discretionary budget authority was reduced by $52.4 million, leaving $38.348 billion available for DHS to use. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security had $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority from P.L. 113-6 after sequestration. Data for FY2012 is from President's Budget Documents, H.Rept. 112-492, and S.Rept. 112-169. Information on FY2013 is from President's Budget Documents, DHS Congressional Budget Justifications, and Budget in Brief. Funding levels post-sequester are from U.S. Senate explanatory statement. The final resolution of FY2013 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security comes from P.L. 113-6 and the Senate explanatory statement. Post-sequester funding levels are from the DHS Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. Historical funding data is from the President's Budget request documents. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles. Title I of DHS appropriations includes funding for OSEM, USM, CFO, CIO, A&O, and OIG. Title II covers CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and Secret Service. Title III funds NPPD, OHA, and FEMA. Title IV funds USCIS, S&T, and FLETC. Title IV of the DHS appropriations bill includes funding for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC). The bill's structure may vary between House and Senate versions, with additional titles added for special issues like emergency appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). Differences in subcomponents and accounts were noted in the proposed FY2013 appropriations bills. The structure of subcomponents and accounts varied in the proposed FY2013 appropriations bills. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process, with Congress setting overall spending totals in the first stage and appropriations committees allocating discretionary funds in the second stage. In the second stage of the congressional budget process, appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds to subcommittees for each appropriations bill. These allocations, known as 302(b) allocations, must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made during the year by the Appropriations Committee. The FY2012 appropriations bills were impacted by the Budget Control Act, which set spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013. The Budget Control Act (BCA) established discretionary spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with separate caps for security and nonsecurity spending. For FY2013, security spending was capped at $686 billion, while all other spending was capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. The BCA allows for adjustments to cover funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud and abuse control. The Budget Control Act established discretionary spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with separate caps for security and nonsecurity spending. For FY2013, security spending was capped at $686 billion, while all other spending was capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. The Act allowed for adjustments to cover funding for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud and abuse control. In the absence of a budget resolution for FY2013, these levels became the basis for enforcement in the Senate and the House. The Budget Control Act also established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan, triggering an automatic spending reduction process when legislation was not enacted by the deadline. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established discretionary spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with separate caps for security and nonsecurity spending. The Act also created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan. The Budget Control Act triggered a sequestration process for FY2013, requiring across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act made significant changes to the procedures in the BCA for FY2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA), enacted on January 2, 2013, made significant changes to the Budget Control Act (BCA) procedures for FY2013. The joint committee sequester date was delayed to March 1, 2013, with a $24 billion reduction in the sequester amount. President Obama ordered the sequester implementation, leading to budget authority cancellations at the program level. Sequestration was applied to discretionary spending caps for FY2013 and FY2014. The sequestration implemented during a temporary continuing resolution will result in reductions apportioned throughout the fiscal year. The post-sequestration numbers in the report are based on the FY2013 DHS operating plan. Sections 3001 and 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aim to eliminate any excess budget authority beyond FY2013 discretionary spending limits. The Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent legislation aim to reduce excess budget authority beyond FY2013 discretionary spending limits. DHS falls under the \"security\" category and receives a 0.1% across-the-board cut to align with spending limits. The Office of Management and Budget has the final say on exceeding these limits. After the Budget Control Act of 2011, additional rescissions were calculated by OMB for security and nonsecurity budget authority at the program level. Cuts were intended to reduce discretionary budget authority, excluding funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief under the Budget Control Act. All tables and funding references in the report include CRS calculations of these across-the-board cuts. Table 2 displays DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013, compared to FY2012 and the President's FY2013 request. Three justifications from the Budget Control Act have influenced DHS's appropriations process, with two not being limited - emergency spending and overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror. No adjustments were made for emergencies in FY2012, but $258 million was allocated for Coast Guard overseas contingency operations. Disaster relief adjustments are limited under the BCA, determined by OMB using a specific formula. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determines the allowable adjustment for disaster relief under the Budget Control Act (BCA) using a specific formula. For FY2013, the allowable adjustment was $11,779 million, fully exercised including $6,400 million in pre-sequestration resources through the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 113-6. Table 3 summarizes funding in the FY2012 regular DHS appropriations bill, the Administration's FY2013 request, and the final DHS appropriations legislation in Division D of P.L. 113-6. The final DHS appropriations legislation included in Division D of P.L. 113-6 prior to sequestration impact. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for civilian federal employees, which was rejected by the House, resulting in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise, but neither P.L. 112-175 nor P.L. 113-6 provided resources for it. Unlike other appropriations bills, breaking down the DHS bill by title does not offer much transparency. The DHS appropriations bill in P.L. 113-6 did not include resources for a civilian pay raise. Breaking down the bill by component does not provide transparency into DHS's budget allocation. Table 4 and Figure 1 show DHS's budget authority for FY 2013 by component size. Figure 1 includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas operations, but not general provisions like rescissions. The DHS appropriations bill in P.L. 113-6 did not include resources for a civilian pay raise. The bill's general provisions include rescissions of prior-year budget authority, reducing the net budget authority. The discretionary budget authority provided in P.L. 113-6 is scored against the bill's budget allocation, with additional resources available under adjustments to the discretionary budget cap. However, Figure 1 does not fully represent the resources available to individual DHS components, as much of DHS's budget is not from discretionary appropriations. The DHS budget is not solely funded through discretionary appropriations. Components like TSA and CIS rely on fee income for a significant portion of their activities. Less than 4% of CIS's budget comes from direct appropriations. A comparison of the Administration's FY2013 budget request and enacted budget shows the breakdown of discretionary appropriations, mandatory appropriations, and adjustments under the Budget Control Act. This highlights the non-appropriated resources that contribute to the DHS budget. The FY2013 enacted funding for DHS includes amounts from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. Table 5 shows DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation or sequestration. The data may differ from congressional documents. The House and Senate marked up the DHS appropriations bill in May 2012, with P.L. 113-6 being the second-latest enactment of annual appropriations for the department. Figure 3 illustrates the history of the bill's progression through the legislative process. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 went through various stages in the legislative process. The requested funding for Title I was $1,279 million, but after cuts, it was reduced to $1,026 million due to sequestration. The House and Senate proposed different funding levels, with the final amount being 4.1% below FY2012. The operating plan for DHS for FY2013 indicates sequestration reduced funding to $1,026 million, 4.1% below FY2012. Table 6 lists enacted amounts for components of Title I for FY2012 and FY2013, House and Senate appropriations, and post-sequester levels of available resources reported by DHS. The departmental management accounts cover general administrative expenses of DHS, including the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management, Under Secretary for Management, and its components. The Department of Homeland Security's operating plan for FY2013 shows a reduction in funding due to sequestration. The Office of the Secretary and Executive Management, along with 12 entities reporting directly to the Secretary, are included in the departmental management accounts. The Administration typically requests funding for consolidating its headquarters. A graphic representation in the report displays the discretionary appropriation provided to each DHS element, allowing for easy comparison with previous years' funding levels. The FY2013 request for Department of Homeland Security management activities included increases for OSEM, OCFO, and OCIO, with a total request of $724 million. The Administration also requested $134 million for OSEM, with separate line items proposed for specific offices. The budget proposed separate line items for three offices\u2014the Office of International Affairs, the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement, and the Private Sector Office. Two program changes funded through this request were for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman: $135,000 for a training program and over a million dollars for policy advice and investigations related to ICE programs. The Administration requested $222 million for the USM and 902 full-time employee equivalents (FTEs), with several program changes proposed under this appropriation. The budget includes increases for various offices: $441,000 for Directives function transfer to OUSM, $26 million for OCHCO salaries and expenses, $10 million for HR IT, $5 million for Nebraska Avenue Complex improvements, and $55 million for OCFO, including $6.7 million for Financial Systems Modernization for FEMA in FY2013. The Administration requested $313 million for the OCIO at FEMA in FY2013 to implement a new financial system for accurate resource tracking. Within the OCIO account, $122 million was requested for Infrastructure and Security Activities, including $65 million for data center migration activities. H.R. 5855 proposed appropriations that were lower than the President's request for OSEM and USM. The House Appropriations committee recommended lower appropriations for various management activities compared to the President's request. The total funding for Title I was $627 million, a decrease of $97 million or 13.4%. These reductions were justified by the committee due to the need to cover unrealized funding proposals and failure to comply with statutory requirements. Amendments were offered during floor consideration of the bill on June 6, 2013. During floor consideration of the bill on June 6, 2013, amendments were offered to decrease funds for departmental management accounts. The amendments that passed would have reduced the budget for management by almost $33 million, with the largest reductions for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management. During floor consideration of the bill on June 6, 2013, amendments were passed to reduce funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $10 million and increase funds for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology by $10 million, as well as to reduce funds by $5 million for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management and increase funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million. These changes would have left the USM with $41 million less than the requested level. The Office of Policy and activities related to the visa waiver program faced amendments during House consideration on June 6, 2012. Representative Flake proposed reallocating funds to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries and Expenses by $43,000. Additionally, provisions withheld $71 million from obligation until required reports were submitted. A general provision proposed restricting the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft until key reports were provided to Congress. Funding of $5 million was proposed to be withheld until a final overseas aircraft repair station security regulation is published. More than $124 million would have been withheld from obligation until all required reports are submitted. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $7 million for failure to comply with the statutory requirement to submit a comprehensive acquisition report on time. Additionally, over $29 million would have been withheld from obligation under the OCFO account. The House Appropriations Committee recommended withholding over $29 million from obligation until all required reports are submitted on time. The Committee also emphasized the need for direct communication from relevant components regarding their areas of responsibility. The Office of the Chief Information Officer would receive a recommended appropriation of $242 million, allocated to salaries and expenses as well as other expenses. The House recommended an appropriation of $242 million for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, with $117 million for salaries and expenses and $125 million for development and acquisition of IT equipment. Additionally, $27 million was allocated for Information Technology Services and $55 million for Security Activities. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed slightly lower appropriations compared to the President's request. The Senate-reported bill proposed appropriations for departmental management, with decreases in funding for various offices compared to the President's request. The total funding would have been $655 million, representing a 9.5% decrease. The Senate committee also recommended an increase in funding for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes. The Senate committee recommended a decrease in funding for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, despite an increase in immigration efforts to comply with civil rights statutes. Funding for reception and representation expenses was also reduced in recognition of budget constraints. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding reductions for various offices within the Department of Homeland Security to focus resources on critical operational missions, including oversight of major acquisitions, workforce development, and security measures. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer would receive $35 million, $1 million below the request, with a reduction in salaries and expenses. The Office of the Chief Information Officer would receive $248 million, with $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology through FY2015. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $248 million appropriation for the Department of Homeland Security, with $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments overseen by the OCIO. This includes $57 million for IT equipment, software, and services, and $65 million for data center migration. The committee noted that data center consolidation could result in nearly $3 billion in savings by 2030. The appropriations for various offices were reduced compared to the President's request. The President's request for Department of Homeland Security funding included reductions for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO. The total funding provided by the law for departmental management is $643 million, a decrease of $170 million from the request. Only OCIO faced a funding reduction due to sequestration. 2 USC 903 outlines a crediting mechanism to reduce sequestration for activities with lower appropriations. See Table 7 for more funding details. The FY2013 appropriation for the Department of Homeland Security was below the baseline calculated by OMB. P.L. 113-6 included directives for the DHS CIO to submit a multi-year investment and management plan for IT projects funded under the CIO or through reimbursable agreements. The Senate also directed the Secretary to report travel costs and submit a contingency plan for user fee collections. The Secretary must submit a contingency plan to address gaps in user fee collections mandated in the FY2010 DHS appropriations report, with a revised plan due within 90 days of enactment. The USM is required to submit a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report (CASR) with the President's FY2014 budget proposal and provide quarterly updates to the appropriations committees. DHS must report on the balanced workforce strategy implementation and justify any insourcing or outsourcing initiatives in the annual budget request. The CFO will continue to provide semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization. The CFO will provide semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization efforts. Table 7 outlines funding levels for existing management accounts, reflecting spending cuts but not the impact of sequestration. The DHS Plan column shows budgetary resources available after sequestration, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate impacts. House and Senate Appropriations committees identified issues, including the Administration's proposal for separate line items under OSEM. The Appropriations committees accompanying H.R. 5855 and S. 3216 raised concerns about the Administration's proposal for separate line items under OSEM for three offices, new revenue assumptions in the department's budget, late submission of required plans and reports, and departmental conference spending. The proposal to create separate line items for the Office of International Affairs, Office of State and Local Law Enforcement, and Private Sector Office was rejected during the legislative process. None of these offices are led by Senate-confirmed individuals. The proposal to create separate line items for the Office of International Affairs, Office of State and Local Law Enforcement, and Private Sector Office was rejected during the legislative process. The House committee stated that the proposal is inconsistent with streamlining the department and reducing administrative overhead. The Senate committee noted that DHS has not provided a compelling rationale for these offices to be standalone entities. The Senate committee report criticized DHS for not providing a compelling rationale for the standalone offices that report to the Secretary. The Administration's budget proposed three legislative measures to increase DHS's budget resources, but the House rejected them while the Senate approved all three. The House committee expressed concerns about the President's budget assumptions regarding new revenue and the potential shortfall from the proposed aviation security fee increase. The Senate committee report criticized DHS for budget assumptions and potential shortfall from aviation security fee increase. The Committee rejects unrealistic budgeting and warns of additional reductions in Department requests. The House committee report expressed concern about late submission of required plans and reports by the Department, withholding funding as a result. P.L. 113-6 allowed CBP to start pilot projects for reimbursable agreements for customs services. The Department's failure to comply with Congressional direction was highlighted in the report. The Department has been severely late in responding to Congressional direction, failing to submit required reports on time. This non-compliance is unacceptable as investment and expenditure plans are crucial for DHS to protect the American people and maintain fiscal responsibility. Many plans have been late, incomplete, or not submitted at all, including expenditure plans that should have been submitted at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Department has been late in submitting required reports and plans, with many being more than three months overdue. The Senate proposed withholding 59% of budgets until all reports are submitted on time, while the House reduced the USM budget to the point that 70% would have been withheld if provisions became law for FY2013. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of budgets. House floor action reduced the USM budget significantly, with 70% potentially withheld if provisions became law for FY2013. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of budgets until all reports and plans are submitted. The House committee report highlights the need for better oversight of expenditures, requiring the Office of Inspector General to assess compliance with federal laws on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs. New provisions on conference spending were also included. The House and Senate bills included provisions for better oversight of expenditures, requiring reports on conference spending and employee awards programs. The Senate provision also restricted the use of grants or contracts for unrelated conferences and mandated compliance with government-wide spending directives. Section 3003 of Division G of P.L. 113-6 required government-wide reporting on conference costs. The House and Senate bills included provisions for better oversight of expenditures, requiring reports on conference spending and employee awards programs. Section 3003 of Division G of P.L. 113-6 mandates government-wide reporting on conference costs and limits the number of employees that can attend overseas conferences. The House would limit attendance to 50 DHS employees unless it's a law enforcement conference, while the Senate would cap attendance at 50 employees per DHS component unless it's deemed important to national interest. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 45 locations in the Washington, DC area, leading to inefficiencies and high costs. A $3.4 billion plan aims to create a unified DHS headquarters. The Department of Homeland Security and General Services Administration approved a $3.4 billion master plan to create a new DHS headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia. $1.4 billion from DHS budget and $2 billion from GSA will fund the project. $1,366 million has been invested so far, with Phase 1A nearing completion. Some DHS functions in the DC area will not move to the new facility, with efforts to consolidate offices for cost-saving purposes. The Administration has requested $89 million for activities related to the St. Elizabeths DHS headquarters project, including funding for a highway interchange to handle increased traffic. This infrastructure element is not traditionally funded through Homeland Security appropriations but through the General Services Administration or Department of Transportation budgets. Additionally, $24.5 million was requested for the Coast Guard's move to its new facility. The Administration requested $24.5 million for the Coast Guard's move to a new facility in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange or St. Elizabeths project through the Homeland Security bill. The committee suggested providing the requested funding for the Coast Guard's move and an additional $10 million for the project from the Coast Guard's construction budget. The Committee recommends no new construction funding in the bill for new Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion, $89,000,000 below the request. Funding is included in the Coast Guard appropriation for the move to St. Elizabeths. Additional funding under Coast Guard construction is allocated for project completion, site access improvement, and planning adjustments. The Department is exploring lease modifications due to delays in permanent headquarters construction. USM is actively exploring options to modify or consolidate current leases due to delays in permanent headquarters construction. The Committee includes $10,000,000 for Phase 1 of construction to ensure Coast Guard can move in 2013 without obstacles to access. The bill does not provide $89 million for site access. The minority views on the project highlight the lack of funding for site access to the new DHS headquarters, leading to delays and increased costs. The bill only funds relocation for the Coast Guard in 2013, with no funding for Phase 2 construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for highway interchange, but it was not funded. The House floor addressed DHS headquarters consolidation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for a highway interchange, funded under the Under Secretary for Management's office. Full funding was recommended for the Coast Guard's move. An attempt to use the $89 million as an offset for an unrelated amendment failed. The funding remained in the reported version of the legislation. The committee recommended $89 million for headquarters consolidation and mission support. The Under Secretary must submit an expenditure plan within 90 days of enactment, with quarterly briefings required. The Department is developing an updated plan with the General Services Administration for smaller, more manageable segments. The Department is developing an updated plan for headquarters consolidation in smaller, more manageable segments. $29 million is provided for necessary expenses related to the project, with no funding provided in Title I of the legislation. The plan is expected to identify construction segments, resource requirements, and funding timelines. The DHS operating plan includes funds for the Analysis and Operations account to support the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS). I&A manages the DHS intelligence enterprise and shares intelligence information, while OPS coordinates departmental and interagency operations plans and manages the National Operations Center. The National Operations Center is the main hub for domestic incident management and operations coordination, combining law enforcement, intelligence, emergency response, and private sector information. The FY2013 budget request for the Analysis and Operations account was $322 million, a decrease of $16 million from FY2012. H.R. 5855 proposed $317 million for the account, $4.5 million below the President's request. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended a $21 million decrease from FY2012 funding levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, a decrease of $14 million from FY2012 and an increase of $2 million from the President's FY2013 request. The Committee required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013 within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment. The Committee directed DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013 within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment, focusing on I&A's unique expertise and intelligence customers. The Analysis and Operations account received $322 million in P.L. 113-6, aligning with the President's FY2013 request and representing a 4.7% decrease from FY2012. The plan also includes semi-annual briefings on the State and Local Fusion Centers program. The operating plan for DHS for FY2013 indicates sequestration reduced executive service salaries and the Air Domain Intelligence Integration Element to $306 million. Some Members of Congress have concerns about I&A's mission, citing a lack of focus and overlapping authorities. Representative Sue Myrick highlighted these issues in a House of Representatives hearing on DHS's role in the intelligence community. The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis, and Counterintelligence discussed DHS's intelligence mission based on a report by the Aspen Institute. The report suggested that DHS should focus on specific homeward-focused areas where it has unique strengths and value, avoiding duplication of efforts by other agencies. This direction should prioritize areas not covered by other agencies, especially state/local partners. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department. It also ensures information technology security and makes recommendations on legislation. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) ensures information technology security and reviews legislation. The OIG requested $144 million, including $2.6 million for audits of states receiving FEMA grant funds. The House-passed bill allocated $109 million for the DHS OIG. The House-passed bill allocated $109 million for the DHS OIG, with $10 million reduced due to dissatisfaction with communication. The Committee funded $24 million through a transfer from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for disaster-related audits. The Senate-reported bill included $123 million for the DHS OIG, with $24 million expected from the DRF. The Senate-reported bill allocated $123 million for the DHS OIG, with $24 million from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for investigating corruption and criminal conduct at CBP and ICE. This is an increase of $4 million from last year's appropriation but a decrease of $23 million from the President's request. The FY2013 budget for the DHS OIG saw an increase of $4 million from the previous year's allocation but a decrease of $23 million from the President's request. A $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund was included to align the budget with the request. Sequestration reduced the OIG budget by $7 million, with projected total resources for FY2013 at $138 million, $3 million less than FY2012 levels. Both House and Senate bills required the OIG to conduct reviews and provide reports on various matters. The House directed the DHS OIG to report on various matters including budget expenditure plans, integrity of CBP and ICE officers, non-competitive contract awards, and reviews of local law enforcement operations. They also requested assessments on TSA screening, fraud detection reforms, and delays in FEMA's public assistance programs. The Senate, on the other hand, requested a review of FEMA's application of its own rules. The Senate directed the DHS OIG to review FEMA's application of its own rules regarding public assistance funds for debris removal, as stated in Section 565 of Division D of P.L. 113-6. No additional funding was allocated for this work, except for integrity investigations of ICE and CBP officers. The Senate directed the DHS OIG to review the organizational structure and reporting functions of the OIG, expressing concerns about its independence and timeliness. The OIG has many senior positions filled by officials in acting roles, potentially hindering its ability to fulfill its duties. The DHS OIG has concerns about its organizational structure and reporting functions, with many senior positions filled by officials in acting roles, potentially hindering its ability to fulfill its duties. Title II of the DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, with the enacted level slightly below the requested amount for FY2013. After across-the-board cuts, the appropriations for Title II increased slightly from the requested level but remained below FY2012 levels. The DHS appropriations bill provides $31,267 million for Title II, a 1.7% increase from the requested level and 0.8% below FY2012. Sequestration reduced the funding to $30,184 million for FY2013. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry with a focus on preventing terrorism. CBP officers at ports of entry prevent entry of terrorists and enforce laws to prevent illegal entries. Major programs include Border Security Inspections, Border Security and Control, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, and Facilities Management. The curr_chunk discusses funding for various agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, including Border Security Fencing and Facilities Management. Funding numbers reflect spending cuts compared to previous years, and the department is likely to make transfers and reprogramming to mitigate the impact of sequestration. The Administration requested an appropriation of $10,345 million in net budget authority. The Administration requested an appropriation of $10,345 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with program changes including transferring the US-VISIT program to CBP and increasing funding for the Automated Targeting System. Increase of $31 million for the operation and maintenance of the Automated Targeting System (ATS), $38.7 million for the Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison, $8 million for the National Targeting Center, $13 million for the Container Security Initiative, $10 million for intellectual property rights enforcement, and $3 million to expand CBP's Centers for Excellence and Expertise. Decrease of $68.2 million for the Office of Air and Marine Interdictions and $7.1 million for Air and Marine salaries. Decrease in funding for Office of Air and Marine Interdictions (OAM) due to fewer new aircraft acquisitions and reduced air missions, management and administration staffing, fleet acquisition, information technology infrastructure, and nonintrusive inspection operations and maintenance. The House approved $10,172 in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with decreases in various expenses such as NII operations, officer overtime, training programs, and transportation costs. This represents an increase of $17 million from the previous year's appropriation and a decrease of $173 million from the President's request. The House-approved bill for CBP in FY2013 included amendments for increased funding for CBP salaries, expenses, and communications infrastructure, as well as cuts to environmental mitigation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed a $299 million increase in net budget authority for CBP compared to the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed a $299 million increase in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, totaling $10,454 million. This is a 3.0% increase from the previous year's appropriation and a 1.1% increase from the President's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provides $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP, an increase of $201 million from the previous year. The President's request for CBP budget authority in FY2013 was $11,872 million, a slight decrease from the previous year's appropriation but an increase over the President's request. Sequestration further reduced the budget authority by $575 million. Various policy issues were discussed during the appropriations cycle, including US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security. Congress mandated the implementation of an automated entry and exit data system by the former INS. The former INS was mandated by Congress to implement an automated entry and exit data system to track foreign visitors' arrival and departure in the US. This system collects biographic and biometric identification information, stored in databases like ADIS and IDENT, and shared with various government agencies to identify potential risks. The IDENT database is used to share information with government agencies to identify potential risks. The entry-exit system collects biometric data from most non-citizens entering the US but does not collect data from those exiting. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system. Instead, DHS focused on enhancing the biographic exit program. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system. DHS focused on an enhanced biographic exit program and an integrated U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. Air and sea carriers provide passenger manifest data to DHS for checks against entry records and immigration databases to identify overstays. Citizenship and Immigration Canada provides biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada through land ports for U.S. exit records. Canada provides biometric records of third country nationals entering through land ports for U.S. exit records. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the lack of a biometric exit system, leading to directives for DHS to report on plans for a more comprehensive system. The U.S. entry-exit system has undergone organizational changes since its creation, including being part of the US-VISIT Program and later proposed to be under a Screening Coordination Office. Former DHS Secretary Chertoff reorganized the US-VISIT program, proposing to place it within a Screening Coordination Office (SCO) that would report directly to the Secretary. However, funding for the SCO was not allocated, leading US-VISIT to become a standalone office within DHS. In FY2008, US-VISIT was transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). A proposed move in FY2013 to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE was not fully supported by Congress. The House-passed bill proposed transferring $73 million to CBP and ICE offices for entry-exit policy and overstay analysis, leaving $191 million for US-VISIT funding in a new Office of Biometric Identity Management within NPPD. The Senate-reported bill recommended transferring US-VISIT to CBP as a stand-alone appropriation, replacing it with a new Office of Biometric Identity Management under P.L. 113-6. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and Border Patrol agents, with questions raised by both chambers on how DHS sets staffing levels. The Senate and House budget proposals supported requested staffing levels for CBP officers and Border Patrol agents, but raised questions about how DHS sets these levels. The Senate report warned of adverse consequences if high staffing levels are maintained during budget tightening, while the House report suggested changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs through automation, risk-based targeting, and technology utilization. The House and Senate reports supported staffing levels for CBP officers and Border Patrol agents, with a focus on increasing efficiency through technology and trusted programs. There are concerns about maintaining high staffing levels during budget constraints, with suggestions to reduce staffing requirements at ports of entry through automation and risk-based targeting. CBP officer salaries are partially funded by user fees, and efforts are being made to refine revenue forecasting for adequate budgeting. Border patrol staffing has increased significantly since FY2005, while OFO staffing at ports of entry has seen a smaller increase despite expanding responsibilities. Since FY2005, OFO staffing at POEs has only increased by 18%, despite expanded responsibilities like biometric data collection and enhanced cargo security. Some argue that increased enforcement between ports of entry has pushed illegal migrants and drug smugglers to enter through POEs. Supporters of increased OFO staffing believe officers enhance security and facilitate legal admissions better than automated systems. Sequestration in 2013 led to warnings of furloughs, reduced overtime, and decreased hiring for CBP personnel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is facing budget cuts that could lead to furloughs, reduced overtime, and decreased hiring for frontline CBP personnel. The agency plans to minimize the impact by eliminating employee performance awards, reducing outside contracts, and working with appropriators to reprogram funds. Despite efforts to avoid furloughs, staffing reductions through overtime cuts and hiring freezes are likely due to budget constraints. The Border Security and Control between POEs Account faces potential staffing reductions due to budget cuts, with a focus on salaries and benefits. The administration is exploring public-private partnerships for funding, despite restrictions on fee-for-service immigration and customs services. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five partnerships in FY2013. The administration is considering public-private partnerships for funding CBP services at POEs, allowing reimbursement for additional services and officer overtime. CBP collects user fees, including COBRA fees, to reimburse for customs functions like overtime compensation and benefits. Certain COBRA fees are used for customs functions such as overtime compensation and benefits for CBP officers. Some fees are deposited in the Customs User Fee Account for additional revenue functions, subject to appropriations acts. Congressional interest has been sparked by instances where passenger fees were collected without corresponding appropriations. The NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 and the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 increased fees for passengers entering the US, resulting in significant revenue collection. Funds were directed to the Customs User Fee Account for customs functions, sparking congressional interest in fee collection without corresponding appropriations. Some Members of Congress have questioned the allocation of fees collected for customs functions, specifically regarding the $639 million identified by GAO. The House Appropriations Committee directed CBP to explain how the department will remove these funds from its books. Despite the increase in fees from certain trade agreements, CBP faced a budget shortfall as the funds were not made available to the agency in appropriations bills. The House and Senate did not include funds in their appropriation bills to address a shortfall for CBP, leading to a budget shortfall for the agency. P.L. 113-6 provided an additional $110 million to cover the shortfall in CBP salaries and directed CBP and OMB to include access to COBRA fees in future budget requests. DHS uses technology to monitor the Southwest Border and detect illegal entries. Since 1998, DHS has tried to develop a network of border cameras, radar, and sensors for surveillance along key stretches of the border. Previous initiatives like America's Shield Initiative and SBI net faced criticism for contracting practices and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan, focusing on rapid deployment of existing technology for video surveillance systems. The Arizona Border Technology Plan involves the rapid deployment of video surveillance systems using a mix of fixed and mobile technology. House and Senate reports criticized DHS for delays in implementing new surveillance equipment. Despite concerns about the effectiveness of existing SBI net towers, both chambers recommended fully funding the border surveillance mission. The House and Senate recommended fully funding the President's request for the BSFIT account for border surveillance. However, they also proposed rescinding unobligated balances from the account, with different amounts specified. P.L. 113-6 included $73,232,000 in rescissions. CBP uses manned and unmanned aircraft for surveillance, with the President's FY2013 budget supporting 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and border surveillance. OAM reported flight hour projections for FY2013. CBP reported 81,045 flight hours in FY2012 and projected 65,000 hours in FY2013, with 10 unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in operation. UAS accounted for 5,737 flight hours in FY2012. Some Members of Congress support the use of aircraft for border surveillance, but there are concerns about privacy and cost effectiveness. A DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's UAS program for lacking adequate support resources. The 2012 DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's unmanned aircraft systems program for inadequate planning and support resources, potentially leading to under-utilization of UAS assets. Both appropriations committees recommended budget increases for OAM, with the House suggesting $82.7 million and the Senate suggesting $71 million for upgrading the fleet and supporting UAS operations. P.L. 113-6 allocated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, including a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. The legislation directed CBP to restore overall and UAS flight hours to 2011 levels. CBP is responsible for screening cargo passing through U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials. Legislation requires all maritime cargo to be scanned before being loaded on ships bound for the United States. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano extended the deadline for excluding cargo that has not been scanned. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano extended the deadline for excluding cargo that has not been scanned, citing concerns about balancing security benefits with costs. Some argue for focusing scanning on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to cut costs and make better use of resources. Requests for reductions in international cargo security screening programs in FY2011 and FY2012 were made, with Congress providing funding levels above the President's request both years. The FY2013 budget request included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and a total of $78 million in proposed increases to the Automated Targeting System for security screening. House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports supported these programs, acknowledging concerns about the costs of a 100% scanning program at foreign ports. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws within the United States. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws within the United States, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry and investigating violations of immigration laws. They are responsible for locating and removing aliens who have overstayed their visas or entered illegally, as well as combating terrorist financing and enforcing export laws. Funding details can be found in Table 8 for agency-level information and Table 10 for sub-account level details. The funding numbers for ICE in FY2013 reflect spending cuts compared to FY2012, with a decrease in net budget authority and gross budget authority. The Administration requested $5,332 million in net budget authority, a 3.9% decrease from FY2012, and $5,644 million in gross budget authority, a 3.7% decrease. The budget request included an increase of $40 million to expand the Alternatives to Detention program. The FY2013 budget for ICE saw a decrease of $218 million (3.7%) from FY2012. The budget request included various changes such as increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, video conferencing expansion, and transferring the US-VISIT Program. There were also reductions for programs like 287(g), Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided $5,474 million in net budget authority for FY2013. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a budget of $5,474 million for ICE in FY2013, representing a decrease of $77 million (1.4%) from FY2012 and an increase of $142 million (2.7%) from the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a budget of $5,330 million, a decrease of $2 million (less than 0.1%) from the Administration's request and a decrease of $220 million (4.0%) from FY2012. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed a budget of $5,642 million for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $220 million (3.8%) from the FY2012 enacted amount. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE, a decrease of $125 million (2.3%) from last year's appropriation. Sequestration further reduced ICE budget. ICE's budget authority for FY2013 saw a $125 million decrease from the previous year's appropriation, with an additional $200 million reduction due to sequestration. The FY2013 expenditure plan projected a total spending of $5,442 million for ICE, $420 million less than FY2012 levels. Congress has debated on how ICE resources should be allocated to best achieve its mission, especially regarding detaining and removing aliens and the involvement of state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement. ICE's mission includes locating and removing deportable aliens, with a capacity to remove 400,000 aliens a year. There are 10.8 million unauthorized aliens and 1.9 million criminal aliens in the US. Debate continues on how ICE should prioritize removal. Amendments in H.R. 5855 aimed to direct immigration enforcement priorities. P.L. 113-6 allocates $1,600 million to identify removable aliens convicted of crimes. The Agency's immigration enforcement priorities are outlined in P.L. 113-6, which allocates $1,600 million to identify and remove aliens convicted of crimes based on severity. ICE's ERO manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings and ensures their departure from the US, but concerns exist about insufficient detention space leading to decisions on releasing aliens based on space availability rather than individual cases. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention for noncriminal alien detainees due to concerns about inequities in detention conditions and decisions based on space availability. ICE maintained 34,000 detention bed spaces in FY2012, with a proposed reduction to 32,800 beds in FY2013. In 2013, ICE released 2,228 detainees citing the need for reductions required by sequestration. ICE released detainees in 2013 due to funding constraints from a continuing resolution and sequestration. Critics viewed the release as a political move to pressure Congress. ICE is required to maintain 34,000 detention beds for FY2013, leading to interest in alternatives to detention for certain non-detained aliens. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring options, such as electronic devices and home visits, for aliens awaiting hearings or appeals. The Administration sought to decrease detention bed space while increasing funding for the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained bed space and increased ATD funding by $20 million, while Senate-reported S. 3216 reduced bed space by 600 and increased ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and boosts ATD funding by $19 million. The Administration has decreased detention space by 600 beds and increased funding for the ATD program by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases ATD program funding by $19 million. ICE has deployed Secure Communities to 89% of all jurisdictions nationally and is requesting resources to expand the system nationwide by the end of FY2013. House and Senate appropriators express strong support for continued immigration enforcement efforts. In FY2012, there were 282,000 more removable aliens compared to FY2010, including 73,000 Level 1 offenders. House and Senate appropriators supported the expansion of Secure Communities. The enforcement of immigration laws by state and local law enforcement agents has sparked debate about their role, with concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Some argue that the federal government lacks resources for immigration enforcement. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the FY2012 enacted level. ICE plans to discontinue the least productive 287(g) task force agreements in jurisdictions where Secure Communities is active and will not consider any requests for new 287(g) task forces. Senate-reported S. 3216 would have appropriated $51 million for 287(g) agreements while H.R. 5855, as passed by the House, would have funded the 287(g) program at the FY2012 level of $68 million. The House passed H.R. 5855 to fund the 287(g) program at $68 million, with an amendment prohibiting termination of existing agreements. P.L. 113-6 also funded the program at $68 million. ICE established the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about its operations, but some criticize it as unproductive. The law prohibits funding for the Public Advocate position. The TSA, created in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US. It was transferred to DHS in 2002. TSA's duties include safeguarding the aviation system against terrorist threats and deploying security technologies. The TSA is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US, including aviation, marine, and land modes. They assess terrorist risks, issue security regulations, and enforce them. The TSA budget is complex, with aviation security costs partially offset by fees. The TSA's security fee collection offsets aviation security costs, with $250 million for screening technology investments. Other fees cover transportation threat assessment and credentialing costs. The President's budget request for TSA includes $7,645 million in gross budget authority, offset by $2,515 million in proposed collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million. This represents a 2.5% decrease in gross funding from FY2012, with a 7.1% drop in net appropriations. Of the total request, $5,099 million is allocated for aviation security, a decrease of $155 million (3.0%) compared to FY2012. The President's budget request for TSA in FY2012 included $7,645 million in gross budget authority, with a 7.1% drop in net appropriations. $5,099 million was allocated for aviation security, a decrease of $155 million (3.0%) compared to FY2012. Proposed decreases in funding reflected reductions in procurement for baggage and passenger checkpoint technologies, screening technology maintenance costs, and a 50% reduction in the FFDO program and flight crew training. The requested funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing (TTAC) would increase by $68 million (33%) to $272 million, including a one-time increase of $30 million for TTAC infrastructure modernization. Funding for Transportation Security Support was set at $970 million, a decrease of $62 million (6%), and funding for the Federal Air Marshals Service (FAMS) specified $930 million, a decrease of $36 million (3.8%). The House-passed bill for TSA included a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million, a decrease from the administration's request. The bill specified $5,041 million for aviation security, rejecting proposed increases in passenger security fees. Appropriations for aviation security actually rose $58 million above the request. The House-passed bill proposed additional cuts to TSA screening operations, including reductions in workforce costs and checked baggage equipment procurement. It specified funding for surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS, all below the administration's request. These reductions were made to offset a budget shortfall caused by the administration's reliance on passenger security fees. The House committee noted reductions to the TSA budget request to offset a shortfall from proposed passenger security fee increases. The Senate-reported bill allocated $7,633 million for TSA, with a net discretionary appropriation of $4,919 million, a decrease from the Administration's request. This included $5,087 million for aviation security, $11 million less than requested. The Senate accepted the proposed increases in passenger security fees, resulting in a $211 million reduction in net appropriations for aviation security. The appropriations proposed in the bill for aviation security dropped $211 million (7.3%) from the Administration's request, with reductions to checkpoint equipment procurement, explosives detection systems procurement, and screener staffing. The committee specified $24 million for the FFDO program, $12 million (92%) above the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS at requested levels. P.L. 113-6 provided TSA with $7,551 million in total gross budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS at requested levels. P.L. 113-6 provided TSA with $7,551 million in total gross budget authority, $290 million less than the FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration further reduced TSA budget authority by roughly an additional $339 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected gross total spending for TSA in FY2013 to be $7,212 million, $629 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. The Administration proposed changing passenger security fees to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, doubling the fee on direct flights. Airlines have raised concerns about the potential impact on air travel. This change is estimated to increase revenue collections by $317 million. The Administration proposed increasing passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip for direct flights, with the revenue increase estimated at $317 million. $117 million would be used for aviation security costs, and $200 million for deficit reduction. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the proposal, applying all passenger security fees to aviation security costs. The Senate committee approved using passenger security fees for aviation security as offsetting collections for deficit reduction in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional issues. P.L. 113-6 did not change passenger security fees despite TSA identifying over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies. In FY2013, TSA identified savings of over $100 million through management efficiencies, leading to questions about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner. Efficiency improvements are crucial in addressing budget sequestration impacts at TSA, with initiatives such as risk-based screening programs like PreCheck and modified procedures for children. TSA's risk-based initiatives include the PreCheck program, trusted traveler trial programs, and modified screening procedures for children, flight crew members, and elderly passengers. These trial programs aim to improve screening efficiencies and potential savings, with PreCheck modeled after CBP programs and currently available on a trial basis at limited airports. TSA plans further expansion of these programs. The PreCheck program, part of TSA's risk-based initiatives, is being expanded to include more eligible populations such as frequent flyer program members and military service members. Both the House and Senate committees support the expansion, with a focus on increasing screening efficiency and reducing workforce requirements. TSA is directed to report on expansion plans, success indicators, passenger satisfaction, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures for PreCheck enrollees. The Senate committee expressed concern about TSA's known crew member pilot program being limited to pilots and included bill language to expand it to include flight attendants. TSA's efforts in behavioral-based observation and screening of passengers have faced scrutiny, with the House committee questioning the increase in Behavior Detection Officers without clear evidence of their effectiveness. The committee called for a cost-benefit analysis and a robust risk-based strategy for their deployment. The committee called for a formal cost-benefit analysis of the BDO program and a risk-based strategy for deployment. The budget justification proposed a $13 million reduction in funds for the FFDO program and crew member self-defense training, but this proposal was not adopted. The House recommended keeping the FFDO program at FY2012 levels and passed an amendment to increase funding by $10 million. The House passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by an additional $10 million to $36 million, offset by reductions in other areas. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs, slightly lower than FY2012 levels due to budget constraints. The Coast Guard, as the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, had its budget slightly decreased in FY2013 to $23 million due to sequestration cuts. It also performs non-homeland security missions such as search and rescue, environmental protection, and aids to navigation. The President requested $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations for the Coast Guard, $257 million less than FY2012's enacted amount. The President requested $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations for the Coast Guard in FY2013, which was $257 million less than the previous year. The House and Senate proposed slightly higher funding amounts, with differences mainly in capital acquisitions and vessel procurement. P.L. 113-6 provided funding for the USCG. The President requested $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations for the Coast Guard in FY2013, which was $257 million less than the previous year. P.L. 113-6 provided USCG with $10,400 million in total gross budget authority, $68 million more than FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration reduced USCG budget authority by roughly an additional $268 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected gross total spending for USCG to be $10,132 million, $200 million less than FY2012 enacted levels. Table 13 outlines funding levels for USCG operating expenses and acquisition and construction functions for FY2013. The department assessed budget resources available through P.L. 113-6 after sequestration as of April 26, 2013. Differences in funding recommendations for FY2013 between the President's request and House and Senate bills were seen in vessel and aircraft acquisition. The President requested $139 million for two new fast response cutters, while the House funded four ($224 million) and the Senate funded six ($335 million). The House provided $90 million for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters. The House provided $90 million for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters. The President requested $64 million for the long-range aircraft, but made this request in the DOD's budget and requested no funds for MH-60 helicopters. The Senate did not request funds for either aircraft under the Coast Guard's appropriation. P.L. 113-6 requires a future-years capital investment plan for FY2014 through FY2018 to be submitted. DHS's sequestration operating plan includes $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, $646 million for one national security cutter, $319 million for six fast response cutters, and $8 million for a new icebreaker. The Coast Guard's effort to replace or modernize its fleet of vessels has been a major issue for Congress. The House bill would have provided $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, including $31 million to address a shore facilities backlog list and $10 million for the Coast Guard's new headquarters building. In FY2012 appropriations, $30 million was allocated for housing and aids to navigation, reduced to $29 million due to sequestration. The House Appropriations Committee called for implementing card readers for TWIC at ports and vessels. The Senate Committee requested a briefing on Interagency Operations Centers at ports. P.L. 113-6 directed expedited completion of a final TWIC. The explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 113-6 directs the Coast Guard, Department, and TSA to expedite the final TWIC reader rule. The U.S. Secret Service has missions in criminal investigations and protection, including financial crimes, identity theft, and protecting high-profile individuals and locations. The U.S. Secret Service, along with the White House and Vice President's residence, provides protective duties for designated individuals and foreign missions in DC. They are also responsible for security at National Special Security Events, with a requested appropriation of $1,601 million for FY2013. The Administration requested $1,601 million for the USSS in FY2013, $66 million less than FY2012. The House-passed DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,613 million, $12 million more than the Administration's request. The decrease in funding was due to the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season. The Senate-reported version of the DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the USSS, reflecting a total decrease of $54 million from the previous year. This amount was $12 million above the Administration's request and included funding for specific programs like the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Electronic Crimes Task Forces. The Senate Committee recommended $1.613 million for the USSS in FY2013, $54 million less than the previous year. The funding included support for specific programs like the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Congress appropriated $1.611 billion for USSS in FY2013, $56 million less than the previous year. Following the sequester, the Service plans to expend $1.527 billion, $84 million less than what was appropriated in P.L. 113-6. The Secret Service's funding levels for FY2013 were outlined in detail in Table 14 of the DHS Plan. Congress has been concerned about balancing the Service's investigative and protective missions, with the protective mission receiving more resources and attention. Congressional action has focused on the protection mission and recent agent misconduct. The majority of congressional action concerning USSS has focused on its protection mission and recent agent misconduct. There has been an increase in the need for protection activities due to potential terrorist attacks and threats to the President. Advocates for expanding the investigation mission argue that better threat investigation efforts enhance protection. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for NPPD, OHA, and FEMA, with a requested increase in funding for FY2013. The Administration requested $5,911 million for NPPD, OHA, and FEMA in FY2013, with the House-passed bill providing $5,930 million and the Senate-reported bill providing $5,971 million. Both versions also included $5,481 million for disaster relief offset by a Budget Control Act adjustment. P.L. 113-6 ultimately provided $5,920 million after cuts, an increase from the requested level and FY2012. The enacted amount for NPPD, OHA, and FEMA in FY2013 was $5,920 million, which included $6,400 million for disaster relief offset by a Budget Control Act adjustment. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in 2006 and includes the Office of the Under Secretary for NPPD, Office of Infrastructure Protection, and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The Administration proposed moving US-VISIT program activities from NPPD to other departments, while the House suggested keeping some functions in a new Office of Biometric Identify Management. The FY2013 budget supports these offices through various programs. The Office of Infrastructure Protection and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications are supported by the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS), which includes projects related to infrastructure protection, cybersecurity, and communications. The Administration requested $1,217 million for NPPD activities in FY2013, with a decrease of $29 million compared to FY2012. The FY2013 Management and Administration budget request was $50 million, reflecting a transfer of functions to the DHS Office of Policy. The FY2013 request for IPIS was $1,167 million, an increase of $278 million (31.3%) above the FY2012 appropriation, with a focus on securing the federal government. The IPIS budget request for FY2013 was $1,167 million, a $278 million increase (31.3%) from FY2012. The increase was mainly for securing federal information systems, with two major program increases: a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security and a $116 million increase for Network Security Deployment to expand the National Cybersecurity Protection System. The FY2013 budget for the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) includes extra funding to expand deployment of version 3.0 for active defenses and development of version 2.2 for threat visualization. Additionally, $15 million is allocated for US-CERT to analyze data generated by NCPS, and $5 million for MS-ISAC to support cybersecurity efforts at state and local levels. Infrastructure protection funding was reduced by $40 million and communication activities by $7 million. Infrastructure protection funding was reduced by $40 million (13.7%) below the FY2012 appropriation, with a significant portion attributed to a $19 million (20.1%) reduction in the budget for the Infrastructure Security Compliance project. This project ensures compliance with Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) at covered facilities. Another $8 million in reductions was associated with the elimination of contract support for incident planning exercises, which would continue under other infrastructure protection projects. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, with $45 million for Management and Administration, $1,110 million for IPIS, and $191 million for OBIM. They allocated $5 million less for Management and Administration due to concerns over TSA fee increases and CBP fee revenues. The reduction in IPIS funding was mainly in the Security Compliance project, following internal program reviews revealing implementation issues and unobligated funds. The House proposed $29 million less than requested due to major implementation problems and unobligated funds. They also reduced funding for the NCPS deployment by $17 million, citing concerns about NPPD's ability to use the funds. Additionally, the House directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard on program implementation and consider using private sector security programs for approving security plans under CFATS. Other reductions included $3 million in the Global Cybersecurity Management project and $7 million in the Programs to Study and Enhance Telecommunications project. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD, with specific allocations for Management and Administration, IPIS, and Security Compliance projects. This included additional funding for bombing prevention and vulnerability assessments, as well as $12 million more than requested for the Security Compliance project. The Committee recommended additional funding for the Security Compliance project, acknowledging unobligated funds and the need for more funds for future implementation plans. They proposed $18 million less than requested for the Federal Network Security project and recommended withholding $120 million until an expenditure plan is produced. The Committee also noted the restructuring of the project to a more unified effort managed by DHS. The Committee recommended increased funding for cybersecurity projects managed by DHS, including setting aside $17 million for cybersecurity education and emphasizing the importance of improving the cybersecurity posture of state and local governments. They also highlighted the need for annual National Cyber Security Reviews to track progress and recommended funding increases for emergency communication offices. The Committee recommended increased funding for cybersecurity projects managed by DHS, including $17 million for cybersecurity education. They emphasized the importance of improving the cybersecurity posture of state and local governments and recommended annual National Cyber Security Reviews to track progress. Additionally, funding increases were recommended for emergency communication offices, including the Next Generation Telecommunications project receiving $5 million above the requested level. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,439 million for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM, with $50 million for Management and Administration, $1,157 million for the IPIS program, and $232 million for Biometric Identity Management. After sequestration, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million, with $48 million for Management and Administration, $1,065 million for IPIS, and $224 million for Biometric Identity Management. The operating plan for FY2014 includes $48 million for Management and Administration, $1,065 million for IPIS, and $224 million for Biometric Identity Management. Specific allocations for IPIS include funding for cybersecurity education, CFATS, and Federal Network Security programs to assist federal agencies with continuous monitoring and diagnostic equipment. The Federal Network Security program will assist federal agencies in acquiring and operating continuous monitoring and diagnostic equipment and software. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provides additional instructions related to CFATS. GAO and the Coast Guard will continue to examine DHS progress in developing the CFATS program. NPPD is directed to provide semiannual reports on the compliance program and brief on alternative security programs for CFATS. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provides instructions for cybersecurity efforts and expenditure plans from federal agencies. Agencies must send quarterly reports on their cybersecurity plans to the Office of Management and Budget, which will then provide an annual summary to Congress. Table 16 outlines funding levels for the IPIS program in FY2012 and FY2013. The \"DHS Plan\" column assesses post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. Issues for Congress include CFATS compliance. The Department's funding levels are subject to transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration impacts. An internal review identified issues with CFATS compliance, prompting ongoing program review. Congress is interested in oversight of CFATS compliance. Cybersecurity has been a focus for Congress, with attention on bills addressing information sharing, workforce development, and protecting critical infrastructure. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), under NPPD, is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel. Their operations focus on security and law enforcement to reduce vulnerability to threats. Legislation expanding DHS's role in protecting critical infrastructure may require additional resources. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) conducts security and law enforcement activities to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats. FPS operations include risk assessments, countermeasures like barriers and cameras, law enforcement response, and emergency education programs. FPS is the lead agency for protecting government facilities under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. They employ around 1,225 personnel and oversee 13,000 contract security guards, with a budget request of $1,302 million for FY2013. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Federal Protective Service (FPS) included $1,302 million for approximately 13,000 contract security guards. The budget is offset by security fees charged to GSA building tenants. House-passed H.R. 5855 and the Senate Appropriations Committee made no specific changes to the FPS budget for FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee report required the Office of Under Secretary for NPPD, in conjunction with the FPS Director, to brief the committee on FPS management and budget improvement efforts. No specific changes to the FPS budget were recommended in P.L. 113-6 or the accompanying explanatory statement. FPS was directed to brief the appropriations committees on their progress in implementing recommendations made in GAO report GAO-12-852. Congress continues to express concern over certain aspects of the FPS mission and how it is funded. In response to concerns over FPS mission and funding, legislators have introduced legislation to improve federal building security and strengthen FPS capabilities. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 735, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013, aims to set staffing levels and create a pilot program for FPS inspector force. The Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013 (H.R. 735) aims to set staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and expand the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees various programs including BioWatch and the National Biosurveillance Integration Center, with a proposed budget of $166 million for FY2013 to support 101 FTEs. The proposed budget for the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) for FY2013 is $166 million, which is $1 million less than the previous year. The funding would support 101 FTEs, with allocations for various programs including $125 million for BioWatch, $8 million for NBIC, $1 million for the Chemical Defense Program, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $28 million for Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill would have provided $132 million, while the Senate-reported bill proposed $168 million. The Senate-reported bill recommended $168 million for FY2013, slightly more than the President's request. The bill also included small increases for Planning and Coordination and Salaries and Expenses, as well as $2 million for the Chemical Defense Program. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $132 million for OHA, a significant decrease from FY2012 and the President's request. The reduction in funding largely reflects decreased funding for BioWatch, as recommended by the House. The enacted funding amounts for OHA components for FY2013 reflect decreased funding for BioWatch as recommended by the House. The DHS Plan column provides the department's assessment of post-sequester resources under P.L. 113-6, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impacts. The House Appropriations Committee noted the separation of activities to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction in its report on FY2013 funding recommendations for DHS. The Committee directed the Secretary to submit a consolidation plan to merge DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate report and House explanatory statement did not carry a parallel directive, but called for coordination of WMD activities and a comprehensive review of operations. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, is a major part of OHA's budget. They aim to deploy more advanced sensors, but face technical and cost challenges. The program's Gen-3 sensors have a projected cost of $5.8 billion, making it one of the largest DHS acquisitions. The BioWatch Gen-3 program has faced technical and management challenges, with an estimated life cycle cost of $5.8 billion. Congressional appropriators have sought to limit funding for program expansion, affecting its development and deployment. FEMA's primary mission is to reduce loss of life and property from all hazards through emergency management preparedness. FEMA leads the nation's preparedness for disasters through a comprehensive emergency management system. It provides assistance to state and local governments, disaster relief, and supports preparedness through grant programs. The Administration requested a budget increase for FEMA in FY2013. The Administration requested an additional $5,481 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in FY2013, funded by an adjustment to the discretionary budget cap. House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed $4,451 million for FEMA, a decrease from the President's request. Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed $4,582 million for FEMA, an increase from the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $4,582 million for FEMA in FY2013, a $55 million increase from the President's request and a $316 million increase from FY2012. The total discretionary appropriation for FEMA after cuts was $4,351 million, $84 million more than FY2012 but $177 million less than the President's request. Additionally, $6,400 was allocated for the Disaster Relief Fund for major disaster costs under the Stafford Act. After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions. After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions and $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA. State and local governments may reduce resources allocated to public safety and homeland security preparedness due to tight budgetary conditions. State and local governments facing fiscal constraints may decrease funding for public safety and homeland security preparedness, impacting national readiness levels. President Obama issued a directive for the development of a national preparedness goal, emphasizing coordination with various government levels and prioritizing objectives to mitigate risks. The national preparedness goal, informed by specific threats and vulnerabilities, includes measurable objectives to mitigate risks. It defines core capabilities needed to prepare for incidents posing the greatest risk to national security, superseding a previous directive after 9/11. The first National Preparedness Goal was released on October 7, 2011, under PPD 8. The National Preparedness Goal (NPG) was released on October 7, 2011, by the Secretary of DHS under PPD 8. It identified core capabilities and targets for developing measures using an integrated, layered, and all-of-nation approach. The goal aimed for a secure and resilient Nation with capabilities to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards. Prior to 9/11, only three federal grant programs were available for homeland security. Several homeland security grant programs were added post-9/11 to ensure state and local preparedness, including SHSGP, CCP, UASI, REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Grants, Port Security, Over-the-Road, BZPP, IECGP, and EOC grants. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, which is $400 million more than the previous year's appropriation. This funding accounts for less than one percent of total state and local government public safety expenditures, which amount to $218 billion annually. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, $400 million more than the previous year's appropriation. The House Appropriations Committee denied a request to consolidate state and local preparedness grant programs under a National Preparedness Grant Program due to lack of authorization, implementation details, and stakeholder participation. The Senate Appropriations Committee also expressed concerns about the consolidation proposal. The Senate Appropriations Committee and House expressed concerns about the proposal to consolidate state and local preparedness grants for FY2013. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, rejecting the consolidation proposal and recommending the grant structure enacted in FY2012 to continue. Grant funding would be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs in FY2013, rejecting the consolidation proposal. Grant funding would be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security under various authorities. The funding included allocations for Operation Stonegarden, highest risk areas, and education, training, and exercises. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013, with allocations for State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, Public Transportation Security, Port Security Grants, and education, training, and exercises. The funding was decreased by 20.3% from the requested level and 8.6% above FY2012 after across-the-board cuts. Sequestration further reduced budget authority for FEMA's state and local programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013 for state and local programs, a decrease of 20.3% from the requested level and 8.6% above FY2012. Sequestration further reduced budget authority for FEMA's state and local grants program by roughly an additional $77 million. P.L. 113-6 removes a transfer from the grant programs that had paid FEMA's administrative costs, resulting in $132 million higher funding available for grants compared to FY2012. Table 18 outlines the funding levels for FEMA state and local programs. The \"DHS Plan\" column provides the department's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. The department's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013 indicates potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impact. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. A shift in grant administration to the SLP Management and Administration office was proposed starting in FY2013. The Administration proposed shifting grant administration to the SLP Management and Administration office. They requested legislative language to use SAFER grants for maintaining firefighter staffing levels. The House-passed bill funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the shift of AFG and SAFER grants. The Senate-reported bill also proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance. The Senate-reported bill proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, with $337.5 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. It denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funded firefighter assistance at $642 million, with administrative costs derived from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is funded through regular appropriations but often depleted before the end of the fiscal year due to high demand for disaster assistance. This reliance on supplemental funding has been attributed to underfunding the DRF, with average appropriations between 2005 and 2011 at $1,749 million. The reliance on supplemental funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is primarily due to underfunding, with average appropriations between 2005 and 2011 at $1,749 million. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the DRF in FY2013, a decrease from the previous year. This request includes funding for activities not directly tied to major disasters and disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act. The Administration requested $5,481 million for disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act in FY2013, reflecting the impact of the Budget Control Act. The request was based on FEMA's planned spending for past catastrophic events, the 10-year average for non-catastrophic events, and a $500 million reserve to prevent shortfalls. This amount was adjusted downward by $1,200 million to account for projected fund recovery. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills for FY2013 allocated funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) as requested by the Administration. Both bills included a $24 million transfer from the DRF to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits and investigations on disaster-related spending. Despite this transfer, P.L. 113-6 provided approximately $918 million more for the DRF. The Budget Control Act (BCA) included provisions for disaster relief funding adjustments to avoid sequestration due to exceeding discretionary spending caps. This adjustment allows for additional budget authority for federal costs incurred by major disasters beyond regular allocations. The Budget Control Act (BCA) allows for adjustments to discretionary budget caps to prevent sequestration from exceeding federal spending limits. \"Disaster relief\" funding under the BCA is distinct from the Disaster Relief Fund, with funding coming from various federal accounts. The DRF had access to $7.3 billion during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, due to a continuing resolution. The Disaster Relief Fund received additional funding through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 to meet high demand. Congress approved $11,485 million in pre-sequester resources, exceeding the allowable adjustment for disaster relief in FY 2013. Emergency funding designations were provided to cover most of the relief efforts. The Administration requested tens of billions in additional disaster assistance, with emergency funding designations covering most relief in FY2013. The proposal suggested eliminating the PDM program, stating it duplicated the HMGP. PDM awards funds prior to disasters, unlike HMGP. Programs under NFIP address similar issues. The PDM program, unlike HMGP, awards funds prior to disasters and applies to all types of hazards. The Administration noted a large unobligated balance of over $174 million, allowing the PDM program to continue awarding grants for several years. Both the House-passed bill and the Senate-reported bill expressed concerns about the slow pace of awards and the large unobligated balance. The PDM program has a reduced post-sequester amount of just under $25 million for FY2013, presenting challenges to program administration. State minimum awards become difficult to fund, and a full new round of applications and awards is impractical due to reduced funding levels. FEMA may work from existing, unfunded applications to continue the program funding cycle. The Administration has proposed reduced funding for the EFS program for several years, requesting $100 million for FY2013. The Administration has proposed reduced funding for the EFS program, with FY2013 requesting $100 million, a $20 million reduction from FY2012. Congress funded the program at $120 million in FY2012, with the House keeping the funding level at $120 million for FY2013 and the Senate suggesting $150 million. The post-sequester funding level for FY2013 is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also exist over delayed fund distribution in FY2012. The EFS program faced reduced funding in FY2013, with the Administration requesting $100 million, a $20 million decrease from FY2012. Concerns arose over delayed fund distribution in FY2012, with FEMA and the National Board taking nine months to begin distributing assistance, double the time allowed by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. Title IV of the DHS appropriations bill includes funding for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The House-passed bill provides $1,510 million, a 3.3% decrease from the requested level, while the Senate-reported bill offers $1,535 million, 1.7% below the request. The USCIS budget for FY2013 saw a 3.3% decrease from the requested level in the House-passed bill and a 1.7% decrease in the Senate-reported bill. The enacted amount in P.L. 113-6 was $1,520 million, a 0.5% decrease from the requested level. USCIS activities include adjudication of immigration petitions and naturalization. The USCIS budget for FY2013 decreased slightly from the requested level, with activities including adjudication of immigration petitions, naturalization, and processing various petitions and claims. USCIS funds its operations through revenues generated by the Examinations Fee Account. USCIS was directed to transform its revenue structure with the creation of the Examinations Fee Account. The agency receives most of its revenue from adjudication fees of immigration benefit applications and petitions. The requested USCIS gross budget authority for FY2013 was $3,005 million, including $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The FY2013 budget request for the Immigrant Integration Initiative includes $20 million for the SAVE Program to determine eligibility for public benefits based on immigration status. The remaining $2,862 million in budget authority was expected to be funded by fee collections, with allocations for USCIS adjudication services, information and customer services, and administration expenses. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a gross budget authority of $3,004 million for USCIS, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. This amount was $31 million less than the requested amount but $9.5 million above the FY2012 funding level. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a budget for USCIS that was $31 million less than requested but $9.5 million above the FY2012 funding level. The recommended level did not include funds for a pay increase and directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify. The Committee emphasized monitoring fee revenues and recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program and $29 million for digital record conversion. Funding for military naturalizations was not provided, with the Committee suggesting it should be funded by the Department of Defense. USCIS was directed to codify this agreement. The House Committee recommended a budget for USCIS that was $31 million less than requested but $9.5 million above the FY2012 funding level. They did not provide funding for military naturalizations, suggesting it should be funded by the Department of Defense. USCIS was directed to codify this agreement in a memorandum of understanding with DoD. The Committee expressed concerns about a 2012 OIG report on USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to provide a progress report on its corrective action plan. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $2,999 million, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. The Committee recommended no direct appropriations for the SAVE program, instead allocating $20 million from user fees. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program and $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants in direct appropriations. They directed USCIS to allocate $20 million of its user fee revenues for the SAVE program. Additionally, they recommended that no appropriations be used to operate the Office of Citizenship Services and that its operations continue to be fee-funded. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates sequestration would reduce funding to $109 million, with potential transfers and reprogrammings to mitigate or exacerbate the impact in different areas. The curr_chunk lists enacted amounts for USCIS for FY2012, the Administration's request for FY2013, House-passed and Senate-reported appropriations, pre-sequester funding levels, and post-sequester levels reported by DHS. Potential issues for Congress in FY2013 included fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, USCIS Transformation program, E-Verify operability, paper record digitization, and refugee processing. USCIS must monitor fee revenues to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting. The House Committee directed USCIS to monitor fee revenues and obligations accurately to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains an issue, with the Administration requesting $11 million in appropriations for FY2013, while the House and Senate Committees prefer funding from fee revenue. Section 546 of P.L. 113-6 requires USCIS to allocate $7.5 million from the Immigration Examinations Fee Account funds for immigrant integration grants in FY2013, with an additional $2.5 million in appropriations. The House Committee expressed disappointment with USCIS's lack of progress on the Transformation program, questioning the justification for continued investment in the current contract. USCIS was directed to provide updates on efforts to transition to an online-based system for immigration benefits. The House and Senate Committees directed USCIS to provide updates on the E-Verify program, including creating a review process for final non-confirmations and reporting on the cost of expanding E-Verify. The House extended E-Verify authorization for one year and the Senate requested recommendations on its use in the agricultural industry. The House Committee supported efforts to increase efficiency in the agricultural industry by digitizing immigration records and eliminating paper forms. They also expressed concerns about coordination issues. The House Committee supported digitizing immigration records to increase efficiency in the agricultural industry. They also expressed concerns about coordination issues in processing vulnerable individuals for resettlement in the United States. The Senate Committee urged DHS to use parole authority for urgent humanitarian needs, like family unity and medical emergencies after natural disasters. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides basic and advanced law enforcement instruction to various entities, promoting consistency and collaboration. FLETC administers training at multiple sites and online, catering to state, local, and international law enforcement agencies. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) offers training at various sites and online, with a proposed budget of $258 million, a reduction of $13 million from the previous year. The budget includes Salaries and Expenses at $229 million and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses at $29 million, with reductions in both areas due to efficiencies and deferred construction work. The House-passed bill proposed a $4 million reduction in the budget for basic training and deferred construction work, resulting in a cut of $16 million for FLETC. The House Appropriations Committee cited reliance on unauthorized fee increases for the reductions in the acquisition budget. The Senate-reported bill maintained the President's requested funding level of $258 million for FLETC. S. 3216 would have included $258 million for FLETC, the same level and distribution of funding as requested by the President. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicates sequestration would reduce this to $245 million prior to any transfers and reprogrammings that might mitigate the impact of sequestration in some areas and exacerbate it in others. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the primary DHS organization for research and development (R&D). The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) within DHS conducts R&D in its own labs, funds R&D in national labs, industry, and universities, and supports acquisitions for other DHS components. The Administration requested $831 million for S&T in FY2013, a 25% increase from FY2012. The request for Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) saw a significant increase, with the largest being for disaster resilience R&D. There was a reduction in the request for Laboratory Facilities due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. The FY2013 request for the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) within DHS included a reduction of $50 million in Laboratory Facilities funding, mainly due to the absence of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The House-passed bill allocated $826 million for S&T, $6 million less than the request, with $72 million less for RDI. The House Appropriations Committee directed DHS to determine how to distribute the reduction across the six thrust areas. The House Appropriations Committee directed DHS to determine how to allocate a $72 million reduction in RDI funding across six thrust areas. The bill provided $75 million more for Laboratory Facilities, with the increase earmarked for NBAF construction. The Senate recommended S&T funding levels matching the Administration's request, but specified separate amounts for each thrust area within RDI. The committee recommended no funding for NBAF construction, citing a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion. P.L. 113-6 provides $834 million for the S&T Directorate after rescissions, $28 million less than requested for RDI. The explanatory statement directs DHS to detail how RDI funding is allocated by thrust areas. The S&T Directorate receives $834 million, $28 million less than requested for RDI. The act directs DHS to provide a breakdown of RDI funding allocation by thrust area. $37 million is allocated for Laboratory Facilities, with additional funds for NBAF construction. The post-sequester total reported by DHS is $801 million. DNDO is responsible for DHS nuclear detection research and development. The Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is the primary DHS organization for combating nuclear threats, responsible for research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support. The Administration requested $328 million for DNDO in FY2013, a 13% increase from FY2012. Funding breakdown includes a $44 million increase for Transformational R&D and a $23 million reduction for Systems Development. Requests for human-portable radiation detectors increased by $20 million, while radiation portal monitors decreased to $1 million from $7 million in FY2012. The House-passed bill proposed $316 million for DNDO, $12 million less than the requested amount. The bill focused on reducing funding for the Transformational R&D program and called for an updated implementation plan for the global nuclear detection architecture. Additionally, the House Appropriations Committee suggested consolidating DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs for potential cost savings and improved coordination. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for DNDO that matched the Administration's request and directed DHS to provide an updated implementation plan for the global nuclear detection architecture. The committee did not address the potential consolidation of DNDO and OHA. The Senate committee report did not address the potential consolidation of DNDO and OHA. P.L. 113-6 provides $318 million for DNDO, $9 million less than the request for Transformational R&D. DHS is directed to review its WMD programs and evaluate the potential advantages of consolidation, including merging DNDO and OHA. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO, as reported by DHS, is $303 million. Table 22 outlines the funding levels for existing DNDO program functions. The \"DHS Plan\" column provides the department's assessment of post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013. Title V of the DHS appropriations bill contains general provisions that may include rescissions of funding from previous years and appropriations for special initiatives. This section of the report discusses new general provisions with a direct impact. The report discusses new general provisions in the DHS appropriations bill for FY2013, including rescissions and appropriations for special initiatives. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 35 general provisions from the FY2012 bill, with three being rescissions and eleven viewed as one-time provisions. Five provisions were permanent changes in the U.S. Code, and one was deemed obsolete. The Administration proposed not carrying forward 15 general provisions from the FY2012 bill, deemed \"restrictive\" and hindering the Department's ability to manage its affairs. They also suggested adding five new provisions, including extending the termination deadline for E-Verify and allowing FEMA to use earmarked grant funds for hazard mitigation. The House-passed H.R. 5855 includes provisions for fees collected under the United States Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement to pay for customs inspectors and equipment. CBP can enter into reimbursable fee agreements to provide services. The bill includes $292 million in rescissions to reduce the net scoring. The House added and dropped various general provisions, including extending the termination deadline for E-Verify. The House added 13 general provisions to H.R. 5855, including restrictions on funds for racial profiling, ICE rule enforcement, Public Advocate position, alternative transportation fuels, and Section 1301(a) implementation. The House added provisions to restrict funds for racial profiling, ICE rule enforcement, the Public Advocate position, alternative transportation fuels, and Section 1301(a) implementation. It also included restrictions on government officials sharing immigration status information and purchasing new light-duty vehicles without following guidelines. The curr_chunk discusses various actions related to immigration enforcement, including operating armed drones, detaining criminal aliens, providing language access services, enforcing policy memos, and terminating agreements allowing local officials to act as immigration officers. The Senate bill includes $192 million in rescissions and provisions impacting the scoring of the bill. It offsets its cost by $68 million and drops 15 general provisions. Three provisions providing funding to DHS initiatives were modified to apply to FY2013. The Senate bill funded security costs for National Special Security Events, migration and consolidation of DHS data centers, and DHS headquarters consolidation. It included provisions allowing CBP to enter into reimbursable fee agreements and $307 million in rescissions. The bill offset costs by $202 million and dropped ten general provisions sought by the Administration. The enacted bill reduced spending by $202 million according to CBO. It dropped ten general provisions sought by the Administration and included funding for various DHS initiatives such as immigrant integration grants, security cost reimbursements, data center migration, and DHS headquarters consolidation. Federal government spending involves a process starting with budget authority enactment by Congress. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite, available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. Budget authority is available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. One-year budget authority is only for a specific fiscal year, while multi-year and no-year budget authority allow funds to be obligated over a range of time or indefinitely. Obligations are incurred when federal agencies engage in transactions, while outlays are the funds actually spent during the fiscal year. Budget authority may be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It is funded each year in appropriations acts and may consist of discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated yearly by Congress, while mandatory spending is mandated by existing law. The Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. Within DHS, the Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the federal government as part of a business-type transaction, not counted as revenue but as negative outlays. The DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset an agency's discretionary budget authority, while others offset an agency's mandatory spending, such as entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. These entitlements can be funded by permanent or annual appropriations. The Secret Service and Coast Guard retirement pay accounts are funded differently - Secret Service pay is a permanent appropriation, while Coast Guard pay is annually appropriated. The DHS budget also includes Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress. Since 9/11, there has been a focus on homeland security funding levels. The Office of Management and Budget publishes an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism, which now includes homeland security analysis. The analysis has become more refined over the years, with distinctions between homeland and non-homeland security activities becoming more precise. It is important to note that DHS funding does not cover all federal spending on homeland security, as other agencies also contribute to these efforts. The DHS homeland security budget for FY2012 accounted for nearly 52% of total federal funding for homeland security, with the Department of Defense at nearly 26%. The top five agencies collectively accounted for approximately 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. Not all DHS funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities. The FY2012 DHS budget included $35.1 billion for homeland security activities out of a total budget authority of $52.5 billion. The budget amounts in Table B-1 may not align with total amounts in the report, and this inconsistency applies to other agencies as well. No authoritative data for FY2013 is available due to the impact of sequestration and P.L. 113-6 on the Administration's budget release."
