    "title": "SB 127",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature acknowledges the disproportionate impact of drought on areas heavily reliant on groundwater. While state programs assist communities with water needs, individual homeowners with groundwater wells lack financial assistance for vital water improvements. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans and grants to individual homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment. This includes actions like digging deeper wells, addressing contaminants, or connecting to local systems. Chapter 6.6 is added to the Water Code to establish a Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program for eligible applicants. The program created by this act provides low-interest loans and grants to homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment. Eligible actions include extending service lines, paying fees for connections, closing abandoned septic tanks, deepening or improving wells, and installing water treatment systems for contaminated groundwater. The board may adopt regulations to carry out the purposes of the chapter. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is established in the State Treasury for expenditure by the board. Moneys deposited include repayments from grants or loans and interest earned. Eligible loan applicants must have a household income below the statewide median and own the residence. Eligible loan applicants must have a household income below the statewide median, own the residence, be unable to obtain financial assistance from private lenders, demonstrate ability to repay the loan, and secure the loan with a mortgage on the residence. The loan must be repaid within 20 years with a 1 percent interest rate, and the recipient must maintain homeowner's insurance on the residence. The board may contract with a private financial institution to provide loans for eligible applicants with low household income who own their residence and cannot obtain financial assistance elsewhere. Recipients must repay the grant if they sell the residence within five years or return any unused funds. Ten million dollars ($10,000,000) is transferred from the General Fund to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund. A grant recipient must repay any unused funds. This act is urgent for providing access to cleaner water during California's drought. Section 21168.6.7 of the Public Resources Code defines a \"water project\" funded by bonds from the Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014. The procedures outlined in this section apply to legal actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports or approvals for water projects. The Judicial Council must adopt a rule of court by July 1, 2016, to establish procedures for resolving actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports for water projects within 270 days. Environmental impact reports for water projects must include a notice in at least 12-point type. The draft and final environmental impact reports for water projects must include a notice in not less than 12-point type stating that certain comments filed after the public comment period for the draft report may not be considered. Judicial actions challenging the certification of the report or project approval are subject to specific procedures outlined in the Public Resources Code. The full text of this section must be included as an appendix in the reports. The draft and final environmental impact reports must include the full text of specific procedures outlined in the Public Resources Code. Within 10 days of releasing the draft report, an informational workshop must be conducted by the lead agency. Additionally, a public hearing must be held within 10 days before the close of the public comment period, with a transcript included in the final report. Following the public comment period, commenters on the draft environmental impact report can request nonbinding mediation within five days. Mediation must involve all relevant parties and be completed within 35 days. Mediators must be experienced in land use and environmental law, with costs covered by the applicant. (D)A mediation session shall be conducted on each area of dispute with the parties requesting mediation. The lead agency must adopt any agreed-upon measures as a condition of approval. Written comments submitted after the public comment period will only be considered if they address new issues raised in the response to comments by the lead agency. New issues raised in response to comments, new information released by the public agency post-draft EIR, project changes post-public comment period, proposed approval conditions, mitigation measures, and new unknown information. The lead agency must file a notice within five days after the last initial project approval and prepare and certify the record of proceedings, with the applicant covering all costs. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available to the public in an electronic format within three business days of release. Any additional documents related to the report must be accessible within five business days of preparation or receipt. The lead agency must make the draft environmental impact report and related documents available in an electronic format within three business days of release. Copyright protected documents not prepared specifically for the project do not need to be electronically accessible, but an index of these documents must be provided electronically. Written comments on the project should be encouraged to be submitted electronically, and made available to the public in the same format within five days of receipt. Within seven business days, the lead agency must convert any non-electronic comments into an electronic format for public access. Comments not considered by the agency will be noted in the record without including their content. Within five days of filing the required notice, the lead agency must certify and provide an electronic copy of the proceedings record to a party upon request. A reasonable fee may be charged for the copy. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint or petition, the agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the court. Any disputes over the record content will be resolved by the court, with parties required to file a motion to augment the record if necessary. In granting relief, the court shall not stay construction of a water project unless there is an imminent threat to public health or important unforeseen artifacts or values at the project site. The court will only enjoin specific activities of a water project if they pose a threat to public health or important artifacts/values. Any challenge to a project approval must follow certain requirements. No reimbursement is needed for this act as local agencies can cover the mandated costs."
