    "content": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions, prohibiting discrimination based on sex in programs receiving federal funding. The Supreme Court has ruled that schools can be held liable for a lack of response to such incidents, and federal agencies like the Department of Education enforce this responsibility. Title IX is enforced through private rights of action against schools and by federal agencies providing funding to educational programs. Compliance with Title IX is a condition for receiving federal funding in any education program, applying to all federally-funded schools. Title IX applies to all levels of education, with public school districts and higher education institutions receiving federal financial assistance. While the text of Title IX does not explicitly mention sexual abuse or harassment, Department of Education guidance instructs schools on addressing allegations of sexual harassment. Educational institutions have developed procedures in response to these guidelines. The Department of Education provides guidance to schools on their responsibilities under Title IX for addressing sexual harassment allegations. Recently, new proposed regulations could significantly change how educational institutions respond to such allegations. This report also examines how federal courts have interpreted Title IX in cases where students sue schools for damages related to sexual abuse or harassment. The report discusses private rights of actions by students against educational institutions for sexual abuse or harassment, federal enforcement of Title IX, constitutional challenges against public universities, and proposed regulations altering schools' responsibilities under Title IX. The Amendments of 1972 prohibit sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funding, but do not explicitly allow for private legal action for Title IX violations or define sexual harassment as discrimination. Title IX also does not specify when schools can be held liable for such behavior. Title IX does not specify when schools can be held liable for sexual harassment or abuse. Federal courts have established the legal framework for victims seeking relief under Title IX through a private right of action, including creating liability standards for sexual abuse or harassment by teachers and students. Title IX imposes liability on educational institutions for their response to sexual abuse or harassment, not just the occurrence of the misconduct. The standard for liability is high, requiring a showing of \"deliberate indifference\" to the conduct. The private right of action under Title IX implies a legal remedy for victims of sex discrimination, while administrative enforcement focuses on institutional policies. Supreme Court decisions outline the requirements for holding educational funding recipients liable for damages related to sexual abuse or harassment. Court decisions, including Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District and Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, establish that an educational institution can be held liable under Title IX for damages related to sexual abuse or harassment only if it shows \"deliberate indifference\" in responding to such conduct. This means the institution is not automatically liable for a teacher's or principal's actions, and liability is based on the institution's response to the knowledge of the abuse. The Court's standard in Gebser establishes that liability under Title IX is based on a funding recipient's own failure to act adequately in response to known misconduct, not the misconduct itself. Liability only occurs if deliberate indifference is shown, regardless of the egregiousness of the conduct. The Court relied on the statute's administrative enforcement provision to infer legislative intent regarding Title IX liability. Agencies can suspend or cut funds to a recipient for violating Title IX only after advising them and determining voluntary compliance is not possible. This procedure aligns with the Court's standard that liability is based on a recipient's failure to respond adequately to known misconduct, showing deliberate indifference. The Court reasoned that liability under Title IX requires \"actual notice\" to an \"appropriate person\" and deliberate indifference in response to known violations. This standard aligns with the statute's enforcement provision, which allows for sanctions only after advising the recipient and determining voluntary compliance is not possible. The Court held that a school district cannot be held liable under Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student without actual notice and deliberate indifference. Deliberate indifference is a high standard that must cause students to undergo harassment or make them vulnerable to it. Funding recipients are only considered deliberately indifferent if their response to harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The Court's standard for deliberate indifference under Title IX requires more than just unreasonableness in a funding recipient's response to sexual abuse or harassment. The recipient must be clearly unreasonable in its response to be held liable. Additionally, other threshold showings are necessary to prevail in a Title IX suit for damages. Gebser requires establishing \"actual knowledge of discrimination\" by an \"appropriate person\" at the funding recipient before addressing \"deliberate indifference.\" Failure to prove this may result in dismissal of a Title IX claim for damages related to sexual harassment or abuse. The definition of \"appropriate person\" and what constitutes \"actual\" notice have led to disagreements among the circuits. The Supreme Court's liability standard for student-to-student harassment requires a plaintiff to show \"substantial control\" by the funding recipient over the harasser, the harassment being severe and pervasive, and the denial of educational access. Davis limits liability to situations where the recipient had control over the harasser. The Supreme Court's liability standard for student-to-student harassment requires showing \"substantial control\" by the funding recipient over the harasser and the harassment being severe, pervasive, and denying educational access. The recipient may be liable for deliberate indifference to harassment if the harasser is under their disciplinary authority, emphasizing the recipient's authority to take remedial action. The harassment must occur in a context subject to the school district's control, and the conduct must be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it undermines the victims' educational experience, effectively denying equal access to resources and opportunities. The Supreme Court's liability standard for student-to-student harassment requires showing \"substantial control\" by the funding recipient over the harasser and the harassment being severe, pervasive, and denying educational access. Whether the conduct rises to this level depends on various circumstances, including the ages of the individuals involved. Harassment is actionable under Title IX only when it has a systemic effect of denying the victim equal access to education. The Supreme Court's Gebser and Davis decisions establish that a school or educational program receiving federal funding can be liable under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment only if it acted with \"deliberate indifference.\" Lower federal courts have varied in their interpretations of the evidence required to prove a Title IX claim. Lower federal courts have varied in their formulations of the evidence required to prove a Title IX claim, with some focusing on a \"hostile environment\" analysis for teacher-to-student harassment cases, while others emphasize elements such as \"actual\" notice of discrimination, \"appropriate person\" authorized to take corrective measures, and \"deliberate indifference\" by the funding recipient. Additionally, in cases of student-on-student harassment, courts require proof that the harassment was severe, pervasive, and impactful. Courts have varied in their formulations of evidence required to prove a Title IX claim, with some focusing on a \"hostile environment\" analysis for teacher-to-student harassment cases, while others emphasize elements such as \"actual\" notice of discrimination, \"appropriate person\" authorized to take corrective measures, and \"deliberate indifference\" by the funding recipient. In cases of student-on-student harassment, proof of severe, pervasive, and impactful harassment is required. Failure to satisfy any one of these elements may result in dismissal of a Title IX claim. Under Gebser, actual notice of discrimination by the funding recipient is necessary, not just evidence that they should have known about the misconduct. Federal courts differ on the evidence required to establish \"actual\" notice of sexual misconduct in Title IX cases, including whether knowledge of a substantial risk of abuse or specific allegations is sufficient. Some courts also differentiate between teacher-to-student abuse and student-on-student harassment. In Doe v. School Board of Broward County, the Eleventh Circuit determined that complaints from two students about a teacher's sexual misconduct were sufficient to alert the principal to the possibility of the teacher's abuse of a third student. The reports detailed multiple instances of sexual propositions, touching, and comments, establishing a pattern of behavior that gave the principal actual notice. In Baynard v. Malone, the Fourth Circuit found that despite prior reports of sexual abuse by a sixth grade teacher, the school principal did not have \"actual\" notice of the abuse. The evidence showed that the principal had met with a former student who reported being molested by the teacher, but the court ruled that this did not constitute actual notice of the abuse. The teacher's former students warned the principal about the teacher being a pedophile and exhibiting concerning behaviors. Another teacher and the school librarian also reported allegations of sexual misconduct. The court found that while the principal should have been aware of the potential for abuse, there was no evidence to support that the principal knew a student was being abused. The court dismissed the Title IX claim due to lack of evidence that the principal was aware of a student being abused. Courts vary in defining \"actual\" notice for Title IX liability for sexual abuse or harassment, requiring notice to an appropriate person with authority to address discrimination. Federal appellate case law shows that courts determine an \"appropriate person\" based on their ability to address misconduct or their position within the funding recipient's hierarchy. The Court's opinions in Gebser and Davis have led to varying interpretations by federal courts, especially in the school context, regarding who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX for addressing discrimination. In the school context, courts differ on who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" to address discrimination under Title IX. Some courts consider a principal as suitable based on their authority to investigate and take corrective action, while others have ruled differently. The Fourth Circuit ruled in Baynard v. Malone that a principal, despite supervising teachers, is not an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX. Another court held in Salazar v. South San Antonio Independent School District that a school official who sexually abuses a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person.\" The Fifth Circuit ruled that a school principal's sexual abuse of a student does not make him an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX, as it is unlikely he would report his own behavior or take corrective measures. The court also rejected the argument that the abuse should be considered an official action of the school district for Title IX liability purposes. The Fifth Circuit ruled that a school principal's sexual abuse of a student does not qualify him as an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX. Federal courts analyze the individual's ranking in the university hierarchy, responsibilities in handling harassment allegations, and ability to address misconduct to determine if they are an \"appropriate person\" for a Title IX private right of action. In some cases, even with evidence, individuals may not be deemed appropriate. For example, the Tenth Circuit held that campus security officers were not considered \"appropriate persons\" in Ross v. University of Tulsa. In Ross v. University of Tulsa, the Tenth Circuit ruled that campus security officers were not \"appropriate persons\" for the university to have actual notice of on-campus sexual assault, despite their mandatory reporting and participation in investigations. The court considered mandatory reporting as a clerical act and rejected the notion that participation in corrective processes automatically made someone an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX. The determination of who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" can vary among courts. The determination of who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX can vary among courts. A court's analysis will likely depend on the characteristics indicative of an \"appropriate person\" and the evidence relating to the individual's responsibilities in the institution. To establish \"actual notice\" of discrimination, a plaintiff must prove deliberate indifference in the entity's response, which requires more than a failure to respond. Federal appellate courts interpret the standard for Title IX to require more than negligence or failure to respond reasonably. Liability for \"deliberate indifference\" is not avoided by remedying harassment. Courts analyze the recipient's knowledge and response to determine if it was clearly unreasonable. \"Deliberate indifference\" cases involve recipients not responding to actual notice of harassment or abuse. The recipient's response to actual notice of sexual harassment or abuse is crucial in determining deliberate indifference. Federal case law shows varying analyses on what constitutes deliberate indifference, with courts setting a high bar to meet. For example, in Doe ex rel. Doe v. Dallas Independent School District, despite evidence of a deficient response, the court did not find deliberate indifference. In a case involving allegations of sexual abuse by a third-grade teacher, the district's response, though arguably deficient, was not deemed deliberate indifference by the court. Despite evidence of the principal's inadequate actions, such as failing to report the abuse to authorities and not monitoring the teacher, the court found that these actions did not amount to deliberate indifference. The court found that the school's response to allegations of teacher sexual misconduct was not deliberately indifferent, despite serious deficiencies in the principal's actions. The principal had received complaints from two students about the same teacher, but only obtained a written statement from the second student, failing to take further action. The principal failed to take appropriate action in response to complaints of teacher sexual misconduct, despite being aware of a possible pattern. The court criticized the principal for not notifying the school board's investigative unit about the allegations involving the same teacher who was previously investigated. The court concluded that the school's response was inadequate and could be considered deliberate indifference. The court criticized the school for failing to take corrective measures regarding teacher sexual harassment, which could be seen as deliberate indifference. Some courts have addressed allegations of deliberate indifference not covered in previous court decisions. For example, in Simpson v. University of Colorado, Boulder, the Tenth Circuit discussed a case where the university allegedly had an \"official policy of deliberate indifference\" by not providing proper training or guidance despite an obvious need for it. The court highlighted evidence of the university coaching staff's prior knowledge of sexual assaults during football recruitment and by football players, including a recent rape case. The head coach resisted recruiting reforms despite advice from the district attorney. One player received little guidance on his responsibilities as a \"player-host.\" The court emphasized evidence of the head coach's knowledge of sexual assaults during football recruitment and lack of changes to the program. This created a triable issue of deliberate indifference under Title IX. In addition to private rights of action, Title IX is enforced by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs, with termination or suspension of federal funds as the ultimate sanction for violations. Agencies can issue regulations and orders to enforce the statute. Federal agencies enforce Title IX by issuing regulations and orders to ensure compliance with the statute. The Secretary of Education plays a key role in enforcing Title IX against educational institutions that receive federal assistance. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and OCR collaborate in enforcing Title IX, with OCR having primary responsibility for enforcing the statute directly against recipients of financial assistance from ED. ED has regulations implementing Title IX for all levels of educational institutions receiving federal assistance. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and OCR collaborate in enforcing Title IX, with OCR primarily responsible for enforcing the statute against recipients of financial assistance from ED. Regulations apply to educational institutions at all levels receiving federal assistance, prohibiting sex-based discrimination and requiring the designation of a Title IX Coordinator. OCR conducts reviews and investigations to ensure compliance with Title IX regulations. Title IX and OCR conduct reviews and investigations to ensure compliance with regulations. OCR receives complaints and can seek informal resolution or take formal enforcement measures if violations are found. ED's OCR has issued guidance documents interpreting Title IX to include sexual harassment and outlining responsibilities for educational institutions. The guidance documents interpreting Title IX bar sexual harassment and define responsibilities for educational institutions. The documents reflect a different analysis for assessing Title IX liability compared to Supreme Court case law on private rights of action for damages. ED applies a constructive notice requirement for schools' Title IX responsibility, rather than \"actual notice.\" The Supreme Court requires a \"clearly unreasonable\" response for liability, while ED sets baseline standards for compliance with Title IX. The ED has set baseline standards for schools to comply with Title IX, holding them responsible for sexual harassment under Title IX when a teacher commits misconduct. In 1997, OCR released guidance stating that sexual harassment of students by school employees is prohibited by Title IX, defining two types of sexual harassment: quid pro quo and hostile environment. The 1997 OCR guidance defines two types of sexual harassment under Title IX: quid pro quo harassment, where an educational decision is based on unwelcome sexual conduct, and hostile environment harassment, which creates a hostile or abusive educational environment. In cases of quid pro quo harassment, a school is liable if an employee in authority engages in harassment. In cases of hostile environment harassment by employees, a school is liable if the employee acts with apparent authority or is aided in the harassment. The 1997 OCR guidance outlines liability for sexual harassment under Title IX, distinguishing between quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment. In cases of hostile environment harassment by employees, a school may be liable if the employee acts with apparent authority. Additionally, schools are responsible for addressing their own discrimination by taking immediate corrective action when aware of harassment. The Supreme Court set a different standard for liability in private suits for damages against schools in cases of harassment. In Gebser (1998), the Court ruled that a school district is liable only when it has actual knowledge of allegations by an \"appropriate person\" and responds with deliberate indifference. In Davis (1999), the Court added that the harassment must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to deny the victim equal access to educational opportunities. The Court in Gebser distinguished between actions by a school that could result in Title IX liability for damages in a private right of action, and Title IX administrative requirements imposed by a federal agency in implementing and enforcing the statute. Agencies have the authority to enforce requirements that effectuate Title IX's mandate, even if those requirements do not define discrimination under the statute. This allows agencies to require compliance with procedures and rescind funding for violations, even if breaches of these requirements may not lead to liability in private suits for damages under Title IX. In response to Supreme Court decisions on liability in Title IX damages suits for sexual harassment, the Department of Education (ED) issued guidance reaffirming a school's responsibilities under Title IX. The liability standard for Title IX sexual harassment violations in damages suits is different from the administrative enforcement context. In 2001, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) issued a Revised Sexual Harassment guidance. In 2001, OCR issued a Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance document reaffirming the standards for enforcing Title IX regulations in educational institutions that receive federal funds. Schools must have grievance procedures for resolving complaints of sexual harassment promptly and equitably to comply with Title IX. The 2001 Guidance document emphasizes the importance of schools having grievance procedures for resolving complaints of sexual harassment promptly and equitably to comply with Title IX regulations. Failure to do so would result in a violation of Title IX, and educational institutions must take prompt and effective action to end harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects. The guidance documents serve to inform the public about the agency's approach to enforcing laws and regulations, but they do not carry the force of law. The 2001 Guidance document explains that sexual harassment constitutes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature and can limit a student's ability to benefit from a school's program based on sex. It outlines types of harassment such as quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment. In the context of Title IX, sexual harassment can be categorized into quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment. Quid pro quo harassment involves a teacher or employee conditioning benefits on a student's submission to unwelcome sexual conduct, while hostile environment harassment requires an investigation into whether the conduct is serious enough to limit a student's ability to benefit from the school's program. In evaluating hostile environment harassment, OCR considers all relevant circumstances, including whether the conduct was welcome. The extent of a school's responsibility to address harassment by teachers or employees depends on whether it occurs within the context of their job responsibilities. In cases of harassment by teachers or employees that limit a student's participation in school programs, the school is responsible for stopping the behavior, preventing its recurrence, and remedying the effects on the victim, regardless of prior notice. The determination of whether sexual harassment falls within an employee's job responsibilities depends on various factors, with quid pro quo harassment clearly falling within this scope. For hostile environment harassment, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) evaluates multiple factors to assess if the behavior occurred within an employee's job responsibilities. The 2001 Guidance outlines that schools must take prompt and effective action to address harassment that creates a hostile environment, whether it occurs within an employee's job responsibilities or not. Schools are responsible for ending the harassment, preventing its recurrence, and remedying its effects on students. In cases of harassment, schools must take action to end, prevent, and remedy the effects for the student. The 2001 Guidance states that schools are responsible for addressing sexual harassment by employees, students, or third parties if a responsible school employee knew or should have known about the harassment. A responsible employee is one with the authority to address harassment or report misconduct. School officials must address sexual harassment or misconduct by students or employees, even if not reported through proper channels. Title IX violations occur if a school is aware of a hostile environment and fails to take immediate corrective action. Schools must promptly investigate and take steps to end harassment, prevent future incidents, and eliminate a hostile environment. The school must promptly investigate reports of harassment by students or parents, take appropriate steps to resolve the situation, and prevent future incidents. Informal mechanisms may be used if parties agree, but certain procedures like mediation are not suitable. The OCR Guidance allows for informal mechanisms to resolve complaints if parties agree, but certain procedures like mediation are not appropriate for cases like alleged sexual assault. Schools must ensure due process rights do not delay Title IX protections for the complainant. In 2011, OCR issued a Dear Colleague Letter focusing on peer-to-peer harassment and defining sexual harassment as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment, as defined by a Dear Colleague Letter, includes unwelcome sexual conduct, advances, requests, and violence. It creates a hostile environment that interferes with a student's participation in school programs. Schools must take immediate action to address and prevent harassment. The Letter emphasized the need for schools to address and prevent sexual harassment promptly, even if it occurs off-campus. Schools must consider the effects of off-campus conduct when evaluating a hostile environment on campus. Criminal investigations into sexual violence do not exempt schools from conducting Title IX investigations. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized that criminal investigations into sexual violence do not excuse schools from conducting Title IX investigations promptly. Schools should not delay their own investigations and must take immediate steps to protect students. The Letter also outlined key elements of grievance procedures for resolving sexual harassment complaints effectively. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter highlighted the importance of prompt and fair resolution of sexual harassment complaints, emphasizing the use of a preponderance of evidence standard. This standard is lower than the previous \"clear and convincing\" standard and discourages personal cross-examination during hearings. The 2014 Q&A document provided more specific instructions to schools on handling allegations of student-on-student sexual violence under Title IX, emphasizing the immediate investigation of possible incidents. The 2014 Q&A clarified that schools must promptly investigate possible sexual violence cases and take effective steps to address them. Title IX requires schools to protect complainants and ensure their safety through interim measures before completing an investigation. The 2014 Q&A clarified the requirements of Title IX regarding the responsibilities of a school's Title IX Coordinator, written grievance procedures for sexual violence complaints, and the individuals who must report allegations. It also outlined the requirements for schools conducting investigations into sexual violence cases. The 2014 Q&A emphasized the importance of schools conducting their own Title IX investigations into complaints of sexual violence, even if a criminal investigation is ongoing. It stated that sanctions alone may not be enough to address the issue and prevent recurrence, and that schools are not required to hold hearings for allegations of sexual violence. Schools were advised by the 2014 Q&A to conduct their own investigations into sexual violence complaints, without requiring the complainant to attend hearings. Cross-examination was discouraged, with parties allowed to submit questions to a third party for screening. Schools developed various procedures to comply with Title IX in response to guidance from the Department of Education. In response to allegations of sexual assault, schools developed procedures to comply with Title IX, which vary across institutions. Public universities faced challenges in disciplinary procedures from students claiming violations of due process rights. Several students challenged disciplinary procedures in state and federal courts as unconstitutional, specifically regarding Title IX procedures for sexual misconduct cases. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires certain procedures to be followed when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property, protecting against the deprivation of \"property interests\" without due process. These property interests are not created by the Constitution but arise from independent sources like state or federal law. The Due Process Clause protects property interests that originate from independent sources like state or federal law. When a state deprives an individual of liberty, due process must be afforded. Courts require state action that alters legal status to constitute a deprivation of liberty. The procedures required before depriving individuals of protected interests can vary, with courts balancing three factors. The Due Process Clause protects property interests originating from state or federal law. When depriving individuals of liberty, courts balance factors such as private interest, risk of error, and government interest. Individuals with protected interests are entitled to notice and a chance to be heard before deprivation. Due process is flexible and varies based on circumstances. The concept of due process is flexible and requires procedural protections based on the severity of deprivation. In cases like Mathews v. Eldridge, the private interest at risk determines the level of procedures needed. Goss v. Lopez focused on procedural due process in student discipline, ruling that students have a legitimate entitlement to education and must have a minimum level of process before suspension. The Supreme Court ruled that public education is a protected property interest under due process, requiring notice and a hearing for student suspensions. More severe sanctions may need formal procedures. Public universities must adhere to constitutional standards for student discipline, while private universities are not bound by the Due Process Clause. Students at public universities are assumed to have a constitutionally protectable property right in their enrollment. Federal courts have ruled that students in public universities have property interests in their education, requiring due process in disciplinary actions. Due process includes notice of charges, evidence disclosure, and the right to present their side to an unbiased decision maker. Procedures to satisfy due process vary depending on the circumstances of each case. Recent judicial rulings have addressed the constitutionality of disciplinary proceedings in cases of sexual misconduct at public universities. Courts have considered claims such as inadequate notice of charges and denial of the right to confront and challenge evidence. The recent judicial rulings have addressed the constitutionality of disciplinary proceedings in cases of sexual misconduct at public universities. The university failed to provide adequate notice of charges, did not allow the accused student to confront witnesses, had biased decisionmakers, and employed unfair review processes. Students accused of sexual misconduct challenge the lack of notice as a due process violation. The lack of notice of charges in disciplinary proceedings for sexual misconduct at universities can lead to a due process violation. For example, a student was suspended for three years without being properly informed of the allegations against him, resulting in a court ruling that his due process rights were violated. The court ruled that a lack of notice in a disciplinary case could violate due process rights, as seen in a case where a student was suspended for three years without proper information on the allegations. Another student faced expulsion for misconduct not clearly outlined in the initial notice, leading to a court finding that the school's limited focus prejudiced the student's defense. This, along with other procedural issues, resulted in the school being accused of depriving the student of due process. The court found that a university violated a student's due process rights by not providing evidence used in a disciplinary decision. This failure to disclose evidence was deemed a constitutional violation, as students have brought claims alleging denial of due process in similar situations. Courts have often rejected claims of denial of due process in school disciplinary hearings, noting that students' rights are not the same as criminal defendants. However, courts may entertain claims when students are denied the opportunity to challenge witness credibility on critical facts. Cross-examination is not always considered necessary for due process in civil contexts, even in cases outside of sexual harassment allegations. In civil contexts, cross-examination has not been seen as essential for due process. Courts have rejected due process challenges in university adjudicatory proceedings, including those related to sexual harassment allegations. Students may not always have the right to directly cross-examine witnesses in school disciplinary hearings. Despite challenges to proceedings regarding sexual assault allegations, courts have upheld the decisions, emphasizing that the Due Process Clause does not guarantee the right to cross-examination in such cases. The Sixth Circuit and Fifth Circuit rejected due process challenges to university disciplinary proceedings involving sexual assault allegations. Students were not allowed to directly cross-examine their accuser but could submit written questions. The courts found that the limited cross-examination satisfied the requirements, emphasizing the burden on the school outweighed the marginal benefit of allowing follow-up questions. In a due process challenge to a university's disciplinary proceedings, the court noted that the decision was based on videos and a photo, not testimonial evidence. However, courts have ruled in favor of due process challenges when credibility determinations are critical. For example, the Sixth Circuit found a university violated due process by not allowing cross-examination when the disciplinary decision relied on a credibility determination from hearsay evidence. The court emphasized the importance of allowing the accused to question their accuser in disciplinary hearings to assess credibility and ensure due process. A live hearing may be necessary in cases where credibility determinations are crucial, as seen in a federal district court ordering a university to provide one for a student facing expulsion. The court ordered a university to provide an accused student with a live hearing to ensure due process, as the university's procedures did not allow for questioning or cross-examination. This violated the student's rights according to the court. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a university must allow the accused student to cross-examine the accuser and adverse witnesses in the presence of a neutral fact-finder to ensure due process. This decision was made after the university's appeals board reversed a finding of sexual misconduct based on more persuasive testimonies without giving the accused student a chance to cross-examine. Some students claim they were denied due process by not being able to present exculpatory evidence, such as text messages, in disciplinary hearings for sexual harassment or assault. Courts examine these claims on a case-by-case basis, with one court ruling that such denial raised due process concerns. Students have also challenged decisions alleging bias from decision-makers in these proceedings at higher education institutions. Courts generally assume school disciplinary panels are impartial unless actual bias is shown. Allegations of bias must be supported by evidence, such as statements or a pattern of biased decision-making. For example, a Fifth Circuit panel rejected a bias claim in a university sexual assault hearing due to lack of evidence undermining the proceedings' integrity. The victim advocate investigating the case provided findings to the panel based on photo and video evidence. The court upheld a disciplinary decision based on photo and video evidence, finding no indication that a different investigator would have changed the outcome. However, bias in decision-makers' behavior or statements can lead to a due process challenge, as seen in a Sixth Circuit case where a student alleged bias in a sexual assault hearing where a panel member acted as investigator, prosecutor, and judge. The court found that a disciplinary hearing for alleged sexual assault was biased as one panel member acted as investigator, prosecutor, and judge. The student alleged that the panel member was not impartial and had pre-judged the case. Courts have addressed claims of bias based on institutional pressures, such as sexual assault training received by university officials. The court rejected a due process claim regarding biased university staff members receiving sexual assault training. The court found the plaintiffs' belief of bias unsupported by evidence. In contrast, another court allowed a due process claim by an expelled student alleging biased investigation and training materials for the panel. The court found that training materials given to the panel deciding a student's case were biased, potentially leading to a due process violation. Several federal district court cases have addressed similar allegations of unfair review processes in university disciplinary proceedings. The university ordered a new hearing for a student cleared of sexual assault, which was deemed unfair by the district court. In another case, a student was found not responsible initially but later found guilty without proper notice or opportunity to respond to new evidence. The university failed to provide a fair hearing for a student accused of sexual assault, not informing him of key details and denying him the opportunity to attend the appeal board's meeting. The appeals board reversed the initial decision without explanation or live testimony, leading to a federal district court ruling that the student was not given a meaningful hearing. Another student was expelled for sexual assault after a rehearing, despite being found not responsible initially. The student was expelled after a flawed appeal process where the presiding individual conducted off-the-record meetings with the accuser, leading to a violation of due process. In response, OCR withdrew previous guidance documents in 2017 to begin the rulemaking process for schools. In September 2017, OCR withdrew the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2014 Questions and Answers document, stating it would start the rulemaking process for Title IX responsibilities. During this time, schools were advised to follow the 2001 Guidance and a new Question and Answer document was issued. This document allowed for mediation in certain cases and outlined appeal options for parties involved in sexual misconduct cases. On November 29, 2018, a notice of proposed rulemaking was issued in the Federal Register, proposing significant changes to how schools handle sexual harassment allegations. The proposed regulation in the Federal Register would redefine sexual harassment under Title IX, require \"actual notice\" of harassment for schools to respond, only consider a school's response as a violation if it shows deliberate indifference, and introduce new procedural requirements for due process in investigations. The proposed regulation redefines sexual harassment under Title IX, setting a higher threshold for hostile environment harassment than before. It requires \"actual notice\" of harassment for school response, only considers deliberate indifference as a violation, and introduces new procedural requirements for due process in investigations. The proposed regulations redefine sexual harassment under Title IX, setting a higher threshold for hostile environment harassment. It requires \"actual notice\" of harassment for school response and introduces new procedural requirements for due process in investigations. The proposed regulations under Title IX set a higher threshold for defining sexual harassment as a hostile environment. Schools are required to respond to allegations of sexual harassment only when they have \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice to a school's Title IX Coordinator or official with authority to take corrective measures. This departs from past practices that considered \"constructive notice\" triggering a school's responsibilities. The proposed regulations under Title IX set a higher threshold for defining sexual harassment as a hostile environment. Schools are required to respond to allegations of sexual harassment only when they have \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice to a school's Title IX Coordinator or official with authority to take corrective measures. The regulations explicitly reject imputing knowledge to a school based on respondeat superior or constructive notice. The proposal explains that this threshold for triggering a school's obligations is intended to align the administrative standard imposed by ED with that articulated by the Supreme Court in Gebser and Davis in the context of private litigation seeking money damages. Further, the proposed regulations would compel schools to respond only to sexual harassment that occurs within a school's \"education program or activity.\" This contrasts with past ED guidance which provided that schools sometimes will be responsible to respond to harassment that occurs \"outside a school's education program or activity.\" The proposed regulations under Title IX set a higher threshold for defining sexual harassment as a hostile environment. Schools are required to respond to allegations of sexual harassment only when they have \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice to a school's Title IX Coordinator or official with authority to take corrective measures. The regulations reject imputing knowledge to a school based on respondeat superior or constructive notice. The proposed regulations would compel schools to respond only to sexual harassment that occurs within a school's \"education program or activity,\" shifting away from past guidance that required responses to harassment outside of these parameters.
