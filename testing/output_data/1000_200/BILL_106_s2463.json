    "content": "The Act titled \"National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000\" establishes a moratorium on the death penalty. Congress finds that death sentences are disproportionately imposed on the poor and certain racial and ethnic groups, with evidence showing disparities in legal representation and execution rates. The House Judiciary Subcommittee found that 89% of defendants selected for capital prosecution under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 were African-American or Hispanic American. Additionally, a 1990 report by the General Accounting Office highlighted racial disparities in charging, sentencing, and imposition of the death penalty. The Supreme Court has restricted death row prisoners' rights to appeal convictions and sentences in Federal courts, even with compelling evidence of innocence. Legislation in 1996 limited Federal court review of death penalty appeals and reduced public funding for legal aid services for death row prisoners, increasing the risk of imprisoning and executing innocent individuals. The Federal Government and States are prohibited from carrying out the death penalty until Congress reviews the final findings and recommendations of the National Commission on the Death Penalty. This moratorium will remain in place until legislation is enacted based on the Commission's guidelines and procedures. The National Commission on the Death Penalty is established with 15 members appointed by the President. The Commission includes prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges.
