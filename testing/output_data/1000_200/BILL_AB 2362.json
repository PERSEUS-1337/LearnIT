    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Existing law requires landlords to provide written notification to tenants before applying pesticides in certain ways without a licensed pest control operator. The bill aims to ensure that owners and tenants in common interest developments are notified in writing before pesticides are applied by the homeowner association or its agents, similar to the notification required when pesticides are applied by a licensed pest control operator.Adjacent separate interests are defined as those directly beside, above, or below a particular separate interest or common area. For the purposes of this section, \"Adjacent separate interest\" refers to a separate interest directly beside, above, or below another separate interest or common area. \"Authorized agent\" is an entity acting on behalf of the association. \"Broadcast application\" is spreading pesticide over an area larger than two square feet. \"Electronic delivery\" is sending a document electronically to an owner's authorized address. \"Licensed pest control operator\" is someone licensed to apply pesticides. \"Pest\" is a living organism causing property damage, economic loss, or disease transmission. (6) \"Pest\" refers to a living organism causing damage or disease transmission. (7) \"Pesticide\" is a substance used to control pests, excluding certain types defined by federal law. An association or its agent must provide written notice to owners and tenants before applying pesticides without a licensed pest control operator. The notice must include information on the pests to be controlled and the name of the pesticide product to be used, as required by state law. CAUTION \u2013 Pesticides are toxic chemicals. Unlicensed use is allowed based on scientific evidence of minimal risks if used properly. Minimize exposure to reduce risk. If experiencing symptoms after pesticide application, contact a physician or California Poison Control. For more information, contact County Health Department for health questions and Department of Pesticide Regulation for regulatory information (916-324-4100). Prior notification of pesticide application is required, including the approximate date, time, and frequency. Notice must be given to owners and tenants at least 48 hours in advance, with a disclaimer that the information is subject to change. Prior notification of pesticide application is required at least 48 hours in advance. The association must post a written notice in the common area or provide individual notice to owners and tenants adjacent to the area. In case of immediate health and safety threat, notice must be posted within one hour after application. Tenants can receive notice through mail or personal delivery. Notice to tenants of separate interests can be provided through first-class mail, personal delivery to tenants 18 years or older, or electronic delivery if an electronic mailing address is provided. Upon receipt of written notification, the owner or tenant can agree in writing or electronically to allow pesticide application immediately or at an agreed-upon time. The association or authorized agent may agree orally to immediate pesticide application before receiving written notification if requested by the owner or tenant. The association must provide written notice for immediate pesticide application to owners or tenants, ensuring it is easily discoverable. If adjacent owners or tenants need to be notified, the notice must be given promptly, but no later than the start of pesticide application. A written notice must be attached to the board meeting minutes following the pesticide application."
