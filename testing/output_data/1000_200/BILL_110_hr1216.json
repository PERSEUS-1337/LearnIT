Safety Act of 2007, mandates the Secretary of Transportation to consider implementing safety standards for power windows on motor vehicles. These standards would require power windows to automatically reverse direction when detecting an obstruction to prevent injuries or fatalities, especially among children. The Secretary must prescribe safety standards for power windows on motor vehicles within 30 months of the Act's enactment. If no additional standards are deemed necessary, a report must be submitted to relevant committees, and information on vehicle safety must be made public. The Secretary will revise FMVSS 111 to improve rearward visibility for drivers to detect areas behind vehicles, reducing accidents involving small children and disabled persons. Different requirements may be set for various vehicle types. The Secretary will revise FMVSS 111 to improve rearward visibility for drivers by adding mirrors, sensors, cameras, or other technology. Final standards must be set within 36 months, with full compliance required within 48 months after the final rule is issued. The Secretary will establish phase-in priorities for rearward visibility safety standards based on data on backing incidents. Regulations will specify the types of motor vehicles to be phased-in first and the percentages by which they will be phased-in. Additionally, measures will be taken to prevent motor vehicles from rolling away. Each motor vehicle with an automatic transmission manufactured after September 1, 2010, must have a system that requires the brake to be depressed before shifting out of \"park\". Violation of this requirement is treated as a safety standard violation and enforced by the Secretary. Each motor vehicle manufacturer must submit information on noncompliant vehicles with automatic transmissions to the Secretary. The Secretary will then publish the make and model of these vehicles to the public. The Act requires motor vehicle manufacturers to submit information on noncompliant vehicles with automatic transmissions to the Secretary, who will then publish the make and model of these vehicles to the public. Any vehicle not listed is presumed to comply with the safety standards. The definition of a motor vehicle excludes motorcycles, trailers, and vehicles over 10,000 pounds. Additionally, there is a provision for a database on injuries and deaths in nontraffic, noncrash events. The Act mandates manufacturers to report noncompliant vehicles with automatic transmissions to the Secretary for public disclosure. Excluded vehicles include motorcycles, trailers, and those over 10,000 pounds. A database on injuries and deaths in nontraffic, noncrash events involving motor vehicles will be established by the Secretary within 12 months, containing details like causes of injuries, vehicle information, and other relevant variables. The Secretary will establish a database on injuries and deaths in nontraffic, noncrash events involving motor vehicles, including causes of injuries and other relevant variables. Information from this database will be made available to the public through the Internet and other means. Additionally, the Secretary will provide information about hazards to children in nontraffic, noncrash incident situations by supplementing an existing consumer information program or creating a new one, utilizing relevant data collected. The Secretary will establish priorities for the program using collected data, address risks to small children, and make program information available to the public. If deadlines cannot be met, new deadlines will be established and relevant committees will be notified. If deadlines cannot be met, new deadlines will be established and relevant committees will be notified. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
