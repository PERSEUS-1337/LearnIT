    "content": "The \"Ballistics, Law Assistance, and Safety Technology Act\" or the \"BLAST Act\" aims to increase public safety by assisting law enforcement in solving gun-related crimes through ballistics technology. It requires ballistics testing of all new firearms for sale and those in custody of Federal agencies to aid in identifying firearms used in crimes. Additionally, it adds ballistics testing to existing firearms enforcement programs. SEC. 3 amends the definition of ballistics in the United States Code to include a comparative analysis of fired bullets and cartridge casings to identify the firearm used. Amendment to Section 923 of title 18, US Code requires licensed manufacturers or importers to test fire firearms, prepare ballistics images, store records in a database, and store fired bullet and cartridge casings as specified by the Secretary. No civil liability except for civil penalties. The Attorney General and the Secretary will assist firearm manufacturers and importers in complying with requirements related to ballistics equipment, database maintenance, personnel hiring, and education for firearm crime reduction. The Attorney General and the Secretary will coordinate with law enforcement agencies and the firearm industry to reduce firearm-related crime and trafficking. They will establish a computer system for accessing ballistics records and encourage training for ballistics examiners. They are required to submit reports to the Senate Judiciary Committee annually. The Attorney General and the Secretary will submit an annual report to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the impact of the section, including the use of ballistics records in criminal investigations, accessibility across jurisdictions, and evaluation of test programs. The Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury are authorized $20,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 for ballistics equipment, testing sites, personnel salaries, and research. The Secretary and the Attorney General are required to conduct mandatory ballistics testing on firearms in their possession. The effective date of this amendment is determined by the Attorney General and the Secretary. The amendment made by subsection (a) will take effect when the ballistics systems of the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury are interoperable for mandatory ballistics testing of new firearms. Ballistics testing under Section 923(m)(1) will start 5 years after the enactment of the Act, while Section 923(m)(6) will be effective immediately upon enactment. Privacy rights of law-abiding citizens are protected under this Act, stating that ballistics information can only be used for prosecutorial purposes if law enforcement officials have a reasonable belief that a crime has been committed and that the information would assist in the investigation."
