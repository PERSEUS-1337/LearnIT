Participation is voluntary, with 85% of employees and 90% of retirees enrolled. Coverage options include individual, family, and self plus one plans in fee-for-service or health maintenance organizations. Premiums are shared between the federal. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents through fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Premiums are shared between the federal government and the employee or retiree. Benefits and cost sharing vary among FEHB plans, covering basic services like hospital and physician care with deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance. Prior to FEHB's creation in 1959, federal employees obtained health insurance independently or through union plans. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established parameters for eligibility, coverage election, types of health plans, and government's share of premiums for federal employees. It also created an Employees Health Benefits Fund and outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in managing the program. FEHBA established the role of OPM in managing the program and the government's authority to contract with insurers. The general model of FEHB, with enrollees choosing coverage from private insurers, has remained consistent. Changes have been made to the government's share of premiums and eligibility, services, and benefits have been expanded over time through legislative modifications by Congress. Since its inception, the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program has seen an increase in eligibility, services, and benefits. Congress plays a role in modifying the program, either proposing changes or reacting to them. The FEHB model involves competing insurers offering various coverage options to enrollees with minimal intervention from OPM. This model is considered successful in allowing enrollees to make cost-conscious choices and controlling overall program costs. Researchers have explored the possibility of applying aspects of the FEHB model to other healthcare programs like Medicare. Researchers have considered exporting aspects of the successful FEHB model to other healthcare programs, such as Medicare, and expanding access to provide coverage to non-federal workers. Some policymakers have introduced legislation to create new programs or expand FEHB eligibility. Lessons from FEHB have been seen as instructive for establishing health insurance exchanges under the ACA. Congressional interest in FEHB extends beyond its potential applicability as a model for other healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has sparked Congressional interest in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which Congress has a financial interest in and legislative authority to restructure. This report aims to explain the evolution of FEHB and how Congress has interacted with the program, including conditioning the use of federal funds on policy changes. Congress has conditioned the use of federal funds on policy changes in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. Changes include modifying the formula for determining the government's share of FEHB premiums, eligibility criteria, and policies affecting the relationship between Medicare and FEHB. Additionally, Congress passed laws prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions, except in cases where the woman's life is in danger. The provision prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions was renewed annually with few changes, except in 1994 and 1995 when it was excluded. The government's share of FEHB premiums has increased over the years, with the formula for determining the share changing in 1971 to the \"big six\" formula. The \"big six\" formula for setting the government's share of FEHB premiums was introduced in 1971, with the government contributing 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans. This formula replaced the original 40% share and was in effect until 1997 when it was updated by the Balanced Budget Act. Eligible participants included federal employees, retirees, and their family members. Since its enactment, eligibility for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program has been extended to various categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members. In 1978, part-time employees were included, and in 1988, certain temporary workers became eligible. Temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) was also authorized in 1988, allowing separated employees to continue FEHB coverage for up to 18 months by paying the full premium. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program has expanded eligibility over the years to include part-time employees, retirees, and certain temporary workers. Temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) allows separated employees to maintain FEHB coverage for up to 18 months by paying the full premium, including the government's and employees' shares, and a 2% administrative fee. Children aging out of their parents' plans may qualify for 36 months of coverage. In 1982, Congress passed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, enabling federal workers to be eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program was established by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-382) on September 28, 1959. It set the parameters for eligibility, enrollment procedures, benefits, premium shares, and the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for federal employees and retirees. Eligible participants included current federal employees and retirees who retired after July 1, 1960, with at least 12 years of service or for a disability. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, established in 1959, required retirees to have at least 12 years of service or retire due to disability. Participants had to be enrolled in an FEHB plan for at least five years prior to retirement. OPM could contract or approve different types of health benefit plans for FEHB participation. Employee Organization Plans provide health benefits to members of the organization sponsored by employee organizations. Comprehensive Medical Plans include group-practice prepayment plans and individual-practice prepayment plans. Government's share of premiums in FEHB plans depended on the type of plan and enrollee under P.L. 86-382. Under P.L. 86-382, the government's share of premiums in FEHB plans varied based on the type of plan and enrollee. The government's share was 50% of the lowest carrier rate for service and indemnity plans. Biweekly government shares ranged from $1.25 to $4.25 for individual and family coverage, with different rates for female employees with family coverage. For employee organization and comprehensive medical plans, the government's share was 50% of the biweekly premium, capped at $2.50 for individual coverage and $6.00 for family coverage. The Postal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1960 (P.L. 86-568) authorized FEHB coverage for employees of county committees under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act and their dependents. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 was amended by P.L. 88-59 in 1963 to provide additional choice of health benefits plans. P.L. 88-59 extended the deadline for applications to participate in FEHB to December 31, 1963, and removed the requirement for employee organizations to offer health care benefits before applying. P.L. 88-284 broadened FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. P.L. 88-284 expanded FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. It also allowed retirees to continue FEHB coverage if enrolled by December 31, 1964. OPM was given authority to terminate contracts with carriers not meeting enrollment requirements. The government's share of premiums was made equal for all enrollees, and changes were made to premium shares for certain plans. P.L. 88-531 authorized FEHB coverage for certain United States commissioners and their dependents if the Civil Service Retirement Act applies to the commissioners. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 was extended to provide coverage for teachers in the District of Columbia who had been temporarily employed for at least two school years. Congressional employees receiving certain staff fellowships were also granted FEHB coverage. Additionally, the Federal Salary and Fringe Benefits Act of 1966 made amendments to the FEHB. The Federal Salary and Fringe Benefits Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-504) amended the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program by changing the government share of premiums and extending coverage for dependent children. The National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-486) converted National Guard technicians to federal employee status, making them eligible for FEHB coverage. The Federal Magistrates Act of 1968 and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 expanded FEHB coverage to different groups of federal employees. The To Increase the Contribution by the Federal Government Act of 1970 adjusted the government's share of premiums to account for medical price inflation. The To Increase the Contribution by the Federal Government Act of 1970 established the \"big six\" formula for indexing government contributions to reflect medical price inflation. The government's share was set at 40% of the simple average of the big six premiums. Family members of deceased employees with less than five years of service could continue FEHB enrollment. The Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 extended FEHB coverage to federal employees assigned to state or local governments, maintaining their eligibility and coverage. It also provided coverage to state or local government employees assigned to an executive agency. P.L. 93-160 extended Civil Service Federal Employees Group Life Insurance and FEHB coverage to United States nationals employed by the federal government. P.L. 93-160 extended FEHB coverage to U.S. nationals employed by the federal government at duty stations outside the U.S. and Panama Canal Zone. P.L. 93-246 increased government's share of FEHB plan premium to 50% in 1974, with a provision to increase to 60% in 1975. Maximum government share set at 75% of total premium for any health plan. The Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHB) was expanded to include coverage for U.S. nationals working outside the country. The government's share of FEHB plan premiums was increased to 50% in 1974, with a provision to increase to 60% in 1975. A maximum limit of 75% of the total premium for any health plan was set. Additionally, FEHB enrollees were granted direct access to clinical psychologists and optometrists without the need for a referral. Payment or reimbursement for services performed by these professionals was also ensured. The amendments in P.L. 94-310 and P.L. 94-342 provided changes to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHB), including government's share of health plan premiums for retirees and restoring eligibility for health benefits coverage to certain individuals. The P.L. 95-368 established uniformity in benefits and coverage under FEHB by preempting certain state and local laws. It provided protections to medically underserved populations and allowed reenrollment in FEHB for surviving spouses with terminated annuities. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) allowed part-time career employees and their dependents to access FEHB coverage, defining part-time career employment as a 16-32 hour work week. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) defined part-time career employment as a 16-32 hour work week and allowed access to FEHB coverage. P.L. 95-583 reduced the required creditable service for FEHB coverage in retirement from 12 years to 5 years. The amendments in P.L. 96-54 and P.L. 96-70 redefined employee eligibility for FEHB coverage, excluding certain individuals based on citizenship and duty station. The amendments in P.L. 96-179 and P.L. 97-248 changed FEHB coverage requirements for federal employees, including eliminating the \"lives with\" requirement for natural children and adding a dependency requirement for all children. P.L. 97-248 also required federal employees to pay the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax starting January 1, 1983. The amendments in P.L. 97-346 required federal employees to pay the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax, allowing them to count their federal employment towards entitlement for premium-free benefits under Medicare Part A. Additionally, Medicare payments are secondary for employees aged 65 to 69 covered under certain employer group health plans. The amendments in P.L. 97-346 required OPM to determine the difference in government's share of health plan premiums for 1983 and pay the difference into contingency reserves of all FEHB plans. P.L. 98-151 prohibited the use of funds for abortions or administrative expenses for FEHB plans covering abortions, except in cases where the woman's life is endangered. The Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 extended FEHB coverage to former spouses of federal employees, who must pay both the employee's and government's share of the premium. A provision in appropriations bills since 1984 prohibits the use of funds for abortions in FEHB plans, except in cases where the woman's life is endangered. P.L. 99-53 authorized additional employee organization plans in FEHB if applied within 90 days. P.L. 99-251 allowed mixed model prepayment plans in FEHB. P.L. 99-251, enacted on February 27, 1986, introduced mixed model prepayment plans to participate in FEHB, combining group practice and individual practice prepayment plans. It eliminated the requirement for group practice prepayment plans to include physicians from three major specialties and mandated studies on extending FEHB contracting authority to health practitioners like nurse midwives and chiropractors. Additionally, it extended contracting authority to clinical social workers, with the option for health plans to require referral by a psychiatrist for reimbursement. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-251) granted authority to clinical social workers in FEHB, allowed health plans to require psychiatrist referral for reimbursement, emphasized adequate treatment for mental illness and addiction, directed OPM to assess FEHB information materials, waived service requirements for retirement coverage in exceptional cases, and allowed enrollees to change or cancel enrollment within a three-week period. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) required OPM to determine minimum financial reserves for health plans, with excess reserves to be returned to the Employees Health Benefits Fund. Starting October 1, 1986, USPS had to pay the government's share of health plan premiums for postal retirees. Medicare payments are secondary for employees aged 70 and older. The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-335) provided FEHB eligibility to individuals first employed by the government of the District of Columbia before October 1, 1987. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 (P.L. 99-569) provided health benefits for certain former spouses of CIA employees. The Joint Resolution Making Further Continuing Appropriations for the Fiscal Year 1988 (P.L. 100-202) added qualified clinical social workers to the group of non-physician providers for FEHB enrollees. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-203) made changes to Medicare payments for employees aged 70 and older.

The Making Technical Corrections Relating to the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act (P.L. 100-238) declared certain nonfederal employees ineligible for FEHB benefits after October 1, 1988. However, FEHB coverage continued for St. Elizabeth's Hospital employees who became District of Columbia employees. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-360) included provisions affecting FEHB that were later repealed by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-234). The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) required OPM to reduce rates based on estimated medical costs, report to Congress on incorporating health plans for Medicare-eligible individuals, and assess adopting NAIC standards for Medicare supplemental plans under FEHB. It also allowed OPM to impose sanctions on providers convicted of illegal activities. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) authorized OPM to impose debarment and sanctions on health care providers convicted of illegal activities, set time limits for debarment proceedings, prohibited providers without a valid license from participating in FEHB, and allowed OPM to impose fines for false charges. It also created temporary continuation of FEHB coverage (TCC) for separating employees and their families. The Temporary Continuation of FEHB Coverage (TCC) allows separating employees to maintain FEHB coverage for up to 18 months after separation by paying the full premium plus a 2% administrative charge. TCC is available to employees separated for reasons other than gross misconduct and individuals no longer meeting unmarried dependent child requirements. Additionally, certain employees on the office staff of former Presidents or Vice Presidents are considered federal employees and eligible for FEHB coverage. P.L. 101-76 adjusted the big six formula for FEHB in response to Aetna's withdrawal, calculating the government's share based on the average change in remaining plans for 1990 and 1991. This adjustment would not apply if comprehensive reform legislation amends FEHB financing provisions. OPM must provide recommendations to Congress for comprehensive FEHB reform. OPM must transmit recommendations to Congress for comprehensive FEHB reform within 180 days of enactment. P.L. 101-239 required USPS to pay FEHB premiums for survivors of postal employees who retired or died after October 1, 1986. P.L. 101-246 authorized FEHB coverage for former spouses of Foreign Service employees. P.L. 101-303 allowed federal retirees to pay health benefits premiums through direct payments rather than through annuity withholdings if the annuity is insufficient to cover the required withholdings. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508) included FEHB-related reforms such as hospitalization cost-containment measures, improved cash management, exemption from state premium taxes, and extension of the big six formula. It also required coordination between FEHB and Medicare to identify individuals entitled to Medicare benefits and applied Medicare payment limits to services. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508) included reforms for FEHB, such as cost-containment measures and coordination with Medicare. It applied Medicare payment limits to services for retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 and older. Additionally, the act required the USPS to pay the government's share of FEHB premiums for annuitants who retired from employment with the USPS after July 1, 1971. U.S. hostages in Iraq, Kuwait, and Lebanon, and their family members, were entitled to FEHB benefits under P.L. 101-513. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508) included reforms for FEHB, such as cost-containment measures and coordination with Medicare. It applied Medicare payment limits to services for retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 and older. Additionally, the act required the USPS to pay the government's share of FEHB premiums for annuitants who retired from employment with the USPS after July 1, 1971. U.S. hostages in Iraq, Kuwait, and Lebanon, and their family members, were entitled to FEHB benefits under P.L. 101-513, which appropriated up to $10 million for these benefits. The Intelligence Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1991 (P.L. 102-88) and Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1992 (P.L. 102-90) expanded eligibility for FEHB benefits for certain groups, including National Guard technicians and former spouses of CIA employees. Employees at the Child Care Center can enroll in FEHB coverage within 31 days of enactment or during open enrollment. The Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1993 (P.L. 102-393) prohibited changes to FEHB affecting Medicare beneficiaries, such as requiring retired FEHB enrollees eligible for Medicare to pay more for nonparticipating Medicare providers or eliminating coinsurance waivers for prescription drugs. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (P.L. 102-484) continued FEHB benefits for individuals involuntarily separated from the Department of Defense. The act limited payments for coverage to the employee's share of premiums and required agency compliance. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) directed a review of FEHB to assess efficiency. It also required most FEHB plans to apply Medicare Part B limitations on payments for physician services to retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older. The Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-123) extended and modified payment provisions for FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older, aligning them with Medicare Part B. It also removed a provision restricting abortion coverage in FEHB plans. The Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-123) extended payment provisions for FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older and aligned them with Medicare Part B. The first appropriations act since fiscal year 1984 (P.L. 98-151) did not include a provision restricting funding for abortion coverage in FEHB plans, but it was reinserted in the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1996 (P.L. 104-52). The FEGLI Living Benefits Act, 1994 (P.L. 103-409) allowed individuals covered under health benefit plans administered by certain offices to enroll in an FEHB plan upon termination of their current plan. The Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 (P.L. 104-37) allowed individuals covered under health benefit plans administered by the Farm Credit Administration to enroll in an FEHB plan for coverage effective on and after September 30, 1995. The act also deemed any prior enrollment under a health benefit plan administered by the Farm Credit Administration as enrollment under FEHB. The Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1996 (P.L. 104-52) reinstated the provision prohibiting funds for abortion or administrative expenses of any FEHB health plan covering abortions, with an exception for cases endangering the woman's life. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (P.L. 104-106) changed the coverage under FEHB for individuals voluntarily separating from certain positions in the Department of Defense or Energy.

The act also mandated a report to establish a demonstration program allowing certain beneficiaries of Department of Defense health programs entitled to Medicare Part A to enroll in an FEHB health plan. Additionally, the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-12) prohibited the use of federal funds for assisted suicide-related benefits and services, and OPM from contracting with plans that include such coverage. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) modified the formula for determining the government's share of FEHB premiums. It required OPM to calculate the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB annually by October 1st. The biweekly government share of an FEHB plan for an employee or retiree was set at 72% of the weighted average premium, with a cap at 75% of any given plan's premium. This provision took effect at the beginning of the contract year. The Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (P.L. 105-261) directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct a demonstration project with OPM allowing certain individuals eligible for Department of Defense health benefits to enroll in FEHB health plans. The project had to be conducted over three contract years starting in 1999. Individuals enrolled in FEHB are not eligible to enroll in a Medicare Medical Savings Account plan until OPM certifies that enrollment will not increase government expenditures. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) allowed certain Department of Defense health beneficiaries to enroll in FEHB health plans through a demonstration project conducted over three contract years. The project ended on December 31, 2002, with reports submitted to Congress on costs, effectiveness, and feasibility. Additionally, the act included administrative changes to FEHB, such as debarring fraudulent health care providers. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) made administrative changes to FEHB, including debarring fraudulent health care providers. It modified the definition of a carrier under FEHB and revised preemption provisions related to health insurance laws. OPM is required to encourage carriers to obtain discounts from health care service providers. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) established rules for readmission of plans in FEHB and clarified that plans can provide direct access, payment, and reimbursement to licensed health care providers not specified in statute. The District of Columbia Courts and Justice Technical Corrections Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-274) allowed individuals enrolled in FDIC and Federal Reserve health plans to enroll in FEHB plans when their plans terminate. It also treated Public Defender Service employees as federal employees for eligibility for health insurance under FEHB. Employees treated as federal employees for health insurance, work injuries, retirement, and life insurance under FEHB. P.L. 105-277 required FEHB plans to cover contraceptives, with exceptions for religious objections. P.L. 106-65 required the Secretary of Defense to compare case management programs between Department of Defense and FEHB plans. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (P.L. 106-117) changed how TCC works for certain individuals by allowing them to continue coverage under FEHB and be liable for no more than the employee's share of premiums. This act also required a comparison of health care coverage between TRICARE and FEHB, including cost-sharing requirements, overall costs, covered benefits, and exclusions from coverage. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Children's Equity Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-394) mandates FEHB coverage for dependent children if the employee cannot provide proof of other coverage. If the employee is no longer enrolled in FEHB, they must be enrolled in a family plan with lower coverage. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Children's Equity Act of 2000 mandates FEHB coverage for dependent children if the employee cannot provide proof of other coverage. The employee is authorized to change to family coverage if they have individual coverage under FEHB. If the employee does not change their coverage, the employing federal agency will change their enrollment to family coverage. The National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2001 directed a study comparing Department of Defense health programs with Medicare and FEHB plans for therapies. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2001 allowed certain changes in coverage. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2001 (P.L. 106-522) and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (P.L. 107-107) allowed certain employees to be treated as federal employees for FEHB eligibility and authorized employing agencies to pay premiums for health care coverage for reservists called to active duty. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 allowed reservists called to active duty to be treated as federal employees for FEHB eligibility and authorized employing agencies to pay premiums for their health care coverage. P.L. 107-304 allowed beneficiaries of a health benefits plan administered by OPIC to obtain FEHB coverage when OPIC-administered plans terminate. OPIC-administered plans terminate, with enrollment considered in FEHB. P.L. 108-372 extended FEHB coverage to State Justice Institute employees starting from October 1, 1988. P.L. 108-375 allowed temporary continuation of FEHB coverage for federal employees in the reserve component called to active duty for more than 30 days. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 authorized the Director of the CIA to establish a nonofficial cover employee health insurance program for designated employees and their families, who cannot simultaneously participate in FEHB. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 authorized the Director of the CIA to establish a nonofficial cover employee health insurance program for designated employees and their families. Designated employees in this program cannot participate in FEHB concurrently but can switch to FEHB coverage at the discretion of the CIA Director. Additionally, the Federal Employee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004 and the Amendment to Chapter 89 of Title 5, United States Code expanded health insurance coverage options for certain individuals. The Park Commission and Senate Restaurants were granted eligibility for federal health insurance under various acts (P.L. 110-74, P.L. 110-279). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-422) specified requirements for health insurance coverage under FEHB for NASA employees. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-422) outlined requirements for TCC under FEHB for NASA employees affected by the termination of the Space Shuttle Program. Employees receiving TCC are not liable for more than their share of the health benefits premium, with NASA covering the remaining share. This requirement applies to separations between the enactment of the act and December 31, 2010. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) contains provisions that apply to health insurance coverage, including FEHB plans. OPM has provided guidance on implementing ACA provisions, some of which require FEHB plans to comply with new requirements. For example, adult children up to age 26 can remain on or enroll in their parent's health insurance. The ACA requires FEHB plans to comply with new provisions, such as allowing adult children up to age 26 to remain on their parent's health insurance plan. TCC is available for three years when the child ages out of FEHB at 26. Preventive care services must be offered with no out-of-pocket costs since 2011. Since 2011, FEHB plans have provided preventive care services without cost sharing as required by the ACA. Plans must offer a summary of benefits and coverage (SBC) and a glossary of terms to help consumers understand health insurance terms. Out-of-network providers may still require cost sharing under plan terms. Lifetime limits are prohibited by the ACA. The ACA required FEHB plans to eliminate lifetime limits on certain health benefits and establish restricted annual limits before January 1, 2014. Plans were also mandated to comply with coverage requirements for clinical trials starting in 2013. The ACA required FEHB plans to comply with coverage requirements for clinical trials starting in 2013. Plans were prohibited from having preexisting condition exclusions, effective for all individuals in 2014. Additionally, FEHB plans must report a medical loss ratio and provide annual rebates if the ratio of premium revenue spent on clinical claims and health quality costs is below a certain threshold. The ACA requires FEHB plans to issue rebates if the ratio of premium revenue spent on clinical claims and health quality costs is less than 85%. Rebates are deposited into the health plan's contingency reserve to reduce the following year's premiums. The act also changed the definition of qualified medical expenses for FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs, restricting coverage of OTC medicines without a prescription. The ACA raised the penalty for nonqualified HSA withdrawals to 20% for those under 65. Maximum annual contributions to HCFSA under FEHB were lowered to $2,500 in 2013. Eligible Indian tribes can purchase FEHB for tribal employees since 2012, with the tribe paying the government's share of the premium. The ACA allowed tribes and tribal organizations to purchase coverage for employees, not retirees. It imposed administrative requirements on employers, including reporting aggregate coverage costs on W-2s. Insurers, employers, and government agencies had to report coverage details starting in 2014. The federal government can only offer specific health plans to Members of Congress and certain staff. The ACA specifies that only certain health plans can be offered to Members of Congress and designated staff, with options including plans created under the ACA or offered through an exchange. Starting in 2014, Members and staff could no longer purchase FEHB plans as active employees, but could enroll in a health plan through a SHOP exchange with an employer contribution.

The ACA includes provisions for raising revenues that may affect FEHB plans, such as annual fees on health insurance plans, a PCORI fee on insurers, and a 40% excise tax on health insurers and plan administrators for coverage exceeding specific thresholds. Additionally, the ACA required the Director of OPM to offer at least two multistate plans through each exchange in each state, providing individual or group coverage for small employers. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 allowed FEHB enrollees to choose \"self plus one\" coverage. The Director of OPM must ensure that MSPs are separate from FEHB and can appoint additional personnel for MSP activities. FEHB plans are not required to offer an MSP. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 introduced \"self plus one\" coverage option for FEHB enrollees. The government will determine the share of premiums for self plus one coverage based on the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB, paying either 72% of the average or 75% of a specific plan's premium, whichever is lower. In the first year of offering self plus one, OPM will calculate the weighted average premium through actuarial analysis."
