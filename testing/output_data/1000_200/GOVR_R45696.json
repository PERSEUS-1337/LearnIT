    "content": "The report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress through two legislative vehicles: The Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018. These laws address forest management on federal and nonfederal lands, as well as forestry research programs. This report focuses on federal forest management provisions that change how the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management manage their lands, covering the National Forest System and public lands under BLM's jurisdiction. It includes background information on the National Environmental Policy Act and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. The report summarizes provisions in federal forest management laws such as NEPA and HFRA, enacted by the 115th Congress. It covers project planning, wildland fire management, forest restoration programs, and miscellaneous issues. The analysis discusses changes made by Congress and potential issues for consideration. The report summarizes federal forest management laws enacted by the 115th Congress, covering project planning, wildland fire management, forest restoration programs, and various issues. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System consist of forests and woodlands, with Congress directing management to protect watersheds, provide timber, and allow for recreation, grazing, energy development, and wildlife protection. The Appendix includes tables comparing forest-related provisions in each law to prior legislation. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 expanded the official uses of national forests to include recreation, livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, and protection of wildlife and fish habitat. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires the Forest Service to develop comprehensive land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit with public involvement. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 mandates the development of land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit with public involvement. These plans must comply with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Forest plans outline resource conditions but do not authorize specific on-the-ground actions. Projects, such as timber harvests and trail maintenance, implement the forest plan and must align with established resource objectives. Activities on public lands, including timber harvests, watershed restoration, trail maintenance, and hazardous fuel reduction, must align with forest plans' resource objectives. Projects are planned, evaluated, and implemented following FS procedures to ensure compliance with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, with 38 million acres being woodlands and forests, under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield as directed by FLPMA. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) directs the management of forested lands in Oregon and California for permanent forest production, timber provision, watershed protection, recreation, and economic stability. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is required to prepare and maintain resource management plans in alignment with FLPMA, similar to the requirements for Forest Service decision-making. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) must prepare and revise resource management plans in accordance with federal laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. NEPA requires agencies to assess environmental impacts before final decisions. Actions with significant impacts require an EIS, while uncertain impacts may need an EA or FONSI. Compliance with these laws is essential for on-the-ground activities. The environmental assessment (EA) determines if an EIS is needed or a FONSI can be issued. Agencies evaluate impacts and alternatives, including a no-action alternative. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions with no significant environmental effects, exempt from EIS or EA requirements. FS and BLM have identified CEs based on past experience, some established by Congress. In their agency-specific procedures implementing NEPA, federal agencies identify actions that require an EIS, EA resulting in a FONSI, or can be approved using a CE. FS distinguishes between actions that need further documentation and those that require a decision memorandum. Agencies base CEs on past experience and some are established by Congress. The presence of extraordinary circumstances, such as flood plains, endangered species habitats, and archaeological sites, may require further analysis in an EA or EIS instead of using a CE for a project. NEPA serves as a framework to identify environmental impacts and compliance processes for federal agencies implementing environmental requirements. The agency's NEPA process identifies project impacts that may trigger additional environmental review requirements under other laws like ESA and NHPA. Compliance with NEPA may be waived for certain actions, but requirements under other federal laws would still apply. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk by modifying biomass availability. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk by modifying biomass availability. The authorization covers up to 20 million acres of federal land for specific projects. An At-Risk Community is defined as an area prone to large-scale wildland fire events. Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) involve methods such as prescribed fire, wildland fire use, and mechanical methods to reduce hazardous fuels. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes are terms used to prioritize and assess these projects based on historical fire patterns. HFRA projects focus on reducing hazardous fuels in specific areas like the Wildland-Urban Interface, municipal watersheds, and lands with ecological concerns. Wilderness areas are explicitly excluded from these projects. HFRA projects focus on reducing hazardous fuels in specific areas like the Wildland-Urban Interface, municipal watersheds, and lands with ecological concerns. Projects are excluded from designated wilderness areas and must be consistent with the land management plan. Covered projects must focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or removing small-diameter trees while maximizing large or old-growth tree retention. HFRA also established an objection process for proposed projects. HFRA established an objection process for proposed projects, requiring objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. Objections are limited to parties that submitted specific comments during the comment periods, and judicial review is available if the objector is unsatisfied after the administrative review process. Only issues raised during the public comment period and administrative review may be considered during judicial proceedings. The post-decisional administrative appeals process for non-HFRA projects was replaced with the pre-decisional objection process used by HFRA projects. All FS projects now fall under the same pre-decisional objection process, with some differences between HFRA and non-HFRA projects. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added a new Section 602 to HFRA, authorizing the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added Section 602 to HFRA, allowing the creation of insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS. These areas are designated based on declining forest health, risk of tree mortality, or hazard trees. Approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide have been designated as I&D areas. Projects within these areas aim to reduce the risk of insect or disease infestations. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added Section 602 to HFRA, allowing the creation of insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS to reduce the risk of infestations. Projects initiated before FY2018 in these areas are considered hazardous fuel reduction projects and must follow HFRA guidelines, including collaboration with government entities, consideration of best available science, and retention of old-growth trees. Projects in the WUI require analysis of proposed actions and alternatives, with closer scrutiny if near at-risk communities. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added Section 602 to HFRA, allowing the creation of insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS to reduce the risk of infestations. Projects in the WUI require analysis of proposed actions and alternatives, with closer scrutiny if near at-risk communities. Congress authorized FS to identify eligible NFS areas for designation as I&D areas, prioritize projects in those designated areas, and plan and implement those projects through a potentially expedited process. FS reports 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states have been proposed under these authorities, with some undergoing EA analysis procedures and EIS evaluations. The 2014 Farm Bill added a new Section 603 to HFRA, allowing certain projects to be categorically excluded from NEPA requirements to reduce insect or disease infestations. Hazardous fuels projects were later added as a priority category eligible for this exclusion. Projects must comply with eligibility criteria to qualify for this exemption. Projects eligible for the 2014 Farm Bill CE must meet CFLRP requirements or consider best available science, retain old-growth trees, and be developed collaboratively. They cannot establish new permanent roads, must decommission temporary roads within three years, and cannot exceed 3,000 acres. Projects must be located within designated I&D areas. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are allowed. The Farm Bill CE allows projects up to 3,000 acres within designated I&D areas or in specific fire regime groups. FS policy requires documentation of decisions through a decision memorandum. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities, including the definition of authorized fuel reduction projects. The 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities to include fuel breaks and fire breaks as authorized fuel reduction projects. Hazardous fuels reduction projects in I&D areas can be expedited using Farm Bill CE procedures. The 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities to include fuel breaks and fire breaks as authorized fuel reduction projects. Hazardous fuels reduction projects in I&D areas can be expedited using Farm Bill CE procedures, which also apply to wildfire resilience projects for FS and projects related to greater sage grouse or mule deer habitat for both FS and BLM. The 2018 farm bill also included provisions affecting interagency consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act. The 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities to include fuel breaks and fire breaks as authorized fuel reduction projects. Hazardous fuels reduction projects in I&D areas can be expedited using Farm Bill CE procedures, which also apply to wildfire resilience projects for FS and projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat for both FS and BLM. The potential impact of these new CEs on project planning and implementation efficiency is uncertain. Larger project sizes may help achieve landscape-level goals more efficiently, and using a CE for environmental review could speed up project implementation. The 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities to include fuel breaks and fire breaks as authorized fuel reduction projects. Hazardous fuels reduction projects in I&D areas can be expedited using Farm Bill CE procedures, which also apply to wildfire resilience projects for FS and projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat for both FS and BLM. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established in FY2018, is similar to the Farm Bill CE and aims to expedite specified hazardous fuel reduction projects. Concerns exist regarding conducting landscape-scale projects without detailed environmental reviews, potentially leading to undesirable resource effects. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established in FY2018, is similar to the Farm Bill CE and aims to expedite specified hazardous fuel reduction projects within designated I&D areas on NFS lands. Eligible projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or prioritize the retention of old-growth and large trees for resiliency. Projects must be developed through a collaborative process, avoid new permanent roads, and decommission temporary roads within three years. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established in FY2018, expedites hazardous fuel reduction projects within designated I&D areas on NFS lands. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements, prioritize old-growth and large trees, avoid new permanent roads, and decommission temporary roads within three years. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres and must be located in areas with high wildfire hazard potential. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018 under this authority. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established in FY2018, expedites hazardous fuel reduction projects within designated I&D areas on NFS lands. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements, prioritize old-growth and large trees, avoid new permanent roads, and decommission temporary roads within three years. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018 under this authority. The Wildfire Resilience CE requires projects to be located within designated I&D areas and in areas with high wildfire hazard potential. Projects outside the WUI must be in specified fire regime condition classes, while projects within the WUI are prioritized. The CE is available for hazardous fuels reduction projects and does not include insect and disease projects like the Farm Bill CE. The Wildfire Resilience CE is available for hazardous fuels reduction projects in designated areas on NFS lands, prioritizing old-growth trees and avoiding new roads. Congress directed FS to evaluate if extraordinary circumstances are present that may require further analysis. The Farm Bill CE is also available for insect and disease projects. Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill directs the establishment of a CE for projects to protect, restore, or improve greater. The 2018 farm bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to establish a CE for projects on NFS and BLM lands to protect, restore, or improve greater sage-grouse and/or mule-deer habitat. Projects must be consistent with resource management plans and comply with specific requirements, including activities like removing invasive vegetation and targeted herbicide use. The 2018 farm bill mandates a categorical exclusion (CE) for projects on NFS and BLM lands to enhance greater sage-grouse and/or mule-deer habitat. Activities include managing nonnative vegetation with livestock grazing and targeted herbicide use, with restrictions on project size, location, and road construction. Agencies must consider landscape-scale habitat projects and population trends when applying the CE. The CE for projects on NFS and BLM lands aims to enhance sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat by managing vegetation and developing a monitoring plan. The Endangered Species Act focuses on conserving endangered species and their ecosystems, administered by FWS and NMFS. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for the listing of plants and animals as endangered or threatened, with prohibitions applying once listed. Federal agencies must ensure actions do not harm listed species or their habitats, consulting with FWS or NMFS if needed. Under the Endangered Species Act, federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS if an action may harm a listed species or their critical habitat. A Section 7 consultation is required for discretionary actions, where a biological opinion is issued to determine if the action will jeopardize the species or modify their habitat. If harm is likely, alternative solutions must be proposed to avoid harm to the species. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans in Oregon, specifying that updating forest plans does not always require consultation unless the plan is over 15 years old. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon, stating that consultation is not always necessary for plan updates unless the plan is older than 15 years. The changes are controversial as they override a Ninth Circuit Court decision regarding re-consultation on land management plans after critical habitat designation for the Canada lynx. The changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon, specifically for the Canada lynx, are debated. Supporters argue that not requiring consultations for existing plans allows for flexibility and consistency, while opponents fear harm to species if harmful activities are not addressed promptly. Critics argue that the time lag before consultation is required could harm species and their habitat, while proponents believe that projects under a plan still undergo consultation, making plan consultation redundant. Plans address projects at a higher level and could impact the cumulative effect of all activities. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include fuel reduction, prevention, detection, response, and recovery activities. Changes in funding allocation for wildfire suppression and specific requirements for wildfire risk mapping were included in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill changed Congress's funding allocation for wildfire suppression and added specific requirements for wildfire risk mapping. This included modifications to the hazardous fuel reduction programs of the Forest Service and Department of the Interior. Funding for wildland fire management is provided through discretionary appropriations in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funding for wildland fire management is provided to the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Forest Service (FS) through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The funding is allocated to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies\u2014BLM, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Suppression Operations program within DOI and FS's Wildland Fire Management account funds wildfire control on federal land, including firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, and post-wildfire response programs. If suppression funding is depleted, DOI and FS can transfer funds from other accounts for firefighting activities, known as fire borrowing. Overall, appropriations to FS and DOI for wildland fire management have increased significantly since the 1990s, with a large portion of the increase attributed to rising suppression costs. This has led to instances of fire borrowing, where funds are transferred from other accounts to cover suppression activities. Congress has often provided supplemental appropriations to repay the transferred funds and replenish wildfire accounts, as wildfire spending is subject to procedural and budgetary controls. The 115th Congress established a new mechanism for wildfire suppression funding outside of budgetary constraints in the FY2018 omnibus. Discretionary spending is currently subject to statutory limits enforced through sequestration if exceeded. The FY2018 omnibus established a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations in nondefense discretionary spending limits. This adjustment starts in FY2020 and continues through FY2027, exempting spending for emergency requirements and disaster relief. The FY2018 omnibus established a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations in nondefense discretionary spending limits, starting in FY2020 through FY2027. The adjustment exempts spending for emergency and unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting, including support, response, and emergency stabilization activities. The adjustment applies to appropriations above the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations as calculated for FY2015. The amount of the adjustment is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing by $0.1 billion annually to $2.95 billion. The FY2018 omnibus established a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations in nondefense discretionary spending limits, starting in FY2020 through FY2027. The adjustment exempts spending for emergency and unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting. The adjustment is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing to $2.95 billion in FY2027. Congress could appropriate up to an additional $2.25 billion in FY2020, effectively outside of the discretionary limits, allowing for a total of $3.64 billion in total for the same discretionary budget \"score\" as $1.39 billion. The wildfire funding fix established an adjustment for wildfire suppression operations in nondefense discretionary spending limits, allowing for additional funds outside of the discretionary limits. This adjustment could provide up to $3.64 billion in total for FY2020, with the potential for additional funds in FY2021. The BCA statutory limits for discretionary spending are in effect until FY2021, and the wildfire adjustment may still apply if new limits are established for FY2022 through FY2027. The wildfire funding fix established an adjustment for wildfire suppression operations in nondefense discretionary spending limits, providing up to $3.64 billion for FY2020. Congress may need to take additional action to ensure agencies have access to funds for federal services in response to wildfires. The wildfire funding fix raises concerns for Congress regarding accountability, oversight, and inflationary factors. It is a temporary procedural change that does not address various concerns related to suppression costs, such as forecasting, effectiveness of methods, and drivers of increasing costs. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index to help with strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale. Approximately 226 million acres of land in the continental United States are classified at high or very high WHP, with 53% of these lands being federal land. Approximately 226 million acres of land in the continental United States are classified at high or very high Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP). Of these lands, 53% are federal land, while the remaining 47% are state, tribal, other public, or private lands. The WHP index indicates fuels with a higher likelihood of extreme fire behavior under specific weather conditions. This data, when combined with spatial data, can estimate wildfire risk to resources and assets. The FY2018 omnibus directs the Forest Service to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for community-level risk management within two years. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill require FS and BLM to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for community-level risk management within two years. Reports on wildland fire management must be submitted to Congress, with the first report due by December 30, 2021 if the wildfire funding fix is used in FY2020. The reports are to be prepared in consultation with the OMB Director and made available to the public. The Secretaries are required to prepare reports on the use of the wildfire funding fix in FY2020. The reports will be submitted to specific House and Senate Committees and will document funding obligations, outlays, and overall wildland fire management spending. They will also analyze fire size, costs, regional location, and risk-based factors influencing suppression management decisions. Lessons learned from large fires will be included in the analysis. The 2018 farm bill mandates a report on wildfire prevention on federal land to be submitted to Congress annually. It includes details on the effectiveness of fuel treatments, suppression costs, and preparedness activities. The report is due within 180 days of the bill's enactment and covers the number of acres treated for wildfire prevention. The 2018 farm bill mandates an annual report on wildfire prevention on federal land, including details on acres treated, fire risk, response time, timber production, road maintenance backlog, and measures for water quality and ecosystem resilience. Forest restoration activities aim to establish ecological processes and functioning. Forest restoration activities on federal land aim to establish resilience and resistance to disturbance events like insect infestations or wildfires. This includes thinning trees to reduce density and using prescribed fires to manage vegetation buildup. BLM and FS derive authority for these projects from FLPMA and Organic Act responsibilities. The authority for conducting restoration projects on federal lands is primarily derived from various acts such as FLPMA, MUSY, and NFMA. Congress has also authorized specific programs for forest restoration, including new programs for FS and amendments to existing programs. The FS and BLM have programs like CFLRP, stewardship contracting, and good neighbor authority to partner with stakeholders for forest restoration. These programs aim to address land management concerns at a landscape-scale and offer opportunities to accelerate restoration to mitigate insect infestations and wildfires. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 established the CFLRP to fund restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, aiming to reduce wildfire risk and provide benefits to surrounding communities through collaboration with diverse stakeholders. The CFLRP funds restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, focusing on reducing wildfire risk and benefiting communities through collaboration with stakeholders. Proposals must meet specific criteria, including being transparent, incorporating the best available science, and not including plans for new permanent roads. Annual and 5-year status reports are required by law. The law authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to select and fund up to 10 proposals annually for forest restoration. FS has funded 23 proposals since FY2010, with each proposal including individual projects to achieve forest restoration goals. A fund covers up to 50% of project costs, with annual appropriations of up to $40 million through FY2019. Each proposal can receive up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) authorizes up to $40 million annually for selected proposals for forest restoration projects. The program has been successful in achieving land management objectives, boosting local economies, and promoting collaboration. The dedicated funding provides stability for project implementation, but some argue it may divert resources from other areas. Some concerns have been raised about the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program's funding commitment potentially redirecting resources from non-selected projects on NFS lands. While the program offers economic benefits, it falls short in creating new markets for smaller-scale wood products and reducing treatment costs. Collaboration with community stakeholders has been positive but mainly focused on simple issues, lacking progress on more complex or controversial matters. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations until FY2023, allowing for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects by up to 10 years. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations until FY2023. It allows for a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects by up to 10 years. The law also included the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture as recipients of program status reports. If Congress appropriates to the new authorization level, more projects could be selected and funded. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements with state governments for all NFS lands. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program was initially authorized as a temporary pilot on NFS land in Colorado in 2001 before becoming available nationwide for all NFS and BLM lands. States are authorized to do restoration work on public lands under approved Good Neighbor Agreements, including treating trees, reducing fuels, and improving forest health. Prohibited activities include treatments in designated wilderness areas, construction of permanent roads, and special treatment for revenue. The 2014 farm bill did not include funding for road construction on federal lands or specify special treatment for revenue from wood products. States can work on public lands under Good Neighbor Agreements, with Master Agreements outlining the scope and Supplemental Project Agreements detailing project terms. FS has signed 48 MAs and 105 SPAs in multiple states, covering 82 national forests. These agreements allow for various authorized activities. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows states to work on public lands through Master Agreements (MAs) and Supplemental Project Agreements (SPAs). There are 48 MAs and 105 SPAs covering 82 national forests in 33 states. The primary emphasis of GNAs is on specific project types like timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. The GNA is seen as successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and performing cross boundary restoration work, but some states have concerns about sustained future work. Changes to the GNA were enacted in the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to include federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments. Funds received by states through timber sales under GNA can be used for additional projects until FY2023. Payments made by counties to the relevant Secretary under GNA projects are not subject to revenue-sharing laws. This expansion has the potential to increase the use of the authority. The expansion of the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to tribes and county governments has the potential to increase its use significantly. This could lead to more cross-boundary restoration work and the leveraging of nonfederal resources. However, it may also increase administrative demands on agencies like FS or BLM. Concerns include contract administration, project planning, oversight, and revenue distribution from timber sales. Stewardship end-result contracting was established as a pilot program in 1999 and extended multiple times until 2013. The Stewardship end-result contracting program was established in 1999 as a pilot program and made permanent in 2014. It allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts combining timber sales with service activities to achieve land management goals. The Stewardship end-result contracting program allows FS and BLM to combine timber sales with service activities to achieve land management goals, such as improving water quality, forest health, reducing fire hazards, and restoring ecosystems. Excess timber sale revenue can be deposited into a Stewardship Contracting Fund for use on other projects without further appropriation. Contracts are awarded based on best value, considering past performance, proposal quality, and innovation in wood use by contractors. Stewardship contracting allows FS and BLM to consider past performance, proposal quality, and other factors in addition to cost. They can give procurement preference to contractors using wood products innovatively. Annual reports on contract development and accomplishments are required. Stakeholders generally view stewardship contracting favorably, citing increased restoration opportunities and economic benefits. Concerns include the removal of ecologically important trees and the need for more market support. Some concerns with stewardship contracting include the potential incentive to remove ecologically important trees for funding service work, distribution of receipts, up-front financial obligations, and slow implementation pace. Initial difficulties in implementation were due to contract complexity and record-keeping issues, but improvements have been made with integrated contracting systems and increased contract offerings. The agencies improved record-keeping and increased contract offerings, but issues with contract administration were found in a 2015 USDA OIG report. New guidance was published in 2016, and the FY2018 omnibus authorized 20-year stewardship contracts in specific fire regime areas. The law authorizes the Secretary to give procurement preference to contractors promoting innovative use of forest products. It also allows FS and BLM to include cancellation ceilings in stewardship contracts, with funds obligated in stages. Excess revenues can be used to pay outstanding liabilities. Congressional notification is required for contracts with a cancellation ceiling over $25 million without proposed funding. The cancellation ceiling provision in stewardship contracts allows funds to be obligated in stages, resolving concerns about up-front financial obligations. The use of 20-year contracts and procurement preference can increase market certainty for forest products industries. Watershed protection is an authorized activity of the NFS, but inadequacies were noted in FS's watershed programs in a 2006 assessment report. The 2006 assessment report identified inadequacies in FS's watershed programs, including lack of water quality data and inconsistent national approach. FS committed to developing outcome-based performance measures, improving data quality, and prioritizing watershed management on NFS lands. The Watershed Condition Framework was developed to classify and prioritize watersheds for restoration action plans. The Forest Service classified and prioritized watersheds for restoration action plans, starting in 2011. In 2013, they began developing these plans and implementing projects to achieve their goals. However, a 2017 USDA OIG report highlighted inadequacies in the management of the Watershed Condition Framework program, such as lack of coordination and oversight at the national level. The 2018 farm bill codified the program, assigning specific responsibilities and priorities to the Secretary of Agriculture. The law authorized the establishment of a Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) for NFS land by the Secretary of Agriculture through the Chief of the Forest Service. The framework allows for evaluation and classification of watershed conditions, identification of priority watersheds for protection and restoration, and development of restoration action plans in coordination with nonfederal landowners and governments. An emergency designation process is also authorized for prioritizing watershed rehabilitation after significant wildfire impact. The process to prioritize watershed rehabilitation after significant wildfire impact includes watershed protection as an authorized use of NFS. The Secretary of Agriculture can enter cooperative agreements for restoration purposes with various entities, sharing costs if in the public interest. Activities include improving resources on NFS lands. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into multi-year partnership agreements with nonfederal partners to protect and restore NFS watersheds serving as sources of municipal water. FS may develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners to carry out forest management activities for municipal water supply protection and forest health restoration. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into multi-year partnership agreements with nonfederal partners to protect and restore NFS watersheds serving as sources of municipal water. FS may develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners to carry out forest management activities for municipal water supply protection and forest health restoration. The law authorizes FS to conduct environmental analysis for the development of the water source management plan and accept various forms of investment and assistance from partners to implement the plan. Congress authorized $10 million in annual appropriations to the Water Source Protection Fund through FY2023. The 2018 farm bill included provisions for federal forest land, such as designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Section 8626 designated a new wilderness area and expanded five existing areas in NFS lands in Tennessee, including the establishment of the Upper Bald River Wilderness on the Cherokee National Forest. The 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas and expanded existing ones on the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee. This includes areas like Big Frog, Big Laurel Branch, Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness, Little Frog Mountain, and Sampson Mountain. The law mandates that these areas be managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access. Provisions in the FY2018 omnibus and farm bill also changed how federal land is acquired, exchanged, or disposed of, with new programs and authorities established. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized programs for leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites at market value, selling or exchanging BLM lands for disposal, and acquiring lands for administrative purposes. It also reauthorized the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program for conveying administrative sites or undeveloped parcels of NFS land. Additionally, it modified the Small Tracts Act by expanding eligibility requirements. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized programs for leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites at market value, selling or exchanging BLM lands for disposal, and acquiring lands for administrative purposes. It also modified the Small Tracts Act by expanding eligibility requirements. The bill contained provisions authorizing exchanges or sales for specifically identified parcels and entities. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for the use of BLM and NFS lands, allowing for various purposes including water infrastructure and transportation systems. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized programs for leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites at market value, selling or exchanging BLM lands for disposal, and acquiring lands for administrative purposes. It also modified the Small Tracts Act by expanding eligibility requirements. The bill contained provisions authorizing exchanges or sales for specifically identified parcels and entities. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for the use of BLM and NFS lands, allowing for various purposes including water infrastructure and transportation systems. Authorizing access for various types of infrastructure on specified lands, with cost-recovery fees and annual land use rental fees charged by FS and BLM. Fees are based on processing and monitoring hours, with a general rental fee schedule for linear ROWs based on land value. The 115th Congress enacted provisions directing FS to update their process and fee schedule for issuing special use authorizations for communication sites, directed FS and BLM to issue new regulations for certain activities within electricity ROWs, and also established a similar pilot process for FS for many of the same activities within utility ROWs. Some provisions enacted by the 115th Congress aim to improve processes for obtaining approvals and implementing vegetation management projects on federal lands within utility rights-of-way (ROWs) to mitigate wildfire risks associated with power line ignitions. Confusing administrative processes have been cited as a barrier to necessary maintenance activities by ROW permit-holders. The 115th Congress provisions aim to improve processes for ROW permit holders to implement vegetation management projects on federal lands. Concerns exist regarding the balance between expediting project implementation and maintaining accountability. Some provisions specify responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs and liability costs for ROW permit holders. There are concerns about the potential implications for the federal government bearing a disproportionate share of wildfire suppression costs. Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations revising the process for issuing special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands within one year of enactment. The law aims to address concerns about the balance between project implementation and accountability, including responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs and liability for ROW permit holders. The provisions also aim to prevent utilities from shouldering the full costs of wildfires on federal lands. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the process for issuing special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands. The law specified streamlined, uniform, and standardized procedures, competitive and technology-neutral application considerations, and minimum 15-year lease terms. Regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing costs, with fees used for managing communication sites. The FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA to establish new requirements for vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance on federal land containing electric transmission and distribution facilities. The law directed FS and BLM to issue guidance for planning and implementing these activities within ROWs, with specific requirements for review and approval of plans submitted by permit holders. The law directs FS and BLM to review, approve, and modify vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plans submitted by ROW permit holders. Owners can develop and submit plans for approval and conduct activities within their ROW with an approved plan. Certain management activities can be conducted without approval in specific circumstances. FS and BLM are to identify NEPA categorical exclusions and propose regulations within one year of enactment. Training programs for FS and DOI are encouraged. The FY2018 omnibus law directs FS and BLM to review, approve, and modify vegetation management plans for ROW permit holders. It also specifies liability limits for damages resulting from activities conducted under an approved plan. FS and BLM must report on the impacts of the law within four years of enactment. Section 8630 of the 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) land, allowing them to develop vegetation management plans with FS approval and perform projects within and up to 75 feet from the ROW. Participants must adhere to FS and state regulations regarding fire management. Participants in the pilot program on NFS lands can pay for and conduct projects within 75 feet of the ROW, following FS and state regulations. They are responsible for project costs, with the possibility of FS contributing funds. The Secretary of Agriculture may retain funds provided by participants for the pilot program. FS must report program status to Congress biennially. Participants must reimburse FS for wildfire costs and damage caused by their operations under certain conditions. The pilot program on NFS lands requires participants to pay for and conduct projects within 75 feet of the ROW, following FS and state regulations. They are responsible for project costs, with the possibility of FS contributing funds. The program also stipulates that participants must reimburse FS for wildfire costs and damage caused by their operations under certain conditions, with a reimbursement limit of up to $500,000 in certain circumstances. The program differs from the FY2018 omnibus program in that it is applicable to electricity ROWs, natural gas, and related infrastructure. The 2018 farm bill pilot program under the FY2018 omnibus caps liability costs for participants in electricity ROWs, natural gas, and related infrastructure. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on prior year revenue. SRS offers optional payments based on historic revenue, land acreage, and per capita income, allocated for education, roads, and governmental purposes. Title I FS payments were allocated for education and roads, while Title II payments were retained by the agency for projects on the lands and within the county. Title III payments were designated for county programs like fire prevention and emergency services. Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) were established to provide advice and recommendations, with specific membership requirements representing various interests. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program had 15 members representing different interests like outdoor recreation, timber industry, and environmental organizations. Payments were set at 95% of the previous year's level and extended until FY2016. Counties received lower revenue-sharing payments when SRS payments were not authorized. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018 at 95% of the last authorized payment level. Payments were made in FY2018 and FY2019, with FY2017 payments already distributed. The reauthorization also expanded the uses for Title III funds and expired at the end of FY2018. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the SRS statute despite its expiration, allowing for modifications to RAC membership requirements and establishing a pilot program for the Secretary to appoint RAC members in Montana and Arizona. The Tribal Forest Protection Act authorized agreements with Indian tribes for forest projects on NFS and BLM lands. The Tribal Forest Protection Act allows agreements with federally recognized Indian tribes for forest projects on Indian trust or restricted lands, NFS, and BLM lands adjacent to tribal lands. The Secretary evaluates requests based on tribal factors and unique circumstances. This extends the good neighbor authority to tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The 2018 farm bill authorized self-determination contracts with federally recognized tribes for forestry functions on TFPA lands. The Secretary of Agriculture carries out responsibilities on NFS land, with decision-making authority retained by the Secretary concerned. Congress may oversee implementation of the new laws. Congress may consider oversight of forestry provisions enacted by the 115th Congress, including implications of changes and addressing concerns with federal forest management. The Forest Service has identified millions of acres at high risk in need of restoration treatments, with a backlog that could take up to 29 years to eliminate. To address these concerns, the Forest Service has proposed increasing treatments. The Forest Service aims to increase forest management projects to address hazardous fuel accumulation and restoration needs. Administrative process barriers, including decision-making processes and NEPA implementation issues, hinder progress towards restoration goals. The Forest Service faces challenges in implementing forest management projects due to administrative barriers and NEPA implementation issues. Efforts by the 115th Congress aim to improve agency efficiencies by expanding procedures to expedite project planning and review processes. This includes utilizing Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities and allowing for more projects under NEPA Categorical Exclusions to accelerate project implementation. Some stakeholders argue that changes to agency decision-making processes, such as the use of Categorical Exclusions under NEPA, are altering the legal framework for federal forest management. Concerns about environmental impacts and citizen participation have been ongoing for decades, with issues like deteriorating forest health and high fuel levels dating back to wildfires in Yellowstone National Park in 1988. In response to wildfires in Yellowstone National Park in 1988, the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters recommended increased investment in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems. Recommendations were made in 1994, 1995, 1999, and 2006 to increase hazardous fuel treatments, develop strategies for reducing fuels, and improve guidance and controls for hazardous fuels reduction programs. The focus has been on addressing forest health issues and mitigating wildfire risks. The 2016 OIG report assessed FS' progress in implementing recommendations for hazardous fuels reduction projects, highlighting issues with prioritizing, tracking, and reporting. Concerns about project implementation have been ongoing, with challenges and appeals noted in various reports and academic studies on FS NEPA implementation. Several academic studies have examined FS NEPA implementation, indicating that complex projects are more likely to be challenged. Despite provisions in the HFRA to expedite hazardous fuels reduction projects, the extent of NFS areas needing treatment has increased. This suggests that the HFRA approach to streamline agency decision-making may not have been successful. The HFRA approach to streamline agency decision-making may not have been successful, as indicated by academic studies on FS NEPA implementation. Some suggest that the HFRA approach needs broader application, as seen in legislation during the 115th Congress. Two tables compare forest-related provisions in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill to prior laws, excluding provisions not directly related to forest management."
