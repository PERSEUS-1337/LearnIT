    "content": "A helper in the construction industry is typically an unskilled worker who assists skilled craftsmen. They may have a range of skills but lack formal training. Helpers are often not union members and are paid less than skilled workers, but can be valuable for their flexibility and lower cost. A helper in the construction industry is an unskilled worker who assists skilled craftsmen. They are cheaper to employ and more flexible in the types of work they can do. Craft fragmentation involves assigning helpers to perform narrow aspects of complex tasks under the guidance of a journeyman. The productivity and quality of workmanship in this arrangement are subjects of debate. Apprentices receive on-the-job and formal training, while helpers receive minimal training. The Davis-Bacon Act recognizes apprentices and trainees in formal programs for wage rate purposes but generally does not recognize helpers to protect the prevailing wage structure and skills system. The Davis-Bacon Act requires construction contracts over $2,000 to include minimum wage provisions based on prevailing wages determined by the Secretary of Labor. Congress delegated the Secretary the task of implementing the act and defining key concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing.\" The Davis-Bacon Act delegated to the Secretary of Labor the responsibility of defining key concepts such as \"wages,\" \"prevailing,\" and \"project of a character similar.\" These concepts have been contentious topics for over 60 years, including the concept of \"helper\" and whether their use is common in federal construction projects. Congress initially referred to \"classes of laborers and mechanics\" without mentioning \"helpers\" or other skill groups. The Davis-Bacon Act delegated the definition of key concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing\" to the Secretary of Labor. The act initially referred to \"classes of laborers and mechanics\" without mentioning \"helpers\" or other skill groups. The Secretary developed definitions over the years, focusing on apprentices and trainees in formal training programs. The term \"helper\" appeared in regulations but lacked a precise definition or application in wage rate determinations. The Davis-Bacon Act delegated the definition of key concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing\" to the Secretary of Labor. The term \"helper\" appeared in regulations without a precise definition or application in wage rate determinations. Business economist Armand Thieblot highlighted the need for clear definitions in the regulations, especially regarding classifications of laborers and mechanics. He noted that firms bidding on construction projects in union areas might have to reclassify helpers as journeymen or laborers to comply with prevailing wage requirements. Thieblot emphasized the importance of clear definitions in Davis-Bacon regulations, particularly regarding the classification of workers as journeymen or laborers. He mentioned that firms may need to reclassify helpers as journeymen or laborers to meet prevailing wage standards, especially in union areas. The recognition of helpers for Davis-Bacon rate purposes is limited to geographic areas where their employment is common among open shop firms. Davis-Bacon regulations are seen as crucial by trade unionists to maintain labor standards in the building trades. They argue that restrictions on the employment of apprentices, trainees, or helpers at sub-craft rates are necessary to prevent contractors from undercutting prevailing wages. The Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD), AFL-CIO, believes that clear definitions are important, especially for titles like \"helper\" and \"trainee,\" which can lead to conflicts. The Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD), AFL-CIO, argues that restrictions on the use of helpers and trainees at sub-craft wages are necessary to prevent contractors from undercutting prevailing wages. They believe that these titles can lead to conflicts and that the use of helpers was one of the abuses the Davis-Bacon Act was intended to remedy. There was a campaign in the late 1970s for reform or repeal of Davis-Bacon, either through direct legislation or regulatory reform. In late 1979, the Carter Administration proposed a rule to revise the administration of the Davis-Bacon Act, focusing on classifying laborers and mechanics based on work performed rather than skill levels. This regulatory reform aimed to address abuses and conflicts related to the use of helpers and trainees at sub-craft wages. The proposed rule in late 1979 aimed to revise the Davis-Bacon Act by focusing on classifying laborers and mechanics based on work performed. It established two tests for designation of a special wage rate for helpers, emphasizing their distinction from other classifications. The final rule published in mid-January 1981 addressed the use of helpers, omitting a specific definition for them. The Department of Labor addressed concerns about job opportunities for youths, minorities, and women in relation to the use of helpers under BAT approved programs. They emphasized the importance of recognized apprenticeship and training programs to prevent exploitation and ensure real training. Payment of reduced wages to apprentices and trainees was noted as an exception to the Davis-Bacon Act, with strict conditions to prevent circumvention of its requirements. The final rule defined the terms apprentice and trainee. The Department of Labor emphasized the importance of recognized apprenticeship and training programs to prevent exploitation and ensure real training. The final rule defined the terms apprentice and trainee, but did not define helper. Differences in wage determinations were based on work performed, not skill levels. The Department anticipated difficulties in recognizing helpers and determining prevailing wage rates for them, leading to a delay in implementation. The Reagan Administration announced a delay in implementing Davis-Bacon regulations and later withdrew them for further review. During the Reagan era, consideration of the helper issue went through three periods: issuance of a proposed rule in August 1981, publication of a final rule in May 1982, and subsequent litigation. The new proposed rule allowed for a helper classification on wage determinations when identifiable in the locality, recognizing common construction industry practices. The DOL proposed new regulations to issue helper wage determinations more broadly, allowing for one helper to five journeymen and prohibiting the use of journeymen as helpers to prevent abuse. This shift in emphasis aimed to increase the use of helpers in the construction industry. The new regulations issued by the Carter Administration aimed to increase the use of helpers in the construction industry by defining a helper as a semi-skilled worker who assists a journeyman in various tasks under supervision. The Carter Administration's new regulations aimed to increase the use of helpers in the construction industry by defining them as semi-skilled workers assisting journeyman. Helpers perform tasks under supervision and may use tools of the trade. The Department of Labor received over 2,200 comments on the proposed rule, with a focus on the helper issue. A final Davis-Bacon rule was issued in 1995, changing the restrictive approach to helper use. Trade union concerns were rejected in favor of industry views. The Department of Labor (DOL) set a new standard for helper ratios in the construction industry, increasing the ratio to two helpers for every three journeymen. This decision was met with sharp division in reactions, with former Labor Secretary John Dunlop criticizing the lack of evidence supporting the new ratio. The Department of Labor's new 2:3 ratio for helpers to journeymen in the construction industry was criticized by John Dunlop as lacking credible evidence to support it. The Building and Construction Trades Department objected to the rule, stating that it would allow unlimited use of helpers and cross-craft helpers. Industry supported the change, with the Associated General Contractors calling it the most significant change in the regulation. The new Davis-Bacon regulation, particularly the redefinition of the \"helper\" classification, received mixed reactions. Industry groups praised the change for allowing contractors to use semi-skilled workers at lower wages, while the AFL-CIO criticized it as derogatory to the statutory wage determination requirement. The AFL-CIO filed a lawsuit to challenge the changes in the \"helper\" requirement under the new Davis-Bacon regulation, arguing that it would negatively impact minority construction workers and lead to wage-cutting practices. Judge Harold H. Greene issued a preliminary injunction against the Secretary of Labor, addressing the issues raised with respect to the helper provision. Judge Greene's injunction against the Secretary of Labor focused on the helper provision of the Davis-Bacon Act. Congress was aware of employers classifying workers as \"helpers\" to avoid paying skilled laborers' wages, leading to wage disparities. The Senate Committee recommended construction contracts specify minimum wages based on prevailing rates for different classes of laborers and mechanics. The Davis-Bacon Act aimed to prevent wage disparities by specifying minimum wages based on prevailing rates for different classes of laborers and mechanics. However, the new regulations may allow helpers to perform any task throughout the construction field, contradicting the original intent of the Act. The new regulations under the Davis-Bacon Act redefine helpers as \"general helpers\" who can perform tasks of laborers and mechanics across different trades, potentially leading to wage disparities as contractors may assign them tasks at lower pay. The Davis-Bacon Act allows construction contractors to classify traditional craft work as they wish, potentially undermining the established wage standard in the area. The new regulations now only require helpers to be \"identifiable\" rather than \"prevailing,\" leading to possible exploitation of lower-paid workers. The Davis-Bacon Act's new regulations allow for the substitution of traditional craft workers with helpers in construction work, potentially undermining the Act's central purpose. Judge Greene criticized the changes, noting that previous interpretations had been consistent with the original understanding of the law. Judge Greene criticized the changes to the Davis-Bacon Act, stating that previous interpretations aligned with the original understanding of the law. He issued a permanent injunction against the helper rule, which was partially upheld and partially overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Appeals Court deemed the provision allowing helper classification based on being 'identifiable' as undermining the Act's purpose of mirroring local prevailing wages on federal construction projects. The Appeals Court criticized the helper rule under the Davis-Bacon Act, stating that it undermines the purpose of mirroring local prevailing wages on federal construction projects. It also noted the potential for downgrading work classifications, leading to reduced wages. The court found that the Secretary of Labor's classification regulation would likely result in underclassification in union-dominated areas. The Appeals Court criticized the helper rule under the Davis-Bacon Act, finding that a shift in classification regulation could lead to underclassification in union-dominated areas. The decision of the Appeals Court was upheld by the Supreme Court in January 1984. In January 1984, the Supreme Court declined to hear the unions' appeal regarding the helper rule under the Davis-Bacon Act. The Secretary of Labor had to restructure the regulation to comply with judicial approval. In August 1987, a new proposed rule on the use of helpers was issued by the Department, addressing the issue of \"prevailing\" classification. Defining \"prevailing\" remained a challenge, with various options presented in the proposed rule. In January 1984, the Supreme Court declined to hear the unions' appeal regarding the helper rule under the Davis-Bacon Act. The Department set forth options for determining prevailing classification and called for public comment. A revised final rule was published on January 27, 1989, but had to be cleared through the District Court due to an injunction. Judge Greene vacated the injunction on September 24, 1990, allowing DOL to implement the helper regulation. Contractors were asked to report helper, apprentice, and trainee numbers and wage rates. Congress was notified that the helper rule would be effective on February 4, 1991. In April 1991, Congress intervened to halt the implementation of helper regulations by the Department of Labor. Despite requests to delay implementation, funding for the regulation was denied in the FY1992 budget. The dispute over the temporary or permanent nature of the restriction continued until the end of the fiscal year. The Department of Labor's FY1992 budget request to implement helper regulations was denied by Congress. President Bush signed the new budget without the requested funding. The Appeals Court upheld the Department's definition of \"helper\" and \"prevailing\" but deemed the ratio of helpers to journeymen as \"arbitrary and capricious,\" invalidating this provision. The court criticized the fixed ratio as lacking rational decision-making and being arbitrary. The Department of Labor's regulation on helper ratios was deemed arbitrary by the Appeals Court. The court criticized the fixed ratio and the lack of rational decision-making. The Department issued a new rule removing the ratio, causing controversy among building trades unions and industry critics. The Department of Labor's regulation on helper ratios was criticized by the Appeals Court for being arbitrary. Industry critics favored a more sweeping use of helpers, but implementation of the regulation remained in abeyance. Debate continued on the wisdom of the regulation in terms of manpower utilization and costs. Major revision or repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act through legislation was not a viable option, leading to reform through the rulemaking process as a more likely approach. However, rulemaking did not offer a permanent solution. Senator Nickles introduced legislation in September 1982 to amend the Davis-Bacon Act by adding the classification of \"helper\" to the list of workers covered. Despite unsuccessful attempts to codify the regulations, the issue of helpers resurfaced in Congress in 1993 during the consideration of H.R. 2518. Senator Nickles proposed the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects to save the federal government money and create job opportunities in construction. Senator Harkin opposed the proposal, citing that the regulations for helpers were already a decade old. Senator Harkin opposed the Nickles/Craig proposal to delay implementation of helper regulations, citing concerns about its impact on minority workers and apprentice training programs. He disputed the projected $600 million in savings and argued that the regulations would lead to reduced wages and fringe benefits for workers. The committee's amendment to suspend implementation of the DOL's helper regulations was ultimately approved. On June 21, 1994, the House Appropriations Committee defeated a proposal by Representative DeLay to remove the helper funding restraint from a pending DOL appropriations measure. On June 28, during floor debate on the same measure, Representative DeLay argued for the implementation of the helper regulation to benefit public construction and small contractors. The Davis-Bacon requirement aims to ensure quality construction, prevent undermining of wages and benefits in local communities, and save money in the long run. Representative Ford argues that the regulation would prevent contractors from shifting work to lower skilled and lower paid helpers, which would undermine apprenticeship training programs and create low skilled, dead-end jobs. The Department plans to issue revised helpers regulations in the upcoming fiscal year. Representative Ford urged against the DeLay amendment, which was defeated, retaining the language prohibiting implementation of helper regulations in the bill. Congress has attempted to modify or repeal the Davis-Bacon Act through various means, with a focus on repeal during the 104th Congress. Senator Kassebaum introduced S. 141 in 1995 calling for the repeal of Davis-Bacon. During the 104th Congress, efforts were made to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. Senator Kassebaum introduced S. 141 for repeal, which was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. In the House, Representative Ballenger introduced H.R. 500 for the same purpose. Both bills faced party-line divisions in committees before moving forward. During the 104th Congress, efforts were made to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. Senator Kassebaum introduced S. 141 for repeal, which was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. In the House, Representative Ballenger introduced H.R. 500 for the same purpose. Both bills faced party-line divisions in committees before moving forward. The Subcommittee voted along party lines to report the measure to the full Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. Two additional measures, S. 1183 (Hatfield) and H.R. 2472 (Weldon), were introduced as compromises to reform rather than repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. Representative Weldon argued that repealing Davis-Bacon would harm skilled construction workers and their families. The Hatfield and Weldon bills proposed comprehensive revisions to the Act, including provisions for helpers. The Hatfield/Weldon bills did not resolve technical issues with helper classifications under the Davis-Bacon Act. The bills did not define the term \"prevails\" or establish a ratio of helpers to journeymen. The classification of helpers and their compensation rates remained unclear. The Hatfield/Weldon legislation did not address technical issues with helper classifications under the Davis-Bacon Act. The term \"prevails\" remained undefined, and no ratio of helpers to journeymen was established. The Department suspended the helper regulation in November 1993 under congressional mandate. The spending prohibition continued until mid-fiscal 1996, but no such prohibition was imposed for the latter half of fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1997. In June 1996, the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) filed a lawsuit in federal court to enforce the revised helper regulations. The Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) sued the Department to enforce revised helper regulations, citing a cost of over $500 million per year to taxpayers. The Department quickly responded, with Assistant Secretary of Labor Bernard Anderson stating that the current helper regulation was non-administrable and unclear in distinguishing between helpers and other workers. Anderson confirmed that the Department had no intention of implementing the regulation in its current form. The Department clarified that the current helper regulation was unclear and non-administrable, with no intention of implementing it in its current form. Additional information over the years warranted a review of the suspended rule, originally crafted to align the construction workforce on federal projects with the private sector's use of helpers. The Federal Register notice highlighted concerns about the potential abuse of helper classification and its impact on prevailing wages and apprenticeship programs in federal construction projects. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the impact of helper regulations on formal apprenticeship and training programs. Due to Congressional controversy and lack of public comment, DOL decided to reexamine the semi-skilled helper regulation. The suspension of the regulation will continue while the Department engages in substantive rulemaking. Public comments were requested, and nearly five months passed. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of the helper regulations while engaging in substantive rulemaking. Public comments were requested and received over a five-month period, with most comments focusing on the substantive issues of the rule rather than the interim suspension. The Building and Construction Trades Department agreed with the suspension, while the Associated General Contractors disagreed, suggesting a quicker implementation timeline. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of the helper regulations, despite the Associated General Contractors arguing for a quicker implementation timeline. DOL believes it would take longer than 60 days to fully implement the regulations based on past experience. The rule would provide a 60-day effective date for affected parties to come into compliance. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of helper regulations, citing the need for additional time for implementation. Bid solicitations must be advertised for 30 to 60 days before contract award. Contractors can use helpers if the contract contains a wage determination with a helper classification or if the contractor requests a helper classification to be added. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of helper regulations due to the need for additional time for implementation. The Department determined that using a helper classification is a prevailing practice in the area where the work will be performed, and completing a substantive rulemaking action is still the intention within approximately one year. The implementation of helper regulations during the rulemaking period would result in minimal savings and cause disruption and uncertainty. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of helper regulations due to the disruption and uncertainty it would cause during rulemaking. Comments did not change the Department's belief in the suspension, and they are reexamining the basis and effect of the regulations. They have not decided to repeal or amend the regulations yet but will consider changes in the future. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the potential impact of the helper regulation on formal apprenticeship and training programs, noting that the use of helpers may not be as widespread as initially thought. They also highlighted the difficulty in administering the regulation and policing potential abuse of the helper classification. The Department is willing to explore further the extent of private sector helper utilization and related costs/savings impacts. The Department of Labor is concerned about the subjective nature of the helper classification under Davis-Bacon regulations, which may make enforcement challenging. Critics worry about the impact on apprenticeship programs and the potential for contractors to pay apprentices lower wages. The Department of Labor is concerned about contractors paying apprentices lower wages, which could threaten formal training programs and private funding for apprenticeship and training. Some in the industry view helpers as entry-level workers, allowing them to gain experience. The Department of Labor is suspending the helper regulation to further understand the helper/apprentice relationship and may issue a final rule amending or reinstating the regulations. In 1996, the Associated Builders and Contractors sued the DOL to implement helper regulations. In 1997, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the DOL's indefinite suspension of the regulations. Judge Stanley Sporkin acknowledged the \"good cause\" for the suspension in 1993 due to congressional prohibition, but questioned its validity after the prohibition expired in 1996. Judge Sporkin disagreed with ABC's argument that DOL was required to implement the regulations once the spending ban expired in 1996. He stated that the Department had the freedom to review the regulations and collect new data on helper employment during the two-and-a-half year period between the suspension and the ban expiration, which undermined the assumptions behind the revised regulations. The Department collected new data on helper employment, undermining the assumptions behind the revised regulations and casting doubt on cost-savings. Judge Sporkin argued that the Department had the discretion to seek a postponement of the effective date based on this new information. Judge Sporkin pointed out that the Department should have sought an indefinite postponement of the effective date based on new data collected on helper employment. He noted that the plaintiffs focused on the substance of the regulations rather than procedural issues, offering little evidence that the delays were arbitrary and capricious. Judge Sporkin ruled in favor of the Department of Labor, suspending the helper regulation indefinitely. The court found the Department's rationale for the delay to be reasonable, despite challenges to the cost-saving claims. A new proposed rule on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects was published in the Federal Register, reflecting the Wage and Hour Division's longstanding policy on the issue. The Wage and Hour Division affirmed its longstanding policy on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects, allowing their use only under specific conditions. The notice reviewed Departmental initiatives and constraints imposed by Congress on implementing a new helper rule. The DOL's expectations for new policy changes in the early 1980s aimed to align with private sector practices, reduce federal construction costs, and provide job opportunities for unskilled workers. However, after extensive analysis, it was found that the suspended rule may not be effectively enforced, the use of helpers in the private sector is not as widespread as assumed, and full implementation could negatively impact apprenticeship and training programs. The findings under the Clinton Administration differed from those of the Reagan era. The DOL under the Clinton Administration found that the suspended regulation on helpers posed significant administrative difficulties and could not be effectively enforced. The definition of \"helper\" was criticized as internally inconsistent and not distinguishable from that of a general laborer. This led the Department to conclude that reverting to pre-1980s practice was necessary. The Department of Labor struggled with developing enforcement guidelines for job classifications, including determining the line between semi-skilled and skilled workers. They also questioned whether a skilled worker could work as a semi-skilled helper without violating regulations. The Department dissected the provisions of the suspended rule. The Department of Labor argued that the definition in the suspended rule provided little guidance for distinguishing between semi-skilled helpers and journeyworkers, leading to significant overlap in duties and making it difficult to classify helpers as a distinct group. The Department of Labor highlighted the challenges in distinguishing between helpers and laborers in the construction industry due to significant overlap in duties and subjective definitions of the term \"helper.\" Conducting a meaningful wage determination process for helpers was deemed difficult, as contractors ascribed different meanings to the term. The Department of Labor found it challenging to define and determine wages for helpers in the construction industry due to varying interpretations of the term. Survey data revealed that the use of helpers was less widespread than initially assumed, leading to difficulties in establishing formal training programs for workers. \"Formal apprenticeship training programs lead to quicker achievement of journeylevel status compared to informal training, which can result in being stuck in low-paying jobs. These programs produce skilled, productive, and safety-conscious workers, encouraging training for unskilled and semi-skilled workers, including women and minorities. The Department of Labor aims to prevent contractors from using helpers instead of apprentices and trainees in structured training programs.\" The Department of Labor aims to prevent contractors from using helpers instead of apprentices and trainees in structured training programs. Representative Norwood introduced legislation to establish helpers as a separate classification of worker under the Davis-Bacon Act. Representative Norwood reintroduced the proposal (H.R. 1012) in the 106th Congress to define \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker who assists a journeyman in various tasks. The bill was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce but no action was taken on it. The bill introduced by Representative Norwood (H.R. 1012) to define \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker was not acted upon by the Committee on Education and the Workforce. The Department of Labor (DOL) reviewed the legislation in April 1999, finding it imprecise and burdensome. A final rule on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects was issued by the DOL in November 2000, taking effect in January 2001. The Department of Labor issued a regulation in January 2001 regarding the recognition of helpers as a separate category of workers. The Department explained the difficulties in administering and enforcing the suspended rule with its definition of helpers, opting for a duties-based approach. Industry spokespersons disagreed, suggesting that helper classes could be identified through area practice surveys. The Department of Labor reasoned that identifying helper classes through area practice surveys is challenging due to the suspended rule allowing helpers to perform duties of other classifications without limitations. This could lead to overlapping duties and difficulties in enforcement and wage determination. The Department of Labor suspended a rule that would have allowed helpers to perform work of other classifications at lower wages, undermining the prevailing wage structure. The Department cited vague criteria for defining helpers and the difficulty in distinguishing between semi-skilled and skilled work in today's construction market. The Department of Labor suspended a rule allowing helpers to perform work of other classifications at lower wages due to vague criteria for defining helpers and difficulty in distinguishing between semi-skilled and skilled work in the construction market. Laborers and journeyworkers may work under supervision, but the concept of supervision on a construction site is ambiguous and not easily evaluated. The Wage and Hour Administration expressed concerns about conducting meaningful wage determinations using the suspended definition of helpers. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University raised concerns about the impact of the suspended rule. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University raised concerns about the impact of the suspended rule on wage surveys and productivity. The Department of Labor emphasized the importance of protecting prevailing wages and stated that the purpose of the Davis-Bacon Act was to set a floor on wages, not to secure the cheapest labor. The Department of Labor found that helpers are used less widely than previously thought, with only 3.9% of classifications employing helpers. This contradicted earlier projections and highlighted the importance of protecting prevailing wages under the Davis-Bacon Act. The Department of Labor found that the use of helpers in construction is extremely low, with estimates ranging from 1.2% to slightly higher percentages. The issue is influenced by assumptions about the construction industry's structure and definitions of terms like \"widespread.\" The Department believes that helpers are not as prevalent as previously assumed and that suspending helper regulations could harm training programs in the industry. The Department of Labor expressed concerns that suspending helper regulations in the construction industry could undermine formal apprenticeship and training programs, leading to a shortage of skilled craft workers. Building trades unions argued that using helpers instead of apprentices would disadvantage contractors supporting formal training programs. The Department of Labor expressed concerns that suspending helper regulations in the construction industry could lead to a shortage of skilled craft workers. Employers disputed this, stating there was no basis for concern. The Department emphasized the importance of formal structured training programs over informal on-the-job training. The Department of Labor reinstated the definition of \"helper\" in Davis-Bacon projects to prevent the undermining of formal apprenticeship and training programs. The final rule, effective January 19, 2001, clarifies that helpers can only be used on projects where their duties are clearly distinct from other workers. The Department of Labor reinstated the definition of \"helper\" in Davis-Bacon projects to prevent undermining formal apprenticeship and training programs. Helpers can only be used on projects where their duties are clearly distinct from other workers. In the 107th Congress on May 23, 2001, Representative Norwood introduced legislation addressing the helper issue. In the 108th Congress, Representative Marsha Blackburn introduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act\" (H.R. 2283) along with Representatives Norwood and Steve King. The proposal aimed to classify helpers separately for Davis-Bacon purposes and ensure they are paid the prevailing wage of helpers and laborers or mechanics on similar projects in the locality. A \"helper\" was defined as a semi-skilled worker who assists skilled journeyman mechanics. In the 108th Congress, Representative Marsha Blackburn introduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act\" (H.R. 2283) to classify helpers separately for Davis-Bacon purposes and ensure they are paid the prevailing wage of helpers and laborers or mechanics on similar projects in the locality. The bill defined a \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker who assists skilled journeyman mechanics. In the 109th Congress, Blackburn reintroduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunities Act\" (H.R. 3907) with Representative Norwood, but no action was taken on the proposal. The Davis-Bacon Act has been a focus of public policy debate since the 1960s, with periodic reviews and changes such as the inclusion of fringe benefits in 1964. A new round of review occurred in the late 1970s during the Carter Administration, resulting in rulemaking. In the late 1970s, the Carter Administration initiated a new round of review of Davis-Bacon, leading to rulemaking. The regulations were withdrawn and new ones proposed in 1981, addressing the issue of helpers. Litigation ensued, with portions of the rule gaining court approval over the years. However, the helper provision was only approved in 1992 after Congress intervened and blocked enforcement until 1996. Eventually, the Department of Labor deemed the regulation unenforceable and suspended it for further review. The Department of Labor suspended the enforcement of a regulation regarding helpers in construction, deeming it \"non-administrable\" and reverting to the status quo of the late 1970s. After new evidence emerged, the regulation was suspended in December 1996 for further review. Litigation ensued, with a court ruling in July 1997 that the Department acted appropriately in withdrawing the regulation. The Department of Labor withdrew a regulation regarding helpers in construction, which was deemed \"non-administrable\" and reverted to the late 1970s status quo. Litigation followed, with a court ruling in July 1997 that the Department acted appropriately. A new proposed rule was published in April 1999, reinstating the Department's practice with helpers. The final rule was issued on November 20, 2000, taking effect on January 19, 2001, after over 2 decades of defining wage treatment for helpers on Davis-Bacon projects. The Department of Labor withdrew a regulation on helpers in construction, reverting to the late 1970s practice. Litigation ensued, with a court ruling in July 1997 supporting the Department's actions. A new rule in April 1999 reinstated the original helper classification, and a final rule in November 2000 largely rejected the policies of the 1980s and 1990s. Legislation in the 109th Congress addressed the helper issue. In the 109th Congress, legislation was introduced to recognize a separate \"helper\" classification on Davis-Bacon projects, but the bill did not pass. The issue has not resurfaced in the 110th Congress."
