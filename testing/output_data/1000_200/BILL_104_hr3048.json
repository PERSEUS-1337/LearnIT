    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Regulatory Flexibility Amendments Act of 1996\". Judicial review is addressed in the Act. Section 611 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to allow small entities to petition for judicial review of final rules that were certified to have no significant economic impact or had a regulatory flexibility analysis prepared. A court with jurisdiction over rule compliance can review the certification or analysis. The provision allows small entities to petition for judicial review of final rules certified to have no significant economic impact. The court can review the certification or analysis, and affected small entities can file a petition within one year of the analysis being made public. The court may order the agency to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis if the certification was found to be arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with the law. If the agency fails to take corrective action within 90 days, the court can intervene. The court may order the agency to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis or take corrective action within a specified period. If the agency fails to comply, the court can stay the rule or grant appropriate relief, considering the rule of prejudicial error. Any regulatory flexibility analysis for a rule is part of the record for judicial review. This section does not prevent judicial review of other required impact statements or analyses under different laws. The amendment allows judicial review of impact statements required by other laws. It applies to final agency rules issued after the Act's enactment. SEC. 3. RULES COMMENTED ON BY SBA CHIEF COUNSEL FOR ADVOCACY.
