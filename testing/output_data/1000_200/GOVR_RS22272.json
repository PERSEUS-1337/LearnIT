    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), regulates \"federal election activity,\" including voter registration drives, voter identification, get-out-the-vote drives, and public communications that refer to federal candidates. Public communications are defined as various forms of media targeting the general public. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) defines \"public communications\" as various forms of media targeting the general public, including broadcast, cable, satellite, newspaper, magazine, outdoor advertising, mass mailing, or telephone bank communications. Candidate and party committees can only use regulated federal funds, known as \"hard money,\" for \"federal election activity.\" The FEC exempted Internet communications from federal campaign finance regulation, leading to a lawsuit by Representatives Shays and Meehan against the FEC. In response, BCRA sponsors Representatives Shays and Meehan sued the FEC in U.S. district court, arguing that the FEC's failure to regulate Internet activities allowed circumvention of campaign finance laws. The court in Shays v. FEC overturned FEC regulations on Internet political communications, stating that excluding Internet communications from the definition of \"public communication\" was inconsistent with Congress's intent in BCRA. The court overturned FEC regulations on Internet political communications, stating that the use of the phrase \"or any other form of general public political advertising\" in the BCRA definition of \"public communication\" was crucial. The court also found that the FEC failed to provide adequate notice to the public regarding the definition of \"generic campaign activity\" as a \"public communication.\" The court overturned FEC regulations on Internet political communications, stating that the FEC failed to provide adequate notice to the public under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court found that the exemption of Internet communications from the definition of \"public communications\" meant they could not be considered \"coordinated communications\" subject to FECA regulation. This contrasted with the long-standing principle in campaign finance law that expenditures made in cooperation with a candidate are considered contributions. The court overturned FEC regulations on Internet political communications, stating that the exclusion of Internet communications from coordinated communications was contrary to Congress's intent. The court remanded the case to the FEC for further action consistent with its decision. In response, the FEC published an NPRM seeking comments on amending the definition of \"public communication\" to include paid Internet advertisements. The FEC proposed changes to disclaimer regulations and exceptions to definitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" for certain Internet activities. The rules aimed to ensure proper financing and disclosure of political committee Internet communications without hindering individual citizens' freedom of speech. After a public hearing in June 2005, the FEC delayed consideration of Internet regulations pending congressional action. In March 2006, the FEC unanimously approved the new regulations, citing the 2004 Shays v. FEC court decision as a driving factor. In March 2006, the FEC unanimously approved new regulations reflecting an attempt to leave blogs free of FECA regulation, as long as they are not performed for a fee. The regulations were influenced by the 2004 Shays v. FEC court decision and aimed to prevent corruption while promoting the Internet as a unique forum for free speech and information exchange. The FEC recognized the importance of preventing corruption but also acknowledged that Internet activities do not present a significant danger of corruption. The FEC proposed regulations to treat paid Internet advertising as \"public communication\" but exclude other Internet communications from this definition. The regulations apply when money is exchanged for campaign ads on the Internet, subjecting them to FECA limitations and reporting requirements. The FEC regulations treat paid Internet ads as \"public communications,\" subjecting them to FECA limitations and reporting requirements. Paid Internet ads must include disclaimers if they advocate for a federal candidate or solicit contributions. The FEC regulations require disclaimers on paid Internet ads advocating for a federal candidate or soliciting contributions. Disclaimers are not needed on emails unless sent by political committees. Payments to bloggers by candidates must be disclosed on candidate statements. Coordinated Internet ads with a candidate or party committee are considered in-kind contributions subject to FECA limits. The FEC regulations require disclaimers on paid Internet ads advocating for a federal candidate or soliciting contributions. Payments to bloggers by candidates must be disclosed on candidate statements. Coordinated Internet ads with a candidate or party committee are considered in-kind contributions subject to FECA limits and disclosure requirements. Individual or volunteer activity on the Internet to influence a federal election is exempt from FECA regulation. During the consideration of BCRA in Congress, the topic of Internet communications was discussed but not addressed. An amendment to exempt Internet communications from FECA regulation was defeated. In the 109th Congress, bills were proposed to exempt all Internet communications from regulation under FECA, but they failed to pass. The bill failed to pass in the House with a 225-182 vote, requiring two-thirds for passage. It was later ordered reported favorably by the House Administration Committee but the vote was postponed pending FEC regulatory action. Two additional bills were proposed during the 109th Congress to address concerns about the Online Freedom of Speech Act potentially allowing FECA circumvention. H.R. 4194 aimed to exclude Internet communications from FECA regulation, while H.R. 4900 sought to exempt most individual online communications and advertisements below a dollar from regulation. During the 110th Congress, there was no major legislative action on regulating political communications on the Internet. H.R. 894 would have extended disclaimer requirements to Internet communications, while H.R. 5699 aimed to exempt uncompensated Internet services from being treated as contributions or expenditures. House floor action on these bills was postponed indefinitely after new FEC regulations were approved in 2006. H.R. 5699 aimed to exempt individuals and corporations engaged in Internet activities from certain revenue sources, including public communication fees and email address list purchases. It also sought to exempt blogs and electronic publications from expenditure regulations. The bill was referred to the Committee on House Administration during the 110th Congress."
