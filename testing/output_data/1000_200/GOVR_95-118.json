    "content": "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established by ERISA in 1974 to protect pensions of participants in private sector defined benefit plans. PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, covering about 37 million participants in FY2018. In FY2018, PBGC insured 25,000 DB pension plans with 37 million participants. It paid benefits to 1.4 million people and is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans. PBGC provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. 49% of participants in terminated multiemployer plans have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee. The PBGC, a government-owned corporation, is administered by a three-member board of directors. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with Senate approval. The governance structures of PBGC were altered by the MAP-21 Act, including setting the Director's term at five years and requiring the Board to meet at least four times a year. An Advisory Committee advises PBGC on various issues. The PBGC, a government-owned corporation, is required by ERISA to be self-supporting and receives no appropriations from general revenue. The main sources of PBGC revenue are premiums set by Congress, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded pension plans. Some Members of Congress are hesitant to provide financial assistance to PBGC. The PBGC is funded through premiums, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded pension plans. The sponsors of private-sector pension plans pay premiums to PBGC, including a flat-rate per-participant premium and additional premiums for underfunded plans. In 2019, sponsors of single-employer DB pension plans pay an annual premium of $80 per participant. In 2019, sponsors of single-employer DB pension plans pay premiums including a flat-rate per-participant premium of $80, a variable-rate premium for underfunded plans, and a termination premium for plans ending in certain situations. Multiemployer DB pension plans pay a flat-rate premium of $29 per participant in 2019. In 2019, sponsors of single-employer DB pension plans pay premiums including a flat-rate per-participant premium of $80, a variable-rate premium for underfunded plans, and a termination premium for plans ending in certain situations. Multiemployer DB pension plans pay a flat-rate premium of $29 per participant in 2019. PBGC covers only DB plans meeting Section 401 qualification requirements of the IRC. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans are not insured by PBGC. Plans meeting IRC Section 401 requirements receive tax benefits. Employer contributions are tax-deductible, and plan earnings are not taxable income to participants. Pension plan income is taxed as ordinary income. When a pension plan participant receives income, it is taxed as ordinary income. To qualify under the IRC, a pension plan must be permanent, provide definite benefits, not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees, and cover a minimum number of employees. PBGC excludes certain plans from insurance coverage, such as governmental plans, church plans, and plans for professionals with fewer than 25 participants. PBGC operates separate insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer plans with separate reserve funds. PBGC operates separate insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer plans. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated underfunded pension plans, while in the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent plans. Employers can voluntarily or involuntarily terminate single-employer plans, with participants and PBGC being notified accordingly. A single-employer plan can be terminated voluntarily in a standard or distress termination. PBGC may also involuntarily terminate an underfunded plan if the sponsor cannot fund its pension obligations. If a company ends its pension plan voluntarily with sufficient assets to cover benefit liabilities, PBGC does not pay benefits to participants. Benefit liabilities include all benefits earned by participants, vested and nonvested, early retirement supplements, and subsidies. If assets cover benefit liabilities, PBGC confirms termination requirements have been met. The termination of a single-employer pension plan with sufficient assets to cover benefit liabilities may result in the distribution of benefits to participants. Any excess assets may be recovered by the employer through an asset reversion, subject to an excise tax. The excise tax rate is 20% if a qualified replacement plan is established, otherwise, it is 50% of the reversion amount. When an underfunded plan terminates in distress or involuntary termination, PBGC becomes the trustee, takes control of assets, and pays liabilities. PBGC uses plan assets and recovered employer assets to pay benefits, with any shortfall covered by PBGC's funds. Distress termination requires meeting specific criteria. The distress termination criteria for a pension plan include: 1. Filing for bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings, 2. Approval by the court for plan termination to continue business, 3. PBGC determining termination is necessary for debt payment, or 4. PBGC determining termination is needed to avoid pension burdens. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if necessary for the employer to pay debts or avoid burdensome pension costs caused by a decline in the workforce. These requirements were added by SEPPAA and modified by P.L. 100-203 and RPA to ensure employer responsibility for underfunded plans unless strict financial need standards are met. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits when due, has a substantial owner who received a distribution over $10,000, or if PBGC's long-run loss is expected to increase unreasonably. A federal court may also order termination to protect participants' interests or avoid financial deterioration. Table 2 shows termination data since 1974 by single-employer DB pension plans. Table 2 provides data on terminations by single-employer DB pension plans since 1974. PBGC became trustee of 4,769 plans from FY1974 to FY2016. Most terminations result in standard terminations, with only a small fraction leading to claims against PBGC. After distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and its controlled group members are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. The liability of a terminated pension plan is the difference between the plan's termination date value and its assets. Each member of the controlled group is jointly liable for the entire amount, payable to PBGC in cash or securities. Failure to pay may result in a lien on the employer's property. If the sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited. PBGC's benefit payments upon termination depend on the statutory limit. PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited when an underfunded plan terminates. The benefits PBGC pays depend on the statutory limit on guaranteed benefits, the terminated plan's assets, and recoveries from the employer. PBGC guarantees vested retirement benefits and certain death, survivor, or disability benefits at the date of plan termination. Only monthly installment retirement benefits are guaranteed, and contingent benefits may also be covered. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees retirement benefits that commence before the plan's normal retirement age, contingent benefits are guaranteed only if the triggering event occurs before plan termination. The maximum pension guarantee for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019 is $67,295 annually, adjusted for national wage growth. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019. The benefit amount is adjusted annually based on when the participant starts receiving payments. Examples of maximum benefits for different ages and annuity types are provided in Table 3. There are reductions in the maximum guarantee for benefits paid before age 65. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019. The reduction in the maximum guarantee for benefits paid before age 65 is 7% for the first 5 years, 4% for the next 5 years, and 2% for the following 10 years. Only \"basic benefits\" are guaranteed, including benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and survivor benefits. Vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 for retirees in FY2015. Over 80% of PBGC recipients in single-employer plans received their full benefits according to a 2008 study. In a study released in 2008, PBGC indicated that over 80% of recipients in single-employer plans received their full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits were reduced. Assets of terminated plans are allocated to pay benefits based on a priority schedule. PBGC also pays participants a portion of their unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits. In multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency rather than plan termination. PBGC provides financial assistance to insolvent multiemployer plans by offering loans to cover benefits that exceed available resources. These loans are rarely repaid, and if the plan recovers, repayment must begin. PBGC offers loans to insolvent multiemployer plans to cover benefit shortfalls, with repayment required if the plan recovers. Only one plan has repaid any financial assistance. The benefit guarantee limit for participants is based on a formula tied to years of service, with a maximum of $12,870 for 30 years of service. The PBGC benefit guarantee limit is $12,870 for participants with 30 years of service. PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance get their full benefit, but only 49% would in plans needing assistance in the future. Plans not receiving assistance have larger benefits. The net financial position is a key measure of PBGC's financial status. The PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. PBGC's main assets include its trust fund and revolving funds, while its main liabilities are future benefit payments and financial assistance. PBGC's main liabilities are future benefit payments and financial assistance. The single-employer program showed a surplus in FY2018, while the multiemployer program has reported deficits since FY2002. PBGC projects that the multiemployer program will likely become insolvent. PBGC reported deficits in the multiemployer program since FY2002, projecting insolvency by FY2025 with less than 1% chance of solvency in FY2026. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments in FY2015, with an average monthly payment of $536. Retiree payees received an average monthly benefit of $606, while beneficiary payees received $307. Around 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment in FY2015, averaging $2,054. In FY2015, approximately 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment averaging $2,054. PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion in FY2018, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. The financial assistance provided to multiemployer plans increased significantly from FY2008 to FY2018. In FY2018, 78 plans received assistance, benefiting 62,300 participants with 27,800 expected to receive future benefits. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program rose from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017 before decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program increased significantly from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017 before decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. PBGC's budgetary cash flows are based on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and trust and revolving funds. Trust funds hold pension plan assets, while revolving funds contain premiums and trust fund transfers for participant benefits. When PBGC takes over a pension plan, assets are transferred to a nonbudgetary trust fund. The assets of terminated pension plans are transferred to PBGC and placed in a nonbudgetary trust fund managed by private-sector money managers. The trust fund's investments totaled $70.2 billion at the end of FY2018. PBGC has seven revolving funds, but only three are used, containing premiums from pension plan sponsors and trust fund transfers for benefits. The PBGC transfers funds from the trust fund to revolving funds to pay for participants' benefits. The revolving funds' assets at the end of FY2018 were $33.2 billion, invested exclusively in U.S. Treasury securities. The funds' gross outlays include benefit payments and administrative expenses, while receipts include premiums paid and interest on federal securities. Increases in premiums paid by pension plan sponsors to PBGC are considered federal revenue. Some stakeholders criticize PBGC premium increases as they believe the funds are used to offset federal spending rather than improve PBGC's financial condition. PBGC projected a deficit reduction in the single-employer program by FY2018 and a $26 billion surplus in 10 years. The multiemployer program is forecasted to run out of money by FY2025. PBGC projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years. The multiemployer program is at risk of insolvency by FY2025, with a 99% chance of insolvency by 2026 due to large pension plans. PBGC's exposure to future financial assistance for the multiemployer program is estimated at $53.8 billion. Premium levels may not be enough to support insolvent plans, potentially exhausting PBGC's ability to guarantee benefits. Once resources are depleted, insolvent plans may need to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections. PBGC's multiemployer program faces insolvency risk by FY2025. Plans may need to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections once resources are exhausted. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits, potentially improving PBGC's financial condition. Uncertainty remains on how benefit suspensions and plan partitions will be utilized under MPRA. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to improve the solvency of pension plans and the PBGC. The committee did not release recommendations by the deadline. Historical data on premium levels is provided in tables A-1 and A-2. Table A-1 and A-2 provide historical data on single-employer and multiemployer program premium levels."
