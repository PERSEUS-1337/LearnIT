The Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat to national security, especially in unstable regions. The United Nations has recognized the threat of weapons of mass destruction and has taken steps to prevent proliferation. The United Nations Special Commission on Iraq was established to prevent nuclear proliferation. Aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, other nations are pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Regional nuclear arms races increase the risk of nuclear weapons use. Concerns about Russia's nuclear materials tracking raise the threat of proliferation. Belarus signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program aided by dual-use exports from western countries. North Korea and the United States exchanged nuclear reactors for light water reactor technology to reduce bomb-making capabilities. North Korea's history of pursuing nuclear weapons capability raises concerns about nuclear proliferation. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa renounced nuclear weapons and accepted IAEA safeguards. The United States' security interests align with South Korea's policies. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones to prevent regional conflicts and arms races. The IAEA's safeguard system may be affected by constraints, but the US backs its efforts. The United States supports immobilizing plutonium for energy and mixing it with low-enriched uranium for nuclear reactors. Challenges arise from storing and disposing of plutonium from dismantled warheads. Strengthening the international nuclear nonproliferation regime is crucial. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 shows the US commitment to support nonproliferation efforts. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 reaffirmed the US commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and strengthening the IAEA. It aims to establish better controls over nuclear transfers and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide. SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION POLICY. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by placing fissile materials under international controls, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, ending production of new nuclear warheads with Russia, and negotiating to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals. The multilateral agreement aims to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia to 2,000-2,500 each, with lower levels for the UK, France, and China. Additional enforceable agreements are sought to reduce nuclear arsenals globally. Immediate agreements with Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty states are sought to halt fissile material production by 2008 and place existing stockpiles under international controls. The multilateral agreement aims to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia to 2,000-2,500 each, with lower levels for the UK, France, and China. Immediate agreements with Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty states are sought to halt fissile material production by 2008, place existing stockpiles under international controls, strengthen IAEA safeguards, and enhance nuclear and dual-use export controls. The measures include imposing sanctions on entities involved in nuclear proliferation, increasing transparency on nuclear export licenses, and endorsing the IAEA's Strengthened Safeguards System. Additionally, efforts are made to reduce incentives for acquiring nuclear weapons, enhance regional security agreements, and urge the UN Security Council to enforce nonproliferation agreements. A commitment to a \"no first use\" policy with other nuclear states and providing immediate assistance to NPT parties under nuclear attack is also emphasized. The measures include supporting NPT parties under nuclear attack, bilateral agreement with Russia for nuclear disarmament, ratifying nuclear-free zone treaties, monitoring North Korea's nuclear activities, and starting negotiations on START III. To prevent North Korea from restarting its weapons program, formal negotiations on START III should begin between the United States and the Russian Federation before START II takes effect. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the President must report to Congress annually on the actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those of the Russian Federation and other countries. Reports must be unclassified, with a classified appendix if needed. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"fissile materials,\" \"highly enriched uranium,\" \"IAEA,\" \"IAEA safeguards,\" \"no first use,\" \"non-nuclear weapon state,\" and \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\" The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\" \"nuclear weapon state,\" \"START I treaty,\" and \"START II treaty.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the context of nuclear arms control agreements. The curr_chunk defines the \"START III treaty\" as the Treaty on Further Reductions and Limitations of Strategic Offensive Arms discussed between President Clinton and President Yeltsin in March 1997."
