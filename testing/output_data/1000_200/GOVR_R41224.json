    "content": "The changing structure of U.S. agriculture has raised concerns about reduced competition in various agricultural markets, including dairy. Key issues in the dairy industry include consolidation and industry concentration. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice planned workshops to address competition issues in agriculture. A workshop focusing on the dairy industry is scheduled for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI. This report offers background on the U.S. dairy industry, financial stress for dairy farmers, and the historical development of the industry. The curr_chunk discusses financial stress for dairy farmers in 2009 due to lower milk prices, leading to over $1 billion in federal support. It also covers industry consolidation, concentration, and antitrust laws in the dairy industry. In 2009, the federal government provided over $1 billion in support to the dairy industry. Despite financial assistance, the number of U.S. dairy farms decreased by 3% to 65,000 farms. The decline in dairy cows led to a drop in milk production, but increased foreign demand raised average farm milk prices to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010. Dairy farmers still face financial concerns after losing farm equity during the milk price collapse. Financial concerns remain for dairy farmers who lost significant amounts of farm equity during the milk price collapse and continue to contend with high feed prices. The industry and Members of Congress are reconsidering options to handle fluctuations in milk prices and income for dairy farmers. The Obama Administration and some Members of Congress are also examining issues of consolidation and concentration in the dairy industry. The U.S. dairy industry has evolved over the last 100 years, transitioning from local to national markets with advancements in milk marketing. Government intervention has played a significant role, with dairy farmers forming cooperatives to bargain with milk handlers. Urban growth led to milk being processed for wider distribution by the early 1900s. Financial concerns persist for dairy farmers amidst price fluctuations and high feed costs. Discussions on handling price fluctuations and industry consolidation are ongoing. In the early 1900s, dairy farmers turned to cooperatives to negotiate with milk buyers, leading to the establishment of the Capper-Volstead Act in 1922. Classified pricing for milk based on its use was introduced, but broke down during the Great Depression. Federal milk marketing orders were then created to stabilize the market and balance the power between farmers and processors. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) were established to stabilize the market and equalize the power between dairy farmers and processors. Import quotas were enacted to protect producers, and during World War II, demand for milk increased. The government began supporting milk prices in the late 1940s through the Dairy Product Price Support Program. Additional programs like the Dairy Export Incentives Program and Milk Income Loss Contract were added to national dairy policy in later years. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century. In the early 20th century, raw milk was transported to processing plants by truck or rail, with milk primarily bottled for home delivery. Home delivery characterized fluid milk marketing for decades, emphasizing the historical local production and consumption of milk. Advancements in milk marketing have shifted the U.S. dairy industry from local to national. Improved transportation and packaging led to a transition to retail milk purchases in stores. Bulk milk is now transported long distances to meet market demands, along with dairy products like cheese and yogurt. The dairy industry has seen a shift towards national distribution of products like cheese, yogurt, and milk to food distribution centers across the country. There has been a long-standing issue regarding the relationship between farm and retail prices, with a decline in farm value share causing concern among Congress about economic stress on dairy farmers. Factors such as increased productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing have contributed to a decreasing farm share of the retail food dollar. The declining farm share of the retail food dollar is attributed to factors like increased agricultural productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing. In 1950, the farm share was 41%, but by 2006, it had dropped to 18.5%. For milk and dairy products, the farm share is around one-third of the retail dollar, higher than the all-food average due to lower processing levels in other food categories. The farm share of the retail price for milk and dairy products remained relatively flat between 2000 and 2008, with a slight uptrend for cheddar cheese. In 2008 and early 2009, there was a decline in the farm-value share of retail product values, leading to a widening of the marketing margin. The difference between the retail and farm price increased to $2.35 per gallon by December 2008. In January 2009, the retail price of milk was $2.43 per gallon higher than the farm price, a record-high difference. Throughout 2009, retailers lowered prices due to lower farm milk costs, reducing the margin to $1.69 per gallon by December. The price spread returned to the five-year average in early 2010, with retail price adjustments to farm price changes taking months to occur. Retail food prices tend to adjust faster and more significantly to increases in farm prices than to decreases, a phenomenon known as \"sticky\" retail food prices. Consumer behavior, store preferences, and inventory management can limit retail price adjustments to downward farm price movements. This does not necessarily indicate excessive market power by retailers. Recent research has also shown that competition plays a role in price movements. Consolidation in agriculture has led to fewer but larger operations, reducing costs and increasing competitiveness. Retail stores offering additional services may charge more for products like milk, creating a disconnect between farm and retail prices. Competition effects can attract less price-sensitive consumers to supermarkets, influencing price movements. Consolidation in the dairy industry has led to larger operations, reducing costs and increasing competitiveness. This has resulted in fewer dairy farms needed to produce the same amount of milk. Concentration of firms controlling sales or purchases has been increasing in the industry. Concentration in the dairy industry has increased, with a small number of firms controlling most sales. The number of dairy farms has decreased due to higher productivity and technological advancements. Total milk production has continued to rise despite the decline in farms and cows. Domestic demand for milk has grown slowly, while consumption of dairy products like cheese has increased. Exports of dairy products have increased, reaching record levels in 2008. Farm numbers have shifted, with smaller farms declining while larger farms with 1,000 or more cows increasing by 20% due to lower production costs. Dairy industry structure at the farm level is characterized by milk volume. In 2009, the largest portion of U.S. milk output (47%) was produced on farms with 1,000 head or more, while small farms (fewer than 100 head) accounted for only 16% of the total. Larger dairy farms benefit from scale economies, modern facilities, and automated systems, leading to lower production costs. Regional variations exist in the structure of dairy farms. Large, modern dairy buildings reduce housing costs and automated manure systems help with handling. Dairy farm structures vary by region, with western states having larger farms (e.g., California with 850 cows per farm) compared to Wisconsin with smaller farms averaging 88 cows. Operating costs in western states are affected by high feed costs, while overhead costs are relatively low due to a large number of animals. Farms in regions where producers feed grain and hay produced on the farm, like in Wisconsin, tend to have lower operating costs. Dairy cooperatives, owned and operated by farmers, manage milk distribution and product manufacturing. The number of dairy cooperatives has been decreasing since the 1940s as they merge for economic benefits. The number of dairy cooperatives has been declining since the 1940s, with consolidations and strategic alliances enabling them to serve large retail customers. By 2008, 79% of the milk produced in the United States was marketed by the 50 largest dairy cooperatives. The dairy sector has seen consolidation within cooperatives, with the top four firms accounting for 40% of U.S. milk production in 2008. The National Milk Producers Federation emphasizes the importance of the Capper-Volstead Act in allowing farmers to cooperate while remaining independent producers. Cooperatives have historically improved farmers' bargaining power and represent members in federal milk marketing order changes. The dairy processing industry has been impacted by changes in demand, technological advancements, and shifts in the retail sector. This has led to a decline in the number of dairy firms, with larger plant sizes and increased consolidation. Cooperatives have played a role in improving farmers' bargaining power and representing members in federal milk marketing order changes. Some producers argue that cooperatives may not always act in their best interests. The dairy manufacturing industry in the United States has seen a decline in the number of firms, leading to larger plant sizes and increased consolidation. The number of dairy manufacturing plants has stabilized around 1,100 facilities, with the largest dairy processor/manufacturing companies operating 9 to 81 plants. Concentration trends in the industry are similar to other food processing sectors, with a four-firm concentration ratio of 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing in 2002. The dairy industry in the United States has experienced consolidation, with a decline in the number of firms and larger plant sizes. The industry concentration ratio was 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing in 2002. While dairy processing concentration is not unusually high nationally, local markets can be more concentrated. The fluid milk industry has seen an increase in concentration following a merger in 2001, but it remains below the average level for selected food manufacturing industries. The retail sector for food products has undergone significant changes in recent years, with nontraditional food retailers like discount stores and warehouse clubs causing traditional supermarkets to adjust pricing and product strategies. This has led to consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry, with the top four firms accounting for 36% of national sales by 2005 due to acquisitions and mergers by large grocery retailers. In the early 1990s, the four-firm concentration ratio in the grocery retail sector increased to 36% by 2005 due to acquisitions and mergers by major retailers like Kroger Co., Albertson's, Ahold USA, and Safeway. Local-level concentration in specific market areas was even higher, averaging 74% in 2003, with ranges from 63% to 85% in different cities. This local concentration is more significant for consumers compared to national levels. The dairy industry has seen an increase in consolidation and concentration, with dairy processors and manufacturers growing in size and market share to meet demands from food retailers for lower costs. Concerns about concentration include reduced competition and market power, but it can also lead to efficiency gains and cost savings. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that concentration in the processing and retail sectors of the beef, pork, and dairy industries may not adversely affect agricultural commodity or retail food prices. Studies reviewed by the GAO showed either no evidence of market power or efficiency gains outweighing market power effects. Experts predict that concentration is likely to increase in the future. The GAO report found that concentration in dairy processing may not impact commodity or food prices significantly. Experts predict increased concentration in the future, which could raise concerns about market power. Efficiency gains from concentration were noted, with some studies showing benefits outweighing market power effects. Dairy cooperatives were mentioned as a counterbalance to the market power of dairy processors. The report highlighted evidence of market power in regional retail milk markets, with noncompetitive behavior and market power among retailers. Experts predict increased concentration in the future, leading to fewer retail outlets and potential pressure on food processors to consolidate. Some experts believe that large retail firms are influencing food processors to consolidate, leading to further concentration in the industry. Concerns arise about how this concentration impacts price transparency in dairy markets. Market participants feel that fewer transactions due to consolidation weaken price discovery, as markets function best with many observable transactions providing information on demand, supply, and prices. The dairy industry's shift towards a more integrated market with closer ties between players results in fewer product trades. The dairy industry is moving towards a more integrated market with closer ties between market players, leading to fewer trades on the spot market. The primary spot market for dairy is at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where prices are determined for cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk. These prices are used to establish wholesale price contracts nationwide, with premiums and discounts for quality and transportation. Some dairy producer groups question the adequacy of the CME as a pricing mechanism. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) sets monthly minimum prices for farm milk, but some dairy producer groups criticize it for being thinly traded, lacking transparency, and creating market volatility. The GAO found in a 2007 study that the CME spot cheese market is susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. However, industry participants are prepared to intervene if price manipulation occurs. The cheese and dairy industry closely monitors the market for any signs of price manipulation. In the past, some industry participants were penalized for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices through purchases of cheese on the CME. The CFTC and CME monitor spot market activities for manipulation. Recently, the CME introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder as a risk management tool. The CME introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder as a risk management tool. Some are interested in expanding USDA's price reporting system for dairy products. U.S. antitrust laws focus on competition in markets, not individual competitors, and proscribe unlawful mergers and business practices. The Sherman Act and the Clayton Act are the two basic antitrust laws in the United States, enforced by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. They prohibit unlawful mergers and business practices, with the Sherman Act specifically targeting activities that restrain trade and monopolization. Private individuals can also allege economic injury from violations of these acts. Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits monopolization or attempted monopolization, with violations being a felony subject to fines or imprisonment. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions that may lessen competition, with updated \"Merger Guidelines\" being issued by DOJ and FTC. Premerger notification is also provided for under the Clayton Act to allow antitrust enforcement. The Clayton Act allows for premerger notification to examine potential mergers/acquisitions before consummation. Remedies include legal action to stop mergers or conditioning approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. Negotiating changes is preferred over litigation due to cost and risk. The Capper-Volstead Act provides an exemption for agriculture from antitrust laws. The Capper-Volstead Act exempts farmer cooperatives from antitrust laws for joint processing and marketing of agricultural products. In 2009, Dean Foods acquired two plants from Foremost Farms, a Wisconsin cooperative. Dean Foods, the largest fluid milk processor in the United States, purchased two plants from Foremost Farms, a cooperative in Wisconsin. The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil antitrust suit against Dean Foods, alleging that the acquisition violated the Clayton Act by reducing competition in the market for selling milk to schools and supplying fluid milk to grocery chains in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. DOJ claims that the elimination of Foremost Farms as a competitor will negatively impact school milk and fluid milk purchases. Foremost Farms had been losing fluid milk customers to other processors, leading to aggressive pricing against Dean Foods. The DOJ filed a lawsuit against Dean Foods for acquiring Foremost Farms' plants, claiming it reduced competition in the market. Dean Foods defends the acquisition, stating it benefits dairy farmers and consumers with cost savings and increased competition. The ongoing case highlights the economics of milk purchases in the region. The ongoing case against Dean Foods in the U.S. dairy industry involves a class action antitrust complaint filed by Northeast dairy farmers against major firms, including Dairy Farmers of America, Dairy Marketing Services, and Dean Foods. This highlights the economics of consolidation and competition in the dairy market. The lawsuit alleges that major dairy firms, including Dairy Farmers of America and Dean Foods, conspired to control the supply of fluid milk in the Northeast, leading to lower prices for farmers. Producers are now required to affiliate with specific firms due to exclusive supply agreements, impacting competition in the region's milk marketing system. The lawsuit alleges that Dairy Farmers of America and Dean Foods, with exclusive supply agreements, used their market power to harm dairy farmers in the Northeast. DFA claims to have increased returns for farmers through efficiencies, but observers predict a lengthy legal process. Another ongoing case from 2008 involves multiple class action lawsuits in the southeastern United States. The net effect of concentration on market power remains a key economic and legal concern. Determining the net effect of concentration in the dairy industry is complex due to various factors influencing market power and efficiency gains. Market power can be influenced by product differentiation, market entry ease, and contract structures, while efficiency gains can come from technology and business practices. Economic events and government policies also impact commodity prices, making it challenging to isolate the effects of concentration."
