    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1997\" acknowledges the historical lack of attention to women's health and highlights the role of obstetrician-gynecologists in providing primary and preventive care throughout a woman's lifetime. Obstetrician-gynecologists play a crucial role in improving access to healthcare for women by offering comprehensive care and reducing the need for referrals to other physicians. Obstetrician-gynecologists provide basic health care services to women and play a crucial role in improving access to healthcare. Some states have taken steps to promote access to these specialists, but patients in other states or federally-governed health plans may still face restrictions. SEC. 2. ASSURING ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE. This section introduces standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services in group health plans. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without requiring prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without requiring prior authorization for gynecologic care. The ordering of gynecologic care by the obstetrician-gynecologist is considered prior authorization from the primary care provider. No waivers are provided for coverage requirements related to medical necessity or appropriateness of gynecologic care. Additionally, group health plans and health insurance issuers cannot restrict access to gynecologic care. Group health plans and health insurance issuers are prohibited from denying women eligibility based on avoiding requirements, providing incentives to accept less coverage, or penalizing providers for following the minimum protections. Compliance with notice requirements is mandatory for group health plans under this section. Group health plans must comply with notice requirements and can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. This section does not override more protective state laws regarding health insurance issuers. The text discusses how federal law may override state laws related to health insurance issuers in group health insurance coverage. It also mentions amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended by adding a new section at the end of title I. SEC. 713. STANDARDS RELATING TO ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without requiring prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without requiring prior authorization for gynecologic care. The ordering of other gynecologic care by the participating physician is considered prior authorization from the primary care provider. No waivers are provided for coverage requirements related to medical necessity or appropriateness. Prohibitions are in place for group health plans and health insurance issuers against certain actions. Prohibitions are in place for group health plans and health insurance issuers to prevent denial of eligibility based on gender, incentivizing women to accept lower coverage, or penalizing providers for following the requirements of the plan. Notice must be given for any modifications to the plan. The requirements of this section are considered a material modification in the plan, necessitating notice within 60 days. Group health plans can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. State laws on health insurance issuers are not preempted. The section allows for state laws on health insurance issuers to provide greater protections to enrollees than those under this section. It also amends sections 731 and 732 of the Act. The amendment inserts references to sections 711 and 713 in various parts of the Act. The amendment adds new standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services in individual health insurance under the Public Health Service Act. The provisions of section 2706 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market. Health insurance issuers must comply with notice requirements similar to group health plans. State laws that are more protective regarding health insurance issuers are not preempted by this section. Section 2762(b)(1) does not override State laws that offer greater protections for enrollees in group health insurance coverage. Section 2762 of the Act is amended to include references to other sections. The amendments will apply to group health plans starting from January 1, 1998. The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to group health plans starting on or after January 1, 1998. The amendment made by subsection (b) applies to health insurance coverage in the individual market on or after that date. For group health plans under collective bargaining agreements, the amendments do not apply before the termination of the agreements or January 1, 1998. For group health plans under collective bargaining agreements, any plan amendment made to conform to new requirements added by the Act shall not terminate the agreement before January 1, 1998."
