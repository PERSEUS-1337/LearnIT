    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Nuclear Assistance to State Sponsors of Terrorism Act of 2009\". The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 with the objectives of promoting atomic energy for peaceful purposes and preventing its use for military purposes. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's regular budget. The IAEA's Technical Cooperation Program provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes to countries worldwide through voluntary contributions. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund, providing nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes globally. A report by the Government Accountability Office found that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received over $55 million in assistance from 1997 to 2007, despite being designated as state sponsors of terrorism. The GAO report highlighted proliferation concerns with the Technical Cooperation Program due to assistance provided to certain countries like Iran, and the dual-use nature of nuclear equipment and technology. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program's lack of formal mechanisms to address proliferation risks, limited documentation on how concerns are resolved, and shortcomings in U.S. policies and IAEA procedures. Additionally, IAEA officials stated that the program does not exclude countries based on political considerations. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program's lack of formal mechanisms to address proliferation risks and limited documentation on how concerns are resolved. It also highlighted shortcomings in U.S. policies and IAEA procedures. The report found that the State Department cannot assert with complete confidence that TC assistance has not advanced weapons of mass destruction programs in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. Additionally, the report questioned the State Department's confidence in IAEA's internal safeguards. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program's lack of formal mechanisms to address proliferation risks and limited documentation on how concerns are resolved. It also highlighted shortcomings in U.S. policies and IAEA procedures. The report found that the State Department cannot assert with complete confidence that TC assistance has not advanced weapons of mass destruction programs in U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism. Additionally, legislation prohibited funds for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, or the Palestine Liberation Organization, and restricted funds for IAEA programs in Cuba. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 required the United States to withhold funding to the IAEA for projects in Cuba related to the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant and the Pedro Pi Nuclear Research Center. The GAO report suggested withholding a share of future contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for countries of concern, including U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism, to promote a consistent U.S. policy towards such nations. The IAEA has reported Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions by continuing heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. Resolution 1737 limits technical cooperation with Iran to humanitarian purposes only. The IAEA Director General reported Iran's significant progress in uranium enrichment, with 7,000 centrifuges and a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium. Concerns remain about Iran's nuclear activities. The IAEA Director General reported concerns about Iran's nuclear program, including the lack of implementation of the Additional Protocol and access to key locations for transparency measures. Iran's lack of cooperation with the IAEA regarding concerns about possible military dimensions of its nuclear program has hindered progress. Iran has repeatedly refused to comply with resolutions adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors. Iran has repeatedly denied access to its enrichment site at Natanz to IAEA inspectors and blocked additional surveillance cameras, violating its NPT Safeguards Agreement. In April 2008, it was revealed that Syria, with North Korea's help, was building a secret nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium for weapons. In September 2007, an Israeli air strike reportedly destroyed a Syrian reactor at Dair Alzour, based on a North Korean model for producing plutonium. General Michael Hayden stated in April 2008 that the reactor could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported in November 2008 that the facility bore features of an undeclared nuclear reactor, and Syria had not provided requested documentation regarding its nature or function. The IAEA Director General expressed concerns about Syria's lack of cooperation in providing documentation and access to sites, hindering the agency's ability to determine the nature of destroyed facilities and identify uranium particles not declared in Syria's inventory. Prohibition on the use of funds. No US funds to IAEA can support Technical Cooperation for countries like North Korea that are state sponsors of terrorism, in breach of safeguards agreements, Additional Protocol, NPT, UN resolutions, or under investigation. The Secretary of State must withhold voluntary contributions within 30 days of this Act. The Secretary of State must withhold US voluntary contributions to the IAEA proportional to the amount spent on Technical Cooperation Program for specified countries. If not done within 30 days, assessed contributions will also be withheld. SEC. 4. WAIVER. The provisions in subsections (b) and (c) of section 3 may be waived if the IAEA suspends assistance to specified countries or if the President certifies that these countries no longer pose a threat to US national security. SEC. 5. UNITED STATES ACTIONS AT IAEA. The President will direct the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to these countries. SEC. 6. REPORT. The President must submit a report on the implementation of the Act to congressional committees within six months of its enactment. Definitions are provided in Section 7. Section 7 of the Act defines key terms, including \"appropriate congressional committees\" and \"state sponsor of terrorism.\""
