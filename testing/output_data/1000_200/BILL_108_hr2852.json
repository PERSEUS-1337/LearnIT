    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to cord blood stem cells. The Congress finds that research has shown the feasibility of using cord blood for clinical applications, including bone marrow reconstitution for certain diseases. Cord blood, normally discarded after childbirth, contains stem cells that can be collected as donor tissue without risk. Residual neonatal blood, known as cord blood, is a valuable source of stem cells that can be collected as donor tissue without risk to the donor. It can be preserved through freezing for many years and used for transplantation in clinical situations or scientific research. Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants over bone marrow transplants include reduced risks to the donor, quicker availability of donor cell units, and lower risk of transplant complications. Finding a fully matched unrelated donor is crucial for successful bone marrow transplantation, especially for patients of ethnic minorities who struggle to find fully matched donors. Partially matched transplants result in high complication rates, including graft versus host disease and mortality. Cord blood stem cell banks offer increased genetic diversity in donor supply, potentially improving transplant outcomes. Cord blood stem cell banks provide increased genetic diversity in donor supply, allowing for fully matched or partially matched transplant units. This reduces the risk of complications such as graft versus host disease and mortality compared to conventional bone marrow transplantation. Having an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units can help match 90% of patients in need within a shorter timeframe than finding an unrelated bone marrow donor from the National registry. Having an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units can help match 90% of patients in need within days of a formal request, taking into account the ethnic diversity of the country. Matched donors are more likely within the same ethnic group as the patient, which is crucial for genetic conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia, prevalent in certain ethnic groups and leading to severe health risks and reduced life expectancy. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease, especially those with severe disease in childhood, have a high risk of early death. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has shown promising results in curing Sickle Cell Anemia, with better outcomes when done earlier in the disease course. Unrelated cord blood transplants are beneficial for ethnic minority patients, like African Americans, due to less stringent matching requirements compared to bone marrow transplants. An American patient has a higher chance of finding a suitable unrelated cord blood donor compared to a matched bone marrow donor. With an ethnically balanced national cord blood bank of at least 150,000 units, around 90 percent of African American patients with conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia could find appropriately matched cord blood stem cells for successful treatment. The National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants since 1987, but cord blood transplantation is more beneficial for patients of non-caucasoid ethnicity who struggle to find adequate matches through the program. Cord blood is a valuable source of stem cells for transplantation, especially for patients of non-caucasoid ethnicity who struggle to find adequate matches through the National Marrow Donor Program. Radiation exposure can lead to bone marrow failure, where cryopreserved cord blood stem cell units may be crucial for treatment. Further research on cord blood stem cells shows promise for future advancements. Research on cord blood stem cells may lead to improved therapies and potential cures for chronic diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, which contribute significantly to healthcare costs in the US. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is defined by key terms such as Administrator, cord blood unit, donor, donor bank, and human cord blood stem cells. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network consists of stem cells from neonatal blood collected immediately after birth from the placenta and umbilical cord. The network aims to establish, provide, and maintain at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells through contracts with qualified cord blood stem cell banks. The purpose of the donor banks in the network is to contribute to this goal. The donor banks in the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network acquire, test, store, and make cord blood units available for transplantation and research. Eligible banks must comply with Federal and State regulations. To be a donor bank in the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, a bank must have all necessary licenses, certifications, registrations, and authorizations. They must also have proper donor screening and cord blood collection practices to protect donors and recipients from infections. Additionally, strict confidentiality measures must be in place to protect patient and donor identities in accordance with Federal and State laws. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network requires donor banks to comply with Federal and State laws for patient and donor confidentiality, encourage donation from diverse donors, and have effective communication systems with other banks and medical facilities for cord blood unit distribution. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network requires donor banks to comply with regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, track recipients' outcomes for distributed units, educate the public about the benefits of donating cord blood stem cells, and establish a Board of Directors to administer the network. The Board of Directors, appointed by the Secretary, oversees the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, including a national registry and coordination of donor banks. Members represent transplant centers, birthing hospitals, and the research community. The curr_chunk discusses the various stakeholders involved in the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank, including birthing hospitals, the research community, transplant recipients, family members, experts in social sciences, the general public, and the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank involves stakeholders such as birthing hospitals, the research community, transplant recipients, family members, social science experts, and the general public. The Board of Directors includes members appointed for 3-year terms, with approximately 1/3 of the members' terms expiring each year for continuity. The Board of Directors includes members appointed for 3-year terms, with approximately 1/3 of the members' terms expiring each year for continuity. A member may continue to serve after the term expires until a successor is appointed. The Secretary will establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry as part of the Network to identify, acquire, and distribute donated cord blood units matched to patients. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry will enable searching for donor matches, requesting specific cord blood units, and maintaining a database to document collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation outcomes. The database will operate according to standards of consent, disclosure, and confidentiality. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry will report to the Secretary on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of activities. The Board of Directors will ensure donor banks meet requirements continuously within the Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry will report to the Secretary on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of activities. The Blood Stem Cell Bank Network must meet requirements continuously and be geographically distributed throughout the United States. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and additional funds for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 or until the 150,000 unit inventory is acquired."
