The Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2009 authorizes Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase and securitize qualified refinancing and new mortgages on single-family housing, following established policies and procedures by the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. If a lender offers a mortgage for purchase, the enterprise must determine if it meets the requirements for a qualified mortgage. The Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2009 allows Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase qualified refinancing and new mortgages on single-family housing. The enterprise must commit to purchasing mortgages that meet the requirements for qualified mortgages. The Director requires each enterprise to establish a procedure for approving lenders to receive advance commitments for the purchase of qualified mortgages. The Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2009 allows Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase qualified refinancing mortgages on single-family housing. A qualified refinancing mortgage must be for a one to four-family dwelling, the mortgagor must occupy the property as their principal residence, and the loan amount must be used to pay off existing first mortgage debt. The qualified refinancing mortgage must pay off an existing first mortgage made for the same property before January 1, 2008. The new mortgage must have a fixed interest rate not exceeding 4.0% annually and a term of 30 to 40 years. The qualified new mortgage must have a term of 30 to 40 years from the beginning of amortization and meet underwriting standards set by the Director. Prepayment penalties and fees related to default on the underlying mortgage must be waived or forgiven. The term \"qualified new mortgage\" refers to a mortgage meeting specific requirements, including being used for purchasing a property, originating after a certain date, and conforming to underwriting standards. Enterprises are allowed to establish exceptions to underwriting standards, such as downpayment and credit rating criteria. The enterprise can establish exceptions to underwriting standards to purchase and securitize qualified refinancing mortgages and new mortgages. Each enterprise must set aside qualified mortgages and issue securities based on them with approval from the Secretary of the Treasury. Securities can be in the form of debt obligations or trust certificates. Securities issued under this subsection may be in the form of debt obligations or trust certificates of beneficial interest, with maturities and interest rates determined by the enterprise with approval from the Secretary. These securities are exempt and deemed to be on par with US government securities. Mortgages set aside for this purpose must always be sufficient to cover principal and interest payments. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that mortgages set aside for securities issued under this subsection must always be adequate to cover timely principal and interest payments. Each enterprise must disclose that these securities are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt of the United States. The Federal Reserve System will establish a credit facility for financing. The Federal Reserve System will establish a credit facility to provide credit to enterprises at interest rates comparable to Treasury securities. The requirement for enterprises to purchase mortgages will not apply to mortgages offered after December 31, 2010. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines the Director as the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Enterprise as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the Secretary as the head of the Treasury."
