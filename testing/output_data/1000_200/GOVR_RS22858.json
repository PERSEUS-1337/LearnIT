    "content": "This report provides a comparison of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy with other energy technologies over different time periods, including the past 10 years, the 41-year period since DOE was established, and a 71-year funding history. Final funding for FY2017 and FY2018 was determined by specific acts signed by the President. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) set final funding for FY2018, including appropriations for DOE in Energy and Water Development programs. Figures and tables present DOE funding totals in real terms since 1978, with data converted into relative shares of spending for different energy sources. The pie charts in Figures 2, 3, and 4 display the relative shares of cumulative DOE spending for different energy sources over various time periods. Energy played a crucial role in World War II, leading to the application of R&D to military technologies. Post-World War II, R&D focused on fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and fusion for economic growth. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the groundwork for energy development. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to focus on R&D for fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and fusion to support economic growth. The AEC also promoted the use of nuclear energy for civilian electric power production. In response to the 1973 oil embargo, the Federal Energy Administration and Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) were established, leading to the creation of the Department of Energy (DOE) in 1977. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, incorporating energy programs from various federal agencies. It consolidated R&D programs for fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency technologies. Significant funding was allocated to fossil and nuclear energy R&D from FY1948 to FY1977, totaling $17.1 billion and $51.6 billion respectively in constant FY2016 dollars. Since FY1978, the Department of Energy (DOE) has been the primary funder of energy R&D, including nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency technologies. Funding for all energy technologies peaked in FY1979 at $8.6 billion (2016 dollars) before steadily declining to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s. Funding has since increased gradually, with a notable spike in 2009 due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. DOE energy R&D funding peaked at $8.6 billion in FY1979 before declining to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s. Funding has gradually increased since then, with a spike to $13 billion in FY2009 due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In FY2018, funding stood at nearly $4.5 billion."
