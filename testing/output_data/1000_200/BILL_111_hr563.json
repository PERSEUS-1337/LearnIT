The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" prioritizes SCHIP coverage for children in families with income under 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Section 2108 of the Social Security Act is amended to include income-related data in annual reports on the success of states in providing health insurance coverage for children at various income levels. Regulations for data collection and reporting standards must be established by the Secretary by September 30, 2009. The Act prioritizes SCHIP coverage for low-income children, with income levels based on percentages of the poverty line. States must develop a plan for coverage of low-income children to be approved for fiscal year 2010 and beyond. The Secretary must approve a plan within 6 months to ensure all qualified low-income children have health coverage starting in fiscal year 2010. Plans must be reviewed promptly and approved if reasonably designed to provide coverage as described.

Plans must be reviewed promptly and approved if reasonably designed to provide coverage as described. If the Secretary disapproves a plan, the State can resubmit a modified plan for approval. The Secretary will notify the State of the approval or disapproval of the plan. The term 'qualified low-income child' refers to a child meeting specific criteria. In subsection and section 2105(c)(8), a qualified low-income child is defined as a child whose family gross income does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line for the family size and meets all eligibility requirements except income. There is a limitation on the use of SCHIP funds based on increases in income eligibility levels by the State. The State can't receive payment under this section if its income eligibility level for its child health plan exceeds the level in effect before the enactment, unless it proves that no more than 10% of low-income children in the State lack health coverage.

Additionally, there is a safe harbor for qualified low-income children and currently eligible children, exempting them from payment limits under this section."
