    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 2007\" may establish a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for individuals becoming eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989. This amendment calculates the primary insurance amount by adding the transitional increase amount to the individual's existing amount. The \"transitional increase amount\" is calculated for individuals becoming eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989 by multiplying the excess under former law by the applicable percentage determined by a specific table. The applicable percentage for individuals becoming eligible for benefits between 1979 and 1988 ranges from 60 percent to 10 percent based on specific years. The term \"excess under former law\" refers to the difference between the former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary amount. The applicable former law primary insurance amount is determined by comparing it to the individual's primary insurance amount computed under current law without certain adjustments. The former law primary insurance amount is calculated based on the laws in effect in December 1978 or as provided by subsection (d), and modified accordingly. The individual's primary insurance amount is determined without certain adjustments based on laws in effect in December 1978, with specific criteria for computation base years. The primary insurance amount for an individual is calculated without adjustments based on laws from December 1978, with criteria for computation base years. Subdivision (I) in paragraph (4) is applied as if 'without regard to any increases in that table' read 'including any increases in that table'. This applies only if it results in a greater primary insurance amount than computed under paragraph (4)(B) without this provision. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 2007. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to benefits in December 2006 based on certain criteria. The Commissioner of Social Security will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to benefits in December 2006 based on specific criteria, taking into account the amendments made by the Act."
