Storing and accessing embedding vectors for all words requires a lot of space. Two efficient methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, reduce storage space significantly without sacrificing accuracy in natural language processing tasks. The use of word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe in deep learning models reduces storage space significantly while maintaining accuracy in natural language processing tasks. These embeddings convert words into continuous vectors for neural network processing, achieving a hundred-fold reduction in storage space without sacrificing accuracy. Word embeddings use smaller vectors to represent words, capturing semantic relationships and reducing neural network width. The d x p embedding matrix is stored in GPU memory for efficient access. Vocabulary sizes can reach d = 10^5 or 10^6, with embedding dimensionality ranging from p = 300 to p = 1024. The embedding matrix becomes a substantial part of the parameter space in learning models. In classical computing, information is stored in bits, while in quantum computing, qubits are fully described by complex unit-norm vectors. Entanglement allows for exponential dimensionality of the state space in quantum systems. Entanglement is a purely quantum phenomenon where quantum bits are interconnected, unlike classical bits. Quantum registers can be approximated classically, but with a loss of representation power. This loss does not significantly impact NLP machine learning algorithms using approximation approaches. Two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, are proposed for storing word embedding matrices. The word2ket and word2ketXS methods, inspired by quantum computing, offer efficient ways to store word embedding matrices during training and inference. These methods operate independently or jointly on word embeddings, providing high space saving rates with minimal impact on NLP model accuracy. The tensor product space V \u2297 W in Hilbert spaces is used for efficient processing. The tensor product space V \u2297 W in Hilbert spaces is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W. The inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is defined as a product of individual inner products v \u2297 w, v \u2297 w = v, v w, w. The Hilbert space V \u2297 W consists of equivalence classes of pairs v \u2297 w, with vectors often referred to as tensors. An orthonormal basis in V \u2297 W is formed by the set {\u03c8 j \u2297 \u03c6 k} jk, with coefficients indexed by \u03b4 z as the Kronecker delta. The tensor product space V \u2297 W is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, forming an orthonormal basis {\u03c8 j \u2297 \u03c6 k}. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of dimensionalities of V and W. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of tensor product, with arbitrary bracketing. In Dirac notation, a vector u \u2208 C 2 n is written as |u, with a countable orthonormal basis. Some sources refer to n as the degree or rank of a tensor, while tensor rank is a property similar to matrix rank. The tensor product space V \u2297 W is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, forming an orthonormal basis. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of dimensionalities of V and W. It is not always possible to express v \u2297 w + v \u2297 w as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 for some \u03c6 \u2208 V, \u03c8 \u2208 W due to the presence of linear combinations that cannot be decomposed in this way. The tensor product space V \u2297 W is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w to form an orthonormal basis. Tensors with rank greater than one are called entangled. A p-dimensional word embedding model involves a d-token vocabulary and maps word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space. The function f is trained to capture semantic information from the language corpus it is trained on. In word2ket, word embeddings are represented as entangled tensors with a tensor of rank r and order n. The resulting vector v has dimension p = q n, taking rnq = O(rq log q log p) space. It is recommended to use q \u2265 4 to ensure efficient representation. In word2ket, word embeddings are represented as entangled tensors with a tensor of rank r and order n. The calculation of inner product between two p-dimensional word embeddings, v and w, takes O (rq log q log p) time and O (1) additional space. The total space requirement for processing a batch of b words is O (bp + rq log q log p). Reconstructing a single p-dimensional word embedding vector from a tensor of rank r and order n takes O (rn log 2 p) arithmetic operations. The proposed word2ket representation involves a balanced tensor product tree for parallel processing of word embeddings, reducing sequential processing time to O(log2n). The embedding vector v can be defined with gradients for individual elements, making it suitable for training with gradient descent. The word2ket representation can be viewed as a sequence of O(log2n) linear layers with linear activation functions. The word2ket representation utilizes a balanced tensor product tree for parallel processing of word embeddings, reducing sequential processing time to O(log2n). To address potential high Lipschitz constant of the gradient, LayerNorm is used at each node. Linear operators A and B are defined, with A \u2297 B being a linear operator mapping vectors from V \u2297 W to U \u2297 Y. The text discusses the representation of linear operators A and B, with A \u2297 B being a linear operator mapping vectors from V \u2297 W to U \u2297 Y. In the finite-dimensional case, the tensor product of linear operators is bilinear, represented as an mn \u00d7 m n matrix. Word embeddings are also explored, with a word embedding linear operator mapping one-hot vectors to embedding vectors. The text discusses the efficient representation of a d \u00d7 p word embedding matrix using tensor product-based exponential compression. This method allows for space-saving by applying compression horizontally and vertically simultaneously, resulting in a matrix F with dimension p \u00d7 d. Lazy tensors are used to avoid reconstructing the full embedding matrix each time, ensuring space efficiency in neural NLP models. The proposed space-efficient word embeddings use lazy tensors to reconstruct rows efficiently, enabling space-saving in neural NLP models. These embeddings were tested in text summarization, language translation, and question answering tasks, showing comparable accuracy to regular embeddings. The study proposed space-efficient embeddings for neural NLP models, achieving accuracy comparable to regular embeddings. They used a sequence-to-sequence architecture with bidirectional RNN encoder and attention-based RNN decoder, trained for 20 epochs with a dropout rate of 0.2. Results were evaluated using Rouge scores. The study evaluated space-efficient embeddings for neural NLP models, achieving comparable accuracy to regular embeddings. They tested different dimensionalities and found that word2ketXS offered significant parameter reduction with minimal impact on Rouge scores. They focused on word2ketXS for further evaluation in German-English machine translation tasks using the IWSLT2014 dataset. The study evaluated space-efficient embeddings for neural NLP models, achieving comparable accuracy to regular embeddings. They tested different dimensionalities and found that word2ketXS offered significant parameter reduction with minimal impact on Rouge scores. In German-English machine translation tasks using the IWSLT2014 dataset, they used the same sequence-to-sequence model as in the GIGAWORD summarization task. They explored embedding dimensions and measured test set performance using BLEU score. The results showed a drop in BLEU score with reductions in parameter space. They also worked on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) using DrQA's model with bidirectional LSTMs and reported the test set F1 score. The study evaluated space-efficient embeddings for neural NLP models, achieving comparable accuracy to regular embeddings. They tested different dimensionalities and found that word2ketXS offered significant parameter reduction with minimal impact on performance metrics. Results in Table 3 show a 0.5 point drop in F1 score with a 1000-fold saving of parameter space required for embeddings. Using tensors of order 4, there was a 10^5-fold space saving rate with a drop in F1 score by less than 3%. The computational overhead for word2ketXS embeddings was also investigated, showing an increase in training time from 5.8 to 7.4 hours for tensors order 2 and 4 respectively. The training time for the word2ketXS-based model increased to 7.4 hours for tensors order 2 and 9 hours for tensors order 4, compared to 5.8 hours for the model using regular embedding. The memory footprint of the word embedding part of the model decreased significantly, impacting the input layers of sequence-to-sequence models. The dynamics of model training remained largely unchanged despite the increased training time. During training, word embeddings dominate the memory footprint of transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers. These models require hundreds of millions of parameters to work effectively. In RoBERTa BASE, 30% of the parameters are dedicated to word embeddings. The memory footprint is further increased during training to store activations in all layers for gradient calculations. This can be reduced by optimizing memory usage. To reduce memory requirements for transformer models like BERT and RoBERTa during training, various approaches have been proposed, including dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, bit encoding, and quantization methods. These techniques aim to decrease the amount of memory needed for word embeddings and model parameters, such as pruning, sparsity, and low numerical precision methods. Word2ketXS outperforms other approaches in space saving rates. Bit encoding methods are limited to a maximum space saving rate of 32 for 32-bit architectures. Other methods like parameter sharing or PCA offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality. Tensor product spaces have also been used in document embeddings. In related work, tensor product spaces have been used for document embeddings by sketching n-grams in the document."
