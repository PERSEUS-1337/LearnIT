    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS employees hired before 1984 do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS employees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), with only FERS employees receiving employer matching contributions. CSRS and FERS are not governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which applies to private sector retirement plans. ERISA governs aspects of employer-sponsored retirement plans in the private sector, including rights for spouses and former spouses. It requires certain provisions like joint and survivor annuities, compliance with qualified domestic relations orders, spousal consent for beneficiary designations, and default forms of annuities in defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits for federal employees under Title 5 of the United States Code require a joint and survivor annuity as the default form of benefit, similar to ERISA for private-sector plans. Both ERISA and Title 5 mandate written consent for waiving the survivor annuity, but differ on when pension payments to a former spouse can begin after a divorce. Under ERISA, a court can require a plan to start paying benefits to a former spouse when the plan participant reaches the earliest retirement age, regardless of retirement status. In contrast, Title 5 prohibits payment of any part of a CSRS or FERS annuity to a former spouse until the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible for the annuity, and has applied for it. Another difference is in the designation of beneficiaries in defined contribution plans, where ERISA requires spousal consent for married participants. ERISA requires spousal consent for married participants in defined contribution plans to designate beneficiaries. However, federal regulations allow Thrift Savings Plan participants to name anyone as a beneficiary without spousal consent. A state court decree can award a former spouse of a federal employee a share of retirement annuity or survivor annuity, or both, with specific court order requirements. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will pay only the benefits specified in a court order regarding a federal employee's retirement annuity. Section 8345 of Title 5 allows a former spouse to be awarded a share of the employee's CSRS retirement annuity as directed by a state court decree. OPM will divide the annuity as per the court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse after the employee has separated from federal service. OPM will not execute a court order dividing a federal employee's retirement annuity until the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible for an annuity, and has applied for an annuity. The former spouse's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retired employee's death. A former spouse can receive a survivor annuity if the retiree elected it or if a court order specifies it. A CSRS survivor annuity is 55% of the single-life annuity the retired worker would have received. A survivor annuity under CSRS is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity. The annuity is funded by reducing the worker's pension by a certain percentage. The total amount of survivor annuities paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 55% of the worker's original annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded the full survivor annuity, the current spouse is not entitled to it unless the former spouse dies or remarries before the age of 55. A survivor annuity paid to a former spouse of a federal employee terminates if the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55, except in cases where the marriage lasted at least 30 years. The annuity can be restarted in the same amount if the remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment. Any modifications to the survivor annuity election or court-ordered award must be made before the employee retires or dies. OPM will not honor a court order for a survivor annuity if the former spouse previously waived their right to it. If an employee separates from federal service and chooses to receive a refund of their retirement contributions, they forfeit the right to a CSRS annuity. State courts can block refund payments if a former spouse is entitled to a share of the annuity. FERS retirement annuities can be divided between a federal annuitant and a former spouse according to a court decree. OPM will follow court orders to divide the annuity and pay the former spouse. OPM will divide the retired employee's monthly annuity as directed by a court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. The right of a former spouse to receive a share of a retired federal employee's retirement annuity terminates upon the retiree's death. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must have elected it or a court order must specify it. A federal employee can elect a FERS survivor annuity for a former spouse under Section 8445 of Title 5. The survivor annuity is 50% of the single-life annuity the retired worker would have received, funded by a 10% reduction in the retiree's annuity. Only one FERS spouse survivor annuity is allowed, and the total amount paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 50% of the annuitant's single-life annuity. The sum of FERS survivor annuities paid to the employee's spouse at the time of death and former spouses cannot exceed 50% of the single-life annuity. A survivor annuity terminates if the spouse or former spouse dies or remarries before age 55, with exceptions for remarriages lasting at least 30 years. If an employee participating in FERS dies after completing at least 18 months but fewer than 10 years of service, the spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit equal to half of the employee's annual basic pay. This benefit can be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse as per a state court order. The lump-sum survivor benefit under FERS can be paid to a former spouse or divided between current and former spouses based on a state court order. If an employee dies after 10 years of service, the surviving spouse receives a lump sum and annuity. Refunding contributions forfeits the right to a FERS annuity, which can be blocked by a state court if a former spouse is entitled. Beneficiaries for TSP accounts must be designated using Form TSP-3 with the Thrift Investment Board. When a participant dies, Form TSP-3 must be filed to designate a beneficiary for the TSP account. Spouse consent is required for certain actions for married FERS participants, but not for CSRS participants. The spouse of a married FERS participant is entitled to certain notifications regarding the TSP account. The TSP notifies participants before approving a loan or in case of withdrawal. Married FERS participants' spouses are entitled to a joint and survivor annuity. State court orders regarding divorce, alimony, and child support are recognized by the TSP. Former spouses of FERS participants may be eligible for Social Security benefits. If a divorced spouse of a worker insured by Social Security is at least 62 years old and was married for at least 10 years, they can receive widow or widower benefits. These benefits end if the divorced spouse remarries before age 60, unless the later marriage ends. Remarriage does not affect Social Security survivor benefits for the deceased worker's children."
