    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grants and loans, split between the NTIA/DOC and RUS/USDA. NTIA received $4.35 billion for the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program, while RUS received $2.5 billion for rural broadband projects. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) under the RUS provides grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations for rural areas. A rural area is defined as not within a city, town, or area with over 20,000 inhabitants. The ARRA allocated $7.2 billion for broadband projects, with NTIA receiving $4.35 billion and RUS receiving $2.5 billion. P.L. 111-226 rescinded $302 million of unobligated BTOP money. Two rounds of ARRA broadband funding were announced in 2009 and 2010, with all funding to be awarded by September 30, 2010. The ARRA mandated all funding to be awarded by September 30, 2010. As of October 1, 2010, all ARRA broadband funds have been awarded. This report focuses on the distribution of ARRA broadband funding, with a breakdown of applications and awards data. The first funding round was announced on July 1, 2009, with projects falling into categories such as last mile and middle mile. The ARRA broadband infrastructure project includes grants for last mile and middle mile projects, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. BIP projects can be last mile remote area, last mile nonremote area, or middle mile. The ARRA broadband infrastructure project offers grants for last mile and middle mile projects, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Over 2,200 applications were received in the first round, requesting nearly $28 billion in funding. The second and final round of funding announced $4.8 billion available, with $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. In the second round of broadband funding, $4.8 billion was available, with $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. NTIA and RUS streamlined the application process based on feedback, with each agency having its own NOFA. NTIA/BTOP focused on middle mile projects, while RUS/BIP focused on last mile projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants for middle mile projects serving anchor institutions. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure (CCI) grants, supporting middle mile projects for anchor institutions. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" category and offered a standard grant/loan combination for all projects. Requirements for eligible infrastructure projects were revised in the second round of BIP funding. In the second round of BIP funding, applicants needed to be eligible entities with a completed application and a 20% nonfederal match. Factors like unserved areas and speed were considered during evaluation. BIP introduced three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. NTIA received 867 applications totaling $11 billion in federal funding requests, with the majority for Comprehensive Community Infrastructure projects. RUS received 776 applications requesting nearly $11.2 billion in federal funding. In the second round of funding, NTIA and RUS received a total of 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds. RUS received 30 middle mile applications, while NTIA received 27 applications for Satellite Projects, 51 for Technical Assistance, and 2 for Rural Library Broadband. By October 1, 2010, awards for 553 projects totaling $7.5 billion in federal funding were announced. By October 1, 2010, all BTOP and BIP award announcements were completed, totaling $7.5 billion in federal funding for 553 projects. This included $3.9 billion for 233 BTOP projects and $3.6 billion for 320 BIP projects, with $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. Awards data breakdowns by project category, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution were provided. About half of the broadband infrastructure funding (51%) went to middle mile projects. Of all broadband infrastructure funding, 51% was awarded to middle mile projects and 49% to last mile projects. Last mile projects received 93% of loan funding. Fiber projects accounted for 56% of all infrastructure projects funded. Projects involving multiple technologies, including fiber and wireless, make up a significant portion of infrastructure projects. Fiber projects represent about two-thirds of all projects, with last mile technologies consisting of 47% fiber, 23% DSL, 17% wireless, 6% multiple, 3% cable modem, and 1% satellite. State-by-state breakdowns of BTOP and BIP funding are provided in tables in the Appendix, along with per capita funding by state. NTIA and RUS are now focused on monitoring and overseeing the progress of funded projects after the broadband awards process concluded. In FY2011, the Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office. The Continuing Appropriations Act added $20 million for BTOP oversight. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure BTOP grants' impact on broadband availability and adoption. The impact of BTOP grants on broadband availability, adoption, and economic and social conditions in areas served by grantees is being monitored by the 112th Congress. The FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Congress may consider whether broadband grant and loan programs should be continued, modified, reduced, expanded, or eliminated based on the outcomes of funded projects."
