    "content": "The \"Patent and Trademark Office Authorization Act of 1993\" authorizes appropriations of $103,000,000 for the Patent and Trademark Office for fiscal year 1994. This funding is derived from the Patent and Trademark Office Fee Surcharge Fund. Additionally, fees collected under title 35, United States Code, and the Trademark Act of 1946 will also be made available to the office for fiscal year 1994. SEC. 3. Amounts appropriated under this Act may remain available until expended. SEC. 4. Adjusts trademark filing fee to $245, effective immediately. SEC. 5. Provides interim patent extensions. Section 156 of title 35, United States Code is amended to allow for interim patent extensions if the regulatory review period for a product may extend beyond the patent expiration. The owner or agent can submit an application for an extension 6 months before the term expires. The application for an interim extension must include the product under regulatory review, the patent being sought for extension, details of the patent claims related to the product, information for determining eligibility for extension, a summary of activities during the regulatory review period, and relevant dates. The Commissioner may grant an interim extension for a patent eligible for extension under certain conditions. The owner of the patent can apply for up to 4 subsequent interim extensions. The owner of a patent eligible for extension can apply for up to 4 subsequent interim extensions, except for patents under a specific subsection where only 1 subsequent extension is allowed. Each extension application must be submitted 60-30 days before the previous extension expires and will be recorded as part of the original patent. The interim extension will end 60 days after the product receives permission for commercial marketing or use. During the interim extension period, the rights of the patent holder are limited to the use under regulatory review for the product. The extension can last up to 5 years from the original patent expiration date or from the date of commercial marketing approval, depending on the circumstances. During the interim extension period, patent rights are limited to the specific uses of the product or method under regulatory review. SEC. 6. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Section 156 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to update subsections (a), (b), and (e) regarding patent rights. The term of certain design patents for the badges of the American Legion, American Legion Women's Auxiliary, and Sons of the American Legion is extended for 14 years from the date of enactment of the Act, with all associated rights and privileges. SEC. 8. INTERVENING RIGHTS. The renewals and extensions of patents under section 6 will not infringe on any patent for use that began after the patent expired but before the enactment of this Act."
