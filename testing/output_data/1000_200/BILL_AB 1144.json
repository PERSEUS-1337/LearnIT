    "title": "AB 1144",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow various electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products may be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and must meet project viability principles. A balanced portfolio of renewable energy resources will be procured to achieve the goals of cost-effectiveness and suitability. Eligible renewable energy resource electricity products must meet specific criteria, including having a first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority or an agreement to transfer electricity dynamically to a California balancing authority. The use of other sources for ancillary services is allowed, but only a fraction of the schedule generated by the renewable energy resource counts towards portfolio content. Unbundled renewable energy credits can be earned by electricity generated by an entity excluded from being an electrical corporation, meeting specific criteria, and used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity. The generating facility must meet certain criteria, and the electricity generated must be used at a public entity-owned wastewater treatment facility. The renewable energy credit is earned by electricity generated at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity, meeting specific criteria. The generating capability of the facility must be put into service on or after January 1, 2016, and not participate in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for all procurement credited toward each compliance period, including firmed and shaped eligible renewable energy resource electricity products scheduled into a California balancing authority. Additionally, any electricity generated that does not qualify under the mentioned criteria must also be accounted for in order to achieve a balanced portfolio. Retail sellers must meet requirements for procurement credited toward each compliance period, including specific percentages of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products meeting product content requirements. Any renewable energy contracts executed after June 1, 2010, must meet product content requirements. For electric service providers, restrictions on crediting renewable energy products apply to contracts after January 13, 2011. Contracts executed before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if the renewable energy was eligible at the time of execution and approved by the commission. (2) The commission approves contracts for electrical corporations, even if after June 1, 2010. (3) Contract amendments post-June 1, 2010, cannot increase capacity or change renewable energy sources, but can extend duration if the original contract had a 15-year procurement commitment. A retail seller can request a reduction in procurement content requirements from the commission if unable to comply due to uncontrollable conditions. The commission can lower the requirement but not below 65% after December 31, 2016. A public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot make marketing claims about the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. All renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser of the credit. The electricity generated by a public entity and sold with a renewable energy credit must be included in the total retail sales of the buyer for renewables portfolio standard calculations."
