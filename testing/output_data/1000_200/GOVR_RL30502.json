The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) is a law enforcement agency that regulates the manufacture, importation, and distribution of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. ATF's mission focuses on reducing crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public. Congress increased ATF's direct appropriations from $336,040,000 to $604,573,000 from FY1992 to FY2000, and for FY2001, Congress has appropriated $772,843,000 in direct funding for ATF.

Congress fully funded the administration's FY2001 request for ATF, except for $5,521,000 for the tobacco compliance initiative. The vetoed Legislative Branch conference agreement would have provided ATF with $768,695,000, while the House bill would have provided $731,325,000 and the Senate version would have provided $724,937,000. The administration's FY2001 request included $105,298,000 in program budget increases. The administration's FY2001 request included $105,298,000 in program budget increases for ATF.

Additionally, funding was requested to relocate the ATF headquarters. Congress provided an additional $41,322,000 to expand the Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy, bringing total funding for IVRS to $62,200,000. ATF received additional funding to intensify local firearm initiatives, review FBI referrals for prohibited persons acquiring firearms, investigate multiple attempts by prohibited persons to purchase firearms, review federal firearm licensees' records, and expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative to 12 more cities in FY2001.

ATF and FBI signed a memorandum of understanding to further develop the Integrated Ballistics Identification System. The ATF and FBI signed a memorandum of understanding to further develop the Integrated Ballistics Identification System (IBIS) for comparing images of ballistic evidence. Congress provided funding for the national laboratory transition and relocation of the ATF headquarters, but did not fund the Administration's request for the Tobacco Compliance/Diversion initiative. ATF's activities include regulating and enforcing laws related to firearms commerce and possession, which have been controversial. The House and Senate bills included language to prohibit preferences for firearms manufacturers who enter agreements with federal agencies. Smith & Wesson had an agreement with HUD, leading to preferences from 411 governments. This language was dropped from the final Legislative Branch agreement. The U.S. Customs Service, responsible for regulating trade between the U.S. and other countries, collected $22.4 billion in FY1999. Congress increased direct appropriations for the Customs Service by 33% from FY1992 to FY2000. Additionally, the agency collects COBRA fee receipts. For FY2001, Congress increased direct funding for the U.S. Customs Service by 18% to $2,281,327,000. This includes $1,863,765,000 for salaries and expenses, an additional $18,934,000 for counter-terrorism, and $133,228,000 for air and marine interdiction. The total amount is $5,167,000 less than the Administration's request. Congress provided $133,228,000 for air and marine interdiction in FY2001, along with an additional $7,000,000. They also allocated $258,400,000 for Customs' automated systems modernization, which is $80,000,000 less than the Administration's projected fee receipts. Additionally, $3,000,000 in offsetting fee receipts were included in the harbor maintenance fee account. The vetoed Legislative Branch appropriations would have provided Customs with $1,863,725,000. The House bill (H.R. 4871) and the Senate bill (S. 2900) proposed different funding amounts for Customs, with the Legislative Branch measure ultimately providing $1,863,725,000. The Administration's FY2001 budget request included program budget enhancements for Customs' salaries and expenses account, such as funding for drug investigations, narcotics illicit proceeds strategy, forced child labor, and airborne support for the Secret Service. The Administration requested increased funding for Customs to maintain current service levels, including earmarks for border security, vehicle replacement, drug investigations, and forced child labor initiatives. The House bill also included funding for drug investigations and forced child labor initiatives. Customs' Automated Commercial System (ACS) has faced challenges with \"brownouts\" hindering international commerce. Congress has allocated funds for upgrades to ACS and the development of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). Customs has been directed to provide a revised blueprint, schedule, and budget for ACE. Customs has struggled with the upkeep of ACS and the development of ACE. In FY2001, the Administration requested $338 million for automation modernization, including $123 million for ACS, $5 million for ITDS, and $210 million for ACE. Congress rejected the fee proposal and provided over $258 million in direct appropriation. The development of ACE is estimated to cost between $1.4 and $1.8 billion over 7 years. Customs is taking steps to implement recommendations to reduce duplication of effort and improve management. GAO warns that ACE is a complex and high-risk project critical for revenue collection from imports. The development of ACE is a complex and high-risk endeavor critical for revenue collection from imports. Customs generates offsetting receipts from user fee programs established by various acts. COBRA fee receipts are a substantial funding source for Customs, while MPF fee receipts are not under Customs' control. COBRA fee receipts, mandated by Congress, provide significant funding for Customs expenditures. Receipts have increased from $176 million to $299 million from FY1992 to FY2000. Initially used for overtime costs, surplus revenues now fund permanent positions and IT costs. However, recent reports show a drop in air passenger processing fee receipts, raising concerns about reliance on COBRA fees for funding. The reliance on COBRA fee receipts to fund Customs expenditures may be problematic due to a drop-off in receipts and the upcoming expiration of authorization. The IRS budget request for FY2001 was $8,986,084,000, a 9.36% increase over FY2000, focusing on maintaining operations and modernization, with additional staffing needed for enforcement and customer service. IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti testified about the need for additional staffing and a state-of-the-art computer system to modernize operations.

Amendments were made to reduce funding for certain programs to offset costs for other initiatives. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed funding the IRS at $8.535 billion, with higher levels for most accounts compared to the House.

The vetoed conference agreement maintained the same funding levels. The FY2001 IRS funding was a contentious issue during the Legislative Branch Appropriations conference report. The FY2001 IRS funding was a major point of objection during the Legislative Branch Appropriations conference. The President signed P.L. 106-346 with partial funding for selected accounts, but subsequently vetoed the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill on October 30. The IRS supplemental provisions included delaying the implementation of a no-cost Internet tax filing service. The IRS is instructed to delay implementing a no-cost Internet tax filing service until a report addressing concerns is submitted to Congress. Funding includes $7.974 million for Tax Law Enforcement, $71.751 million for Information Technology Investments, and $141 million for Staff Tax Administration for Balance and Equity.

The President requested $96.1 million for revenue foregone in FY2001, with $67.1 million delayed until October 1, 2001.
