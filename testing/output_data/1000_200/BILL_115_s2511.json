The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\" includes definitions and provisions for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's assessment, acquisition, and usage of unmanned maritime systems. Funding and additional authorities are also addressed in the Act. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" defines cooperative activities, data specifications, and test or training ranges for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" defines test or training ranges as designated areas for operating unmanned maritime systems and other systems for evaluation and training purposes. Unmanned maritime systems are remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence. Unmanned maritime systems are remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence, including unmanned undersea vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, and autonomous surface vehicles. The term also includes unmanned aerial vehicles and autonomous aerial vehicles used for maritime issues. The Administrator shall direct the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations to coordinate the Administration's research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems, including considering their use in cooperative activities. The Administrator directs coordination within the Administration for research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems through the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB), ensuring representation from various offices actively engaged with unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator coordinates with the Navy to leverage expertise in unmanned maritime systems development and align with strategic priorities. They aim to utilize Naval test ranges for unmanned systems. The Administrator collaborates with the Navy to enhance unmanned maritime systems development and align with strategic priorities. This includes utilizing Naval test ranges for unmanned systems and formalizing coordination through a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of the Navy. The Administrator collaborates with the Navy to utilize test ranges and facilities for unmanned maritime systems development, following procedures set by the Secretary of the Navy. The activities authorized include mapping, bathymetry, observations, and ocean exploration at co-located facilities for efficiency and collaboration. Advancing development of unmanned maritime systems includes research, testing, modifications, and integration. Accelerating transition from concept to manufacturing and acquisition. Coordination with other federal agencies through the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. Coordination with the academic sector for research collaboration. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, may coordinate with academic research institutions for research, training, commercialization, and access to facilities for unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, may coordinate with academic institutions and the private sector to support research, training, and commercialization of unmanned maritime systems. This includes increasing operational tolerance, certifying capacity, training operators, engaging with other academic institutions, and promoting information sharing for more robust systems. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, may coordinate with academic institutions and the private sector to support research, training, and commercialization of unmanned maritime systems. This includes assessing publicly and commercially available unmanned maritime systems for potential use to support missions of the Administration. The Administrator will assess unmanned maritime systems for their suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness to meet data specifications required by Administration programs. This assessment will also determine the operational reliability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of these systems for making observations needed by Administration programs. The Assistant Administrator and Director will jointly convene and consult the Unmanned Maritime Systems Ocean Technology Coordinating Committee. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. They may develop agreements with the Secretary of the Navy for procurement efficiency. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. They may develop agreements with the Secretary of the Navy for procurement efficiency, including participating in Navy procurements, accepting decommissioned systems, sharing policies, and creating efficiency in Federal acquisition. Reports on unmanned maritime systems usage must be submitted to Congress every four years. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. Reports on unmanned maritime systems usage must be submitted to Congress every four years, including an inventory of current systems, data benefits, and data requirements. SEC. 7. FUNDING AND ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES. The Administrator will utilize existing funds for this Act and has the authority to enter into agreements with domestic or foreign governments. The Administrator has the authority to enter into contracts, agreements, and transactions with governments, accept donations and services, receive funds from other Federal departments, utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, transfer funds to organizations, and use resources of other entities with their consent. The Administrator can utilize resources from various government entities, including the United States, State, local, tribal, foreign governments, or international organizations, with their consent and subject to availability of funds. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
