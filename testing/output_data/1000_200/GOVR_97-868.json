    "content": "The Internet is a \"network of networks\" with interconnected computers worldwide. Each computer has a unique IP number for communication. Domain names simplify access, with TLDs like .com or .org. The DNS maps addresses to domain names. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed set of databases containing address numbers mapped to domain names. Root servers coordinate connectivity across the Internet. The Internet originated from research funding by DARPA for a military network, later evolving with support from NSF and other science agencies. While there are no formal authorities governing the Internet and DNS, entities like IANA played key roles in making technical decisions. IANA, operated by the Information Sciences Institute/University of Southern California under a Department of Defense contract, made technical decisions for root servers, managed IP address space, and delegated addresses to registries worldwide. NSF handled nonmilitary domain name registration and in 1993 signed an agreement with InterNic, making Network Solutions Inc. the sole registrar for .com, .net, and .org gTLDs. Network Solutions Inc. (NSI) became the sole registrar for .com, .net, and .org gTLDs, leading to criticism due to registration fees. Concerns about trademark disputes and the stability of the Internet prompted the International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC) to propose creating seven new gTLDs and introducing additional registrars for competition. The IAHC proposed creating seven new gTLDs and introducing more registrars for competition. The U.S. government supported the formation of a new not-for-profit corporation to manage Internet names and addresses. The U.S. government supported the formation of a new not-for-profit corporation, ICANN, to administer policy for the Internet name and address system, ensuring stability, competition, private coordination, and fair representation of the Internet community. Internet constituencies worldwide discussed the structure of the New Corporation, with IANA and NSI proposing bylaws and articles of incorporation. The U.S. government supported the formation of ICANN, a new not-for-profit corporation, to oversee the Internet name and address system. ICANN's bylaws and articles of incorporation were proposed in collaboration with NSI. The final version was submitted to the Department of Commerce on October 2, 1998. An official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between DOC and ICANN on November 25, 1998, outlining the transition of management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector entity. The MOU was extended until September 30, 2006, with specified transition tasks for ICANN to address. On June 30, 2005, the U.S. government outlined principles for the Internet's domain name system, emphasizing security and stability. In September 2006, a new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN was announced to transition DNS management to the private sector. The Joint Project Agreement (JPA) extended to September 30, 2009, focused on transparency and accountability within ICANN. An Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) was agreed upon to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization. The AoC ensures accountability, transparency, security, stability, competition, consumer trust, and international participation for ICANN, a nonprofit corporation based in California. ICANN, headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, operates under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Law for charitable purposes. It has tax-exempt status and a Board of Directors advised by supporting organizations. The Board makes final policy decisions with 16 international members. The ICANN Board of Directors is composed of 16 international members, including a president and representatives selected by various supporting organizations. The organization's budget has significantly increased due to the growth of the Internet and domain name registration, with revenues reaching $159 million in 2015. Funding primarily comes from fees paid by registrars and registry operators. ICANN, with a head count of 373 budgeted for 2015, is funded primarily through fees paid by registrars and registry operators. Congressional committees oversee the Department of Commerce's management of ICANN's activities. Other committees, like the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, are interested in issues like intellectual property and privacy affected by ICANN. The Department of Commerce (DOC) has no statutory authority over ICANN or the DNS. The U.S. government originally owned and operated key components of network architecture enabling the domain name system to function. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding between ICANN and the Department of Commerce initiated a process to transition DNS coordination and management functions to a private-sector entity. The Department of Commerce (DOC) initiated a process to transition DNS coordination and management functions to a private-sector entity through agreements with ICANN. These agreements include the Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) between DOC and ICANN, a contract for technical functions, and a cooperative agreement with VeriSign for managing the official DNS root zone file. On September 30, 2009, an AoC was announced to institutionalize global DNS coordination. The Department of Commerce (DOC) and ICANN announced an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) on September 30, 2009, to institutionalize global DNS coordination. The AoC has no expiration date and would only end if one party decides to terminate it. Various stakeholders debated whether DOC should maintain control over ICANN after the Joint Project Agreement expired. U.S. industry groups argued for continued DOC oversight to prevent international control of the DNS. Many international entities argued that ICANN had met conditions for privatization, while U.S. industry groups advocated for continued DOC oversight to prevent international control of the DNS. In the 110th Congress, Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564, stating that more progress was needed in achieving accountability and transparency goals. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN. The NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) seeking public comment on the upcoming expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN. The mid-term review highlighted areas where further work was needed to increase institutional confidence in ICANN, including long-term stability, accountability, and enhanced competition. Public comments were requested on the progress of transitioning the DNS to the private sector and the model of private-sector leadership represented by ICANN. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce also discussed these issues. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN, with members expressing the need for an extension or a similar permanent agreement to ensure ICANN's accountability to the public and global stakeholders. The committee letter outlines requirements for the instrument to ensure the continuation of the DOC-ICANN relationship, including periodic reviews of ICANN performance, accountability measures, addition of new gTLDs, WHOIS information access, and ICANN remaining a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the United States. The AoC reaffirms ICANN's not-for-profit status and global presence, emphasizing its private nature and the establishment of review panels. The AoC calls for the establishment of review panels to evaluate ICANN governance in areas such as accountability, transparency, and global Internet user interests. The panel will be composed of various stakeholders and experts, jointly agreed upon by the chair of the GAC and the chair of ICANN. The panel, agreed upon by the GAC chair and ICANN chair, will review ICANN's plan to enhance DNS stability and examine the impact of new gTLDs on competition and consumer trust. It will consist of GAC chair, ICANN CEO, Advisory Committees, Supporting Organizations, and independent experts. The panel, composed of the GAC chair, ICANN CEO, Advisory Committees, Supporting Organizations, and independent experts, will review existing WHOIS policy to assess its effectiveness in meeting law enforcement needs and promoting consumer trust. Additionally, global law enforcement and privacy experts will be included in the panel's composition. The Accountability and Transparency Review Team (ATRT) released recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations in June 2011. A follow-up report, ATRT2, presented 12 new recommendations in December 2013. The focus is now on ICANN management and staff to implement these reforms rapidly. The ATRT2 report presented 12 new recommendations to improve ICANN's transparency and accountability. The IANA functions contract authorizes ICANN to manage critical technical functions of the DNS, while a cooperative agreement with VeriSign allows VeriSign to maintain the official root zone file. This gives the U.S. government authority over the root zone file. The U.S. government has authority over the root zone file of the DNS, allowing them to approve or deny changes. The expiration of the JPA and establishment of the AoC did not directly affect this authority. The U.S. government maintains exclusive authority over the DNS root zone file, despite arguments from foreign governments. NTIA awarded the IANA functions contract to ICANN, ensuring separation between policy development and implementation, with increased transparency and accountability measures. The IANA contract specifies requirements for a U.S. owned contractor with operations in the U.S. NTIA has oversight over ICANN and the domain name system, but announced plans to transition stewardship to the global Internet community. NTIA plans to transition its authority over key domain name functions to the global Internet community by letting its IANA functions contract with ICANN expire. They are asking ICANN to work with various stakeholders to develop a proposal for the transition. The Internet technical organizations called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, with all stakeholders participating equally. NTIA will not accept a transition proposal replacing its role with a government-led solution. The proposal must have broad community support and uphold four principles: multistakeholder model, DNS security, global customer needs, and Internet openness. Supporters of the transition argue that transferring authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community will uphold the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. They believe this will allow the United States to effectively oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet. The U.S. government and Internet stakeholders have always seen U.S. authority over IANA functions as temporary, with eventual complete privatization of the DNS. NTIA states that ICANN has matured and improved its accountability, transparency, and technical competence, making the transition feasible. Those opposed to the transition express skepticism or caution. Critics are concerned about the potential loss of NTIA's oversight of ICANN and the DNS, fearing that without this \"backstop,\" foreign governments may gain more influence over Internet governance. They also worry about the development of a new international entity to oversee the domain name system. Critics are concerned about the risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through a new Internet governance mechanism that lacks U.S. oversight. H.R. 4342 aims to prevent the NTIA from relinquishing control until a report on the advantages, disadvantages, and national security implications is submitted to Congress. The report on H.R. 4342 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of relinquishing U.S. oversight of IANA to the multistakeholder Internet community. GAO is tasked with defining the \"multistakeholder model\" in Internet policymaking. The DOTCOM Act was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on May 8, 2014, and a request was made for GAO to examine the Administration's proposal for the transition. On May 22, 2014, the DOTCOM Act was added as an amendment to H.R. 4435, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015, and passed by the House. The House Armed Services committee emphasized the need to protect the .mil domain and maintain separation between policymaking and technical operations in Internet governance. The Senate also addressed Internet governance in its version of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate's version of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act, S. 2410, includes Section 1646 which addresses the future of the Internet and the '.mil' top-level domain. It suggests transferring the role of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority to a global multi-stakeholder community, with the condition that the '.MIL' domain and Internet Protocol address numbers used by the Department of Defense remain exclusively for national security purposes. The Department of Defense is directed to ensure the successful stewardship of Internet root zone servers. The Senate's FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act, S. 2410, addresses the future of the Internet and the '.mil' top-level domain. It urges the Department of Defense to secure an agreement during the IANA transition process to maintain the '.mil' domain's status. The enacted law, P.L. 113-235, does not include the DOTCOM Act provision. Section 1639 of P.L. 113-235 emphasizes the importance of the '.mil' domain for national security. Section 1639 of P.L. 113-235 emphasizes the need for assurances to protect legacy top-level domain names and IP address numbers, uphold consensus-based decision making, and ensure transparency in the multi-stakeholder approach for a secure and resilient Internet. Congress urges the Secretary of Defense to take necessary steps to sustain these measures. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act, which includes funds for DOC and NTIA. The bill report does not allocate funds for the transition of Internet root zone servers and expects NTIA to maintain the existing contract with ICANN in FY2015. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, FY2015 CJS Appropriations Act, with funds for DOC and NTIA. An amendment by Representative Duffy prohibits funds for relinquishing NTIA's responsibility for Internet domain functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to conduct a review in their version of the FY2015 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act. The committee directed NTIA to review the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan. NTIA must report quarterly on the privatization process and notify the committee before any decision on a successor contract. Concerns were raised about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) prohibits NTIA from using funds to relinquish its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions until September 30, 2015. Concerns were raised about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) prohibits NTIA from relinquishing its responsibility for Internet domain name system functions until September 30, 2015. The Explanatory Statement directs NTIA to inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any proposed successor contract or decision related to ICANN or IANA activities. It also requires NTIA to report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 45 days regarding potential recourse if a transition to a new contract is detrimental to the United States. Other legislation, such as H.R. 4367, addresses the proposed transition. Other legislation addressing the proposed transition included H.R. 4367 (Internet Stewardship Act of 2014), H.R. 4398 (Global Internet Freedom Act of 2014), and H.R. 5737 (Defending Internet Freedom Act of 2014), all aimed at prohibiting NTIA from relinquishing its responsibilities over domain name functions unless certain criteria are met. These bills were referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet, are deleterious to the United States. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced as H.R. 805, would prevent NTIA from transferring responsibility over the Internet domain name system until GAO submits a report to Congress examining the implications of the proposed transfer. The report must be issued within one year of NTIA receiving a transition proposal and include an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the transfer, NTIA's criteria for the transfer, and all transfer proposals received. The GAO is directed to analyze the disadvantages of the proposed transfer, NTIA's criteria for the transfer, transfer proposals received, evaluation processes, national security concerns, and concerns regarding the security of the Internet domain name system. H.R. 805 is referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, while S.Res. 71 designates a week as \"Internet Governance Awareness Week\" in the Senate. S.Res. 71 designates \"Internet Governance Awareness Week\" to increase public awareness about NTIA's proposed transition and the importance of accountability and governance reforms for ICANN. The Senate passed S.Res. 71 on February 5, 2015, and a hearing was held on the status of the transition on February 25, 2015. ICANN is working on a transition proposal for the IANA functions, with a focus on enhancing accountability. A steering group will oversee the process in an open and inclusive manner, involving representatives from various stakeholders. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) was formed to coordinate the development of a proposal among communities affected by the IANA functions. The group consists of 30 individuals representing 13 communities and has requested proposals for the three primary IANA functions. The ICG has requested proposals for the three primary IANA functions (protocol parameters, numbering, and domain name-related functions) to be developed by the operational communities associated with each function. The current status of the proposals is as follows: Domain Names proposal by CWG-Stewardship is still in progress with a target submission date of June 2015. Number Resources proposal by CRISP Team was submitted to the ICG on January 15, 2015. The CRISP Team and IETF submitted final proposals for numbering and protocol parameters to the ICG in January 2015. The domain name function proposal by CWG-Stewardship has faced delays and now has a target submission date of June 2015. The numbering and protocol parameters are currently handled by external groups, while the domain name function is performed by ICANN itself. The domain name IANA function is currently performed by ICANN itself under contract with NTIA. The debate is whether to create a new organization to oversee the IANA function contract or enhance ICANN's accountability. ICANN has also started a process to enhance its accountability post-NTIA contract. The purpose of the accountability process is to strengthen ICANN's mechanisms in the absence of its contract with the U.S. government. A Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) has been formed to develop proposals for enhancing accountability towards stakeholders, with 25 members and 141 participants involved in the process. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) consists of participants contributing to mailing list conversations and meetings, with decisions made by consensus. The group is open to any interested person as a participant, with up to seven advisors providing independent advice and research. The CCWG is pursuing two interrelated Work Streams, focusing on mechanisms enhancing ICANN accountability. The CCWG is pursuing two interrelated Work Streams to enhance ICANN accountability. Work Stream 1 focuses on mechanisms that must be in place by the IANA Stewardship Transition deadline of September 30, 2015. Work Stream 2 addresses accountability topics with a timeline extending beyond the transition. If approved, the accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval or modification. The Workstream 1 proposal is due in June 2015, while the Workstream 2 proposal is to be submitted later. The Workstream 1 proposal is set to be submitted to the ICANN Board in June 2015, while the Workstream 2 proposal will follow after the ICANN 54 meeting in October 2015. NTIA's approval is required for the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition. NTIA will not use appropriated funds to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015. NTIA will not use appropriated funds to amend the cooperative agreement with Verisign to eliminate NTIA's role in approving changes to the authoritative root zone file before September 30, 2015. Congress expects NTIA to actively monitor the transition process and participate in discussions with ICANN, Verisign, and other stakeholders. NTIA will provide regular reports to Congress on the transition progress. The stakeholder community is urged to proceed carefully with the transition process, ensuring that all ideas are considered and all concerns are addressed. Administrator Strickling emphasized the importance of developing a well-thought-out plan and called for equal consideration of all transition proposal models by the CWG-Stewardship group. The community should act as if they only have one chance to get this right. NTIA called on the CWG-Stewardship group to consider all transition proposal models equally and ensure new organizational structures are accountable. Stress testing of proposed solutions is crucial to safeguard against future contingencies. NTIA encourages addressing how to remove or replace board members and improve current accountability tools. Both transition processes should be carefully managed to ensure a successful outcome. NTIA emphasizes the importance of accountability tools like reviews and stresses the need for a coordinated and complete transition plan for both the IANA function stewardship and accountability processes. The timing for delivering a transition plan is targeted for summer with flexibility to extend if needed. ICANN is recognized as an international organization due to its global reach and influence. ICANN, as an international organization, has a global reach and influence. The DNS relies on entities worldwide, with the ICANN Board and constituency groups from around the world shaping policy decisions. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) provides advice to the ICANN Board on public policy matters. Some argue that the U.S. government's authority over ICANN and the DNS should be transferred to a higher intergovernmental body. The United Nations debated international involvement in Internet governance at the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society. A report by the U.N.'s Working Group on Internet Governance called for greater internationalization of Internet governance and proposed the creation of a new global forum for Internet stakeholders. Four possible models were suggested, including options where ICANN would be supplanted or made accountable to a higher authority. The report presented four models for Internet governance, with three involving new bodies linked to the U.N. U.S. officials opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to an international body. The EU initially supported the U.S. position but later shifted towards favoring an enhanced international role in governing the Internet. Conflict at the WSIS Tunis Summit over control of the domain name system was averted in November 2005. An Internet governance agreement was reached in November 2005 between the United States, the EU, and over 100 other nations, maintaining ICANN and the United States' roles in the domain name system. The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was established under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. The IGF does not have binding authority and was renewed for another five years in 2010. In 2010, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was renewed for another five years, with the U.N.'s Commission on Science and Technology for Development tasked to develop a report on improvements. Controversies arose in 2010 and 2011 regarding new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and the .xxx TLD, leading to debates on increased government influence on ICANN policy decisions. Some governments, like the United States, Canada, and the EU, advocated for an enhanced role for the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), while others, such as Brazil, South Africa, and India (IBSA), supported the creation of an Internet policy development process. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) on ICANN policy decisions. Nations like Brazil, South Africa, and India (IBSA) favored creating an Internet policy entity within the U.N. system. Russia and China proposed an \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for discussion in the U.N. General Assembly. The Code promotes a multilateral, transparent, and democratic international Internet management. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) in Dubai on December 3-14, 2012, aimed to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs) under the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). The revised International Code of Conduct for Information Security emphasized equal responsibility for international governance of the Internet and promoting multilateral, transparent, and democratic mechanisms for Internet governance. The WCIT in Dubai aimed to revise the ITRs under the ITU, focusing on traditional telecommunications traffic. The US advocated for a multistakeholder model of Internet governance and opposed any ITU jurisdiction over the Internet. Concerns arose in Congress about potential increased intergovernmental control. The 112th Congress had concerns about the WCIT potentially increasing intergovernmental control over the Internet. A hearing was held on \"International Proposals to Regulate the Internet,\" and H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced to preserve the multistakeholder governance model. H.Con.Res. 127 and S.Con.Res. 50 were resolutions passed by the US Congress in 2012 to promote a global Internet free from government control and uphold the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. S.Con.Res. 50 was passed by the Senate on September 22, 2012, and by the House on December 5, 2012, with unanimous support. The resolution aimed to protect the multistakeholder model governing the Internet. During the WCIT, a proposal to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance was introduced but later withdrawn. The ITU proposed managing Internet resources, but the idea was withdrawn. A nonbinding resolution was adopted to promote Internet growth, emphasizing equal government roles in governance. The US refused to sign the treaty due to Resolution 3 and new articles on spam and cybersecurity. The WCIT in Dubai ended, but the debate on Internet governance continues internationally. The United States declined to sign the treaty related to spam and cybersecurity at the WCIT in Dubai. The international debate on Internet governance is expected to continue, with the 113th Congress monitoring and opposing any proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet. H.R. 1580 was introduced to affirm the U.S. policy on Internet governance, stating support for the multistakeholder model. It was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. The United States supports the multistakeholder model governing the Internet. H.R. 1580 was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives in May 2013. In October 2013, ICANN and other organizations called for strengthening global multistakeholder Internet cooperation to address challenges and prevent fragmentation. They expressed concern over surveillance undermining trust in Internet users. The need for ongoing effort to address Internet Governance challenges was identified globally due to recent revelations of pervasive monitoring and surveillance. Efforts were made to accelerate the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, with a focus on multistakeholder cooperation. A meeting called NETmundial was held in April 2014 in Brazil, aiming to gather representatives from government, industry, civil society, and academia to discuss the future of Internet governance. The NETmundial meeting in April 2014 in Sao Paulo, Brazil focused on crafting Internet governance principles and proposing a roadmap for the future evolution of the Internet governance ecosystem. The outcome was a nonbinding \"NETmundial Multistakeholder Statement\" reaffirming the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and endorsing the transition of the U.S. government's stewardship role of IANA functions to the global community. On November 17, 2013, ICANN announced the formation of a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation, composed of stakeholders from various sectors. The Panel prepared a report on principles for global Internet cooperation and a roadmap for future governance challenges. This report, released in May 2014, emphasized the importance of human rights in a free and open Internet. Additionally, in August 2014, the NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was established. The creation of a NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in August 2014 by the World Economic Forum in partnership with ICANN and other stakeholders. The purpose of the initiative is to apply the NETmundial Principles to enable effective and distributed Internet cooperation and governance. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan, Republic of Korea concluded in November 2014, setting general policies, adopting strategic plans, and electing officials. The U.S. delegation had concerns prior to the conference. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in Busan, Republic of Korea concluded successfully, with member states deciding not to expand the ITU's role in Internet governance or cybersecurity issues. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of an address, such as country codes like .us or generic TLDs like .com. ICANN established 22 gTLDs, with some reserved. ICANN established 22 gTLDs, including .com, .org, and .info, with some reserved for specific organizations. Applicants for new gTLDs are typically commercial and non-profit organizations seeking ICANN recognition to operate name servers and implement domain registration processes. Debate has focused on expanding the number of gTLDs, leading ICANN to develop rules for introducing an indefinite number of new gTLDs into the domain name system. ICANN developed rules for introducing an indefinite number of new gTLDs into the domain name system. The new gTLD program was approved by the ICANN Board of Directors in 2011, allowing for potentially hundreds of new gTLDs to be introduced. Applications for new gTLDs were accepted from January 12 through April 12, 2012, with an application fee of $185,000. The approval of the new gTLD program has been controversial, with concerns raised by trademark holders about higher costs and difficulties in protecting their trademarks. The approval of the new gTLD program in 2011 was controversial, with trademark holders and governments expressing concerns over higher costs, difficulties in protecting trademarks, and intellectual property protections. Governments advocated for additional protections and more stringent rules for law enforcement in the new domain space. Despite some changes made, strong opposition from trademark holders led to pushback from parts of the U.S. government, including the Senate Committee on Commerce. Despite strong opposition from trademark holders and some parts of the U.S. government, ICANN proceeded with the gTLD expansion as planned in December 2011. ICANN defended the program, stating that new gTLDs would offer more protections for consumers and trademark holders, provide competition, choice, and innovation to the domain name system. The application window for new gTLDs was opened on January 12, 2012. ICANN opened the application window for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012. By June 13, 2012, they had received 1,930 applications, including geographic names and Internationalized Domain Names in various scripts. The evaluation process for these applications is complex and could take 9 to 20 months for approval and delegation into the DNS. The approval and delegation process for new gTLDs can take 9 to 20 months after the application window closes. ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook outlines the rules and procedures. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been added to the Internet, with 894 currently in progress. ICANN plans for future rounds with changes to the application process. Stakeholders are concerned about potential domain name abuse as new gTLDs go live. The effectiveness of ICANN's approach to addressing domain name abuse and intellectual property protection in new gTLDs will be of interest as the program progresses. Legislation has been enacted to create a \"kids-friendly top level domain name\" to protect children from inappropriate content on the Internet. The Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002 authorized the creation of a kids.us domain for age-appropriate content. Legislation for an adult content top-level domain and mandatory domain for harmful material to minors has been considered in past Congresses but did not advance. ICANN considered creating a \".xxx\" domain for adult websites, which sparked controversy. The Department of Commerce requested additional time for ICANN to address the issue before final approval. The Department of Commerce requested more time for ICANN to address objections regarding the creation of a .xxx domain for adult content. Despite negotiations with ICM Registry, the ICANN Board voted against accepting the proposed agreement in May 2006. Subsequently, a revised agreement was proposed in January 2007, but the Board voted against it in March 2007. On January 5, 2007, ICANN proposed a revised agreement with ICM Registry for a .xxx domain. However, on March 30, 2007, the ICANN Board voted 9-5 to deny the domain, citing reluctance to oversee Internet content. ICM Registry challenged this decision before an Independent Review Panel, which ruled in favor of ICM Registry on February 19, 2010, stating that the denial was not consistent with fair policy application. The ICANN Board's reversal of its initial approval for the .xxx domain was deemed inconsistent with fair policy application. Despite the non-binding nature of the IRP decision, the Board ultimately voted to allow ICM's .xxx application to proceed, leading to further steps for due diligence, negotiations, and consultation with ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The ICANN Board approved a resolution for the .xxx TLD registry agreement after consultation with the Governmental Advisory Committee, despite conflicts with GAC advice. On March 18, 2011, the ICANN Board approved the .xxx TLD registry agreement, allowing the CEO or General Counsel to execute it. The .xxx domain became available in December 2011. Concerns about DNS vulnerabilities led to the development of DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to enhance Internet security. DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to protect against vulnerabilities in collecting passwords and sensitive information. \"Signing the root\" with DNSSEC is a critical step in securing the DNS. NTIA sought public input on deploying DNSSEC in the root zone, working with ICANN and VeriSign on an interim approach. Testing and evaluation reports were filed for public comment before proceeding with the final deployment. DNSSEC was implemented in the root zone on June 9, 2010, with NTIA seeking public comments on the testing and evaluation report. ICANN published the root zone trust anchor on July 15, 2010, and root operators began serving the signed root zone. Adoption of DNSSEC by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide is crucial for effective deployment. WHOIS database information is required for domain name registration. The WHOIS database contains contact information (phone number, address, email) for domain name registration. There is debate over the accessibility of WHOIS information, with privacy advocates pushing for limited access while businesses and government agencies argue for continued public availability. ICANN's GNSO is developing policy recommendations on what data should be publicly available in the WHOIS database. The GNSO supported a narrow technical definition of WHOIS information, favored by privacy advocates and non-commercial user constituencies. Opponents urged ICANN to reconsider limiting access to WHOIS data. The GNSO deferred a decision on WHOIS database privacy in 2007 and recommended more studies. They rejected a proposal to list third party contact information instead of private data. Currently, the GNSO is exploring extensive studies of WHOIS. In 2011, ICANN announced the initiation of four separate studies on WHOIS. The GNSO is currently exploring extensive studies of WHOIS, including examining misuse, registrant identification, proxy and privacy abuse, and the feasibility of a reveal study. A WHOIS policy review team issued 16 recommendations for strengthening WHOIS, focusing on registrar compliance and data accuracy. The ICANN Board approved a resolution to redefine the purpose of collecting and providing access to gTLD registration data. In 2012, the ICANN Board approved a resolution to redefine the purpose of collecting gTLD registration data. An Expert Working Group released recommendations for a new Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS. ICANN is working on implementing these recommendations. The domain name system's commercial use has raised intellectual property concerns, leading to the development of trademark/domain name dispute resolution recommendations by WIPO for submission to ICANN. At ICANN's August 1999 meeting, the board adopted a dispute resolution policy for trademark/domain name disputes to be applied by all registrars uniformly. Registrars will not take action on complaints until instructed by the domain-name holder or a court/arbitrator, except for \"abusive registrations\" which will be resolved through a special online procedure. The Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy started on December 9, 1999, and the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act was passed by the 106th Congress, giving courts authority to intervene in such disputes. The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, passed by the 106th Congress, allows courts to order forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of domain names registered in bad faith. It also provides for civil damages of $1,000 to $100,000 per domain name. Intellectual property concerns drive the debate over adding new generic top-level domain names, with fears of increased trademark protection costs. Domain names are also seen as a tool to combat online piracy. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to address online piracy by prohibiting Internet service providers from directing traffic to infringing content. Decisions regarding the DNS can impact policy issues like intellectual property, privacy, and cybersecurity. ICANN's decisions affect Internet stakeholders globally, and the key policy question is how to ensure Internet stability, security, competition, and fair policymaking in transferring DNS management to the private sector. The key question is how to ensure Internet stability, security, competition, and fair policymaking in transferring DNS management to the private sector. Controversies like new gTLDs and .xxx have raised concerns about ICANN's policymaking process and the role of various stakeholders in the process. Some governments are pushing for increased influence over Internet policies, while defenders of the multistakeholder model argue for its effectiveness in addressing the evolving impact of the Internet on society. Defenders of the multistakeholder model argue for its effectiveness in developing Internet policies, while some governments seek increased influence. The 114th Congress will closely examine the proposed transition of ICANN's authority to a multistakeholder-driven entity to ensure it is in the best interest of the United States and the Internet. Congress will monitor the transition plan and seek assurances for a stable DNS free of U.S. government control. Congress will monitor the development of the transition plan for ICANN's authority to a multistakeholder-driven entity. They will seek assurances for a stable DNS free of U.S. government control and assess the potential for increased intergovernmental control over the Internet. The outcome of these issues could impact the evolution of ICANN, the DNS, and the Internet."
