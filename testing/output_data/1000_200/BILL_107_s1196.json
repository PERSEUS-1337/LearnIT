The Act allows for the removal of a management official for breaching fiduciary duty. A hearing must be held within 30 to 60 days of notice, unless an earlier or later date is set by the Administrator. If the official does not appear at the hearing, consent to removal is assumed. If grounds for removal are found, an order of removal may be issued. The Administrator may issue orders of removal from office if grounds specified in the notice have been established. The order becomes effective after 30 days of service, unless specified otherwise, and remains enforceable unless stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside. The Administrator has the authority to suspend or prohibit participation of management officials for protection of the licensee or Administration's interests. The suspension or prohibition becomes effective upon notice and remains enforceable unless modified or set aside. The Administrator has the authority to suspend or prohibit management officials for protection of interests. The suspension or prohibition becomes effective upon notice and remains enforceable until completion of administrative proceedings or dismissal of charges. Judicial review can be requested within 10 days of suspension or prohibition. A management official suspended or prohibited from a licensee can apply to the US district court for a stay pending administrative proceedings. The court has jurisdiction to grant a stay. If a management official is charged with a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust, the Administrator can suspend or prohibit them from office. This action remains in effect until the legal case is resolved or terminated by the Administrator. If the official is convicted, the suspension or prohibition continues. If a management official is convicted of an offense, the Administrator can issue an order for their removal, which becomes effective upon service to the licensee. A not guilty verdict does not prevent the Administrator from taking further action to suspend or remove the official from office or prohibit their participation in the licensee's affairs. The Administrator can issue an order to remove a management official from a licensee's affairs if convicted of an offense. Notices served to the official must also be given to the licensee. Hearings will be held in the licensee's district and follow procedural provisions outlined in title 5, United States Code. Orders must be issued within 90 days after the hearing. After a hearing, the Administrator must render a decision within 90 days and issue orders consistent with the provisions of title 5, United States Code. The Administrator has the authority to modify, terminate, or set aside any order unless a petition for review is filed in a court of appeals. Judicial review of an order issued under this section shall be exclusively as provided in this subsection. Any party to a hearing may obtain a review of any order by filing in the court of appeals of the United States. The judicial review of an order issued under this section must be done by filing a written petition in the court of appeals within 30 days. The court will then have jurisdiction over the petition and the Administrator must provide the court with the record of the proceeding. Upon filing a petition under subparagraph (A), the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside the Administrator's order. Review of the proceedings will follow chapter 7 of title 5, US Code, and the court's judgment will be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court. The commencement of judicial review does not act as a stay. The court has exclusive jurisdiction to review and make final judgments on the Administrator's orders. Judicial review does not automatically stay any orders issued by the Administrator. SEC. 6. REDUCTION OF FEES.

Guarantee fees are adjusted based on the total loan amount, with percentages ranging from 1% to 3.5% of the deferred participation share.

The maximum amount for loans made during a 2-year period starting October 1, 2002, is 50 percent of the established amount for the life of the loan. The Administration is prohibited from charging any upfront guarantee fees for loans made under this title during the same 2-year period. During the 2-year period starting on October 1, 2002, loans and financings approved by the Small Business Administration shall be treated as separate programs for budgetary purposes.
