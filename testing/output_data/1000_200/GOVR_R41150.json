    "content": "Energy and Water Development funding for FY2010 was provided in H.R. 3183, which became P.L. 111-85 when signed by President Obama on October 28, 2009, totaling $33.5 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) also allocated $44.3 billion for programs in the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Department of Energy. President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget for Energy and Water Development programs was $35.3 billion. The House Appropriations Subcommittee approved a bill for $34.7 billion, while the Senate reported out S. 3635 (S.Rept. 111-228) on July 20, 2010. The Energy and Water Development subcommittee approved a bill with a total of $35.0 billion, but it did not come to the floor of either the House or the Senate. A continuing resolution was passed to fund government programs at the FY2010 level until March 18, 2011, with reduced funding levels for Energy and Water Development programs. The House Appropriations Committee announced that the Energy and Water Development funding level in H.R. 1 was $29.9 billion. The Senate offered S.Amdt. 149 as a substitute for H.R. 1, with funding totaling approximately $32.4 billion. After rejection of both versions, H.R. 1473 was passed, funding Energy and Water Development programs at approximately $32.2 billion for FY2011. The Energy and Water Development bill funds programs at $32.2 billion for FY2011, including projects for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, and independent agencies. Budget totals for energy and water development appropriations from FY2004 to FY2011 are provided in tables. The Energy and Water Development bill funds programs for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, and independent agencies. The FY2011 President's request for the Army Corps of Engineers was $4.88 billion, $564 million below the FY2010 appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $5.32 billion for the Corps in FY2011, slightly below the FY2010 appropriation. The Corps received $5.32 billion, an increase of $381 million over the Administration's request but slightly below the FY2010 appropriation. The House Appropriations Subcommittee provided $5.28 billion. The Continuing Resolution provided $5.05 billion for the Corps, an increase of $152 million over the President's request but $411 million below the FY2010 enacted level. Federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program. The Corps' funding is often debated over earmarks, with about 85% of appropriations directed to specific projects identified in the budget request or added during congressional deliberations. Generally, funds are not provided to projects without prior authorization, leading to a backlog of authorized projects ranging from $11 billion to over $80 billion. This backlog raises policy questions about potential disconnects in funding allocation. The Corps' Civil Works program has received significant funding since Hurricane Katrina, including $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations. This includes $15 billion for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. For example, in 2008, the agency received $5.76 billion for Louisiana hurricane protection, and in 2009, $797 million was provided. The Corps received significant funding post-Hurricane Katrina, including $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations. In 2009, they received $797 million for flood control and coastal emergencies, with $439 million for barrier island and ecosystem restoration. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request included $1.69 billion for construction, a reduction of $341 million from FY2010. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for construction funding was below the FY2010 enacted level. The request included two new construction starts, following the previous practice of limiting new starts to focus on completing ongoing activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $1.9 billion for the Construction account, using unobligated balances from prior years for FY2011 construction activities. The House subcommittee bill proposed funding Construction at $1.851 billion. The House subcommittee bill proposed funding Construction at $1.851 billion, slightly more than the amount requested by the Administration. The enacted bill included a provision barring the Corps from using appropriations for new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) is facing a deficit, with collections falling short of needed funding for ongoing work. Current law designates federal responsibility for construction and major rehabilitation of inland waterways, with funding split between IWTF and federal general revenue. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) receives federal monies from a fuel tax on commercial vessels. FY2009 and FY2010 had additional funding to maintain IWTF solvency. Previous proposals to increase revenues included a lock user fee, but FY2011 Budget limited spending to current fuel tax revenues. The Administration's FY2011 Budget proposed limiting IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues, rejecting the lock user fee proposal. The Senate Appropriations Committee also agreed to this temporary solution, but warned of potential action if a long-term solution is not reached soon. The Corps plays a key role in coordinating the restoration of the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem, with funding coming from Energy and Water Development and Department of the Interior appropriations. Concerns about funding levels and progress in the restoration effort are discussed. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $180 million for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work, the same as the FY2010 appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed reducing this amount to $155 million due to the Corps' inability to utilize the original funding requested. Since FY2006, there has been no across-the-board reduction for savings and slippage in the budget estimates. Since FY2006, there has been no across-the-board reduction for savings and slippage in the budget estimates. The Administration and Congress have not enacted reductions for individual accounts to account for project delays or cost savings. Congress stopped applying an S&S rate in FY2006 to decrease the need for reprogramming allocations among projects. The FY2011 budget request continued this practice, excluding reductions for S&S in individual accounts. The FY2011 budget request included reductions for Investigations, Construction, Operations and Maintenance, and Mississippi Rivers & Tributaries in the Corps budget. The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account, and the Bureau of Reclamation requested $1.064 billion in gross current budget authority for FY2011, with a net discretionary authority of $1.015 billion after offsets. The FY2011 budget request included a total discretionary authority of $1.015 billion for the Central Valley Project (CVP) Restoration Fund. An additional $167 million was estimated to be available for FY2011, bringing the grand total to $1.182 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion, with the enacted bill including $1.129 billion. Reclamation's largest account, Water and Related Resources, received $1.094 billion in appropriations under P.L. 112-10. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, a reduction from FY2010 of $37.6 million. H.R. 1 proposed funding the account at $911.6 million, with potential policy impacts such as eliminating funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin. The proposed H.R. 1 bill would have eliminated funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin and barred funding for other items related to restoration efforts in the region. These provisions were not included in the final enacted version of P.L. 112-10. The Bureau of Reclamation manages dams and water projects in 17 western states, providing water for irrigation and hydroelectric power. It serves 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people, offering flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. Operations can be controversial due to impacts on fish and wildlife, and conflicts among water users. The Bureau of Reclamation's budget is mainly project-based, with limited programs. Despite past achievements, it has been criticized for not taking a leadership role in water supply management. The Central Valley Project in California faces challenges like water delivery restrictions due to drought and environmental concerns. Leadership in western water resource management is crucial due to increasing demand and changing hydrology. Recently, Reclamation has had to limit water deliveries and pumping from CVP facilities due to drought and environmental restrictions, including attempts to prevent new Biological Opinions on project operations' impact on fish species. Two BiOps found that continuing operations under a 2004 plan would endanger Delta Smelt and salmon species in California, protected under the Endangered Species Act. The Operational Criteria and Plan (OCAP) could harm Delta Smelt and salmon in California, protected under the Endangered Species Act. Factors like invasive species, pollution, and water withdrawals also contribute to fish declines. Low Delta Smelt numbers led to pumping limits and a review of project impacts on the economy and species. Low water deliveries worsen unemployment in water districts with junior rights, affecting an already struggling farming economy. Water deliveries to certain water districts with junior water rights are worsening unemployment in an area already struggling due to changes in the farming industry, housing and financial sectors, and the economy in general. The FY2010 enacted bill included an amendment allowing water transfers among certain CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account for FY2011, with funds targeted at water use efficiency, water quality, and water storage. The requested funds for FY2010 are primarily allocated to five program areas: water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Funding for CALFED subaccounts varied, with a substantial increase in water use efficiency and science. The Continuing Resolution provided the same amount as the President's FY2011 budget request. Reclamation proposed an increased allocation for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011. Reclamation proposed an allocation of $72.1 million for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011, an increase of $56.2 million over FY2010. The Fund was authorized by the enactment of Title X of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-11). It is to be used for fisheries restoration and water management provisions of a settlement agreement for the Natural Resources Defense Council et al. v. Rodgers lawsuit, funded through various sources. Additional authorization would be needed for allocations exceeding $88 million authorized in P.L. 111-11. In FY2011, significant actions planned for San Joaquin River restoration include releasing interim flows from Friant Dam and completing planning, environmental compliance, and design for initial improvements. The construction of Friant Dam in the 1940s blocked salmon migration and led to the elimination of spring-run Chinook in the upper river. The Senate Appropriations Committee markup included an additional $8 million for restoration, in addition to the $72 million already allocated. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) includes an additional $8 million for San Joaquin River restoration, in addition to the $72 million already allocated. Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program in FY2011, focusing on water conservation, re-use, and planning. The WaterSMART proposal by the U.S. Geological Survey includes three components: WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects. Reclamation proposed $62 million for WaterSMART in FY2011, with funding allocated for each program. The Senate Appropriations Committee decreased the funding levels for WaterSMART programs in their markup. P.L. 112-10 did not specify programmatic funding levels for the WaterSMART program. The Energy and Water Development bill funds DOE programs, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons. FY2010 appropriations allocated $27.1 billion, with an additional $38.7 billion from ARRA for selected programs. The bill now covers fossil fuels, energy efficiency, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and energy statistics. In FY2010, $38.7 billion from the ARRA was allocated for selected DOE programs, with $27.1 billion in appropriations. For FY2011, the Obama Administration requested $29.6 billion for DOE programs, with the final legislation appropriating $26.3 billion. DOE administers various programs with different functions and missions, including EERE programs which saw a reduction in funding in FY2011. The FY2011 request for EERE funding was reduced by $416.9 million, or 18.6%, compared to the FY2010 appropriation. Additionally, the DOE requested an increase of $13.9 million, or 8.1%, for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (EDER) programs, but received a cut of $27.3 million, or 15.9%. The DOE also sought $50 million for a new science and engineering education program called RE-ENERGYSE to address the need for a skilled clean energy workforce in the U.S. The DOE requested $50 million for the RE-ENERGYSE program to develop a skilled clean energy workforce in the U.S. This program aims to educate and train Americans for green jobs, increase U.S. competitiveness, and support the development of undergraduate and graduate programs in clean energy fields. The $50 million request for the RE-ENERGYSE program includes funding for fellowships, internships, post-doctoral opportunities, interdisciplinary masters programs, technical training, education, and outreach subprograms. It also supports the development of training programs at community colleges, K-12 education activities, and initiatives to educate and inspire students to pursue clean energy careers and adopt sustainable energy practices. The DOE proposed a RE-ENERGYSE program with $115 million funding in FY2010, but Congress did not fund it. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the program's scope and effectiveness, recommending $7.5 million instead. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal, with the conference report providing no funding for the program in FY2010 or FY2011. The Solar Program would have received a net funding increase of $55.4 million in the FY2011 request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the Solar Program in FY2011. The program would have received a $55.4 million increase, with the majority going to the Concentrating Solar Power subprogram for a demonstration project. This project aims to accelerate CSP deployment in the desert Southwest by 2-3 years, adding 1,000 megawatts of new capacity. The Photovoltaic R&D Program would also receive a $23.5 million increase for full funding. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding increases for the Photovoltaic (PV) R&D Program and the Wind Program. The PV Manufacturing Initiative would receive $23.5 million for technology cost reduction. The Wind Program would see a net increase of $42.5 million, with $49.0 million allocated for offshore wind development. This funding aims to address various barriers and accelerate market deployment of offshore projects. The DOE anticipates accelerating market deployment of over three gigawatts of planned offshore wind projects, marking the first major wind demonstration project since the 1980s. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for two offshore wind demonstration projects off the Atlantic Coast and an $11.0 million increase for the Geothermal Program to address induced seismicity and water availability risks. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for geothermal programs addressing induced seismicity and water availability risks, with a focus on low-temperature systems. Additionally, the Vehicle Technologies Program received a net increase for battery and energy storage subprograms to improve lithium batteries for electric vehicles, while the Building Technologies Program saw a net increase for energy efficiency efforts. The Committee on Appropriations recommended a nearly identical total amount as the request, with the Building Technologies Program receiving a net increase of about $8.7 million. The Energy Efficient Building Systems Design Hub would have received a modest increase from $22.0 million to $24.3 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $8.7 million less than the request for the Buildings Program, with most of the difference reflected in a lower amount for the Building Design Hub. The Industrial Technologies Program would have received a net increase of $4.0 million. The committee directed GAO to determine if new program guidelines are needed for the ENERGY STAR program. The Industrial Technologies Program would receive a net increase of $4.0 million, with a new Manufacturing Energy Systems subprogram funded at $10.0 million. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) would increase by $10.3 million to support DOE efforts in meeting energy goals. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for retro-commissioning, continuous commissioning, fugitive emissions capture hardware, and pilot projects for alternative fueling stations. The Weatherization Program would have grown by $90.0 million, with most of the increase supporting the goal to weatherize low-income households. DOE estimates an average cost of $6,500 per household, allowing for the weatherization of an additional 13,200 households. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a $4.2 million increase for the completion of the Weatherization Program evaluation. The State Energy Program would receive a $25.0 million increase to expand current activities. The Facilities Program would see a net increase of $38.5 million, mainly for the Energy Systems Integration Facility at NREL. Program Direction would increase by $60.0 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations supported the requested increase for the Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) at NREL and research equipment. Program Direction would increase by $60.0 million, with a focus on salaries and benefits for processing contracts. Program Support would receive a $42.3 million increase, with a significant portion allocated to the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis (SPIA) subprogram. The FY2011 increase for the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis (SPIA) subprogram focuses on policy analysis of EE and RE technologies for climate change solutions. It includes cross-cutting projects and the Low-Carbon Energy Systems project to meet climate goals. An additional $15.0 million would support the International subprogram addressing energy security and economic goals. The FY2011 increase for Program Support includes $15.0 million to expand support for the International subprogram, focusing on energy security, economic goals, and climate change through partnerships with developing countries like China, India, and Brazil. New initiatives will target global technology deployment and climate change mitigation, including the China and India Clean Energy Research Centers and programs under the Major Economies Forum. Additional funding will also support regional partnerships such as APEC, ECPA, EDIN, and a regional energy platform. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended reduced funding for Program Management and congressionally directed projects, cutting the Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program by $37.0 million and the Market Transformation subprogram by $16.9 million. The Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program faced a $37.0 million cut, or about 21%, with the Market Transformation subprogram also seeing a $16.9 million reduction. The Water Power Program would have been cut by $9.5 million, or about 19%, impacting technologies utilizing marine and hydrokinetic resources for electricity generation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended restoring the proposed cuts to maintain funding at the FY2010 level. The FY2011 budget request for DOE includes funding for new projects and support for incremental hydropower opportunities. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended additional funding for conventional hydropower and Industries of the Future program, while cutting funding for specific industry subprograms. DOE is shifting towards greater support for cross-cutting technology efforts. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $14.0 million for the Industries of the Future program, with a decrease from FY2010 funding. The FY2011 budget would allocate $185.9 million to the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, including a $26.0 million increase for Energy Storage. This increase aims to address electric power infrastructure issues and promote research on lithium-based batteries. The FY2011 budget includes an increase in funding for Energy Storage to address power infrastructure issues and promote research on lithium-based batteries. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the exact amount of the request for programs, with an additional $4.3 million for six congressionally directed projects. P.L. 112-10 reduced the total appropriation for Energy Delivery and Energy Reliability to $144.7 million. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totaled $824.1 million. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totaled $824.1 million, including advanced reactors, fuel cycle technology, and infrastructure support. P.L. 112-10 provided $732.1 million for those programs, with an additional $88.2 million requested for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho nuclear facilities. Critics argue that the nuclear research program provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out due to safety and economic concerns. The Obama Administration's FY2011 funding request for nuclear energy research and development included reorganizing the budget to establish new priorities. The Nuclear Power 2010 Program was completed in FY2010 with no further funding, but a new Reactor Concepts Research, Development, and Demonstration Program was established. Fuel Cycle Research and Development saw a 47.8% increase in funding to $201 million, shifting focus towards longer-term research. The FY2011 budget request for nuclear energy research and development included a 47.8% increase in funding to $201 million, with a shift towards longer-term research on spent nuclear fuel disposal and fuel cycle options. A new program area called Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) was proposed, funded at $99.3 million, supporting various nuclear technologies and advanced power concepts. Generation IV Research and Development is split between NEET and Reactor Concepts RD&D, while funding for university nuclear education and research remains at $5 million. The FY2011 budget request for nuclear energy research and development included a $5 million funding for university nuclear education and research under the DOE-wide RE-ENERGYSE initiative. Additionally, $3 million was allocated for International Nuclear Energy Cooperation, including activities by the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. The Reactor Concepts RD&D program area proposed a total funding request of $195 million for projects like the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) demonstration project and research on advanced reactors. New programs were also established to develop small modular reactors and enhance the sustainability of existing commercial nuclear plants. The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor demonstration project with a funding request of $195 million. The project aims to produce high-temperature heat for electricity generation, hydrogen separation, and industrial processes. The FY2011 budget included $103 million for NGNP, with a decision on final design and construction expected by the end of FY2011. The DOE is considering moving forward with the Advanced Reactor Concepts program, which focuses on developing reactors for improved sustainability, safety, and performance. The program includes research on fast reactors and reactors using different heat-transfer fluids. International collaboration in this area will continue. The DOE is considering advancing the Small Modular Reactors Program with a budget request of $38.9 million. Small reactor concepts are being explored as alternatives to large commercial reactors, with the potential for cost reduction through factory-built modules. The program aims to award financial assistance for up to two SMR designs through a competitive solicitation process. DOE plans to award financial assistance for up to two Small Modular Reactor (SMR) designs through a competitive solicitation process. The Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program will receive $25.8 million to research extending the life of existing commercial reactors beyond 60 years. The program will focus on studying aging reactor materials, analyzing safety margins, and improving plant efficiency. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts long-term research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts long-term research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, with a total FY2011 funding request of $201 million. Under the George W. Bush Administration, the program focused on developing spent fuel reprocessing technology called UREX. This program aims to develop technology options for a wider range of nuclear fuel cycle approaches under the Obama Administration. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program aims to discourage the international spread of nuclear fuel cycle technology by developing technology options for various approaches, including direct disposal of spent fuel and recycling. The program will also conduct research on storage, transportation, and disposal of used nuclear fuel and radioactive wastes. This research will support alternatives to the Yucca Mountain spent fuel repository and study waste treatment technologies for consideration by the Blue Ribbon Commission. President Obama plans to terminate the Fuel Cycle R&D Program, which includes researching waste treatment technologies and geologic disposal media. The program also focuses on developing advanced fuels for reactors, improving nuclear waste characteristics, and conducting research on nuclear energy technology issues through the newly established NEET program. Additionally, research will be conducted on reactor materials, weapons proliferation risks, nuclear plant manufacturing methods, and advanced sensors. Development, research is to be conducted on new types of reactor materials, weapons proliferation risks of fuel cycle options, advanced nuclear plant manufacturing methods, and advanced sensors and instrumentation. The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation, created in FY2010, is to be moved from the Generation IV program to NEET with a slight increase in funding, to $24.3 million. The Modeling and Simulation Hub aims to create a computer model of an operating reactor for a better understanding of nuclear technology. The Obama Administration requested $586.6 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development in FY2011, representing a 12.7% decrease from the previous year's appropriation. The FY2011 budget for Fossil Energy Research and Development decreased to $586.6 million, reflecting cuts in funding for Natural Gas and Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies. The DOE Office of Fossil Energy proposed a new budget structure for the FY2012 Coal subprogram focusing on carbon capture and storage technologies. The FutureGen project aimed to demonstrate clean coal-based power generation with CO2 capture and sequestration. The FY2011 budget for Fossil Energy Research and Development decreased to $586.6 million, with cuts in funding for Natural Gas and Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies. The DOE has abandoned the Carbon Capture Initiative and the FutureGen project concept, opting instead to use $1 billion to refit an existing plant for CO2 capture. The Clean Coal Technology program has only project-closeout activities remaining, with no further funding requested for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a 24% increase in the Fossil Energy budget, bringing it up to $725.95 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $48.15 million increase in the Fossil Energy budget, bringing it to $725.95 million. The committee supports research projects for high-quality fuels derived from coal/biomass feedstocks, despite higher carbon emissions than conventional fuels. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to provide an emergency source of crude oil in case of supply interruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 to provide emergency crude oil supply. By early 2010, it was filled to its capacity of 727 million barrels. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of home heating oil. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994, acquiring additions through royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil. The Acquisition of Petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve includes provisions for acquiring crude oil through direct purchase, transfer of royalty oil, and receipt of premium barrels. Congress passed legislation in 2008 to suspend RIK fill unless crude oil prices dropped below $75/barrel. Despite this, fill of the SPR resumed due to a sharp decline in oil prices. The Bush Administration announced plans in 2009 to purchase nearly 10.7 million barrels for the SPR to replace oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. RIK fill was resumed in 2009 at an average volume of 26,000 barrels per day, totaling over 6.1 million barrels to be delivered by January 2010. The RIK Program for filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was resumed in 2009 after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, bringing the SPR to capacity. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced a phasing out of the RIK Program, leading to the suspension of upcoming natural gas sales. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the SPR to expand to 1 billion barrels, with a possible additional 160 million barrels in Richton, MS. However, the Administration proposed to suspend spending on SPR expansion in its FY2011 request. The Administration proposed redirecting $71 million in balances previously appropriated for expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to fund non-expansion operations and maintenance activities in FY2011. This decision was based on EIA projections indicating a decline in U.S. petroleum consumption and dependence on imports, with the current Reserve projected to reach 90 days by 2025. The FY2011 request for the SPR was reduced to $138.9 million, a significant decrease from the $243.8 million allocated in FY2010. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, with the same amount proposed for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $209.9 million for the SPR and did not support cancellation. The Administration proposed redirecting $71 million in balances previously appropriated for expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to fund non-expansion operations and maintenance activities in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $209.9 million for the SPR, and P.L. 112-10 set the SPR spending level at $209.9 million. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and requested $5.121 billion for FY2011, an increase of 4.4% from the previous year. The DOE requested $5.121 billion for the Office of Science in FY2011, with varying recommendations from different Congress sessions. The President's Plan for Science and Innovation aims to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies by FY2016. The Plan for Science and Innovation aims to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies by FY2016. The requested funding for basic energy sciences was $1.835 billion, up 12.1% from FY2010. Funding for Energy Frontier Research Centers would have increased by $40 million. The Administration proposed to establish new energy innovation hubs on materials for batteries and energy storage with $34 million in funding, and on fuels from sunlight with $24 million. The aim of these hubs is to address basic science and technology for the nation's energy future. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.739 billion for basic energy sciences in the 111th Congress. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.739 billion for basic energy sciences, providing funding for energy innovation hubs and high-energy physics projects. The request included funding for construction projects at Fermilab and support for the Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, the committee recommended $627 million for biological and environmental research. The DOE was directed to provide a report on their expected benefits, strategy, and funding needs. The request for biological and environmental research was $627 million, with proposed increases for climate and Earth system modeling and genomic science. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $614 million, providing funding for an artificial retina project and nuclear medicine research. H.R. 1 would have limited funding for biological and environmental research to $302 million. For nuclear physics, the request was $562 million, with construction funding for the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at $36 million. The construction of an upgrade at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) received $36 million, up from $20 million in FY2010. The total cost and completion date of the CEBAF project remained unchanged, with some construction activities being moved forward and paid for with funding from the Recovery Act. The request for advanced scientific computing research was $426 million, an 8.1% increase from FY2010. There was a proposed increase of $35 million for leadership computing facilities at two national laboratories, partly offset by a $6 million decrease for research and evaluation prototypes. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $418 million for fusion energy sciences, with a request of $380 million, down 10.8% from the previous year. The U.S. contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) would have decreased from $135 million to $80 million in FY2011 due to construction delays. The total project cost for ITER is estimated to be between $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project involves China, the European Union, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the United States with a total estimated cost of $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion. The expected start-up date for ITER was delayed to November 2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $384 million for fusion energy sciences in the 111th Congress, expressing concerns about the cost and schedule of ITER and U.S. leadership in materials science for fusion. The Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) received its first funding in FY2009. ARPA-E, authorized by the America COMPETES Act, supports energy technology research projects. It received funding in FY2009 and announced contract awards in October 2009. The FY2011 budget request was $300 million, with $179.6 million appropriated in P.L. 112-10. President Obama's FY2011 budget called for terminating DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. OCRWM had been developing a permanent nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, as specified by an NWPA amendment in 1987. DOE filed a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in June 2008. The Obama Administration decided that developing the Yucca Mountain repository was not feasible and sought a different solution for nuclear waste disposal. Consequently, no funding for Yucca Mountain or OCRWM was requested for FY2011. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010, which was initially rejected by an NRC licensing panel on June 29, 2010. The full NRC commission is now reviewing the withdrawal, despite strong opposition from states involved. The Obama Administration decided that developing the Yucca Mountain repository was not feasible, leading to a motion to withdraw the license application. The full NRC commission is now considering the withdrawal, opposed by states with defense-related waste. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future is evaluating alternatives to Yucca Mountain, with a focus on temporary storage, treatment, and permanent disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste. The Commission is expected to issue a draft report within 18 months and a final report within two years. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead all future waste management activities. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy has taken over waste management functions from OCRWM. NE will lead future waste management activities and conduct research on disposal technologies. Utilities have won court cases against DOE for missing waste removal deadlines. DOE estimates liability payments could reach $11 billion if waste removal doesn't start by 2020. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims estimates that liability payments could reach $11 billion if waste removal from reactor sites doesn't start by 2020. Congress established the DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program to support energy projects using new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE's loan guarantee program supports energy projects using new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program requires project owners to pay upfront subsidy costs, estimated to be 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with $47 billion in loan guarantee authority, with allocations for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed increasing the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion. The DOE's loan guarantee program supports energy projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed increasing the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion. The first preliminary nuclear loan guarantee was announced for a project at the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, totaling $8.33 billion for two reactors. The proposed increase to $54.5 billion for nuclear loan guarantees could cover about 13 reactors, depending on their size and cost percentage. Critics argue that this would divert resources from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects with a $6 billion appropriation, but $2 billion was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $6 billion for renewable energy projects, but $2 billion was redirected to the \"cash for clunkers\" program. An additional $1.5 billion was reallocated for other purposes. The remaining $2.5 billion is expected to support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion. President Obama also requested $500 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees, estimated to support projects totaling $3 billion-$5 billion. The $500 million appropriation for subsidy costs would support renewable energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees totaling $3 billion-$5 billion. DOE requested $58 million for administrative costs, offset by receipts. P.L. 112-10 reduced the loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies to $7.3 billion. The Section 1703 non-nuclear loan guarantee ceiling now stands at about $9.3 billion. Nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion, and uranium enrichment totals $4 billion. Remaining appropriations for subsidy cost payments under the Section 1705 loan guarantee program are to expire at the end of FY2011. P.L. 112-10 provides $170 million with no expiration to pay subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program. The Section 1703 program provides $170 million in subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects with no expiration. Additionally, there is authority for up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for these projects. The program also includes the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program established by P.L. 110-140, which allows DOE to issue up to $25 billion in direct loans to eligible automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for plant capacity investments. The DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program allows for up to $25 billion in direct loans to eligible automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for plant capacity investments. The program aims to support the production of vehicles with improved fuel economy. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) oversees the United States' nuclear weapons program, ensuring safety, security, and reliability without underground testing. Stockpile stewardship activities are funded through NNSA's Weapons Activities account, with additional programs for nonproliferation and Naval Reactors. The stockpile management program, established by P.L. 111-84, aims to increase the reliability, safety, and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile while reducing the likelihood of nuclear testing. Changes to the stockpile must align with program objectives and maintain basic design parameters. This program supports the stockpile stewardship program at the nuclear weapons complex. The program supports the stockpile stewardship program at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories and four production sites managed by NNSA. The FY2011 request includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program, projecting budgets and components for FY2012-FY2015. Despite Cold War reductions, the Complex was larger in the past. Many in Congress have wanted the Complex to be maintained. During the Cold War, the nuclear weapons complex consisted of eight sites with larger budgets and personnel. Congress has been pushing for further changes to the Complex, including reducing personnel, costs, and footprint, increasing security, and improving efficiency. In response, NNSA submitted the \"Complex 2030\" plan in 2007. However, the House Appropriations Committee in FY2008 demanded a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy, a detailed nuclear stockpile description, and a long-term expenditure plan before considering funding for Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the NNSA's approach to rebuilding and modernizing the nuclear weapons complex without a long-term efficiency strategy. They rejected the premature deployment of the Complex 2030 consolidation effort and called for a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA later announced a plan called Complex Transformation in December 2007, which aimed to retain existing sites and reduce weapons. NNSA announced its plan, Complex Transformation, in December 2007 to modernize the nuclear weapons complex. The plan aimed to reduce the weapons program footprint, dismantle weapons more rapidly, and build new facilities. The House Appropriations Committee reiterated its views in its FY2009 report. The House Appropriations Committee in its FY2009 report emphasized the need for a modern nuclear deterrent strategy focused on current threats, determining the size of the nuclear stockpile and weapons complex. They recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program and other related programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead program in its FY2009 report. The FY2010 and FY2011 budgets did not request RRW funds, with the FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities being $7,008.8 million. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, with plans to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex at a cost of $80 billion over the next decade. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, with plans to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex at a cost of $80 billion over the next decade. In the 112th Congress, there was a proposal to reduce the requested increase by $312.4 million, which was contentious. The Administration worked out a compromise with Senate Republicans to support the New START treaty by increasing funding for Weapons Activities substantially from FY2010 to FY2020 for modernization and maintenance of the nuclear weapons complex. The Administration's budget plan in November 2010 aimed to increase funding for nuclear weapons maintenance and modernization. The New START resolution emphasized the importance of a robust stockpile stewardship program. The President's FY2012 budget requested $7,629.7 million for Weapons Activities, with concerns raised about potential funding cuts. The issue was resolved in P.L. 112-10, which provided $6,946.4 million for Weapons Activities. This program involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile. The DSW program under P.L. 112-10 involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring, maintenance, refurbishment, and R&D for specific warheads. Specific items include Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for warheads like B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs and the ongoing LEP for the W76 warhead for the Trident II missile. The FY2010 appropriation was $223.2 million, with a FY2011 request of $249.5 million. The FY2010 appropriation was $223.2 million, with a FY2011 request of $249.5 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for the NNSA program involving routine maintenance, replacement of limited-life components, and ongoing assessment for all weapon types in the stockpile. Significant increases were allocated for the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead. The FY2010 appropriation for NNSA program was $223.2 million, with a FY2011 request of $249.5 million. Significant increases were allocated for the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead, with funds for B61 system sustainment and B61 phase 6.2/6.2A study. The latter aims to support a life extension study for nuclear and non-nuclear components, enhancing safety and compatibility with modern aircraft like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Stockpile Systems, with a focus on surveillance activities to monitor the status of nuclear weapons. A robust surveillance program is crucial for maintaining confidence in the performance of nuclear weapons without underground testing. Concerns were raised about potential shortfalls in surveillance jeopardizing the safety and reliability assessments of nuclear weapons. The B61 bomb has various variants, including the controversial B61-12, which aims to consolidate most variants into a single version. The House bill did not allocate funds for this new variant, expressing reluctance towards a major warhead redesign without clear definition. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funds for a major warhead redesign without a clear nuclear weapons strategy. The Senate bill included the requested amount, with $92.0 million allocated for B61 stockpile systems activities. $32.5 million was designated for a study of nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12. The bill allows for an additional $15,000,000 to support the B61-12 non-nuclear upgrade study, pending completion of the Nuclear Posture Review. No funds can be used for B61-12 nuclear components without prior approval from the Appropriations Committees. The conference agreement for the B61-12 upgrade study required prior approval from the Appropriations Committees for funds related to nuclear components. An additional $15,000,000 was authorized for the non-nuclear upgrade study pending completion of the Nuclear Posture Review. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for FY2011 and directed NNSA to submit reports on safety and security features for a refurbished B61, cost-benefit analysis, and revised analysis of B61 LEP alternatives. Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) involves reducing the stockpile to the lowest level consistent with national security, dismantling warheads, and further breaking down components to prevent storage problems. The Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) program aims to reduce the nuclear weapons stockpile by dismantling warheads and breaking down components to prevent storage issues. The FY2011 budget request for WDD is $58.0 million, a decrease from the previous year due to reduced dismantlements and component dispositions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million, with $27.5 million allocated to restore weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex. Several components of WDD have been reassigned within DOE in recent years. The Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) program aims to reduce the nuclear weapons stockpile by dismantling warheads and breaking down components. The major activity for FY2009 was the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which converts plutonium pits to plutonium oxide for use in nuclear reactors. The Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) was transferred to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy in FY2008. The Waste Solidification Building (WSB) converts liquid wastes from PDCF and MFFF into solids for disposal off-site. The Waste Solidification Building (WSB) converts liquid wastes from PDCF and MFFF into solids for disposal off-site. The WSB account has been moved to the Fissile Materials Disposition Program within Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. Stockpile Services provides the foundation for the production capability and capacity within the nuclear security enterprise, with an FY2010 appropriation of $828.8 million and an FY2011 request of $941.5 million. The FY2010 appropriation was $828.8 million, with the FY2011 request at $941.5 million. The largest increase was for Plutonium Sustainment, aimed at maintaining technical skills and restoring the capability to build up to 10 pits per year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the request by $30.5 million and allocating funds for surveillance, plutonium sustainment, and weapons assembly at Pantex. These efforts provide specialized scientific knowledge and technical support. The Science Campaign at Pantex focuses on weapons assembly, disassembly, and dismantlement, providing specialized scientific knowledge and technical support for the nuclear weapons stockpile. It aims to improve warhead performance assessment, readiness for nuclear tests, and maintain scientific infrastructure. The campaign funds experimental facilities like the National Ignition Facility. The FY2011 request included five campaigns, with a focus on developing improved scientific capabilities for nuclear explosives. The FY2011 request for the Science Campaign at Pantex includes a focus on developing improved scientific capabilities for nuclear explosives. The campaign aims to assess the safety, security, reliability, and performance of the nuclear explosives package without underground testing. The Advanced Certification program will see a significant increase in funding to improve the weapons certification process and study system requirements. Experiments will be conducted at the Nevada Test Site and the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility to examine options for modernized surety. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the request for modernized surety by $10.9 million. $53.3 million is provided to the Z facility at Sandia for experiments on plutonium. The Z facility in Albuquerque releases a large amount of energy to study materials under high temperature and pressure, critical for nuclear stockpile safety. Engineering Campaign aims to improve nuclear explosive package safety and reliability throughout a weapon's lifetime. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the FY2011 appropriation for nuclear weapon safety and reliability by $8.0 million, with a focus on creating or simulating a nuclear environment. The Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign is developing tools to generate high temperatures and pressures in the laboratory. The Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign aims to create high temperatures and pressures in the laboratory to support weapons-related research and attract scientific talent. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the centerpiece of this campaign, utilizing high energy density physics experiments to validate theoretical models for stockpile certification without nuclear testing. NIF is the world's largest laser and allows access to thermonuclear burn conditions, a significant scientific achievement. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the world's largest laser, dedicated in May 2009. Scientists successfully fired 192 laser beams at a target, heating it to 6 million degrees Fahrenheit. This marked a significant advance in the $3.5 billion facility's work. The FY2010 appropriation was $457.9 million, with a $481.5 million request for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount and supported creating an independent advisory board for NIF experiments. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for the Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign at NIF, which develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons. Some analysts doubt the reliability of simulation for certifying warhead safety and advocate a return to testing. The campaign includes funds for hardware, operations, and software, with a FY2011 request of $615.7 million. The FY2010 appropriation for hardware and operations as well as software was $567.6 million, with a FY2011 request of $615.7 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount. The Readiness Campaign focuses on improving manufacturing safety and efficiency, with a current appropriation of $100.0 million for FY2010 and a request of $112.1 million for FY2011. The Stockpile Readiness subprogram within the campaign saw the largest dollar increase, with $5.7 million for FY2010 and a requested $18.9 million for FY2011, aimed at ensuring future manufacturing capabilities for weapon components containing special materials. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing Tritium Readiness funding from $50.2 million to $30.2 million for FY2011 due to technical challenges in tritium production at the Watts Bar reactor. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing Tritium Readiness funding for FY2011 due to technical challenges in tritium production at the Watts Bar reactor. The program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites with a total appropriation of $1,842.9 million for FY2010 and a request of $1,849.0 million for FY2011. It includes subprograms such as Operations of Facilities, Program Readiness, Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds for Operations of Facilities in FY2011 to fill gaps at Pantex and Y-12, avoiding layoffs and disruptions to dismantlement and life extension schedules. The committee also restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and expressed concerns about NNSA's fund usage for a replacement. The committee restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and expressed concern about NNSA's use of funds for a replacement facility for the Kansas City Plant. The most costly item in Construction, and among the most controversial in the Weapons Activities account, is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. It would replace the over 50-year-old Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building, which houses research into plutonium and supports pit production at Los Alamos. The House Appropriations Committee stated that proceeding with the CMRR project as currently designed will strongly prejudice any nuclear complex transformation plan. The CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory lacks a clear mission unless there is a decision to pursue new nuclear warhead design and production. The Senate Appropriations Committee highlighted safety concerns with the existing facility, while budget cuts may lead to delays in upgrading. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the need for critical decisions on the stockpile to determine the requirements for the nuclear weapons complex. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million for the CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory to address funding shortfalls and operational restrictions, while others argue that existing facilities could fulfill some of the work. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for various weapons activities, including Secure Transportation Asset and Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response, to address operational needs. The FY2010 appropriation for nuclear and radiological incidents worldwide was $221.9 million, with a $233.1 million request for FY2011. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) received $93.9 million in FY2010 and a $94.0 million request for FY2011. Site Stewardship, a new program for FY2010, had a $90.4 million request. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported all requested amounts. The FY2010 request for the security enterprise program was $90.4 million, with the FY2010 appropriation being $61.3 million. The Senate bill denied funding for the stewardship planning initiative due to poorly defined mission priorities. The Defense Nuclear Security element received $769.0 million in FY2010, with a request of $720.0 million for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the FY2011 request by $5.0 million. The FY2010 appropriation for Defense Nuclear Security operations and maintenance was $769.0 million, with a request of $720.0 million for FY2011. The reduction in funding is attributed to efficiencies in staffing levels and procurement. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $668.0 million for operations and maintenance, and $43.0 million for construction, citing uncertainties related to the CMRR project. Cyber Security aims to protect NNSA information assets, with an FY2010 appropriation of $122.5 million. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) implements security safeguards to protect its information assets. The FY2010 appropriation was $122.5 million, increasing to $124.3 million in FY2011. Nonproliferation and national security programs under NNSA received $2.137 billion in FY2010, up from $1.482 billion in FY2009, mainly due to the inclusion of major construction projects. The Obama Administration requested a further increase for FY2011. The Obama Administration requested increased funding for various programs under the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) for FY2011. This included funding for the Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program, Nonproliferation and International Security programs, International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A), and the Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production. The FY2011 request for these programs aimed to enhance international safeguards, export controls, treaties and agreements, and reduce the threat posed by unsecured Russian weapons and weapons-usable material. The Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production program, funded at $572.1 million in FY2010 and $590.1 million in FY2011, aims to persuade Russia to shut down nuclear reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium. Two reactors were shut down in 2008, with the third scheduled for closure in December 2010. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors, with funding of $24.5 million in FY2010 and no further funding requested for FY2011. The Obama Administration requested funding for the Fissile Materials Disposition program to convert surplus weapons plutonium into reactor fuel. The program included construction of a facility at Savannah River, SC, and collaboration with Russia. The FY2010 budget allocated $701.9 million for the program, with a focus on disposing of Russian surplus plutonium. The FY2011 request was $1,030.7 million to continue construction and research efforts. The FY2011 budget request was $1,030.7 million for the Savannah River project and $100 million for research on a gas-turbine modular helium reactor in Russia. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors to use low enriched uranium and protect nuclear materials. The FY2011 request for this program was $558.8 million. The Office of Environmental Management was established in 1989 for cleanup of nuclear weapons production facilities. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup activities at federal facilities involved in nuclear weapons production and research. Cleanup includes disposal of radioactive and hazardous wastes, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, and decommissioning of excess buildings. Cleanup is ongoing at larger and more complex facilities, with some expected to continue for several decades. As of FY2010, the Office administered 18 facilities for cleanup. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup activities at federal facilities involved in nuclear weapons production and research. Cleanup includes disposal of radioactive and hazardous wastes, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, and decommissioning of excess buildings. As of FY2010, the Office administered 18 facilities for cleanup, with estimated costs ranging between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion to complete cleanup at all remaining facilities. Additional funds may be needed for long-term activities to monitor contaminant levels and ensure the effectiveness of cleanup remedies. The Office of Environmental Management is responsible for cleanup activities at federal facilities involved in nuclear weapons production and research. Some facilities have been transferred to other offices within DOE and the Army Corps of Engineers. Congress directed the transfer of cleanup responsibility for smaller, less contaminated facilities to the Corps under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). Once cleanup is complete, the Corps handles activities for the first two years, after which jurisdiction is transferred back to DOE. The Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term operation and maintenance. The cleanup work at federal facilities involved in nuclear weapons production and research is completed, and jurisdiction is transferred back to the Department of Energy (DOE). The Office of Legacy Management administers long-term operation and maintenance activities at FUSRAP sites and facilities cleaned up under the Office of Environmental Management. Funding for the Office of Environmental Management comes from three appropriations accounts, with a total of $5.69 billion allocated in FY2011, which is a decrease from the President's request. In FY2011, the DOE's Office of Environmental Management received $5.69 billion, a decrease from the President's request. The enacted amount was $358 million below the request and $319 million below the FY2010 appropriation. P.L. 112-10 also rescinded $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years for the three accounts funding the office. The rescission of unobligated balances includes funds from various accounts at the DOE's Office of Environmental Management, with significant concerns about cleanup pace at nuclear weapons production facilities like Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. These facilities have complex cleanup challenges and represent the largest funding needs among DOE-managed facilities. Funding for Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory represents over half of the total funding for the Office of Environmental Management. Cleanup at these facilities may continue until 2062, 2040, and 2044 respectively due to the substantial volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored there. DOE estimates 54 million gallons at Hanford, 33 million gallons at Savannah River Site, and nearly 1 million gallons at Idaho National Laboratory. Treatment and disposal of these wastes are necessary before permanent disposal in a geologic repository. The high-level radioactive wastes at Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory need to be treated and disposed of before permanent disposal in a geologic repository. Concerns arise from delays in waste treatment facilities construction and potential environmental risks from untreated wastes. Some tanks at Hanford have leaked wastes into groundwater discharging into the Columbia River, prompting routine water quality monitoring. Funding for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities is also a growing concern. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to fund the cleanup of three uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. Congress authorized special assessments from nuclear utilities and payments from the U.S. Treasury to finance the fund. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to fund the cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities. Congress authorized payments from the U.S. Treasury and utility assessments for the fund. The authority for these payments expired in 2007, but Congress has continued funding through annual appropriations without separate reauthorizing legislation. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund has received federal payments through annual appropriations without separate reauthorizing legislation. The fund balance may not be enough to cover future cleanup costs, with $4.5 billion available in FY2010 compared to DOE's estimated $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion needs. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in FY2011 to increase cleanup resources. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in his FY2011 budget request to increase cleanup resources. OMB estimated $200 million in assessments for FY2011 and $2.2 billion over a 10-year period. Congress needs to enact reauthorizing legislation for the federal government to resume collection of the assessments. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced but not enacted for reauthorization. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstatement in its report on S. 3635. The President requested $730.5 million from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup in FY2011. In FY2011, the President requested $730.5 million from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup, with an assumption of $200 million in offsetting receipts from nuclear utility assessments. However, P.L. 112-10 only included $507.0 million in appropriations, a $223.5 million decrease from the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million, citing the lack of enacted legislation for the assessments. The committee noted a substantial existing balance in the fund exceeding the request by a few billion dollars. The committee highlighted that the existing balance in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund exceeded the request by billions of dollars. P.L. 112-10 allocated $33.6 million for the federal payment in FY2011, much lower than the President's request of $496.7 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a smaller federal payment to fulfill the required contribution under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which mandates DOE to cover cleanup costs even if the fund is depleted. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandates DOE to cover cleanup costs even if the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is depleted. Additional federal funds may be needed in the future for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities. Responsibility for long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management. This office also manages pensions and benefits for former contractor personnel. Funding for this office is within the Other Defense Activities Account. The Office of Legacy Management is funded within the Other Defense Activities Account. Funding needs are expected to increase as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term operation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $188.6 million for the Office in FY2011. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power generated by dams operated by federal agencies for water resource management purposes. PMAs prioritize \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and cooperatives, selling power at low rates to cover expenses and repay debt. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power generated by federal dams to \"preference customers\" at low rates to cover expenses and repay debt. The FY2011 budget request for PMAs was $118.5 million, a $4 million decrease from FY2010. SWPA and WAPA requested discretionary funding in addition to their receipts, while SEPA's receipts are expected to cover all operating costs in FY2011. The FY2011 budget requested $105.5 million for WAPA, with SEPA expected to offset operating costs. An additional $220,000 was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations. P.L. 112-10 appropriated the requested amount with a 0.2% rescission. BPA is self-funded and receives no appropriations, funding activities through borrowing authority increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003. ARRA further increased borrowing authority to $7.7 billion in bonds outstanding to the Treasury. The FY2011 budget proposed Bonneville accrue expenditures. The FY2011 budget proposed Bonneville accrue expenditures of $3.763 billion for operating expenses, $77 million for Projects Funded in Advance, $758 million for capital investments, and $387 million for capital transfers. ARRA provided $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to WAPA for activities authorized in section 402 of the act, along with borrowing authority for new or upgraded electric power transmission lines. The authority to borrow from the United States Treasury is now available to WAPA on a permanent basis, with a limit of $3.25 billion. WAPA has established a Transmission Infrastructure Program for this purpose. Independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The NRC requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, with major activities focusing on safety regulation and licensing of nuclear reactors. P.L. 112-10 provides $1.052.3 billion for NRC operations. The NRC's major activities include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors. The budget request for FY2011 included $272.5 million for new reactor activities, with an increase of $7.8 million from FY2010. Electric utilities and generating companies have applied for licenses for 30 reactors since 2007, with more possible through 2011. NRC's proposed FY2011 budget also included $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's projects. The NRC's FY2011 budget included $10 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. The Obama Administration wanted to cancel the project, leading to a motion to withdraw the license application. The requested amount was included in P.L. 112-10 for activities related to an orderly closure of Yucca Mountain licensing support. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included $531.6 million for regulating operating reactors, with activities such as safety inspections, license renewals, and security oversight. Homeland security spending within NRC was set to increase by $3.8 million. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees, excluding certain expenditures like waste repository licensing and homeland security. The FY2011 budget request includes offsets from the Nuclear Waste Fund for waste repository licensing, homeland security, and DOE defense waste oversight. The net appropriation would be $138.3 million, a decrease from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including the inspector general's office."
