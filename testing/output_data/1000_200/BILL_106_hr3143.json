The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, more than on books and computers combined. Educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy, and well-lit environment. Over half of K-12 schools are over 40 years old and need renovation for efficiency. Inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures are common issues in school buildings. Inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures in school buildings can affect students' performance. Inefficient water use is also common in older schools. A whole building approach in designing and renovating schools can lead to high-performance buildings and improve student and teacher performance. Adopting this approach usually results in significant improvements. Adopting a whole building approach in school construction can lead to lower life-cycle costs, energy conservation, and the use of renewable energy sources, resulting in improved student and teacher performance. Using environmentally preferable products and ensuring adequate fresh air supply further enhances building sustainability. The purpose of this Act is to assist school districts in creating high-performance, healthful, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound elementary and secondary school buildings. Most school districts lack knowledge of cutting-edge design and technologies for efficient school construction and renovations. Congress is considering legislation to support new school construction and existing school renovations. The Act aims to help school districts build sustainable and efficient school buildings. Congress is exploring legislation to support new construction and renovations. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements beyond 30 percent of the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code levels. Grants aim to support the purpose of the Act and promote participation in the program. The Energy Conservation Code provides grants to school districts for high performance school buildings if they demonstrate need and lack funds to respond to increasing enrollments or make renovations. Grants are also available for evaluating compliance with energy efficiency standards. Grants for administration under subsection (b)(2) can be used for evaluating compliance with requirements of the Energy Conservation Code, distributing information on high performance school buildings, organizing programs for school personnel, obtaining technical services for planning, and collecting data. Grants under subsection (b)(3) can be used for promoting high performance school buildings, facilitating financing, working with school administrations, students, and communities, and coordinating public benefit programs. Grants are provided to school districts with approved plans developed in consultation with State offices of energy and education. The State agency designated by the Governor develops feasible plans for grant purposes. School districts are encouraged to supplement grant funds with other sources for plan implementation. The State agency designated by the Governor develops feasible plans for grant purposes, and school districts are encouraged to supplement grant funds with other sources for plan implementation. Allocation of funds is specified in Section 4. Funds appropriated for this Act will be provided to Governors of States to determine the agency administering assistance to school districts. Allocation of funds under section 5: 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain funds to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program. The Governor-designated State agencies will receive $300,000 per year to coordinate and implement the Program for high-performance school buildings, including developing reference materials. SEC. 5. Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 3(b) includes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, increasing annually to $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding for the following 6 fiscal years. SEC. 6. Definitions. The Act defines \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It also defines \"high performance school building\" as one that maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, uses environmentally friendly materials, and enhances indoor quality. The Act defines \"renewable energy\" as energy from solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass sources."
