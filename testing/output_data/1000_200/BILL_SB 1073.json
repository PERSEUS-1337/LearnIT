    "title": "SB 1073",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow an earned income tax credit against the \"net tax\" for taxable years starting January 1, 2015. The credit amount is determined based on Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, with adjustments specified in the annual Budget Act. The earned income tax credit adjustment factor for taxable years starting January 1, 2015, is 0 percent unless specified in the annual Budget Act. The credit is only available when resources are allocated in the Budget Act for oversight and auditing. The credit percentage and phaseout percentage vary based on the number of qualifying children. The earned income tax credit percentages vary based on the number of qualifying children, with phaseout percentages ranging from 7.65% to 45%. The earned income amount and phaseout amount for eligible individuals are also specified based on the number of qualifying children. Certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code are modified for these calculations. Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code is modified to specify withholding requirements for earned income tax credit amounts. The place of abode is changed to \"this state\" instead of \"the United States.\" The earned income tax credit amount is increased to $3,400 from $2,200. In lieu of Section 32(j) of the Internal Revenue Code, for taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2016, the specified amounts will be recalculated annually. Any excess credit will be applied to other amounts due, with the remaining balance refunded to the taxpayer from the Tax Relief and Refund Account. The Franchise Tax Board can create rules for this section, refunds will be treated like federal earned income refunds for benefit eligibility, and exemptions apply for implementing the credit for the 2015 taxable year. The Franchise Tax Board must comply with various reporting requirements for the implementation of the California Earned Income Tax Credit to reduce poverty among working families and individuals. This includes incorporating scope, costs, and schedule changes in the Special Project Report for the Enterprise Data to Revenue Project. Annual reports are also required to measure the effectiveness of the credit by analyzing the number of tax returns claiming the credit. The Franchise Tax Board must report on the implementation of the California Earned Income Tax Credit, including the number of tax returns claiming the credit, individuals represented, average credit amount, distribution by dependents and income ranges, and estimates of families lifted out of deep poverty by the credit. The Franchise Tax Board will provide a report on the California Earned Income Tax Credit to various Senate and Assembly committees. The tax credit will be known as the California Earned Income Tax Credit and will apply to taxable years starting from January 1, 2016."
