    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gun Crime Enforcement and Second Amendment Restoration Act of 1996\". The Congress finds that protecting citizens from armed violent criminals is crucial for public safety. Banning specific firearms does not deter criminals, so the focus should be on arresting, convicting, and incarcerating them to prevent reoffending. The Attorney General must establish an armed violent criminal apprehension program within 180 days of this Act. Each US attorney must appoint a prosecutor and create a task force to remove armed violent criminals from the streets. The program should focus on severe punishment to deter armed violent crime and consider Federal and State laws for apprehension and prosecution.

Each US attorney must appoint a prosecutor and create a task force to address the nature and extent of violent crime in their district, while also considering limited Federal involvement in traditionally State and local prosecuted crimes. The Attorney General shall require monthly reports on the number of defendants charged with armed violent crimes. The Attorney General shall require US attorneys to report the number of defendants charged with violating specific sections of the United States Code. The Attorney General must submit a compilation of this information to Congress twice a year, along with a report on waivers granted. US attorneys can request waivers from the Attorney General for reporting requirements. The Attorney General may waive reporting requirements for US attorneys based on specific criteria such as the number of assistant attorneys and level of violent crime in the district.
