    "content": "One of the most controversial issues in U.S. foreign assistance is the debate over restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. The key questions revolve around whether recipients of U.S. assistance perform abortions or engage in coercive practices with U.S. funds, and the impact of withholding funds on population growth and reproductive health services in developing countries. Members of Congress have debated these issues in connection with U.S. abortion policy since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973. Debate over international abortion restrictions has intensified since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973, with Members of Congress introducing legislation to prohibit abortion and restrict federal funding for the practice. This controversy has extended to U.S. foreign assistance, leading to the enactment of abortion and family planning restrictions in foreign aid authorizations and appropriations. The \"Mexico City policy\" requires foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they won't promote abortion. It was rescinded by President Obama in 2009 and reinstated by President Trump in 2017. Debate on abortion and family planning restrictions continues in Congress. During the 115th Congress, Members debated abortion and family planning restrictions in foreign assistance. Some sought to modify language in State-Foreign Operations legislation, while others introduced bills to make the Mexico City policy permanent law. Federal funding for these activities remains controversial, with ongoing congressional interest. This report examines legislative and executive branch policies on U.S. funding for abortion and family planning abroad. The report discusses legislative and executive branch policies restricting U.S. funding for abortion and family planning abroad, including provisions in foreign aid authorizations and appropriations. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is highlighted as a key legislation in this area. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) is a key legislation that establishes, continues, or modifies foreign aid programs. It is divided into parts authorizing development assistance, military and security assistance, and other provisions. Congress has amended the FAA since 1961 but has not comprehensively reauthorized most programs since 1985. Authorization bills have faced challenges due to debates on controversial issues, tight legislative calendars, and foreign policy disputes. In recent years, foreign aid authorizations have often stalled in Congress due to debates on controversial issues, tight legislative calendars, and foreign policy disputes. Appropriations measures have become significant in influencing how U.S. foreign aid is disbursed, with many including family planning or abortion-related restrictions. The links among these requirements and restrictions are complex, with some amendments from the FAA appearing in other foreign assistance-related legislation. The curr_chunk discusses legislative restrictions on U.S. funding of abortion and requirements for voluntary family planning programs abroad. Various amendments, such as the Helms and Biden provisions, have been added to foreign assistance-related legislation for emphasis or to apply to additional categories of aid. The Leahy amendment clarifies terms, while the Livingston amendment clarifies prohibitions. These restrictions are listed chronologically by year enacted. The Helms amendment, enacted in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to coerce individuals. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. The Helms amendment, enacted in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or coercion. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA, including development assistance. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes the Helms amendment in two sections, ensuring that foreign assistance activities are not used for involuntary sterilizations or coercion. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes provisions prohibiting the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for involuntary sterilizations or coercion. This restriction has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations since FY1979. Since FY1979, annual foreign operations appropriations have included an abortion restriction on Peace Corps funding, prohibiting the use of funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. Medical evacuation costs for Peace Corps volunteers seeking abortions are covered by the organization. The Peace Corps covers the cost of evacuation for volunteers needing abortions in locations where it is legally permissible. The Biden amendment prohibits the use of funds for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization. The Siljander amendment, included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, prohibits the use of U.S. funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds for lobbying on abortion. In 1985, Congress enacted a provision specifying that U.S. funding for family planning projects must offer a range of services to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act prohibits funds for lobbying on abortion in developing nations. Since 1985, family planning projects funded by the act must offer a variety of services to reduce reliance on abortion. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes provisions prohibiting funds for abortion-related activities in foreign countries. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, restricts funding if it violates abortion or involuntary sterilization amendments. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits funding for organizations or programs involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. This measure was adopted due to concerns about the UNFPA's program in China. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits funding for organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since FY1985. The provision applies to any organization supporting coercive practices, with a determination made only regarding UNFPA. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes this provision, requiring determinations within 6 months of enactment, accompanied by evidence. The United States has not contributed to UNFPA in 16 of the past 34 years due to violations in China. The Kemp-Kasten amendment prohibits funding for organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The Obama Administration supported funding for UNFPA, emphasizing its commitment to international family planning and women's health. However, the Trump Administration halted funding to UNFPA due to concerns about its program in China. Congress has imposed conditions on U.S. funding for UNFPA, including in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act imposes conditions on U.S. funding for UNFPA, including funds being transferred to Global Health Programs for family planning activities, restrictions on funds for UNFPA in China, and a requirement for UNFPA not to fund abortions to receive U.S. funding. The Secretary of State must report on dollar-for-dollar withholding of funds to the committees on appropriations. The Secretary must report funds budgeted by UNFPA for a China program within four months of the act. If funds are allocated, they will be deducted from UNFPA's budget for the rest of the fiscal year. In 1986, an amendment prohibited discrimination based on religious beliefs for natural family planning grants under the Foreign Assistance Act. The Livingston amendment ensures that the United States cannot discriminate against organizations that support natural family planning methods when awarding family planning grants, as long as they comply with the DeConcini amendment. This provision is included in foreign operations appropriations, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Leahy amendment clarifies language in the Helms amendment regarding family planning assistance, addressing concerns about violating the Helms amendment by providing information or counseling on legal pregnancy options. Introduced in 1994, it is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Helms amendment prohibits the use of funds for family planning assistance that could be seen as promoting abortion. However, a recent version clarifies that providing information or counseling on all pregnancy options is allowed. This amendment has been included in various foreign operations appropriations acts since its inception. The Tiahrt amendment, enacted in October 1998, directs voluntary family planning projects supported by the United States to comply with specific requirements, including not implementing quotas or numerical targets for births or family planning acceptors. The Tiahrt amendment prohibits the payment of incentives for family planning acceptors and the implementation of quotas for births or acceptors of family planning methods. Projects must also provide comprehensive information on the health benefits and risks of chosen methods. The project must provide family planning acceptors with information on health benefits and risks of chosen methods, including potential risks and benefits of experimental contraceptive drugs and devices. The Administrator must report violations to the Committees on Appropriations. In response to reports of forced sterilizations in Peru, Representative Tiahrt introduced an amendment to ensure U.S. foreign assistance did not support such practices. USAID issued guidance on implementing the Tiahrt requirements for voluntary family planning projects in April 1999. The Tiahrt amendment, aimed at preventing U.S. foreign assistance from supporting forced sterilizations, has been implemented in various countries. USAID conducted audits to ensure compliance, with no further violations found. The amendment was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, applying to family planning assistance. The Mexico City policy, also known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in voluntary abortion activities. This policy has been implemented and reversed by the executive branch, with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposing it. The Trump Administration recently expanded the policy to include all global health assistance. The Mexico City policy, first issued by President Reagan in 1984, restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in abortion activities. Republicans support the policy, while Democrats oppose it. The Trump Administration recently expanded the policy to include all global health assistance. The Mexico City policy, initiated by President Reagan in 1984, restricts U.S. family planning aid to foreign NGOs engaged in abortion-related activities. NGOs had to certify they wouldn't promote abortion to receive USAID funds. President George H.W. Bush upheld the policy, President Clinton rescinded it in 1993, and President George W. Bush reinstated and expanded it in 2001 and 2003. Exceptions were allowed under President Bush's administration. President Bush reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy in 2001 and 2003 to include all assistance for voluntary population planning provided to foreign NGOs by the State Department. President Obama revoked the policy in 2009, citing overly broad conditions on grants and assistance awards. President Trump reinstated the policy in 2017, following President Bush's original memorandum. In January 2017, President Trump reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy to include global health assistance, directing that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The policy, named \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" applies to about $8.8 billion in international health programs. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy, approved in May 2017, applies to $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs. It excludes assistance to governments and humanitarian activities, with exemptions for certain cases like rape and conditions threatening the mother's life. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy, implemented in May 2017, includes exemptions for rape, incest, and life-threatening conditions for the mother. A six-month review by the Trump Administration in May 2018 acknowledged challenges in implementing the policy, with some recipients refusing to agree to its terms. One key challenge identified was the need to improve understanding of the policy's intent, implementation, compliance, and oversight. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy, implemented in May 2017, includes exemptions for rape, incest, and life-threatening conditions for the mother. A review in May 2018 acknowledged challenges in implementing the policy, with some recipients seeking clarification on certain terms related to PLGHA. USAID issued Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization in September 1982 to ensure protection of individuals' needs and rights in funded services. PD-3 outlines requirements for informed consent in voluntary sterilization services. USAID voluntary sterilization services must adhere to guidelines such as informed consent, ready access to other family planning methods, and no incentive payments. These requirements aim to ensure that individuals freely choose sterilization without financial inducements. The guidelines for voluntary sterilization services include no financial incentives for one method over another. Payments to service acceptors, providers, and referral agents must be reasonable and based on country-specific circumstances. Acceptors may receive compensation for extra expenses, providers for per-case payment and related costs, and referral agents for informing or referring clients. PD-3 guidelines apply to family planning assistance funded by USAID for voluntary sterilization activities, covering U.S. NGOs, foreign NGOs, public international organizations, and governments. Referral agents may receive per-case payment for informing or referring clients."
