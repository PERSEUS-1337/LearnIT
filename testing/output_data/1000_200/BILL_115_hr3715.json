The Act defines \"catastrophic event\" as any natural disaster or fire, flood, or explosion, and \"conclusion\" as including containment of the event. It also defines \"National Scenic Area\" as an area with outstanding natural, scenic, and recreational values. The Secretary, designated as the Secretary of Agriculture, must promptly propose response activities within 30 days after a catastrophic event in a National Scenic Area. Response activities include salvage operations or reforestation to address conditions caused by the event. Public input is part of the response process.

Public input is allowed for 30 days, objections can be filed within 15 days, and the agency must respond within 15 days. An expedited environmental assessment is required for response activities. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires response activities in a National Scenic Area to be completed within 60 days of a catastrophic event. A categorical exclusion is available for response activities that do not exceed 10,000 acres and meet specific criteria outlined in the management plan for the area.

Expedited consultation is necessary for activities not covered by the exemption. Consultation under the Endangered Species Act must be concluded within 90 days of the request. If not completed within this timeframe, the activity may proceed without violating the Act. Prohibition on restraining orders and preliminary injunctions is also in place.
