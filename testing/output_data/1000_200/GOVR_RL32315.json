Conflict arises between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on public lands. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands, reflecting Energy Task Force recommendations. Oil and gas development practices have sparked debate in Congress since the early years of the industry, with concerns about abuse of the Mining Law of 1872. President Taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California in 1909, leading to the Pickett Act of 1910. The Pickett Act of 1910 recognized executive branch authority to withdraw public lands, leading to the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 which placed oil and gas under a leasing system. This system has generated billions in revenue for the federal government. Split-estate situations arise when minerals are owned by the federal government under privately held lands, creating various ownership scenarios. The federal government can issue patents for land but reserve mineral rights, making the mineral estate dominant over surface rights. Specific policies must be followed for mineral development, including obtaining consent from surface owners or paying for damages. Split-estate situations exist on public lands, with Wyoming and Montana having high percentages. Environmentalists support land withdrawals and restrictions. Environmentalists and ranchers express concerns about the impact of oil and gas development on water and land. Development supporters argue that existing environmental laws regulate development on public lands, including the National Environmental Policy Act and various other federal and state regulations. The proposed conference report on a comprehensive energy bill addresses industry concerns over delays in drilling on leased lands. It includes establishing a White House Office of Federal Project Coordination to expedite permitting on public lands. Environmentalists argue these provisions could harm the environment and limit land use. The conference report on the energy bill addresses industry concerns over drilling delays on leased lands. It has been approved by the House but not in the Senate due to a cloture motion. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is pending action. The report provides an overview of the oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands, including permitting, production, and reserves. It discusses the contribution of onshore oil and gas to U.S. energy demand and estimates of reserves in restricted areas. An Appendix gives historical background on land withdrawal from mineral development and the role of the Bureau of Land Management in oil and gas development. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) oversees oil and gas development on federal public lands through Resource Management Plans (RMPs). Tracts with oil and gas potential are offered for competitive leasing quarterly, with a drilling permit required for each well. In FY2002, 1,765 new oil and gas leases were issued on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres. Industry has raised concerns about the lengthy process. In FY2002, the federal government issued 1,765 new oil and gas leases on public lands totaling about 1.4 million acres. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) must consider environmental impacts during land-use planning when Resource Management Plans (RMPs) are developed and implemented under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA). RMPs cover large areas and reflect diverse uses such as timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. Impacts of various uses are identified early in the process for equitable consideration. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) develops Resource Management Plans (RMPs) under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) to consider environmental impacts and diverse uses like timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. RMPs weigh impacts and benefits of public lands to serve the community, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and allowing public participation. The BLM determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing through competitive bidding auctions held quarterly. The objective is to provide a \"fair market value\" return to the federal government for its resources. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) holds competitive bidding auctions quarterly to lease lands with oil and gas potential, aiming to provide a \"fair market value\" return to the federal government. If no bids meet the $2/acre minimum, noncompetitive leasing is offered within 30 days. Noncompetitive tracts are available for two years, with priority given to simultaneous lease applications filed after the competitive sale. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM, excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. Exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM, excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. The permittee must file a notice of intent with the BLM and comply with specific practices and procedures outlined by the surface managing agency. Once a lease is obtained, the lessee has exclusive rights to further explore, develop, and produce on the land. An Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must be approved for each oil and gas well, following the Mineral Leasing Act guidelines. The APD form 3160-3 must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage evidence. The surface use plan details drillpad location, construction, waste disposal, and reclamation plans. BLM consults with the surface managing agency and notifies the applicant within 5 days after the 30-day review period. The application must be processed within 35 days and can be approved, approved with stipulations, rejected, or delayed. Final action expectations are communicated to the applicant. The approval process for drilling permits can be delayed due to the need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) to accommodate increased surface disturbance from new activities. This revision process, required under FLPMA section 1712, involves public input and can contribute to delays in issuing drilling permits. The approval process for drilling permits can be delayed due to the need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) under FLPMA section 1712, involving public input and leading to delays in issuing permits. Testimony before the House Committee on Resources highlighted that rewriting RMPs can now take up to three years, compared to less than one year a decade ago. The usefulness of an RMP is now estimated at seven years. The approval process for drilling permits can be delayed due to the need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) under FLPMA section 1712. The Association argues that RMPs now take up to three years to rewrite, compared to less than one year a decade ago. The usefulness of an RMP is estimated at seven years, with some plans lasting up to 20 years in the past. Environmentalists argue that 20-year-old plans are not suitable for current land management decisions. The BLM announced new strategies in April 2003 to expedite the permit process. In April 2003, BLM announced strategies to expedite the APD process, including processing multiple permit applications together, implementing area development planning, establishing standard operating agreements, and promoting consistent procedures for oil and gas leasing on public lands. Land availability for leasing is categorized as open under standard terms, open with restrictions, or closed due to withdrawals, including wilderness areas and national parks. Some federal lands are closed to oil and gas leasing due to land withdrawals, including wilderness areas, national parks, and environmentally sensitive areas. Approximately 165 million acres have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale, while some areas may be opened in the future based on administrative decisions. Approximately 700 million acres of federal lands are subject to mineral development restrictions, with 182 million acres requiring approval from surface management agencies. Lands in the National Park System, Wilderness Preservation System, and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are among those withdrawn from leasing. Public lands open to leasing may have restrictions such as no surface occupancy or timing limitations to protect wildlife. Some leasing restrictions on federal lands include no surface occupancy, timing limitations to protect wildlife, and controlled surface use with mitigation plans. Industry argues that these restrictions hinder exploration and limit reserves, while environmental groups support the withdrawals for conservation purposes. The Rocky Mountain region is a focal point for U.S. oil and gas policy due to its significant natural gas and crude oil projections on public lands. Environmental groups support withdrawals for conservation purposes, while industry argues that restrictions hinder exploration and limit reserves. The Rocky Mountain region is a key area for U.S. oil and gas policy. Recent reports by the National Petroleum Council (NPC), Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments (EPCA), and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) have studied restrictions on natural gas in the region. Despite differences in resource base, the amount of natural gas on federal lands open to development was similar across the studies. The amount of natural gas on federal lands in the Rocky Mountain region is similar across three studies. The NPC study shows a resource base of 335 tcf, EIA estimates 293.6 tcf, and EPCA found 138.5 tcf in major geologic basins. The percentage of closed and restricted natural gas is comparable in all studies, with differences in the amount open for leasing. The EIA data shows that 11.5% of natural gas is closed and 37% is restricted, with differences in the amount open for leasing between studies. The EPCA study found that 63% of proven reserves on federal lands are open under standard lease terms, potentially increasing if Rocky Mountain reserves were included. Oil resources in the Rocky Mountains have less significance compared to U.S. oil supply, with about 600 million barrels of oil examined in the study. The EPCA study examined oil resources in the Rocky Mountains, finding that about 600 million barrels fall under \"no access\" category. Another 3.2 billion barrels would be available for leasing, with one-third having restrictions. Additionally, 2.5 billion barrels are estimated to be available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The numbers in the study are based on a selective area of the Rockies, resulting in smaller figures compared to other reports. The EIA and NPC studies suggest that developing natural gas in restricted land categories could face costly delays. The EIA report indicates that with greater flexibility in federal regulations, 29 tcf of gas could become immediately available, and removing certain lease stipulations could make 51 tcf less costly to develop, totaling 80 tcf. Environmental groups argue that relaxing these restrictions would have ecological consequences. The Rocky Mountain region has substantial natural gas resources, with 41% of it currently closed or restricted. There are disagreements on the importance of these reserves in meeting U.S. energy needs, and relaxing development restrictions could pose environmental risks. The United States has a significant natural gas resource base, with estimates suggesting that the Rocky Mountain region alone could last 20-30 years if production restrictions were lifted. Currently, U.S. natural gas demand is met by various sources, including the outer continental shelf, imports, and other onshore regions. Testimony from The Wilderness Society suggests that the U.S. has enough natural gas supply to meet domestic needs for the next 40 years. Based on estimates, the U.S. has a significant natural gas resource base that could last for the next 40 years. The National Petroleum Council (NPC) suggests that there are ample natural gas resources available for development, with 1,351 trillion cubic feet potentially accessible in the future. However, around 16% of this resource is subject to restrictions that may hinder development, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region where 70 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is under restriction or lease stipulations. The NPC argues that resolving these impediments could ensure timely access to this gas. The NPC suggests resolving impediments to ensure timely access to natural gas resources, proposing relaxing land-use constraints for more drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west. The RAND Corporation emphasizes focusing on the reserve category of the resource base for access restrictions. RAND's view is that access restrictions should be considered only for the most viable resource category. Total U.S. oil production is forecasted to decline, with oil imports estimated to make up 65% of total supply in 2025. Federal onshore oil production accounted for 5.4% of all U.S. oil production in 2002. Oil production from federal onshore leases accounted for 5.4% of all U.S. oil production in 2002, with Wyoming, New Mexico, and California being the top three producing states. Production has declined over the past decade, dropping from 133.5 million barrels in 1992 to around 100 million barrels in 2002. U.S. natural gas production fluctuated between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002, with projections suggesting an increase to 20-24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are expected to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010 before falling to 2.6 tcf in 2025 due to declining Canadian gas production. Forecasts for Canadian natural gas in 2025 were adjusted downward due to declining production, increased domestic use for oil sands, and uncertain offshore supplies. Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) were projected to rise significantly. U.S. gas production on public lands increased to 2.2 tcf in 2002, with New Mexico and Wyoming being the top producers. Federal onshore oil and gas production in the U.S. is expected to remain stable. The U.S. accounted for 85% of total domestic oil and gas production in 2002. Proved U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels, with Texas leading in reserves. U.S. oil reserves declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years. Discoveries in 2001 were three times greater than the average annual discovery since 1976. The discovery of oil in 2001 was three times higher than the average annual discovery since 1976. In 2002, discoveries were about 950 million barrels, slightly above the annual average since 1976. The United States still has significant oil reserves, but production rates are expected to decline in the long term. The technically recoverable onshore and state offshore oil resources are estimated at 92 billion barrels. Gas reserves in the United States have increased by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have risen to 17% from 9% in 1991. Annual discoveries have increased by 70% above the average since 1976. Technically recoverable gas resources are estimated to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the current proved reserves. Two-thirds of onshore natural gas is on nonfederal land. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment estimates 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources. The Rocky Mountain West has significant undiscovered oil and gas resources, with over 90% of the gas classified as unconventional. Proven reserves in the region show that oil and natural gas liquids on public lands account for over half, while natural gas accounts for over 60%. Federal onshore oil is estimated to be 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, and natural gas on public lands is estimated to be 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, and undiscovered conventional natural gas resources are estimated at 319.7 trillion cubic feet. The estimate for undiscovered conventional oil is 30.1 billion barrels and for undiscovered conventional natural gas resources is 319.7 trillion cubic feet. Coalbed methane gas is trapped in coalbeds and extraction involves removing water to release the gas. Concerns about groundwater contamination have been raised due to the varying quality of water pumped out of coal beds. The production of coalbed methane (CBM) involves allowing water and gas to move out of the coal. Water quality and disposal are central concerns, with various methods such as surface discharge or subsurface injection being used. A tax credit in 1980 incentivized CBM development, leading to a significant increase in production since 1987. In 2002, CBM accounted for 8% of natural gas production in the US, with 10,000 CBM wells producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day. Leading producers are in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. In 2002, there were 10,000 CBM wells in the United States producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day. Production rates vary due to the geology of coalbeds. Out of the estimated 700 tcf of coalbed methane in the US, only about 100 tcf are economically recoverable. CBM reserves have more than doubled since 1991, with leading producers in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. Coalbed methane proved reserves were 18.5 tcf in 2001, accounting for 10% of U.S. dry gas reserves. Colorado and New Mexico hold over half of U.S. CBM reserves, with significant reserves also in Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama. The San Juan Basin is the most productive, while the Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive. USGS estimates CBM resources in the Powder River Basin at 39 tcf, with most production taking place on private lands. Surface use agreements between surface owners and mineral lessees or owners in Wyoming are a central concern, with stakeholders establishing the Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative in 2002 to address conflicts. Environmental concerns regarding coalbed methane (CBM) production focus on land and water issues, including disturbances from wells, access roads, and power lines. Environmental concerns related to coalbed methane (CBM) production primarily revolve around land disturbance and water issues, including surface and groundwater impacts. The process involves wells, access roads, power lines, compressor stations, and waste water impoundments, with major issues being surface infrastructure, water removal, effects on the water table, salinity levels, and disposal of water that may affect wildlife and surface water resources. Hydraulic fracturing for CBM production has raised concerns about the potential impact of injected fluids, such as diesel fuel, on underground drinking water. While a draft EPA report found no evidence of contamination from CBM hydraulic fracturing, concerns remain about the use of diesel fuel due to its chemical constituents. The EPA expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel in CBM hydraulic fracturing due to its chemical constituents. An agreement was made to end the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid. Proposed energy legislation may prohibit EPA regulation of fluid injection for hydraulic fracturing. Dennis Hemmer noted that water from CBM production may seep into underground aquifers, potentially polluting drinking water wells with sodium-tainted water. CBM production results in water discharges of 602 million barrels annually, with concerns about pollution of drinking water wells, depletion of underground aquifers, loss of natural vegetation, and threats to wildlife habitats. Holding ponds used for wastewater treatment are unlined and may leak into groundwater, impacting water sources for wildlife. CBM production impacts water quality and wildlife habitats. BLM requires monitoring wells for CBM leases to assess water quality and levels. IBLA invalidated leases due to insufficient environmental evaluations. EA for Powder River Basin aids in decision-making. Supplemental environmental assessments were prepared for the Powder River Basin to determine CBM development in approved leasing areas. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM to withdraw leases due to violations of an IBLA ruling. BLM halted lease sales on public lands with high CBM content until the IBLA ruling was clarified. The Wyoming BLM office finalized a new EA and RMP, anticipating approving 39,000 permits for new wells over a 10-year period. Demand for oil is forecasted to rise 1.6% annually to 28 mbd by 2025, with imports projected to reach nearly 65%. U.S. demand for natural gas is expected to rise 1.4% annually, reaching 31.4 tcf by 2025. The outlook for increased oil and natural gas production from U.S. public lands is mixed. The Bush Administration has initiated actions to ease restrictions on public lands for natural gas production, facing opposition and challenges. Conventional natural gas production is expected to remain steady, while unconventional natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region is forecasted to increase its share by 2025. Natural gas production in the Rocky Mountain region is expected to increase its share to 43% by 2025, up from 32% in 2002. Industry seeks greater access to federal lands for drilling, while environmental concerns focus on potential damage to sensitive lands and wildlife habitats. The US will rely on a mix of domestic output, imports, and LNG from stable countries to meet energy demand. The Rocky Mountain region could contribute up to 40% of US natural gas production by 2025. Additionally, a proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms worldwide continue exploration and development for the best return on investment, considering factors like political stability and resource base. The United States is attractive for investment, but environmental and societal impacts must be considered in public land use decisions. Lease terms include maximum acreage, bonus bid, term length, and bond requirements for competitive and noncompetitive leases. The onshore leasing program in the United States offers noncompetitive leases with terms including maximum acreage of 10,240 acres, no minimum bonus bid, a 10-year term, $75 application filing fee, and a $10,000 bond requirement. Rentals for noncompetitive leases are set at $1.50/acre for 1-5 years and $2/acre each year thereafter, with a royalty of at least 12.5% on production. Revenues from the program are collected by the Minerals Management Service and distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs, excluding Alaska. The Interior Department distributes revenues from federal oil and gas leases to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. States receive 50% of revenues, except Alaska which receives 90%. The number of federal oil and gas leases was 23,000 in 2001, covering over 17 million acres of federal public lands. The National Park System was established in 1916 to conserve natural and historic objects in national parks. The National Park System (NPS) was created in 1916 to conserve natural and historic objects in national parks. Early tension arose between conservationists promoting National Parks and utilitarians promoting National Forests. The focus of the public lands withdrawal debate in the early 1900s was on the authority of the Commander-in-Chief to make withdrawal orders based on national security. The lands withdrawal debate centered on the President's authority to order withdrawals of specific parcels of land for various activities. Presidents have historically exercised the power to withdraw or reserve lands, such as establishing military reservations. Withdrawals have also occurred under specific acts like the Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934. National monuments can be created by the executive branch through statutory delegation under the Antiquities Act, reserving the \"smallest area compatible with the proper care and management\" of protected sites on federal lands. The Taylor Grazing Act withdrew 140 million acres from homesteading laws, while the Organic Act regulated and designated recreation and \"primitive areas.\" Congressional designations as \"wilderness\" were later considered essential for land withdrawals. Under FLPMA, withdrawals can be made by the executive branch or Congress, with wilderness designations considered essential for permanent protection. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act withdrew large areas of Alaska from resource use pending congressional disposition. The Wilderness Act required the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability. Wilderness is defined as off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. Currently, there are four types of withdrawal, with Congress having sole authority in some cases. The Wilderness Act and Acts of Congress govern withdrawals of public lands. Congress has sole authority for creating National Parks and wilderness areas. The executive branch can withdraw lands under the Antiquities Act and Pickett Act. Congress may withdraw specific resources like oil and gas. Modern executive withdrawals are governed by FLPMA, which promotes multiple-use land planning. Under FLPMA, withdrawals of public lands can be temporary or permanent and require congressional approval for parcels exceeding 5,000 acres. Withdrawals can last for 20 years and must be submitted to Congress with detailed reasons, economic and environmental effects, alternatives, and consultation with other agencies. Under FLPMA, withdrawals of public lands can be temporary or permanent and require congressional approval for parcels exceeding 5,000 acres. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals for up to three years. A review of public land withdrawals in 11 Western states is mandated to determine the continuation of existing withdrawals. BLM is prioritizing the review of approximately 70 million withdrawn acres. BLM is reviewing approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, prioritizing about 26 million acres for potential return or multiple use. As of November 2000, 7 million acres have been reviewed, with withdrawals on over 6 million acres revoked. Retention of a withdrawal requires a compelling show of need and approval from BLM Director and the Secretary. The review process will continue over the next few years. The review process for approximately 70 million withdrawn acres by BLM is ongoing, with about 26 million acres prioritized for potential return or multiple use. Withdrawals on over 6 million acres have been revoked, with some lands possibly developed for oil and gas resources while others will likely remain closed or restricted. The process must be supported by documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)."
