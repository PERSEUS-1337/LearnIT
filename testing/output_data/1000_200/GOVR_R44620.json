    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a therapeutic drug or vaccine made from living organisms like human, animal, yeast, or microorganisms. It consists of proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, or cells used in transplantation. Biosimilars are similar but not identical to brand-name biologics. Generic drugs are chemically identical to their reference brand-name drugs. Generic drugs are chemically identical to brand-name drugs, while biologic drugs are more complex and larger in molecular structure. For example, aspirin has a simple structure compared to Remicade, which has thousands of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, was FDA approved in 2016. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs through the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). CBER oversees traditional biologics, vaccines, blood products, gene therapy products, and cellular therapy products. The FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates traditional biologics, gene therapy products, cellular therapy products, and human tissue used in transplantation. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) oversees prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics. Monoclonal antibodies are an example of therapeutic biologics regulated by CDER. Monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, and immunomodulators are all types of therapeutic biologics used in treating various diseases like cancer, infections, and autoimmune disorders. Monoclonal antibodies like infliximab are used for conditions such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Cytokines, such as interleukins and interferons, help regulate the immune system. Growth factors like somatropin control cell division and survival. Enzymes play a role in cell functions and can be targeted in cancer treatment. Immunomodulators like vaccines can stimulate or suppress the immune system to fight diseases. Biologics, including immunomodulators, require special handling and are often administered via injection or infusion. They are referred to as specialty drugs due to their high cost, with some medications costing annually. The cost of specialty drugs, such as biologics like Soliris and Vimizim, can exceed $250,000 per patient annually. Spending on biologics in the United States reached $105.5 billion in 2016, with a 13% increase from the previous year. Biologics spending has been increasing by 10% each year since 2011, driven by increases in Medicare Part B program spending. In the Medicare Part B program, spending on biologics has been increasing significantly, growing by 13.3% annually between 2006 and 2014. Biologics accounted for 63% of prescription drug spending in 2014. Biologics are more expensive in the US compared to Europe and Canada, where the introduction of biosimilars has led to price reductions. Congress has made efforts to lower drug prices, including the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act and similar approaches for biologics in 2010. The 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act allowed FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, lowering drug costs by 60-90%. Generic drugs save costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allowed FDA approval of generic drugs, reducing costs for brand-name manufacturers. Generic drugs must demonstrate sameness to the original product to be approved. The biotechnology industry was developing biologics like human insulin and growth hormone during this time. The FDA approved the first human drug developed by the biotechnology industry in 1982, followed by several others in the subsequent years. Biological products are regulated by the FDA through a biologics license application, while chemical prescription drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs. The Hatch-Waxman Act provided a mechanism for generic drug approval under the FFDCA, but not for follow-on biologics/biosimilars under the PHSA. Companies were limited in submitting follow-on biologics applications for FDA review. Insulin was regulated as a drug under the FFDCA in the 1940s. The FDA was given authority over insulin marketing, which is a small protein regulating sugar metabolism. Insulin, along with a few other biological products, was regulated as drugs under the FFDCA instead of as biologics under the PHSA. The market competition for specialty biologic drug products was limited due to FDA's lack of clear regulatory authority for biosimilars. While some advocated for FDA to establish a regulatory system, the Biotechnology Industry Organization filed a petition against it. In contrast, Europe had fewer barriers for marketing biosimilars, with the first product authorized in 2006. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorized the first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, a human growth hormone, in 2006. In the United States, FDA approval for Omnitrope was granted in 2006 after a court ruling in favor of Sandoz, the sponsor. The 505(b)(2) pathway was used for approval. The FDA approved Omnitrope using the 505(b)(2) pathway in 2006. Congress later established a new regulatory authority for biosimilar products in 2010 through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. The FDA gained authority to approve biosimilar products through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, part of the Affordable Care Act. This allows for the approval of products that are highly similar to reference products with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. The FDA requires biosimilar products to demonstrate interchangeability with reference products in terms of clinical results and risk of alternating use. Interchangeable products can be substituted by pharmacists without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. FDA released draft guidance documents in February 2012 after a public meeting in November 2010 to gather perspectives from industry and the general public. The FDA released draft guidance documents in February 2012 after a public meeting in November 2010 to gather perspectives from industry and the general public. The agency has also released final guidance on biosimilars and additional guidance on related topics. Companies interested in marketing biosimilar products in the US must submit an application demonstrating biosimilarity through analytical, animal, and clinical studies. The FDA requires companies to submit applications demonstrating biosimilarity through analytical, animal, and clinical studies for marketing biosimilar products in the US. Any changes to the approved manufacturing process must be demonstrated for comparability to ensure product quality and safety. Brand-name biologics like Remicade underwent multiple manufacturing changes, each requiring a comparability demonstration. The FDA has approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the United States, but the launch of some, like Erelzi, Amjevita, and Cyltezo, is being delayed by patent infringement lawsuits from brand-name manufacturers. Sales of five biosimilars have been impacted by actions of brand-name manufacturers, with Pfizer suing Johnson & Johnson for allegedly using anticompetitive tactics to prevent insurers from choosing biosimilar Inflectra over brand-name biologic Remicade. Biosimilar Inflectra has sued Johnson & Johnson for allegedly using anticompetitive tactics to prevent insurers from covering it, impacting sales of other biosimilars. The FDA approved seven biosimilars between March 2015 and October 2017, with high costs leading to interest in the government's role in drug development. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio, the first biosimilar in the US, marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is similar to Neupogen by Amgen Inc. In April 2016, FDA approved Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade by Janssen Biotech. In April 2016, FDA approved Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade (infliximab), made by Janssen Biotech, Inc. Pfizer began marketing Inflectra in the US at a price 15% below Remicade. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J alleging anticompetitive practices. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J in September 2017, accusing them of anticompetitive practices with exclusionary contracts that block coverage for Inflectra and other biosimilars. J&J allegedly threatened to withhold rebates from insurers to favor their brand-name drug, Remicade, over Pfizer's biosimilar. The rebate trap in the battle between brand-name and biosimilar manufacturers is explained in a June 2017 JAMA article. If a biosimilar manufacturer offers a price discount to insurers, the branded manufacturer can respond by withdrawing rebates, doubling costs for patients on the branded biologic. Even with a 60% lower price for the biosimilar, if only 50% of patients switch, payer costs increase due to the rebate trap. Strategies to reduce biologic spending must avoid falling into this trap. The rebate trap in the battle between brand-name and biosimilar manufacturers can lead to increased payer costs if patients do not switch to the biosimilar. Pfizer's lawsuit highlighted that providers have been hesitant to purchase Inflectra, even for patients covered by insurance plans that include the product. This reluctance has resulted in a low adoption rate of Inflectra among healthcare providers. Pfizer's lawsuit against J&J highlights the low adoption rate of Inflectra among healthcare providers, with only 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the US. J&J's anticompetitive practices could set a precedent for biologic originator firms to maintain dominance against biosimilar competition, according to the lawsuit. J&J has raised the list price of Remicade and increased government reimbursements, leading to concerns about competition in the market. In response to Pfizer's lawsuit, J&J's president stated that Pfizer has failed to demonstrate sufficient value with Remicade. FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi, which is biosimilar to Enbrel. Enbrel is one of the top-selling drugs in the world. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, received FDA approval. Clinical data confirms its similarity to the reference product. Marketing release delayed due to a lawsuit by Amgen against Sandoz. The FDA approved Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, confirming its similarity to the reference product. However, the marketing release is delayed due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz and its parent company Novartis. Humira (adalimumab) is a top-selling drug globally and in the United States. Amjevita may not be available until 2018 due to patent litigation. FDA approved Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, in April 2017. Renflexis is made by Samsung Bioepsis and launched in partnership with Merck in the US. Samsung partnered with Merck to launch Renflexis in the US, a biosimilar to Remicade, at a 35% lower price. FDA approved Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI for patent infringement. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against Boehringer Ingelheim for patent infringement on Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira. FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin, manufactured by Amgen. Avastin is a top-selling drug in the US. The Purple Book lists biological products, including biosimilars. Neupogen\u00ae is the proprietary name for filgrastim, the active substance. The Purple Book lists biological products licensed by FDA, including biosimilars. FDA released guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products in 2017. The FDA finalized guidance in January 2017 on naming conventions for biosimilars, using proper names with a core name and a unique four-letter suffix. The core name, like filgrastim, is combined with the suffix, such as filgrastim-xzwy, for identification. The FDA is still deciding on suffix formats for interchangeable products and intends to use core names from the United States Adopted Name for originator biological products. The FDA finalized guidance in January 2017 on naming conventions for biosimilars, using proper names with a core name and a unique four-letter suffix. The core name is combined with the suffix for identification. For originator biological products, the FDA intends to use core names from the United States Adopted Name (USAN) Council. In Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the identical International Nonproprietary Name (INN) system. The WHO released its Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal in January 2016 for biosimilar naming, which is an additional element used to uniquely identify biological substances. The FDA finalized guidance in January 2017 on naming conventions for biosimilars, using proper names with a core name and a unique four-letter suffix. The core name is combined with the suffix for identification. The WHO released its Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal in January 2016 for biosimilar naming, which is an additional element used to uniquely identify biological substances. Biosimilar industry groups support the shared use of a nonproprietary name, while innovator companies prefer a naming scheme that distinguishes between the reference biologic product and the biosimilar. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concern that the FDA's naming proposal could deter physicians from prescribing biosimilars, impeding market development and competition. The FTC expressed concern that the FDA's naming proposal for biosimilars could deter physicians from prescribing them, hindering market development and competition. Historically, all originator biologics with the same nonproprietary name indicated similar identity, but the addition of unique suffixes may lead to misconceptions about clinical differences between biosimilars and reference biologics. The addition of unique suffixes to biosimilars' names may lead to misconceptions about clinical differences. Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars argue that the term \"identical\" is misused to create fear and misunderstanding. Biosimilars are inherently not identical to reference biologics due to variability in biologics. Physicians need to understand this lack of identicality in biologics. FDA issued a final rule in 2006 on the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products, providing information approved by the agency for safe and effective use by healthcare practitioners. The FDA requires prescription drug labeling to include a highlights section with warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, and other essential information for healthcare practitioners. FDA also released guidance on biosimilar labeling in 2016, recommending a Biosimilarity Statement in the highlights section. FDA recommends including a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section of biosimilar labeling, clarifying the relationship to the reference product. The biosimilar product may have different labeling and indications than the reference product. Comparative data should not be included in the labeling to prevent confusion, but are available on the FDA website. Views on FDA labeling guidance vary, with the generic industry preferring less information and the brand-name industry advocating for more. The brand-name industry wants FDA to require more information in biosimilar labeling, while the Generic Pharmaceutical Association believes it is unnecessary and confusing. BIO supports providing more information, including nonclinical and clinical data, to prescribing physicians. The BPCIA provision will transition biologics approved as drugs under the FFDCA to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. Under the BPCIA, biologics approved as drugs under the FFDCA will transition to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. This provision affects specific biological products like insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, infertility treatments, menopause and osteoporosis hormones, and certain enzymes. FDA released draft guidance on this transition in March 2016, stating that marketing applications for biological products must be submitted under the PHS Act, with an exception until March 23, 2020 for submission under the FD&C Act. The transition period ending on March 23, 2020 involves the submission of applications for biological products under the FD&C Act. Approved applications under this act will be deemed as licenses under the PHS Act. Applications for biological products approved under the FFDCA will no longer exist after March 23, 2020. The FDA's interpretation of the transition period ending on March 23, 2020 involves replacing approved applications for biological products under the FFDCA with BLAs under the PHSA. Any pending applications under the FFDCA should be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHSA. Industry representatives have raised concerns about delays in the review and approval of competing biological products. The FDA's interpretation of the transition period ending on March 23, 2020 involves replacing approved applications for biological products under the FFDCA with BLAs under the PHSA. Any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product subject to section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act would cease to have any effect. Orphan drug exclusivity would continue to apply after March 23, 2020. Industry groups have raised concerns about the FDA policy on exclusivity. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. The FDA states that transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period as they were not first licensed under the PHSA. This decision aims to prevent exclusivity that would impede competition from biosimilar or interchangeable products until 2032. An interchangeable product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any patient. The FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability in January 2017, stating that biosimilar products may be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. Interchangeability assessment is a separate process from generic drugs due to structural differences. In January 2017, the FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability for biosimilar products. The EMA in Europe does not determine interchangeability but evaluates biosimilars for authorization. Individual member states have their own policies on interchangeability, with some like Denmark considering all originators and biosimilars interchangeable unless proven otherwise. Ireland allows a single switch but not multiple switches. In the United States, FDA regulates drug products while states regulate pharmacies. At least 37 states have considered legislation on biosimilar substitution, with 27 states and Puerto Rico enacting laws. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was passed in 1992, allowing FDA to negotiate performance goals with industry and use fees for new product application reviews. User fees now make up 43% of the FDA budget, leading to faster review times. Additional authority was granted for medical devices, animal drugs, and generic human drugs. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) allows FDA to collect fees for agency activities. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) allows FDA to collect fees for agency activities related to biosimilar review. The program includes fees for products in the development phase to generate revenue and assist industry sponsors in early development stages. The Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program assists industry sponsors in developing new biosimilar products. There were 64 BPD programs for 23 reference products as of February 2017. Companies can choose to discontinue participation but would need to pay a reactivation fee. The biosimilar biological product application fee may be waived for small businesses. FDA collects BsUFA fees annually and holds public meetings for program reauthorization. The biosimilar user fee program, BsUFA II, was reauthorized through the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017. FDA faced challenges in meeting BsUFA I goals for advisory meetings with industry. FDA faced challenges in achieving BsUFA I goals for advisory meetings with industry due to lack of staff. The new hiring authorities in the 21st Century Cures Act are expected to strengthen staff capacity and modernize hiring practices to meet performance goals and encourage price competition. Under BsUFA II, FDA aims to meet performance goals and reduce costs for applicants by dropping certain fees and retaining others. The agency estimates needing $45 million in FY2018 for the program, with a possible adjustment of up to $9 million. The federal government, including NIH, typically focuses on basic or preclinical work. The federal government, including NIH, focuses on basic or preclinical research, while the pharmaceutical industry directs more funding towards clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements can be challenging, with some questioning the federal role in costly new therapeutics. Studies have tried to quantify the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery. Various studies have quantified the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery. A 2010 study found that 24.1% of new molecular entities (NMEs) and new biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 originated from publicly funded work. A study by Stevens et al. in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Of the 1,541 drug applications, 19% from publicly funded labs received priority review. This indicates a higher percentage compared to applications based solely on private-sector research. The FDA grants priority review designation for drugs that offer significant improvements in safety or effectiveness. Data suggests that Public Sector Research Institutions (PSRIs) tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. A 2011 study by Stevens defined PSRIs as those involved in research leading to drug discovery through intellectual property transfer. The study excluded PSRIs' role in developing platform technologies for new drug classes. The role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that led to new drug classes was excluded from a study. These technologies, funded with public money, enabled the development of FDA-approved products but were not used by PSRI scientists to develop specific drug candidates. Without these platform technologies, many new drugs would not have been possible. The PSRI scientists did not use platform technologies to develop specific drug candidates, but these technologies enabled the development of many new drugs. The 36 biologic drugs discovered by PSRIs in the past 40 years have had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Biological products are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for biologics, focusing on premarket approval and manufacturing processes in response to contamination incidents. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 focused on premarket approval and manufacturing processes for biological products, preceding the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906. The Pure Food and Drugs Act was later replaced by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, which required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application demonstrating product safety before marketing. The Public Health Service Act of 1944 revised regulations for biological products, specifying that licensed products are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. Biological products are defined as substances used for prevention, treatment, or cure of diseases in humans. The FFDCA applies to regulated biological products, except those with approved licenses. The Public Health Service Act of 1944 revised regulations for biological products, specifying that licensed products are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. Most biological products regulated under the PHSA also meet the definition of a drug under the FFDCA. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 amended the PHSA to require a single biological license application (BLA) for a biological product. The PHSA provides authority to suspend a license immediately if there is a danger to public health. The Public Health Service Act of 1944 revised regulations for biological products, specifying that licensed products are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. The PHSA provides authority to suspend a license immediately if there is a danger to public health. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created a licensure pathway for biosimilar products and authorized the FDA to collect associated fees. It also established periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain brand-name biologics and biosimilar products. Following the enactment of the 1902 Biologics Act, regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially given to the Hygienic Laboratory, which later transferred to the FDA's Bureau of Biologics in 1972. The FDA's Bureau of Drugs and Bureau of Biologics merged in 1982 to form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics, which eventually split into the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) in 1988. CBER relocated to the new FDA headquarters in 2014. Determining the jurisdictional status of biotechnology products has been challenging for the FDA due to their overlap with biologics, drugs, and devices. In 1991, FDA published an Intercenter Agreement between CBER and CDER, stating that traditional biologics and most biotechnology products would be regulated by CBER. FDA later announced a reorganization in 2002, consolidating review responsibilities under CDER for new pharmaceutical products, allowing CBER to focus on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation. Responsibilities for reviewing new pharmaceutical products were consolidated under CDER in 2002, allowing CBER to focus on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation. In 2003, most therapeutic biologics were transferred from CBER to CDER, where they are regulated as licensed biologics under Section 351 of the PHSA. Products transferred to CDER include monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, growth factors, and cytokines, while traditional biologics such as vaccines and blood products remain at CBER."
