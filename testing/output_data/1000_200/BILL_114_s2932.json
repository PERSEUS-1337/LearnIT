The Congress recognizes the importance of controlled substances for emergency medical services to save lives and improve health outcomes. Mobile emergency medical services require time-sensitive care for critical injuries and illnesses in the field. There have been few DEA investigations related to diversion in emergency medical services. Regulatory oversight is crucial to prevent diversion of controlled substances in emergency medical services. Recent surveys show minimal diversions or investigations for a large number of doses administered. Oversight should be tailored to unique care delivery models and promote uniform rules to prevent diversion and establish clear guidelines within emergency medical services. The regulatory oversight is essential to prevent diversion of controlled substances in emergency medical services, with clear guidelines for various types of agencies. SEC. 312 of the Controlled Substances Act adds regulations for emergency medical services to prevent diversion of controlled substances. In SEC. 312 of the Controlled Substances Act, definitions for emergency medical services are provided, including emergency medical response, mobile services, agencies, and practitioners licensed or certified by a State. The Controlled Substances Act defines emergency medical services, including practitioners licensed by a State and overseen by a medical director. Medical oversight involves supervising medical operations, and standing orders are written protocols for administering controlled substances in emergencies. The Controlled Substances Act defines terms related to emergency medical services, including verbal orders, online medical direction, and registrant emergency medical services agency. The Controlled Substances Act defines terms related to emergency medical services, including registration of emergency medical services agencies under hospital licenses for dispensing controlled substances to ultimate users. The Controlled Substances Act requires individual practitioners or medical directors of emergency medical services agencies to register with the Attorney General. The registration is per State, not per location, and guidance provided should recognize different models of emergency medical service care delivery. Medical oversight is also addressed. Medical oversight for emergency medical services agencies is essential, with one or more licensed physicians serving as medical directors responsible for overseeing the provision of services. The responsibilities of the medical director may vary based on state regulations. The medical director's responsibilities may include decisions on patient transportation, approving medical protocols, overseeing patient care by EMS practitioners, and establishing drug protocols. The medical director oversees online medical direction, establishes drug formularies, administers medications, controls substances, manages medical education programs, ensures quality improvement for the EMS agency, and may administer controlled substances in schedule II-V. Emergency medical services practitioners in a registrant agency can administer controlled substances in schedule II-V under the authority of the State, with a standing order or online medical direction from medical directors or licensed physicians. Emergency medical services practitioners can request verbal orders from the medical director for specific patients, dispatching to mass casualty incidents, or other patient situations identified by the medical director. The medical director can provide standing orders for administering controlled substances without being present or providing a written prescription. The emergency medical services agency must keep these standing orders on file. The registrant emergency medical services agency must keep standing orders on file and make them available to the Attorney General upon request. Practitioners must document receiving verbal orders from online medical direction and the administration of controlled substances in the patient care chart, which should be made available to the Attorney General upon request. The registrant emergency medical services agency can receive controlled substances at designated locations and move them between agency locations. The registrant emergency medical services agency can store controlled substances at designated locations and is not considered a distributor of controlled substances under this Act. This section does not affect requirements under titles XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act and does not limit the Attorney General's authority to enforce diversion of controlled substances."
