    "content": "Surface transportation authorization acts fund federal highway, mass transit, safety, and research programs. The most recent authorization, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009, leading to temporary extensions. Budget constraints have limited funding, with the highway trust fund facing revenue declines from gasoline and diesel taxes. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has seen a decline in revenues from highway taxes, leading to debates on passing a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit. Other issues being discussed include alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management. The distribution of federal spending among states is also a concern, with past solutions of large funding increases for all states not easily achievable with current revenue forecasts. The Senate passed MAP-21, reauthorizing surface transportation programs for two years. The House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, a five-year bill with a total authorization of $260 billion, linking transportation components with provisions for oil and gas production. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) to extend surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. The bill includes provisions for oil and gas production to fund highway infrastructure, controversially discontinuing mass transit funding with Highway Trust Fund revenues. It also addresses the Keystone XL Pipeline, Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund guarantee, and environmental streamlining. The Senate agreed to an amendment that replaced the House-passed language in H.R. 4348 with the language of MAP-21, allowing the measure to go to conference. Negotiations will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Surface transportation reauthorization is complex due to multiple committee jurisdictions. The pending reauthorization bills on surface transportation address complex issues before Congress, involving multiple committees. The highway trust fund is primarily funded by excise taxes on motor fuels, with separate accounts for highways and mass transit. Highway account receives 15.44 cents per gallon of gasoline tax, while mass transit account receives 2.86 cents per gallon. The fuel tax rates, set in cents per gallon, do not increase with inflation. Revenues have fallen below projections, leading to transfers from the general fund. The Highway account is expected to have a $4.6 billion shortfall by the end of FY2013. The CBO projects a gap of $8-9 billion per year in the highway account through FY2022. The mass transit account is expected to fall into a $1.2 billion shortfall by the end of FY2014, deepening in the following years. Without an increase in fuel taxes, the trust fund system will struggle to support transportation spending. The Federal-Aid Highway Program faces financial challenges due to a projected gap in the highway account. Without an increase in fuel taxes, new revenue sources are needed to support transportation spending. State DOTs play a key role in determining how federally funded highway projects are executed. The Federal-Aid Highway Program requires states and local governments to provide a matching share for highway projects. Funds are distributed by FHWA through apportionment and allocation, with reimbursement occurring after project approval and costs are incurred. The Federal-Aid Highway Program requires states and local governments to provide a matching share for highway projects. Reimbursement occurs once a project is approved, work is started, costs are incurred, and a voucher is submitted to FHWA. Contract authority allows for obligation without an appropriation, committing the federal government to reimburse the state for the federal share. Limitation on obligations (ObLim) controls annual FHWA spending by setting a limit on contract authority obligations in a fiscal year. The ObLim sets a limit on FHWA spending, similar to an appropriation. There are formula and discretionary programs for highway funding. Formula programs allocate funds to states annually based on specific factors, while discretionary programs are smaller and allocated by FHWA or Congress. The majority of federal-aid highway money is apportioned to state DOTs through core formula programs, which fund most highway projects. The core formula programs, such as IM, NHS, STP, HBP, CMAQ, HSIP, and EB, receive roughly 80% of SAFETEA's contract authority and fund federal-aid highway projects. Each program has its own formula factors to determine state apportionments. State DOTs have flexibility to transfer funds between programs, except for HSIP. The Equity Bonus Program is the largest highway program in dollar terms, guaranteeing each state a minimum share of funds regardless of funding formulas. State DOTs have increasing flexibility to transfer funds between programs, reducing the importance of funding formulas. Some argue that the program structure limits their use of federal highway funds as they see fit. The Equity Bonus Program, part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, is criticized for diluting core program formulas. Smaller discretionary highway programs, known as \"allocated\" programs, are also under FHWA control. These programs allocate funds through competition, with most funding earmarked by Congress during SAFETEA. FHWA lists 59 activities as allocated programs, some resembling specific projects or temporary pilot programs. The federal transit program, administered by FTA in DOT, is separate from the highway programs. The federal transit program, administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), consists of individual programs with varying funding amounts and distribution mechanisms. There are four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, accounting for 85% of authorized transit funding. Two of these programs, the Urbanized Area Formula Program and the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, distribute funds by formula. The Urbanized Area Formula Program provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, while the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program focuses on rail modernization. The Fixed Guideway Modernization Program in the federal transit program allocates funds for the replacement and rehabilitation of transit rail system assets. The New Starts Program, a discretionary program, provides competitive funding for new fixed guideway systems and extensions, including busways, ferries, and automated guideway systems. Additionally, a \"Small Starts\" program was enacted to fund projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million. The \"Small Starts\" program in SAFETEA funds projects with a total cost of $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million. Bus Program funds are used to purchase buses and related equipment, including building construction. Various smaller funding programs account for the remaining 15% of transit program funds. Highway transportation is the leading cause of transportation-related fatalities in the US, with states primarily responsible for highway safety. Federal highway safety programs, administered by three DOT agencies, aim to improve driver behavior and vehicle safety. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and FHWA focus on commercial driver qualifications, vehicle safety, and roadway design. NHTSA provides grants to states for traffic safety efforts, regulates vehicle safety, and oversees federal grant funds. States must submit highway safety plans approved by NHTSA to receive funds, identifying safety problems, setting goals, and establishing performance measures. NHTSA also offers training and technical assistance through the State and Community Highway Safety Program. NHTSA provides grants to states for traffic safety programs, including data collection, speeding reduction, seat belt usage, drunk driving prevention, and more. FMCSA focuses on commercial vehicle safety through regulation, enforcement, and training. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) administers motor carrier safety grant programs to ensure the safety of truck and motor coach operations. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by improving road design or operation. States receive funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic fatalities, with a minimum allocation of 0.5%. HSIP includes a set-aside for railway-highway grade crossing hazard elimination and funds for construction and operational improvements on high-risk rural roads. SAFETEA extended mechanisms to guarantee annual funding levels for construction and operational improvements on high-risk rural roads. Budget firewalls protected these funds from being used elsewhere, ensuring funding levels set for FY2005 through FY2009 were maintained. Appropriators honored these guarantees throughout SAFETEA's duration. The Enforcement Act guarantees for funding levels set in SAFETEA were honored until 2002. A rule change in the House removed the protection, allowing for adjustments in funding levels based on annual highway account receipts through the RABA mechanism. Despite revenues falling below guarantee levels, Congress has not reduced funding based on RABA calculations. In recent years, revenues have consistently fallen below guarantee levels, leading to potential funding reductions under RABA. However, general fund transfers have supplemented the HTF, making the RABA issue moot. A mechanism to align spending with receipts may still be considered in reauthorization. The Budget Control Act mandates sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to agree on spending reductions. The Budget Control \"Super Committee\" failed to reach an agreement in November 2011, but exemptions likely prevent significant reductions in surface transportation funding. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, likely means that sequestration would not significantly reduce surface transportation spending authorized beyond FY2012. Exempted programs include Federal-Aid Highways, Highway Traffic Safety Grants, NHTSA operations, Motor Carrier Safety, Transit Formula and Bus Grants. $739 million of annual contract authority may be subject to sequester, including the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program. SAFETEA expired in 2009. The New Starts program, funded by general revenues, may be affected by sequester. SAFETEA expired in 2009, leading to surface transportation programs operating on extension legislation. The House-passed STEA-II extends authorization of the HTF and federal transportation programs until September 30, 2012. The Senate replaced the House language with MAP-21, allowing the measure to go to conference. Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica has publicly supported this action. The House and Senate are negotiating the surface transportation bill, with Chairman John Mica emphasizing the importance of including provisions from H.R. 7 in the conference. Members are concerned about the scope of the differences between the House and Senate versions, as out-of-scope provisions may face points of order. House rules can be waived with a majority vote, while Senate rules must be followed. In the House, a majority can waive the rule restricting the content of conference reports, while Senate rules require the support of 60 Senators to waive points of order. STEA-II includes provisions unrelated to surface transportation programs, such as the North American Energy Access Act transferring permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline. Title II of the bill establishes the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, financed by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The fund will be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, with revenues distributed to Gulf Coast states, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and for other purposes. The Treasury will administer the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, distributing revenues as follows: 35% to Gulf Coast states, 60% to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and 5% for research. H.R. 4348 requires a future act of Congress for revenue distribution, unlike S. 1400. The bill also includes provisions for harbor maintenance programs, coal combustion residuals permit programs, and the text of Title III of H.R. 7. Title V of the bill authorizes states to implement coal combustion residuals permit programs, while Title VI includes provisions to expedite transportation project delivery. Both House and Senate bills aim to streamline project delivery and reduce highway programs. MAP-21 reauthorizes the Federal-Aid Highway Program with funding levels adjusted for inflation and changes to program structure and funding distribution. Total authorization for FY2012 is $39.5 billion and $40.5 billion for FY2013, with $400 million allocated for research and education each year. MAP-21 reauthorizes the Federal-Aid Highway Program with funding levels of $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013, along with $400 million allocated for research and education each year. The bill eliminates formula factors under individual programs, apportioning funds to states based on their share of total apportionments and allocations from FY2005-FY2009. This change reduces federal and congressional influence on program direction and project selection. MAP-21 reduces federal and congressional influence on program direction and project selection by broadening eligibility across programs. It eliminates program formulas and congressional designation of projects, shifting towards federal planning and performance management. Transferability between core programs is limited to 20% of each formula program's apportionment. The number of programs is reduced by two-thirds, with eligibility shifted to core programs and discretionary grant programs under FHWA control being eliminated. The Transportation Enhancements Program is merged into the CMAQ program, and some controversial TE uses are eliminated. The bill eliminates some controversial uses of the Transportation Enhancements Program (TE) and merges it into the CMAQ program. States can use TE funds for non-TE CMAQ projects after building up a balance. The National Freight Program (NFP) aims to increase funding for freight projects by removing competition with non-freight projects. The Senate bill significantly increases funding for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Tolling of federally funded roads and bridges is not addressed in the bill. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes a five-year reauthorization with modest increases in funding for federal-aid highways and research/education. It includes folding existing programs into new ones, reducing the number of distinct programs by two-thirds, and guaranteeing a 94% state rate of return on payments to the Highway Trust Fund. The Mass Transit Account of the HTF would be renamed. The Equity Bonus program in the House bill proposes a 94% state rate of return guarantee on payments to the Highway Trust Fund. The Mass Transit Account would be renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing funding for highway programs. Provisions under the streamlining title would change NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, with NEPA no longer applying to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding constituting 15% or less of total costs. TIFIA funding would increase nearly ten-fold under MAP-21. The House bill proposes changes to funding for transit programs, with the HTF providing 79.9% of funding and the general fund providing 20.1%. MAP-21 includes $10.458 billion annually for transit programs, creation of the State of Good Repair program, and modification of the New Starts process. Funding for bus facilities would be set aside from the New Starts program. The New Starts program under H.R. 7 would authorize $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. Provisions include renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account (ATA), funding the ATA by transferring $40 billion from the general fund, and combining various programs into a single one. Funding for the Bus and Bus-related Facilities Program would be distributed by formula. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan, a rolling stock equipment pool for intercity passenger services, and positive train control implementation. The bill also amends the RRIF program to accept state or local subsidies as collateral and makes modest changes to laws affecting rail freight enforced by the Surface Transportation Board. The House bill contains provisions on Amtrak funding, RRIF program, and positive train control implementation. The bill includes provisions to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, including transfers from various sources such as the Leaking Underground Storage Tank trust fund and Gas Guzzler Tax. The Senate bill extends highway-related taxes through FY2015 and trust fund expenditure authority through FY2013. The bill includes provisions to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, including transfers from various sources such as the Gas Guzzler Tax and future import tariffs on automotive products. Other revenue sources include revocation of passports of tax delinquents, levying Medicare payments for unpaid taxes, and changes in tax treatment of securities in corporate reorganizations. Additionally, funds will come from levying federal employee's Thrift Savings Account for tax liabilities and transfers of excess pension assets to retiree health accounts. The bill includes provisions to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, including transfers from various sources such as the Gas Guzzler Tax and future import tariffs on automotive products. Other revenue sources include revocation of passports of tax delinquents, levying Medicare payments for unpaid taxes, and changes in tax treatment of securities in corporate reorganizations. Additionally, funds will come from levying federal employee's Thrift Savings Account for tax liabilities and transfers of excess pension assets to retiree health accounts. Savings Account to satisfy tax liabilities; $363 million (FY2014-FY2022) from the extension for transfers of excess pension assets to retiree health accounts and allowing Section 420 of the U.S. tax code to apply to life insurance benefits; $9.467 billion (over 10 years) from pension funding stabilization, based on the revenue increases from the stabilization of the fluctuation of interest rates attributable to concomitant changes in Pension Guarantee Benefit Corporation premiums; $4.970 billion transfer from the Treasury general fund to the HTF ($2.183 billion in FY2012, $2.277 billion in FY2013, and $510 million in FY2014); $459 million (over 10 years) from allowing federal agencies to offer phased retirement; $244 million (over 10 years) from the reporting of the sale of life insurance policies to third parties; $99 million (over 10 years) from extending taxes on cigarette manufacturers to entities operating roll-your-own machines; $3.627 billion (over 10 years) from delaying the. The bill includes provisions to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, including transfers from various sources such as the Gas Guzzler Tax and future import tariffs on automotive products. Other revenue sources include revocation of passports of tax delinquents, levying Medicare payments for unpaid taxes, and changes in tax treatment of securities in corporate reorganizations. Additionally, funds will come from levying federal employee's Thrift Savings Account for tax liabilities and transfers of excess pension assets to retiree health accounts. Since passage, these offsets and revenue provisions have raised comments, in part, because they total more than is needed to offset the difference between the HTF revenue and the MAP-21 spending levels. This could be seen as an opportunity for deficit reduction or as making room for spending. The Finance Committee also reported favorably on provisions that cost money, including changing the Small Issuer Exception to extend the special rules providing modifications to bonds issued after the date of enactment. The bill includes provisions to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, including transfers from various sources such as the Gas Guzzler Tax and future import tariffs on automotive products. Other revenue sources include revocation of passports of tax delinquents, levying Medicare payments for unpaid taxes, and changes in tax treatment of securities in corporate reorganizations. Additionally, funds will come from levying federal employee's Thrift Savings Account for tax liabilities and transfers of excess pension assets to retiree health accounts. The Senate bill also includes provisions to authorize states to issue TRIP (Transportation and Regional Infrastructure Project) bonds through state infrastructure banks. The Senate bill includes provisions to raise revenue for the Highway Trust Fund, such as transfers from the Gas Guzzler Tax and future import tariffs on automotive products. It also authorizes states to issue TRIP bonds through state infrastructure banks. Additionally, the bill modifies the depreciation period for long-term highway leases and sets an amortization period for the franchise right to collect tolls. This may impact the attractiveness of highway privatization to private-sector investors. The Finance Committee is concerned about the mismatch between the amortization period for toll collection rights and lease terms. A \"solvency account\" would be established to manage excess funds in the Highway Trust Fund, ensuring financial cushion for both highway and mass transit accounts. The Senate bill proposes measures to address these issues. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund to provide new revenue for the highway trust fund, which was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. Annual revenues come from a tax on gasoline and diesel fuels, supporting environmental cleanup programs. States historically used the fund for oversight and enforcement of corrective actions by responsible parties. The Waste Disposal Act expanded state and EPA responsibilities for the LUST program, using trust fund monies for leak prevention and cleanup. Over 85% of reported releases have been addressed, with 88,000 still needing cleanup. The LUST trust fund had a $3.392 billion balance in FY2012, estimated to receive $117 million. The LUST trust fund had a $3.392 billion unobligated balance in FY2012. It is estimated to receive $117 million in interest payments and $181 million in tax receipts. Congress has appropriated approximately $113 million annually from the trust fund, with states receiving 80% as grants. Section 40301 of the Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. It also includes provisions to appropriate future LUST trust fund receipts to the highway trust fund, providing a total of $3.685 billion over ten years. Additionally, the bill extends the LUST trust fund expenditure authority through September 30, 2013, and reauthorizes HTF expenditure authority through FY2016. The Jobs Financing Act of 2012, reported by the Committee on Ways and Means, reauthorizes HTF expenditure authority through FY2016. Existing highway taxes, including motor fuel taxes, would be extended through FY2018. H.R. 7 includes provisions for future transfers to the HTF to be fully offset. The bill seeks to fill revenue gaps and reconfigure the highway trust fund, including $40 billion of general fund resources for the proposed alternative transportation account. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 does not allocate balances. H.R. 7 does not allocate balances or revenues from the LUST trust fund to the Highway Trust Fund. It seeks to direct federal revenues from energy leasing and production into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. The House approved energy leasing and production provisions separately, with the possibility of incorporating them into H.R. 7. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act governs offshore energy development, managed by the Department of the Interior. The program allows leasing for oil and gas resources, generating $6.5 billion in federal receipts in FY2011. Current law allocates these receipts to various programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund receives a $900 million annual allocation, and the National Historic Preservation Fund receives a $150 million allocation annually. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account of the HTF to the alternative transportation account and provides it with a one-time appropriation of $40 billion. Additionally, federal receipts from certain submerged acreage are permanently appropriated to states, with Gulf Coast states receiving additional funds from specified leases. Title XVI, Federal Employee Retirement, is included in MAP-21 to provide offsetting revenues for the $40 billion in general fund revenues allocated to the alternative transportation account. The bill proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years, with $39.9 billion for FY2012 and $40.9 billion for FY2013. MAP-21 eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and guarantees a state share based on SAFETEA, with a 95 cent return on each dollar paid to the highway account. The bill does not include highway program earmarks and includes a provision called the \"ratchet mechanism\" in Section 4001 for highway spending controls. The \"ratchet mechanism\" in MAP-21 ensures the solvency of the highway account by reducing FY2012 ObLim if the balance falls below $2 billion in FY2012 or $1 billion in FY2013. This adjustment would result in a rescission of contract authority to prevent a shortfall, but only under year-long appropriations bills, not short-term resolutions. This provision addresses the pending HTF shortfall under MAP-21 spending levels. The provision in H.R. 7 commits the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to keeping the bill's spending within the means of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to address the shortfall. Implementing the ratchet mechanism could face resistance in Congress due to past negative calculations, but Congress has overridden reductions in the past by drawing down the HTF balance. H.R. 7 proposes a total federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years. Congress chose to override reductions by drawing down the positive balance in the HTF. H.R. 7 proposes a total federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years, with specific obligation limitations for each fiscal year. Additionally, H.R. 7 includes funding for highway programs from an Alternative Transportation Account and a modified Equity Bonus Program ensuring states receive at least 94% of the motor fuel taxes they pay into the HTF. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees that each state's highway grants will equal at least 94% of the motor fuel taxes paid into the HTF, with a cap of $3.9 billion per year. The alternative transportation funding includes programs like CMAQ, Ferry Boats, Puerto Rico Highways, and Territorial Highway Program, with an obligation limitation of $2.707 billion for fiscal years 2013-2016. H.R. 7 allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system and federal participation in projects to increase highway capacity, with no earmarks included. H.R. 7 does not include earmarks and allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system. MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology based on total nationwide apportionments and allocations received for FY2005-FY2009. Each state's initial amount is adjusted to ensure combined apportionments will not be less than 95% of estimated tax payments. The initial amounts for state apportionments under MAP-21 are adjusted to guarantee a minimum of 95% of estimated tax payments from highway users. Any excess federal highway spending over HTF revenues for FY2005-FY2009 may eliminate the need for adjustments. A portion of each state's apportionments is set aside for the new CMAQ program, with the metropolitan planning amount determined based on a state's apportionment ratio under Title 23 Section 134 for FY2009. The planning amount for state apportionments under MAP-21 is determined by a ratio calculation based on Title 23 Section 134 for FY2009. The remaining amount is divided among core programs, with adjustments based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled. This adjustment applies to formerly publicly operated toll roads that have been privatized. The apportionments for states with privatized toll roads would be reduced based on lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled, with Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado seeing reductions and other states seeing increases. The adjustment would result in a 0.087% reduction for Illinois, 4.375% for Indiana, and 0.045% for Colorado, while other states would see a 0.115% increase in apportionments. Table 5 shows the dollar amounts of the aggregate programmatic split. The apportionments for states with privatized toll roads would be adjusted, with reductions for Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado, and increases for other states. MAP-21 does not have an overt equity program but determines the initial amount for each state based on total funding from FY2005-FY2009 to address the donor-donee issue. Adjustments ensure states receive at least a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF, with a nationwide rate of return for FY2005-FY2009 at $1.23 on the dollar. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding for the program authorized in MAP-21, adjustments may be needed to guarantee a 95% return on payments to the HTF. Some states may prefer using their state return on payments to determine the initial amount, rather than the state share of total FY2005-FY2009 funding, due to earmarking legacy issues. SAFETEA included a high number of earmarks valued at $24.3 billion, with 67% of funding for highway earmarks being \"below the line.\" $22.1 billion in highway earmarks had 67% \"below the line\" funding, which did not bring additional money to states. The remaining 33% was \"above the line\" earmarks, increasing funds to states. MAP-21 eliminated project earmarks but states that did well in obtaining \"above the line\" earmarks under SAFETEA benefited from higher base amounts under extensions. The SAFETEA earmarking process favored states with \"above the line\" earmarks, leading to increased apportionment shares under MAP-21. MAP-21 reduced funding programs by two-thirds, absorbing eligibilities into core programs. The five core programs plus metropolitan transportation planning would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012. The core programs under MAP-21 would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013, with the NHPP receiving $20.5 billion for FY2012 and $21 billion for FY2013. This program aims to improve the National Highway System's condition and performance by combining three SAFETEA core programs. The NHPP program focuses on improving infrastructure condition, safety, and mobility, including highway segments, bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, and environmental restoration within NHS corridors. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets, with a limit of 40% of funding for new capacity projects. The NHPP program focuses on improving infrastructure condition, safety, and mobility within NHS corridors. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets. Funds would be transferred if bridge conditions fall below minimum standards. The program aims to improve federal-aid highways and bridges on public roads, replacing SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program. The authorization for TMP is roughly $10.5 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, eligible for transit and carpool programs. The Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) has an annual authorization of $10.5 billion for FY2012 and FY2013. TMP funds can be used for various transportation projects such as transit, carpool programs, congestion pricing, recreational trails, ferryboats, border infrastructure, scenic roads, truck parking facilities, safe routes to school projects, and maintenance of public roads near international borders. Additionally, TMP funds are eligible for state participation in natural habitat and wetlands mitigation efforts related to transportation projects under Title 23 U.S.C. The Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) has an annual authorization of $10.5 billion for FY2012 and FY2013. TMP funds can be used for various transportation projects including maintenance of public roads near international borders. TMP funds could be used for maintenance and improvement of all public roads within 10 miles of international borders on which federally owned vehicles comprise more than 50% of the traffic. States would be subject to penalties if the total deck area of deficient bridges increased in the two most recent years. Fifty percent of each state's apportionment is to be based on the relative share of a state's population residing within different areas. The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) program would be eliminated but its routes and access roads would be eligible under TMP. The Transportation Mobility Program (TMP) has an annual authorization of $10.5 billion for FY2012 and FY2013. States would have more flexibility in determining spending on the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) as it would be eliminated but its routes and access roads would be eligible under TMP. The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program would be expanded to include demand-shifting projects and receive roughly $3.3 billion annually under MAP-21. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) would remain largely unchanged under SAFETEA. The HSIP program would continue to support safety improvements on road infrastructure with an annual funding of $2.5 billion for FY2012 and FY2013. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and the Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be eliminated, while the NFP program would focus on enhancing the national freight network with a funding of $2 billion annually. MAP-21 would decrease the maximum funding transfer percentage from 50% to 20% for states. MAP-21 would reduce the maximum funding transfer percentage from 50% to 20% for states. Section 1507 of the bill would prohibit the transfer of TMP funding suballocated by population. H.R. 7 would retain more of the existing core program structure but expand the NHS and STP programs. The Interstate Maintenance program would be folded into the NHS program. The Surface Transportation Program (STP) would absorb the Highway Bridge Program, Interstate Maintenance program would merge into the National Highway System Program, and the Highway Safety Improvement Program would remain. The 10% STP set-aside for Transportation Enhancements is eliminated. Obligation limitations for core highway programs total $150.7 billion for FY2013 through FY2016, with an additional $8 billion for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. H.R. 7 is the largest formula program in the bill at $70.4 billion. H.R. 7, the largest formula program in the bill at $70.4 billion, would expand funding for the National Highway System Program to cover maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system and bridges. Projects must align with national performance goals, and states must develop asset management plans for the NHS. STP, with broad eligibility criteria, would receive $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 under H.R. 7. Under H.R. 7, the Surface Transportation Program (STP) would receive $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014. The bill broadens the program's purpose to include bridges and tunnels of all classifications, eliminates the 10% set-aside for transportation enhancement purposes, and prohibits projects on certain roads unless they were part of the federal-aid highway system in 1991. Additionally, up to 15% of STP funds for areas with populations under 5,000 can be used on minor collector roads. H.R. 7 would reduce the percentage of funds required to be spent on urbanized areas with populations over 200,000 from 62.5% to 50%. States must consult with local planning organizations before using funds for projects in areas with populations of 5,000 to 200,000. The bill would provide $10.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for Highway Safety Improvement Programs (HSIP), requiring states to have their own safety improvement programs and plans to receive funds. Plans must set safety goals, identify projects, and evaluate progress annually. Federal cost share would be provided. H.R. 7 would amend the existing program to guarantee each state a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments on highway users' payments. It authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014, with $8 billion allocated to the proposed alternative transportation account for CMAQ. The bill aims to identify the 100 most dangerous roads in each state and evaluate progress annually in achieving safety goals. Federal cost share remains at 90%. The SAFETEA program aims to guarantee each state $3.9 billion annually, with flexibility to adjust if needed. The Senate bill clarifies eligibility criteria for roads and bridges damaged by disasters, limiting ER funds to federal-aid highways. U.S. territories are capped at $20 million per year for disaster relief. The ER funds are limited to federal-aid highways, with U.S. territories capped at $20 million per year for disaster relief. The $100 million ceiling for natural disasters or catastrophic failures in a single state would be removed. Section 1506 allows adjustments to the 180-day emergency period for repair costs. The Secretary of Transportation may allow 100% federal share for repairs exceeding the state apportionment. H.R. 7 defines \"comparable facility\" for maximum project costs. Debris removal reimbursement is limited to uncovered costs. The Senate bill proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, allowing ER funding for federal lands highways and tribal roads. Assistance would be provided for declared emergencies, with a limit of $20 million for U.S. territories per fiscal year. States must submit project lists within two years for reimbursement of debris removal costs not covered by the Stafford Act. The Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, proposed under MAP-21, includes the Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program. Funding would be $450 million annually for the Tribal Transportation Program and $550 million for other federal lands programs. Changes in the Tribal Transportation Program include a new formula for fund distribution based on road mileage and tribal population. H.R. 7 authorizes $465 million annually for the Tribal Transportation Program. Funding from the Federal Lands Access Program would be allocated based on federal land, recreational visitors, federal roads, and federally owned bridges. H.R. 7 authorizes the Tribal Transportation Program at $465 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. The Federal Lands Transportation program is authorized at $535 million annually for the same period. The Senate bill combines the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013. Puerto Rico's set-aside is limited to certain program eligibilities. H.R. 7 authorizes the Puerto Rico Highway Program at $150 million annually and the Territorial Highway Program at $50 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. The Appalachian Development Highway System federal share for construction is raised to 95% under certain conditions. The program is retained at $470 million per year, with funds available until expended. States can use toll credits for the local matching share under H.R. 7. The funds under H.R. 7 would be available until expended, with states allowed to use toll credits for the local matching share. Funds are apportioned based on cost estimates, with each state receiving between 1% and 25%. The Senate bill provides $1 billion for FY2013 for a discretionary program funding high-cost transportation projects with national benefits. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to report on the selection process and justification for projects under H.R. 7, which aims to improve transportation safety and reduce congestion. The Senate bill creates a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities, with funding distributed based on passenger numbers. The funding for ferry systems under MAP-21 is distributed based on passenger numbers, vehicles carried per day, and route miles serviced. $67 million is authorized for each fiscal year FY2012 and FY2013, with funds requiring an appropriation. Ferry boats and facilities are eligible for formula funds under the National Highway Performance Program. H.R. 7 proposes modifications to the existing Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program, funding it at $67 million for each fiscal year FY2013-FY2016 via the Alternative Transportation Account. The proposed H.R. 7 bill would fund the Ferry Boat and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program at $67 million annually for FY2013-FY2016 through the Alternative Transportation Account. Distribution of funds would be based on vehicle and passenger numbers, as well as nautical route miles serviced by ferry systems in each state. Additionally, ferry boats and facilities on the National Highway System would be eligible for formula funds under the program. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) provides federal credit assistance for large transportation projects. MAP-21 proposes to increase TIFIA funding to $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund, up from $122 million annually in SAFETEA, to cover administrative and subsidy costs. Administrative costs would be capped at 1% of the funding amount. MAP-21 proposes to increase TIFIA funding to $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund, with administrative costs capped at 1%. This would allow DOT to make loans totaling $9.9 billion per year. Additionally, MAP-21 suggests increasing the share of project costs TIFIA can provide from 33% to 49%, and allowing credit assistance for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge through a \"master credit agreement.\" Los Angeles County Metro has sought this change to accelerate financing for 12 transit projects. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) has sought changes in TIFIA funding to accelerate financing for 12 transit projects. MAP-21 proposes a threshold of $25 million for rural infrastructure projects, with loans offered at half the Treasury rate. 10% of TIFIA funds in MAP-21 are allocated for rural projects. Projects seeking TIFIA assistance would be evaluated solely on their eligibility on a first-come, first-served basis. Once funding is exhausted for a year, a project sponsor could enter into a master credit agreement for future credit assistance or pay its own credit subsidy. MAP-21 permits the payment of the credit subsidy from federal surface transportation apportionments. Unused TIFIA funding may be apportioned to states for the Transportation Mobility Program. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund. Administrative costs are capped at $3.250 million. Projects are evaluated on a first-come, first-served basis. Thresholds for project eligibility include $50 million for non-ITS projects, $15 million for ITS projects, $25 million for rural projects, and $1 billion for assistance under a master credit agreement. H.R. 7 proposes to authorize $750 million per year for state infrastructure banks and raises the maximum federal assistance to 49%. It also includes a $25 million threshold for rural projects and a $1 billion threshold for assistance under a master credit agreement. There is no separate federal freight transportation program in SAFETEA, with most funding provided through regular highway programs like the Surface Transportation Program (STP). The SAFETEA funding is provided to states through highway programs like STP, with minor funding for freight improvements. The debate on whether the federal government should focus more on funding freight improvements is ongoing. The Senate bill (MAP-21) proposes a new dedicated funding program for freight transport, while the House bill (H.R. 7) includes provisions affecting freight transport. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to prepare and update a national freight plan. The Senate and House bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a national freight transport plan and increase private-sector involvement in financing transportation improvements. MAP-21 proposes a new core program to allocate funds to critical infrastructure segments for freight movement, creating a \"primary freight network\" of 27,000 miles of existing roadways. The \"primary freight network\" (PFN) consists of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways, prioritized for funding before other freight-related infrastructure. The Secretary of Transportation can add up to 3,000 more miles based on future freight importance, with periodic re-designations. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density connecting to the PFN or Interstate System. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density connecting to the PFN or Interstate System. These corridors, along with portions of the Interstate System and the PFN, form the \"national freight network (NFM).\" States can allocate up to 20% of their freight program funds for these roads and up to 10% for public or private freight rail or maritime projects if they improve freight flow significantly. The Secretary of Transportation can approve rail or maritime projects that improve freight flow significantly and have a higher return than highway projects on the PFN. A specific funding program for freight movement and the development of performance measures by states will enhance consideration of freight needs in project selection. The PFN, consisting of 30,000 miles of highway, focuses funds on critical segments for freight movement, with many congested areas at urban interchanges. Trucks face speed and congestion issues on over 8,500 trucks per day on 4,700 miles of highway during rush hours, and stop-and-go conditions on an additional 3,700 miles. The Senate bill does not change truck size and weight limits but requires a study on possible changes. The House bill focuses on funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-relevant programs. Federal gas taxes are no longer transferred to the mass transit trust fund. The House bill aims to increase funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-relevant programs and ending the transfer of federal gas taxes to the mass transit trust fund. It also proposes greater reliance on tolling for highway construction, which is opposed by trucking organizations. The bill includes provisions for a study on increasing truck weight limits and allowing longer double trailers for less-than-truckload carriers. The House bill, H.R. 7, includes provisions for increasing the permitted length of double trailers for LTL carriers to 33 feet and for truckload carriers to 53 feet. It also allows auto transporters to be 80 feet long and proposes a pilot program for increased truck weights on certain Interstate Highway segments. Additionally, there is a weight exemption for idle reduction equipment and provisions related to rail and maritime modes. MAP-21 would bring significant changes to transportation planning requirements. MAP-21 proposes substantial changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, emphasizing the use of performance management throughout the planning process. It includes national goals but allows states and metropolitan planning organizations to develop specific performance measures and targets. Failure to meet targets would require a remedial plan of action. The consequences of failing to meet targets under MAP-21 are mild, requiring a remedial plan. The new National Freight Program mandates a national freight strategic plan with performance measures. States must set targets for freight movement to access funding. Failure to progress towards targets necessitates a freight performance improvement plan submission. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act in MAP-21 includes provisions for national surface transportation. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act in MAP-21 includes provisions for establishing a national surface transportation and freight policy, as well as developing a national strategic plan for transportation and freight. Some provisions overlap or conflict with those in other sections of the act, such as setting goals for reducing traffic fatalities and developing a national strategic freight plan within a specified timeframe. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act in MAP-21 includes provisions for a national strategic freight plan and a national surface transportation and freight performance plan. States must develop risk-based asset management plans with performance targets. The Secretary will set minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions, with states required to redirect funds if conditions fall below the minimum. MAP-21 requires states to maintain minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions, with the possibility of redirecting federal funds if conditions deteriorate. State planning requirements remain largely unchanged, but now include incorporating metropolitan and nonmetropolitan transportation plans into statewide plans. Performance-based approaches are also mandated in planning provisions. MAP-21 introduces a performance-based approach into transportation planning, requiring states to incorporate performance measures and targets coordinated with national planning efforts. It proposes creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size, each with specific technical requirements. The Secretary must establish minimum requirements within a year of enactment. MAP-21 introduces performance-based planning and targets for Tier I MPOs, with regulations to be issued by the Secretary within one year. Tier II MPOs will have more discretion, including optional performance measures and blueprint planning. Both tiers can select projects from their TIPs with the concurrence of the facility owner. MPO designation will now be required in urbanized areas of 200,000 population or more. MAP-21 proposes to require MPO designation in urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more, up from the current requirement of 50,000. MPOs in areas below 200,000 population can be designated by agreement between the governor and local officials, but must meet minimum technical requirements for Tier II MPOs. Existing MPOs in areas under 200,000 population may be terminated unless reaffirmed by the MPO, governor, and approved by the Secretary. The legislation aims to consolidate metropolitan planning within a single MPO in each urban region, but allows for multiple MPOs if deemed appropriate by the governor and existing MPO. H.R. 7 proposes the development of a national strategic transportation plan by the Department of Transportation (DOT), including a list of projects of national significance from states. It also requires a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highways and public transportation systems. H.R. 7 aims to improve the Nation's highway and public transportation systems by implementing national performance measures and targets, state performance measurement systems, and reporting requirements. It also includes measures to address congestion at airports, freight rail corridors, ports, and inland waterways. Additionally, the bill emphasizes the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption. H.R. 7 aims to improve the Nation's transportation systems by implementing performance measures and targets. It emphasizes the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion, pollution, and energy consumption. The bill also proposes changes to the metropolitan transportation planning process, including increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation. Budgetary pressures have increased concern about transportation project resource usage. The federal government's role in project delivery and expediting project delivery through changes in the environmental review process are highlighted in both House and Senate proposals. Activities within the process start during the planning stage and conclude during the preliminary engineering and design stage. Documentation and analysis are prepared to demonstrate project-related impacts. During the preliminary engineering and design stage of a transportation project, documentation and analysis are prepared to identify and address potential impacts on the human, natural, or cultural environment. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements is ensured, which may involve obtaining permits, mitigating effects on historic sites, or exploring project alternatives. During the preliminary engineering and design stage of a transportation project, documentation and analysis are prepared to identify and address potential impacts on the human, natural, or cultural environment. Compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements is ensured, which may involve obtaining permits, mitigating effects on historic sites, or exploring project alternatives. For all proposed federal-aid highway or transit projects, NEPA requires documentation, analysis, and review to consider environmental impacts before final design activities can proceed. Coordination of environmental investigations and compliance with all requirements must be reflected in the NEPA document for approval by FHWA or FTA. Recent legislative efforts have focused on expediting environmental reviews for major transportation projects, primarily addressing NEPA compliance. The House proposal suggests more sweeping changes to the existing process beyond NEPA requirements. The House proposal and MAP-21 aim to expedite highway and transit project delivery by changing environmental compliance requirements. The proposed changes may either accelerate environmental reviews and project delivery or slow them down by removing coordination mechanisms or adding requirements. MAP-21's provisions focus on the environmental review phase of transportation project development. The environmental review process in transportation project development involves identifying and documenting state, tribal, and federal environmental compliance requirements, including those under NEPA. FHWA or FTA must ensure completion of the environmental review process before project activities like property acquisition or construction can proceed. Projects with significant environmental impacts require an environmental impact statement, while those with unclear impacts need an environmental assessment. Projects with unclear environmental impacts require an environmental assessment (EA) to determine their significance. Those that do not have significant impacts are categorically excluded (CEs) from preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or EA. Approximately 90% of highway projects approved annually by FHWA are processed as CEs, while 6% require an EA. Even if a project has \"no significant environmental impact under NEPA,\" it may still need to comply with other environmental laws. The most significant changes in the environmental review process in MAP-21 involve new requirements for issue resolution and financial transfer provisions to ensure timely project completion and resolution of disputes. MAP-21 introduces financial transfer provisions for agencies failing to issue permits or approvals required by federal law. The provisions require a weekly transfer of $10,000 or $20,000 under certain conditions to expedite decision-making on applications. Transfer is mandated 180 days after application completion or final project decision, unless the delay is not the agency's fault. Agencies responsible for approvals may include EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or Department of the Interior. The approval process for DOT projects involves various agencies like EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Delays in approvals can be caused by agency under-staffing or lack of funds. Redirecting funds to expedite one project may slow down other applications. MAP-21 requires DOT to compare completion times of CEs. Under Section 1316 of MAP-21, DOT must compare completion times of environmental assessments and impact statements initiated before and after 2005. The assessments must be reported to Congress within a year of enactment, but no specific funding is provided. Determining completion times accurately may be challenging as start and end dates of individual assessments do not reflect the entire process. The NEPA process completion times can be challenging to determine accurately, especially for projects processed with EAs or CEs. State DOTs do not typically track this information. To meet Congress's directive, DOT may require states to start tracking and reporting this data. This would be an addition to the existing environmental clearance process under MAP-21 provisions applicable to CEs. The MAP-21 provisions applicable to CEs involve directives to DOT to change existing regulatory requirements for projects. The most significant provisions would require DOT to survey state agencies for new CEs, promulgate regulations adding projects to the list of CEs, and move certain projects from requiring documentation to not needing DOT approval. Other provisions specify DOT agency roles in NEPA compliance for multimodal projects. The MAP-21 provisions require DOT to change regulatory requirements for projects, including surveying state agencies for new CEs, adding projects to the list of CEs, and specifying DOT agency roles in NEPA compliance for multimodal projects. Other provisions involve continuing or amending environment-related programs established under SAFETEA, such as authorizing federal transportation funds for dedicated staff at federal agencies to support transportation project planning and delivery. The proposed changes under the MAP-21 provisions include requiring a memorandum of understanding between the agency receiving DOT funds and the state, allowing states to use transportation funds for attorneys' fees, and making the surface transportation project delivery pilot program permanent for environmental reviews. The proposed changes under MAP-21 provisions would require certain determinations by DOT for state participation in the program. Specific environmental provisions in Subtitle C of MAP-21 identify key activities and clarify NEPA compliance requirements for federal highway and transit projects. The proposed changes under MAP-21 provisions would extensively alter NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects. H.R. 7 would raise the threshold for NEPA application to projects costing less than $10 million or with federal funding below 15% of total costs. It would also modify the NEPA compliance process by changing project alternatives, document formats, analysis requirements, evaluation levels, permit timeframes, review deadlines, and legal standards. The House proposal in H.R. 4348 includes environmental streamlining provisions from H.R. 7, with a 270-day deadline for environmental review processes and limits on judicial review. The Senate has substituted MAP-21 language for H.R. 4348 and called for a conference with the House. This inclusion ensures that the House streamlining provisions will not be challenged as outside the scope of differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. MAP-21 includes provisions for state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts, aiming to expedite project delivery by combining design and construction responsibilities. This contract type bridges traditional and design-build methods, allowing for better project understanding and potentially faster completion. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 allow state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts to accelerate project delivery. MAP-21 also increases federal funding share by 5% for highway projects using innovative delivery methods. MAP-21 introduces innovations in transportation projects such as prefabricated bridge elements and digital modeling technologies. It also includes a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects, limited to five states. This program aims to expedite the relocation of individuals from project right-of-ways. The \"Payment Demonstration Program\" aims to expedite the removal of individuals from project right-of-ways. It is a minor change compared to other proposed alternatives for property acquisition and relocation laws. State transportation officials suggest allowing states to use their own laws if they meet federal requirements. The program would essentially rewrite the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), which provides funds for projects reducing transportation-related pollutants. EPA sets air quality standards for certain pollutants under the Clean Air Act, relevant to transportation planning agencies. The Clean Air Act directs the EPA to set air quality standards, including National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants like ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5). Areas meeting NAAQS are in \"attainment,\" while those not meeting standards are in \"nonattainment.\" The CMAQ program provides funds for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas, with goals and criteria remaining largely unchanged under MAP-21. Proposed amendments to the CMAQ program under MAP-21 would change how funding levels are determined and distributed to states. Funding has traditionally been based on population and pollution levels, but under MAP-21, funding would be tied to previous allocations plus a percentage increase. Under the proposed amendments in \"Senate Bill Highway Formula Programs,\" CMAQ funds allocated to each state would be linked to the amount allocated in FY2009 plus 10% of the apportioned STP funds. These funds would be distributed within each state based on specific limitations and suballocations. States would need to reserve a portion of the funds for projects like transportation enhancements, recreational trails, and activities related to providing transportation choices for pedestrians and cyclists. The CMAQ funds allocated to each state under the proposed amendments in \"Senate Bill Highway Formula Programs\" would be distributed based on specific limitations and suballocations. Half of the funds would be suballocated for projects within designated nonattainment or maintenance areas, with a formula approved by DOT and weighted by population and pollution severity. Additionally, funds would need to be obligated based on population and fine particulate levels, with a portion set aside for low-emissions construction equipment and vehicles. The remaining CMAQ funds would be available for other transportation projects. The CMAQ funds allocated to states would be distributed based on specific limitations and suballocations. Half of the funds would be for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas, with a formula approved by DOT. Additional provisions in MAP-21 may change how the CMAQ program is implemented, including prioritizing projects to reduce pollutants like PM 2.5 and developing cost-effectiveness tables for projects. States and MPOs would need to consider these provisions for eligible projects. Evaluation and Assessment of Projects. DOT and EPA would develop a cost-effectiveness table for projects, to be considered by States and MPOs in performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. Optional programmatic eligibility would allow MPOs to conduct technical assessments for emissions reductions, demonstrating project eligibility. MPOs are required to prepare performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects, with amendments to project eligibility requirements under H.R. 7. The House bill under Section 1108 would amend project eligibility requirements for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. Incentives include tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuels from cellulose, as well as automaker credits under the CAFE program. SAFETEA allowed low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes until FY2009. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 propose extending the authority for low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes, with limitations if lanes become degraded. They also aim to support electric vehicle infrastructure by allowing highway funds for new charging stations. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 propose using highway funds for new charging stations at parking facilities. MAP-21 also amends the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include clean fuel buses and facilities, as well as zero emission buses. The Senate's public transit provisions in Division B of MAP-21 authorize $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs for FY2012 and FY2013. H.R. 7 proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizing $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion for FY2013 through FY2016. It also eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit. The legislation in Division B of MAP-21 proposes renaming the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and authorizing $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs. It eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit and transfers revenue to the highway account. Additionally, $40 billion from the general fund would be transferred to the alternative transportation account, restructuring the federal transit program with a new State of Good Repair Grant Program for fixed guideway public transit. The Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program would distribute competitive grants for the upkeep of fixed guideway systems, funded by the general fund. The High Intensity Motorbus SGR program would distribute funds for public transportation on facilities at least seven years old, funded by the mass transit account. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program would distribute competitive grants for bus upkeep, funded by the mass transit account. Funding for this program, $75 million, would be set aside from the New Starts program. Significant changes include the elimination of the discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program and the consolidation of the Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program with the New Freedom Program. The Senate bill proposes combining the Formula Grants for Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program with the New Freedom Program to create the Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program would be integrated into the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. A new Access to Jobs program would require recipients to allocate 3% of their Urbanized Area apportionments to projects aiding low-income individuals in commuting to work. Additionally, two new programs, the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency, would be established. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes new highway programs including the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program. The emergency relief program would provide funding for disasters, doubling the amount set aside for transit on Indian reservations to $30 million annually. The bill largely maintains the current structure of the federal transit program. The House bill (H.R. 7) largely maintains the current structure of the federal transit program but eliminates some programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combines others into a single program. Funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program would be distributed by formula instead of being earmarked. H.R. 7 proposes changes for transit agencies, including incentives for contracting out bus services and allowing private operators access to federally funded facilities. The Senate bill focuses on funding core capacity improvement projects for existing fixed guideway systems. The bill authorizes funding for core capacity improvement projects in transit agencies, streamlining the New Starts process by reducing stages to project development, engineering, and construction. It eliminates the separate alternatives analysis and requires applicants to initiate the NEPA process. The bill authorizes funding for core capacity improvement projects in transit agencies, streamlining the New Starts process by reducing stages to project development, engineering, and construction. The sponsor must provide necessary information for the Secretary to review project justification and local financial commitment. The project can enter the Engineering Phase after the NEPA process is completed with specific criteria met. Projects meeting requirements can move into a full funding grant agreement for federal funding assistance and construction. Special warrants are available for projects with federal share of $100 million or less or 50% of total project cost. The bill aims to expedite project delivery for transit projects with federal shares of $100 million or less or 50% of the total cost. It eliminates the Small Starts program but introduces a pilot program for innovative project development and financing. The House bill (H.R. 7) makes changes to the New Starts program, maintaining the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects. The House bill (H.R. 7) allocates $150 million for Small Starts projects within the New Starts program. It eliminates the alternatives analysis but requires projects to be evaluated against a no-action alternative. The bill includes provisions for expediting projects, such as using special warrants for faster evaluation. It adjusts project justification criteria by adding private contributions and intermodal connectivity as factors. The Senate bill maintains the prohibition on federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, but allows exceptions for small bus transit systems. Urbanized areas with high unemployment rates can use formula funds for operating expenses for up to three years. The House bill (H.R. 7) would allow transit bus systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more with 100 buses or fewer in peak service to use federal funding for operating expenses. The cost share would be 25% federal and 75% local for systems with 76-100 buses, and 50% federal for systems with 75 or fewer buses. H.R. 7 proposes a cost share of 25% federal, 75% local for transit bus systems with 76-100 buses in peak service. For systems with 75 or fewer buses, the cost share would be 50% federal. The bill also increases the share of funds for ADA paratransit from 10% to 15% for urbanized and nonurbanized areas. Additionally, it calls for the development of a national rail plan to guide future investments in passenger and freight rail. The bill calls for the development of regional rail plans, excluding the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor, to refine the national plan with respect to each region. States may also create state rail plans that further refine the appropriate regional plan. The bill also amends the NEC advisory commission and requires Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service in the corridor. Additionally, it requires DOT to develop guidance on measuring train delays. The bill requires DOT to develop guidance on measuring train delays and conduct a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail. It also aims to establish an equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services controlled by Amtrak and states. The bill aims to establish an equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services controlled by Amtrak and states, with the entity serving as the equipment supplier and manager of standardized cars. It would also amend the capital grant program to include Amtrak as an eligible recipient. Implementation of positive train control could impact domestic car design, as U.S. regulations focus on crash survival rather than crash avoidance, resulting in heavier cars with robust bulkhead requirements. The implementation of positive train control could lead to modifications in U.S. car design to align with foreign requirements, potentially opening up a global market for passenger car equipment. H.R. 7 would repeal the congestion grant program aimed at reducing congestion on high-priority rail corridors. Congress did not provide funding for this program in FY2011 or FY2012. H.R. 7 would amend laws regarding food and beverage service on Amtrak trains, repealing the self-supporting requirement and requiring competitive bidding for the provision of these services. The proposed changes in H.R. 7 include repealing the self-supporting requirement for Amtrak's food and beverage service, implementing competitive bidding for service provision, expanding a federal grant program for relocating railroad lines to include road relocation, and allowing the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program to accept state or local subsidies as collateral. The Senate bill proposes changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), raising the ceiling on freight charges shippers can bring before the STB. It also includes shorter procedural deadlines for rate relief cases and requires the STB to study incorporating railroad asset replacement costs in its annual examination of railroad revenue. The bill H.R. 7 proposes changes to the Surface Transportation Board (STB), including studying railroad asset replacement costs, compiling and reporting railroad service complaints, and reviewing staffing needs. It also repeals a capital grant program for smaller freight railroads and aims to facilitate access to the RRIF loan program. Additionally, the bill addresses the mandate for positive train control (PTC) in response to safety concerns. The Senate bill proposes extending the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology, which relies on radio signaling to prevent train accidents. Railroads have raised concerns about the high cost and feasibility of PTC implementation. The bill also allows PTC implementation to be funded through the RRIF loan program. The Senate bill proposes extending the deadline for implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) technology to December 31, 2018. It also allows PTC implementation to be funded through the RRIF loan program and requires a joint DOT/FCC study of spectrum needs for PTC. The House bill (H.R. 7) extends the PTC deadline to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and eliminates the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals. It gives railroads the option of implementing equivalent safety measures and adjusting installation routes. The Senate bill retains NHTSA grant programs and creates an incentive grant program to discourage texting while driving and cell phone use by drivers under 18. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes consolidating multiple highway safety grant programs into one general program with reduced funding. It also includes provisions to increase civil penalties for vehicle safety violations and require event data recorders in passenger vehicles starting in 2015. Additionally, the bill prohibits federal funding for measuring motorcycle helmet usage rates or creating motorcyclist checkpoints. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants for FY2012 and FY2013 compared to the House bill. Both bills aim to prevent drivers who fail drug and alcohol tests from evading penalties by switching employers.

It authorizes grants of \"not less than $10 million\" for this program and directs DOT to certify oversight organizations' technical capacity. It does not authorize DOT to set safety standards but allows for funds to be spent on safety and state of good repair projects before others. Financial assistance of $4.6 million annually is also authorized for state safety oversight. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 authorize funding for transportation research and education, with MAP-21 allocating $400 million annually and H.R. 7 allocating $440 million annually. Both bills also include provisions for technology deployment programs, competitive grant programs for ITS deployment, and conducting prize competitions to promote transportation innovations. Additionally, both bills direct the Department of Transportation to conduct studies on various aspects of transportation improvement, such as safety, lifecycle cost analysis, reducing congestion, assessing infrastructure investment needs, and financing options. MAP-21 specifically authorizes 35 competitive grants to be awarded annually to universities. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 authorize grants for transportation research and education, with MAP-21 allocating $400 million annually and H.R. 7 allocating $440 million annually. Both bills also include provisions for technology deployment programs, competitive grant programs for ITS deployment, and conducting prize competitions to promote transportation innovations.
