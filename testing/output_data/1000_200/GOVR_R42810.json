    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill impacting various veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by the House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs on multiple provisions from different bills. This report provides information on the provisions by program, benefit, or topic, with section numbers of P.L. 112-154 provided for each change. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the nation's largest integrated direct health care delivery system. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates the nation's largest integrated direct health care delivery system. Veterans' medical care eligibility is based on factors like veteran status, service-connected disabilities, income, and special treatment authority for certain groups of veterans. In 1981, Congress passed the Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-72) to allow VA to treat veterans for disorders related to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation. In 1993, Congress passed P.L. 103-210 to provide health care for Persian Gulf War veterans with medical conditions possibly related to exposure to toxic substances. P.L. 112-154 addressed chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, providing eligibility for VA health care services for certain veterans. P.L. 112-154 addressed chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, providing eligibility for VA health care services for certain veterans stationed there from 1957 to 1987 due to contaminated well water. Eligible veterans and their family members can receive medical care for fifteen specified illnesses. The VA provides health care services for veterans exposed to contaminated well water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina from 1957 to 1987. Eligible family members can also receive care for specified illnesses. The VA is the final payer for eligible family members' health insurance. The State Veterans' Home program is a federal-state partnership for nursing home care facilities, with the VA providing grants and per diem payments to states. State laws govern admission criteria for these facilities. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 equalized the cost of nursing home care for veterans regardless of the setting, allowing the VA to use higher per diem rates when reimbursing State Veterans' Homes. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 equalized the cost of nursing home care for veterans regardless of the setting. P.L. 109-461 allowed the VA to use higher per diem rates when reimbursing State Veterans' Homes for care of veterans with a 70% service-connected disability. However, some state veterans' nursing homes reported receiving smaller reimbursements that did not cover the actual cost of care. P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to enter into contracts with State Veterans' Homes to provide nursing home care for veterans with a service-connected condition or a disability rating of 70% or greater. The VA is required to enter into contracts with State Veterans' Homes to provide nursing home care for veterans with a service-connected condition or a disability rating of 70% or greater. In June 2011, the Government Accountability Office found about 300 sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police, including various types of sexual assault incidents. Many of these incidents were not reported to VA leadership officials or the VA Office of the Inspector General as required. The GAO found that many sexual assault incidents reported to VA police were not reported to VA leadership or the VA Office of the Inspector General due to a lack of centralized reporting system. A policy on reporting and tracking such incidents at VA medical facilities is required by law, with considerations for veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments. An interim report on the policy's development must be submitted to Congress within 30 days of enactment. The VA is required to develop a comprehensive policy for referring veterans to services, with an interim report due to Congress within 30 days. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common injury in OEF/OIF due to blast injuries, improved survival rates, and increased awareness among healthcare professionals. Advances in protective equipment, combat medicine, and air evacuation have reduced the fatality of past injuries. Health care professionals are now more alert to diagnosing traumatic brain injuries (TBI) accurately. Concerns have been raised about the VA's interpretation of providing rehabilitative care to veterans with TBI, potentially limiting vital therapies for physical and cognitive progress. The VA is required to provide rehabilitative care to veterans with TBI to maximize independence and improve mental health. Telemedicine and telehealth technologies support long-distance clinical care and education. Telehealth and telemental health utilize electronic technologies to provide long-distance clinical care and behavioral health services, including assessments, therapy, and psychiatry. Telemental health, also known as telebehavioral health in the Department of Defense, involves clinicians using technology to provide mental health care to patients remotely. The VA has been a leader in telehealth since 1977, using it to reach veterans in rural areas. Research shows telehealth offers benefits and cost-effective care options within the VA system. The VA has been a leader in telehealth since 1977, using it to reach veterans in rural areas. Research shows telehealth offers benefits and cost-effective care options within the VA system. Section 108 of P.L. 112-154 requires VA to carry out a teleconsultation program of remote mental health and TBI assessments in VA facilities. VA is also required to offer training opportunities in telemedicine to medical residents in VA facilities. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for treatment related to a service-connected condition or illness. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated at 50% or more disabled are not charged copayments for treatment. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated at 50% or more disabled are not charged copayments for any treatment, including nonservice-connected conditions. Outpatient services like health fairs, screenings, counseling, and hospice care are also copayment-free. Veterans without service-connected conditions or receiving care for nonservice-connected conditions typically pay $15 for primary care and $50 for specialty care visits. Only one outpatient copayment is charged per day, regardless of the number of visits. The VA provides service dogs to veterans with hearing or mobility impairments under P.L. 107-135. Additionally, service dogs are available for veterans with mental illnesses, including PTSD, under P.L. 111-117. VA is authorized to study the use of service dogs for treatment under P.L. 111-84. The Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 authorized the VA to conduct a three-year research study on using service dogs to treat veterans with injuries or disabilities, including PTSD. Section 109 of P.L. 112-154 allows accredited service dogs access to VA facilities. The Office of Rural Health was established in 2006 to address disparities in service for rural veterans. VA opened three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers in FY2009. The VA established the Office of Rural Health (ORH) in 2006 to address disparities in service for rural veterans. In FY2009, three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers were opened to develop special practices and products for rural veterans. These centers serve as field-based clinical laboratories experimenting with new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 requires these centers to improve the ORH's understanding of challenges faced by rural veterans and identify disparities in healthcare availability. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) gave the VHA authority to bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to help with medical service costs. However, it did not provide specific authority for the VA to retain third-party payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VA to retain third-party payments for medical care in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF), enabling the VA to provide services for veterans without fiscal year limitations. This change in billing from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" was intended to increase collections by receiving higher payments. The Administration's budget in FY2004 requested the consolidation of various medical collections accounts into the MCCF to enhance VA collections. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 recommended depositing funds from multiple former accounts into the MCCF, providing the VA with permanent authority to do so in 2005. Funds in the MCCF are available for veterans' medical services without fiscal year limitations. The VA consolidates funds from multiple accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. Section 111 of P.L. 112-154 mandates a plan for identifying and collecting billable third-party revenue for the MCCF, including effective billing and collection procedures, employee training, revenue goals, and monitoring systems. Additionally, beneficiary travel payments are provided to eligible veterans and family caregivers for VA medical visits. The VA is required to assess the feasibility of treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement in highly rural areas. The reimbursement authority is valid for three years and limited to eligible veterans traveling to and from their nearest Vet Centers. The VA Secretary must issue a report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on the initiative's beneficiaries and analysis. VA currently provides mileage reimbursement, special mode transport, and common carrier services to eligible veterans and beneficiaries. VA is authorized to provide eligible veterans and beneficiaries with mileage reimbursement, special mode transport, and common carrier services when traveling to and from VA or VA authorized health care. Pre-authorization is required for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in cases of medical emergency. VA proposed using local prevailing Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement to address paying higher rates than allowed by Medicare. VA proposed using local prevailing Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement to address paying higher rates than allowed by Medicare. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 gave VA the authority to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged by the ambulance provider or the applicable Medicare rate, but this change did not have the desired effect as it only applied to situations where VA pays for ambulance service before determining the veteran's eligibility. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 authorized VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or local Medicare rate. This new reimbursement methodology applies to all ambulance transportation except for non-VA emergency care of nonservice-connected conditions approved for payment. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 established means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans report household income to determine eligibility for health care and copayments. P.L. 112-154 authorizes VA to use the veteran's household income for eligibility. P.L. 112-154 also makes changes to the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program for veterans and servicemembers with service-connected disabilities. The Specially Adapted Housing Program offers grants for veterans and active duty servicemembers to purchase or remodel homes to fit their needs. There are two grant programs within the SAH Program, one for veterans with mobility impairments and another for veterans who are blind or have lost the use of their hands. The grants can also be used to adapt the home of a family member where a veteran is living indefinitely. The dollar limit for mobility impairment grants is higher than for other grants, and both types are available to veterans with severe burn injuries. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands qualifying disabilities for grants to cover veterans or servicemembers who have lost use of one or more lower extremities. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands qualifying disabilities for grants to cover veterans or servicemembers who have lost use of one or more lower extremities affecting balance and propulsion, requiring aids for ambulating. Section 203 changes the measure of blindness for grants, and Section 204 increases the maximum assistance amount to $63,780. The Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act (P.L. 110-157) increases assistance grants to $63,780 for \u00a72101(a) and $12,756 for \u00a72101(b). The VA Secretary adjusts award limits annually based on a cost-of-construction index. The new law aligns with FY2012 adjusted limits. Veterans can use grants to modify family members' homes temporarily. Section 205 of P.L. 112-154 addresses Temporary Residence Adaptation grants. The Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant under Section 205 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum grant amounts and extends the authority for TRA grants until December 31, 2022. The TRA grants can now be adjusted annually based on a cost-of-construction index, allowing veterans to modify family members' homes temporarily. The SAH law limits grant funding for home adaptations, but allows exceptions for homes damaged in disasters. Disabled veterans can receive funds for a new home if their previously-adapted home is damaged. The maximum benefit is based on repair costs or statutory grant maximums. The VA Loan Guaranty Program is a mortgage insurance program for eligible veterans, where the VA guarantees to pay lenders a portion of losses in case of borrower default. Veterans must occupy the property as their home to be eligible, and fees are based on factors like down payment amount and military service history. The VA Loan Guaranty Program eligibility criteria have been expanded to include surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. Previously, only surviving spouses of veterans who died from their service-connected disabilities were eligible for the loan guaranty. The VA Loan Guaranty Program eligibility criteria have been expanded to include surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. If the veteran was continuously rated totally disabling for a certain period before death, the surviving spouse may qualify for the loan guaranty without paying the guaranteed loan fee. Additionally, changes have been made to the housing occupancy requirement to allow spouses or dependent children of veterans called away for active duty to satisfy the occupancy requirement. The VA Loan Guaranty Program now includes surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. Changes in P.L. 112-154 also allow dependent children of veterans called away for active duty to meet the housing occupancy requirement. Additionally, the law makes permanent programs for guaranteeing adjustable rate mortgages and modifies when veterans with service-connected disabilities may have the loan guaranty fee waived. The VA Loan Guaranty Program now includes surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. Changes in P.L. 112-154 also allow dependent children of veterans called away for active duty to meet the housing occupancy requirement. Additionally, the law makes permanent programs for guaranteeing adjustable rate mortgages and modifies when veterans with service-connected disabilities may have the loan guaranty fee waived. Disability compensation is now based on pre-discharge examination or review of existing medical evidence to avoid long waits. Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 addresses guaranteed loan fees, maximum guaranty amount, and loan sales securities. It extends current loan fees until October 1, 2017, reinstates higher loan guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas, and addresses limits set by P.L. 110-389. The VA Loan Guaranty Program temporarily increased the maximum guaranty amount for housing in high-cost areas through P.L. 110-389 and P.L. 112-154. The maximum guaranty amount is set at 25% of the higher of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit or 125% of the area median home price, not exceeding 175% of the limit determined under the Freddie Mac statute. The VA Loan Guaranty Program increased the maximum guaranty amount for housing in high-cost areas to 175% of $625,500, or $1,094,625. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans was extended through December 31, 2016. The VA uses the Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process to lease unused property for purposes that benefit veterans, such as housing, child development centers, parking facilities, and more. The EUL program now restricts properties to be used for only one purpose. Section 211 of P.L. 112-154 changes the EUL program to allow properties to be used only for \"supportive housing\" for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. The VA must release an annual report on consideration received for EULs, which can only be cash at fair value. Leases entered before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws. The VA releases an annual report on consideration received for EULs, which must be cash at fair value. The Grant and Per Diem program authorizes grants for transitional housing and services for homeless veterans. Grantees are reimbursed for providing housing and supportive services, not exceeding the current per diem rate for care. The VA Grant and Per Diem program provides housing and supportive services to homeless veterans, with grantees reimbursed for care costs up to the current per diem rate of $38.90 per day. Section 301 of P.L. 112-154 allows grants for construction of service centers and transitional housing, and permits the use of Low Income Housing Tax Credits in conjunction with VA funding. Grantees can also receive funds from other sources if the project is operated by a private nonprofit organization. The VA Grant and Per Diem program, authorized at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent years, targets homeless veterans with special needs. It now includes male veterans with dependent children and no longer requires grantees to already be providers. The VA Grant and Per Diem program, authorized at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent years, targets homeless veterans with special needs. It now includes male veterans with dependent children and no longer requires grantees to already be providers. The program allows funds to be used for services to dependents of homeless veterans and extends the authorization level for the Special Needs grant through FY2013. Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program now includes all homeless veterans, not just those with serious mental illnesses. HUD-VASH is a collaborative program between VA and HUD. Section 302 of P.L. 112-154 expands the HCHV program to include homeless veterans, regardless of mental illness. HUD-VASH is a joint effort between VA and HUD, providing housing vouchers for homeless veterans. Section 304 of P.L. 112-154 allows VA to contract with other entities to help veterans find housing and connect them with services. The VA may contract with outside service providers to assist eligible veterans in finding housing in cases of housing shortages or impracticality for the VA to provide assistance. P.L. 112-154 extends authorization for programs like HVRP and SSVF to help homeless veterans find employment and provide support for very low-income veterans and their families. P.L. 112-154 extends HVRP authorization through FY2013 at $50 million/year and SSVF program at $300 million for FY2013. DEA provides educational assistance to servicemembers' dependents. Section 401 of P.L. 112-154 allows DEA-eligible individuals to combine benefit programs for up to 81 months of entitlement. The amendment allows eligible individuals to combine benefit programs for up to 81 months of entitlement, starting from October 1, 2013. It applies to the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program. The Secretary of Defense and VA Secretary are required to report annually to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA. The Defense report must include information on benefit levels, recruitment, retention, and education costs. The VA report must cover benefit usage, expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations for administrative and legislative changes. Section 402 repeals the requirement for biennial reports from the Secretary of Defense and VA Secretary on the MGIB-AD. Claimants appealing a decision on benefits can submit additional evidence, which may cause delays as the BVA waits for the local VA office to review it. Under Section 501 of P.L. 112-154, the local VA office's initial review of newly submitted evidence will be automatically waived unless requested by the claimant. If no request is made, the BVA will review the evidence. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 grants the VA authority to allow court-appointed representatives or caregivers to sign applications on behalf of claimants for benefits adjudication. Section 505 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement when there is enough evidence for maximum benefit award. It also encourages claimants to submit relevant private medical records without burdening them. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA; P.L. 106-475) requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims. If a veteran receiving benefits dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to the benefits for the month of death. If a pending claim is granted after the veteran's death, the spouse can receive additional benefits for that month. The VCAA requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims, including how the VA can assist in gathering information. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to print the notice on claims forms and removes the requirement to send the notice only after a claim is filed. The VA can now print the notice on claims forms and provide notification through efficient means, including electronic communications. The VCAA notification requirements can be waived if the VA will grant the highest evaluation to the veteran. The Fully Developed Claim process expedites disability claims, with the effective date being the date the VA receives the claim application. The VA has implemented a process to expedite disability claims by allowing veterans to establish an effective date for their claim up to one year before the VA receives the application. This change is only available for original claims received before August 7, 2015. The VA Secretary and Social Security Commissioner must use joint application forms for survivor benefits. Filing the form with either agency applies for benefits with both. Section 503 allows, not requires, the development of the joint form. Any document indicating intent to apply for benefits is considered an application with both agencies. The Improved Disability Pension program provides monthly cash benefits to low-income elderly or disabled veterans. The Improved Disability Pension program offers monthly cash benefits to low-income elderly or disabled veterans. Section 508 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum annual benefit for married veteran couples requiring regular aid and attendance. The maximum annual benefit is raised to $32,433. Income received by the veteran or surviving spouse reduces the cash benefit amount. Reimbursements for casualty losses are excluded from income calculations for benefit purposes. Section 509 of P.L. 112-154 expands this exclusion to include reimbursements for other purposes. Section 509 of P.L. 112-154 expands the exclusion for reimbursements for expenses for replacement or repair of property due to accident, theft, or casualty loss. Disabled veterans and servicemembers may receive financial assistance from the VA for purchasing automobiles or adaptive equipment. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA Secretary to provide assistance for the purchase of a second automobile if the first one was destroyed by a disaster and not covered by insurance. The VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Program offers employment services for veterans with disabilities. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 expands provisions for veterans affected by disasters, allowing for extended subsistence allowances. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 extends subsistence allowances for veterans affected by disasters, allowing for up to four months of support beyond program completion. It also waives the annual participation limit for veterans displaced by disasters. Additionally, the law now allows for increased restrictions on public demonstrations at veterans' funerals. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 increases time, place, and manner restrictions on demonstrations during funerals of servicemembers and veterans at Arlington National Cemetery and other VA-controlled cemeteries. Demonstrations are now restricted 120 minutes before and after a funeral, with increased minimum distance requirements. Section 602 of P.L. 112-154 prohibits the reservation of gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery before an individual's death, with the President having the authority to waive this prohibition. The Secretary of the Army can designate areas and establish monuments to honor missing veterans and servicemembers. Section 604 of P.L. 112-154 outlines requirements for establishing monuments at Arlington. A monument in memory of veterans and servicemembers missing in action or with unavailable remains can be established at Arlington National Cemetery. The 25-year requirement for establishing a monument can be waived by the Secretary of the Army after public and congressional notification. A monument sponsored by a nongovernmental entity and paid for from public sources may be established after providing an independent study of other locations and consulting with relevant committees. The Secretary of the Army consults with the Commission of Fine Arts and the Advisory Committee on Arlington National Cemetery for monument placement. Notice must be given to congressional committees for approval within 60 days. The VA provides certificates to eligible survivors of deceased veterans discharged under honorable conditions. Military personnel who die during active service are not eligible for the certificate. Section 603 of P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility for the Presidential Memorial Certificate to persons who die in active military, naval, or air service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers in the event that their military service impedes their ability to meet financial obligations. The SCRA suspends civil claims against servicemembers and protects them from default judgments, including provisions that prohibit eviction from rental or mortgaged property. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for military members, including a 6% cap on interest, eviction prevention, and insurance safeguards. Amendments have been made since 2003, with recent changes extending mortgage and foreclosure protections until December 31, 2014. Section 710 of the SCRA amended mortgage and trust deed provisions to protect servicemembers from foreclosure during and one year after active duty. It prevents vendors from taking action without court approval if the servicemember is unable to make payments due to military service. Section 701 of the SCRA prohibits foreclosure on a servicemember's property during and one year after military service without court approval. The Comptroller General must report to Congress on these protections within 540 days. Section 703 requires the VA Secretary to submit a plan within 180 days to evaluate and train employees processing disability claims. Section 502 of the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 grants the VA special authority for competitions and awards to small businesses owned by service-disabled and other veterans. Eligibility for contracting preferences is limited to firms listed in a VA database, with misrepresentation leading to debarment. Section 502 of the 2006 Veterans Benefits Act allows the VA to grant preferences to veteran-owned small businesses. Misrepresentation of status can lead to debarment, which is imposed for punishment purposes. Amendment in P.L. 112-154 clarifies that debarment is only for willful misrepresentation. Section 706 of the 2006 Veterans Benefits Act amends Section 502 to specify that debarment for misrepresentation of status must be \"willful and intentional.\" It sets a minimum debarment period of five years and mandates specific time frames for initiating and completing debarment actions. Additionally, it includes provisions for treating principals of debarred firms. Section 706 of the 2006 Veterans Benefits Act requires debarment for misrepresentation to be \"willful and intentional\" with a minimum period of five years. The VA Secretary must report on conferences costing $20,000 or more with 50 or more attendees within 30 days of each fiscal quarter. Federal contractors with contracts over $100,000 must report annually on employment and veteran numbers to the Department of Labor. Federal contractors with contracts over $100,000 must report annually to the Department of Labor on total employment, new employees, and the number of qualified veterans. The DOL Secretary is required to establish a website for public disclosure of this information. Additionally, the VA Secretary is directed to establish the VetStar program to recognize businesses' contributions to veterans' employment."
