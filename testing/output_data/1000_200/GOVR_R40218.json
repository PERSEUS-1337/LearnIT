    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. States have developed independent living programs with funding from CFCIP to help youth attain self-sufficiency. Child welfare agencies are directed to assist older youth in transitioning from care with written case plans outlining services for independent living. Despite these efforts, research shows that current and former foster youth face challenges compared to the general population. Research has shown that former foster youth face difficulties in transitioning to adulthood, such as forgoing higher education, experiencing fair or poor health, becoming homeless, and relying on public supports. Efforts by policy makers and child welfare advocates have brought attention to these challenges, leading Congress to focus on ensuring youth have support systems in place even after reaching the legal age of majority. The 110th Congress passed the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 to provide support for older youth in foster care. The 113th Congress also held hearings on child welfare topics focusing on older youth. The 113th Congress passed the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) to protect older youth in foster care and promote normalcy. This report addresses issues faced by older youth transitioning from foster care into adulthood, focusing on the implementation of P.L. 110-351 and P.L. 113-183. The implementation challenges of extending foster care to older youth under P.L. 110-351 include states hesitancy due to cost despite federal assistance. States must assist youth in developing a transition plan within 90 days of exiting care, engaging adults for meaningful connections upon emancipation. Emancipated youth face challenges in forming permanent connections with caring adults, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Little is known about their outcomes as they transition from foster care, but a new national database may provide insight into areas such as education, employment, and contact with social services and the criminal justice system. Concerns also exist about youth in foster care being vulnerable to child sex trafficking. The report discusses concerns about youth in foster care being vulnerable to child sex trafficking and the requirements for child welfare agencies to serve these youth. It also includes discussions on the implementation of federal child welfare policies for transitioning youth and ongoing issues. The report provides data on the declining number of children in foster care over the past decade. In FY2002, there were approximately 523,000 children in foster care, compared to 397,122 in FY2012. The percentage of older children in care increased from 29% in FY2002 to 35% in FY2010, then decreased to 34% in FY2012. The number of older youth exiting care when they reached the state's legal age of majority also followed a similar trend, with over 20,000 children \"aging out\" of foster care in FY2002. In FY2002, over 20,000 children \"aged out\" of foster care, making up 7% of all children who exited care that year. The number of youth aging out increased each year until FY2010, when slightly more than 26,000 youth aged out, making up 11% of all children who exited that year. However, the number of youth emancipating reached a recent low of 23,396 (10%) in FY2012. Research shows that youth who spend their teenage years in foster care tend to have more negative outcomes in adulthood compared to their peers. The Midwest Evaluation study is tracking outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The Midwest Evaluation study tracked outcomes of former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Surveyed youth entered care before age 16 and responded to questions in five data collection waves. Results at age 26 showed that former foster youth had more negative educational and employment outcomes compared to their peers in the general population. Former foster youth in the Midwest Evaluation study had lower educational and employment outcomes compared to their peers. They faced barriers to enrolling or staying in school, had lower college degree attainment rates, and lower current employment rates with a mean annual income of $13,000. The state child welfare agency is responsible for their care and placement. The child welfare agency is responsible for the care and placement of children removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect. They use federal and state funds to reunite children with their parents or find them a permanent home. States must meet certain criteria to receive federal funds for foster care programs. The state must have a written case plan for each child in foster care, detailing placement and services for a permanent home. The plan must be reviewed every 6 months by a judge or panel, and annually by a judge considering the child's permanency plan. For youth 14 and older, the plan must include programs for transitioning to adulthood. The state child welfare agency must include in a child's case plan a document listing rights related to education, health, visitation, and court participation for children in foster care at age 14 or older. The child must acknowledge receipt of the rights list, and be consulted in the development and revisions of their case plan and permanency plan. The child in foster care has the right to be involved in the development of their case plan and permanency plan, including choosing members of the planning teams. They can also have an advisor to apply the \"reasonable and prudent parenting standard\" for extracurricular activities. States must help youth create a transition plan for housing and other needs after emancipation from foster care. Permanence for children in foster care may involve returning to parents or finding alternative safe arrangements. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares older youth in foster care for emancipation. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) addresses concerns raised in hearings and makes significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, focusing on older youth in foster care and those transitioning out of care. States are authorized to extend foster care to youth age 18 and older, until age 19, 20, or 21. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) provides protections for older youth in care, promotes \"normalcy\" for children in foster care, and requires child welfare agencies to respond to sex trafficking of children. States and Indian tribes can seek federal funds for room and board costs for eligible children in out-of-home foster care under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Funding for the Title IV-E foster care program is appropriated from the general treasury on an open-ended basis. The Title IV-E foster care program provides funding from the general treasury on an open-ended basis to reimburse states for eligible expenditures made on behalf of eligible children. Eligibility criteria include being in state care, meeting certain age and family structure requirements, and being placed in a licensed setting. The Title IV-E foster care program provides funding to states for eligible children in foster care placements. States must make reasonable efforts to secure a permanent home for the child and provide a foster care maintenance payment for their care and safety. This payment covers food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, insurance, visitation travel, and school enrollment travel. Federal reimbursement is available for these costs. The Title IV-E foster care program provides funding for eligible children in foster care placements, covering various expenses such as food, clothing, shelter, and school supplies. Federal reimbursement is available for these costs, and states must also promote the safety and well-being of all youth in care. Children remain eligible for foster care maintenance payments until their 18th or 19th birthday if still in school, with the option to extend payments until age 21 starting in FY2011. States and tribes may seek reimbursement for youth in foster care until age 21 if they are completing high school, enrolled in post-secondary education, participating in employment programs, or have a medical condition preventing participation. The law does not specify employment barrier removal programs or medical criteria. States can seek federal foster care reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. Child care institutions must be licensed and have no more than 25 children. Reimbursement is also available for youth aged 18 or older in foster care placed in supervised settings. Beginning in FY2011, states can seek reimbursement for youth aged 18 or older in foster care placed in supervised settings for independent living. HHS issued program instructions in July 2010, encouraging states to extend foster care assistance until age 21. States must provide a rationale if they choose to extend assistance to a lower age. Funding under Title IV-E is dependent on an approved plan outlining the criteria for extending assistance. The administration of programs under Title IV-E is contingent upon an approved plan. States and tribes must establish criteria to determine if young people meet employment or education conditions, or have a medical condition that prevents them from pursuing these options. They must also verify that youth continue to meet the conditions while in care. Examples of education or employment activities for youth in extended care include finishing high school, preparing for the GED exam, enrolling in college or vocational school, attending Job Corps programs, and working part-time or full-time. HHS advises states and tribes to establish requirements for extended foster care, such as providing assistance to youth enrolled in post-secondary education. Program instructions address criteria for Title IV-E foster care eligibility for young people reaching the state age of majority. To be eligible for federal foster care, young people reaching the state age of majority must meet Title IV-E requirements regarding income, assets, and living arrangements at the time of removal from their home. Youth entering or reentering care at age 18 or older are assessed based on their own circumstances, regardless of their parents or guardians. Youth in extended care must have entered via a court order or voluntary placement agreement. The program instructions state that youth in extended care must have entered via a court order or voluntary placement agreement. For youth who came into care before age 18 and remain in care after age 18, the court ordered removal or voluntary agreement still stands. Criteria for removal for youth aged 18 or older include a court determination of welfare or signing a voluntary placement agreement meeting Title IV-E requirements. This provision requires a judicial determination that remaining in care is in the child's best interest. Title IV-E requirements for voluntary placement agreements state that a judicial determination is needed if Title IV-E payments extend beyond the first 180 days. State and tribal child welfare agencies can meet placement and care rules for older youth through written authorization or court orders. Youth in extended care can be placed in independent living or foster family homes. HHS does not currently have regulations on living arrangements. The program instructions allow states and tribes to develop supervised independent living settings for youth, such as host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Child welfare agencies must ensure that youth in these settings have opportunities to form connections with caring adults. Child welfare agencies are advised to ensure youth in supervised independent living settings have opportunities to connect with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be paid directly to young people in independent living. States and tribes must apply case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care in a developmentally appropriate manner. Case plans for youth age 18 and older should address their needs and be developed jointly with the youth. The case plan and review requirements for youth age 18 and older should address their needs, with benchmarks indicating when independence can be achieved. Periodic reviews every six months should focus on the youth's safety in their placement. States and tribes should make efforts to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months for older youth in court-ordered placements, reflecting goals of emancipation or independence. The court can determine efforts to finalize a permanency plan without a hearing for children in foster care. The court overseeing children in foster care can determine efforts to finalize a permanency plan without a hearing. States and tribes are not required to fulfill IV-E requirements for youth ineligible for federal foster care, but must continue for children under 18. Medicaid eligibility is extended to youth in care after age 18. The guidance extends Medicaid eligibility to youth in care after age 18, with nearly half of jurisdictions amending their plans to extend foster care until age 21. 18 states and the District of Columbia have approved plans, with two other states under review. Indiana and Nebraska extend care until ages 20 and 19, respectively. Nebraska enacted legislation in 2013 to extend care. Indiana and Nebraska extend foster care until ages 20 and 19, respectively. Nebraska enacted legislation in 2013 to extend care to 21, with HHS reviewing this change. Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia have specific conditions for youth to remain in care, such as being in school or completing a program. Other states considering extending care need to consider various factors. States like Indiana and Nebraska have extended foster care until ages 20 and 19, respectively. Factors to consider when extending care include outcomes of youth, costs, which youth can stay, court oversight, rethinking care, older youth returning to care, placement in foster care settings, and types of independent living placements. Research on youth who emancipate from care is limited, with the Midwest Evaluation study showing that youth in care past age 18 had more positive outcomes while still in care. The study examined outcomes for former foster youth in three states: Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Remaining in care appeared to be associated with higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after age 18 was associated with a $470 increase in average annual earnings. In Illinois, youth in care had higher average annual earnings with each additional year in care after age 18 associated with a $470 increase. They were also 38% less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19 and more likely to receive transitional living services between ages 19 and 21. Youth in Illinois who aged out of care were more likely to have received transitional living services between ages 19 and 21, funded through the CFCIP. However, two years after aging out, they were no more likely than their peers to have earned a two- or four-year degree, possibly due to losing access to supportive services. These young people may have had to focus on meeting basic needs like housing, despite assistance from programs like the Chafee ETV program. States face challenges in extending care to youth aging out of foster care due to budget constraints. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests convening a planning group of stakeholders to address this issue. States can convene a planning group of stakeholders to review federal requirements and options for extending foster care to youth aging out. They should consider existing supports, reach agreement on key design issues, project costs, and consider next steps. Studies show significant advantages for youth remaining in foster care after age 18. Extending foster care or providing transitional living services can offset costs to society, such as prison admissions and welfare payments. A study on extending foster care in Illinois estimated an annual cost of $20,800 per youth. Researchers estimated the annual cost of extending foster care in Illinois to be about $20,800 per youth, with potential benefits including increased earnings from attending college. The analysis showed an average return of $2 for every $1 spent on youth in care, resulting in approximately $72,000 additionally earned over their lifetime. However, the analysis did not consider certain costs to state child welfare agencies or courts. The analysis did not examine the potential benefits of extending foster care, such as higher tax revenues and reductions in homelessness. The cost of providing foster care to eligible youth after age 18 is likely a consideration for most states, with only partial reimbursement from the federal government for state foster care expenditures. Eligibility determination and data collection costs are counted as administrative costs. The federal government partially reimburses state foster care expenditures for Title IV-E eligible children and youth based on income/assets tests, family structure rules, and placement criteria. Reimbursement rates are tied to a state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, ranging from 50% to 73%. Program administration costs are reimbursed at 50%, including child placement activities. The federal government reimburses state foster care expenditures for Title IV-E eligible children and youth based on income/assets tests, family structure rules, and placement criteria. Reimbursement rates range from 50% to 73%. States may choose to cover only IV-E eligible youth due to expenses, raising equity concerns if care is extended only to certain youth meeting eligibility criteria. States extending care to youth beyond age 18 may establish different reimbursement levels and services based on Title IV-E eligibility. Eligible youth can remain in care by meeting certain criteria, but some states restrict eligibility based on specific activities, raising equity concerns. The federal reimbursement for extending foster care may restrict eligibility based on certain activities, raising equity concerns. States may limit extended care to youth in post-secondary education, potentially disadvantaging those who choose to work instead. Federal child welfare law empowers state courts to oversee child placement and permanency goals. State courts play a crucial role in overseeing child placement and permanency goals, conducting regular case reviews every six months to ensure safety and progress towards addressing the reasons for entering care. A permanency plan must be established within 12 months of a child entering foster care, determined in a court hearing or by an administrative body. The court or court-appointed/administrative body must review the permanency plan for a child in care every 12 months. HHS requires case review system protections for all children under 18 and those 18 and older who are IV-E eligible. Children ineligible for IV-E may not be subject to the same court oversight. The Departmental policy allows states to exclude youth over 18 not receiving Title IV-E payments from case review and protections. Permanency hearings are not required for youth under voluntary placement agreements, but a case review must be done every six months. States extending care beyond age 18 may provide different levels of services based on IV-E eligibility, leading to varying levels of oversight and support for non-IV-E eligible youth. The American Bar Association recommends legislation to ensure juvenile court involvement for older youth in care beyond age 18, to hold child welfare agencies accountable. This addresses concerns about oversight and support for non-IV-E eligible youth in extended care. The ABA recommends legislation for juvenile court involvement beyond age 18 to hold child welfare agencies accountable. It also advocates for older youth in care to be actively involved in their hearings. Stakeholders suggest rethinking support for foster youth aged 18 and older. The Jim Casey Foundation aims to support children and youth in foster care and those aging out. Foster youth face challenges when transitioning out of the system at 18, lacking necessary support for a successful transition to adulthood. Extended care for foster youth should be developmentally appropriate to provide the needed services for a healthy and productive future. Extended care for foster youth should be developmentally appropriate, geared towards young adults, and take into account the trauma and loss they have experienced. Research on adolescent brain development shows the need for strong social supports during the transition to adulthood, allowing for opportunities to learn from mistakes and take on increasing responsibility. Permanent connections should also be facilitated for these young individuals. Extended care for foster youth focuses on assisting young people in developing permanent connections and skills for healthy relationships. This approach emphasizes the youth's autonomy in choosing who they want to connect with and may involve graduated levels of supervision and support. Case planning is redesigned to allow young people to take on roles and responsibilities at an earlier age, leading to increased autonomy and building social networks. The Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago conducted a study on factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 in Illinois. In Cook County, over 81% of youth remain in care beyond age 18, compared to the three other regions where only 54% remain. The study by Chapin Hall in Illinois identified factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21, including juvenile courts retaining youth, lack of understanding of laws and policies, limited foster care placements, and the importance of stable support for youth. Factors influencing youth leaving care before age 21 in Illinois include limited foster care placements, the importance of stable adult relationships, and youth attitudes towards staying in care. These factors may be relevant to other states that do not extend care beyond age 18. States and tribes can extend foster care assistance to youth aged 18 or older who emancipate from foster care, allowing them to return to care up to age 19, 20, or 21. A 2014 report by the Government Accountability Office found that 19 states have policies in place for young people to leave and re-enter care. The Government Accountability Office found that all states have policies to extend federal foster care, allowing youth to leave and re-enter care. In 12 states, youth can stay in care under voluntary placement agreements. For those over 18, they may live independently in supervised settings. HHS has not issued regulations on independent living settings, leaving guidance unclear on oversight. States with foster youth in independent living settings face several considerations, such as whether the child welfare agency should purchase or contract for living units, and how to screen other residents. Advocates emphasize the importance of youth learning adult skills while still receiving state support. When foster youth are in independent living settings, considerations include contracting for living units, screening residents, rent and utilities coverage, case worker visits, responsibility for lease violations, progression to different settings, maintenance payment management, and support for transitioning back home. In independent living settings for foster youth, states provide supervised housing options such as apartments, homes, and dorms. Challenges include finding appropriate housing and assisting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Youth may live with roommates but not with parents or significant others from whom they were removed. Independent living requirements vary by state. In independent living settings for foster youth, states provide supervised housing options such as apartments, homes, and dorms. Youth may live with roommates but not with parents or significant others from whom they were removed. The state does not require independent living settings to be licensed, and each county has discretion on handling background checks for roommates and safety concerns. Monthly federal assistance is generally not available for youth who have left foster care for adoption or kinship guardianship after turning 18, but some states provide subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday. States and tribes can provide adoption or kinship guardianship subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after age 16, up to age 21 if they are enrolled in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. Assistance can continue past age 21 for youth with medical conditions or disabilities. The child must have a mental or physical handicap that warrants assistance for adoption or kinship guardianship. States can extend foster care beyond age 18 to provide subsidies for youth up to the age they have elected. Kinship guardianship assistance can include biological, legal, tribal kin, extended family, friends, or other \"fictive\" kin. States and tribes can establish conditions for eligibility. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth expected to emancipate from foster care, assisting with employment, postsecondary education, and emotional well-being. States and tribes can establish eligibility conditions for kinship guardianship, including requirements like a child being in care for over six months or targeting specific age groups. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) supports youth aging out of foster care by helping them with employment, education, emotional support, and transitioning to adulthood. States and tribes can provide independent living services to youth leaving foster care after age 16 for adoption or kinship guardianship. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act added a new purpose area to the Chafee program. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act added a purpose area to the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) to ensure children likely to remain in foster care until 18 have opportunities for age-appropriate activities. States receive funding based on foster care population share, with a minimum amount set. States must provide a 20% match for independent living programs for youth. States have developed independent living programs with funding from the CFCIP, providing services such as housing, career exploration, education, health activities, counseling, mentoring, and financial management training to youth. To be eligible for funds, states must describe their program in their five-year plan, ensuring statewide coverage and serving children of various ages. States must also certify that they meet requirements for youth served and funding usage. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides funding for youth who have emancipated from care or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. Congress authorized $60 million in discretionary funds for the program, with approximately $45 million allocated each year. Vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually per eligible youth can be used for higher education expenses. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program authorizes vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually per eligible youth for higher education expenses. Students must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program. States can provide independent living services to youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18. States can provide independent living services to youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18, reaching age 18 through adoption or kinship guardianship. Independent living services may be available to these youth until age 21, with a focus on connecting them to school, work, and resources. States have discretion in defining which youth are eligible for these services, and may need to assess capacity to serve additional youth. New mandatory funding will be available under the program in FY2020. The Child Welfare Law requires youth in foster care to have a transition plan developed with the assistance of their caseworker. The plan includes options for housing, education, health insurance, mentors, workforce supports, and employment services, to be implemented 90 days before the youth turns 18. This plan must be in place regardless of whether foster care payments are being made or the youth is receiving benefits under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program. The transition plan for youth in foster care must address designating a healthcare decision-maker if needed, and provide options for legal documents like a health care power of attorney. It is separate from the case plan but complements it. The transition plan for youth in foster care is distinct from the case plan but complements it. It includes options for services and supports for when the youth is no longer in state custody. Stakeholders must identify specific options to help youth live independently. The transition plan for youth in foster care requires identifying specific options for independent living, including housing options. It is directed by the youth in consultation with others and is not reviewed by a court. HHS provides guidance on the transition plan to assist young people in transitioning from foster care. Child welfare agencies are encouraged to use transition planning to assist young people in foster care. The transition plan should be started well in advance of the 90-day period before a youth's 18th birthday. Questions arise for youth who emancipate at age 17 without a transition plan, potentially leaving them less prepared than their peers. Thousands of youth emancipate at age 17, which could impact their ability to benefit from the Medicaid pathway for emancipated youth. Transition planning for youth in foster care is crucial, especially for those who emancipate at age 17. Without a transition plan, they may be less prepared than their peers. Guidance from social work emphasizes engaging youth and stakeholders in the process to achieve permanency with caring adults. Plans should focus on the strengths of the young people. Transition planning for youth in foster care is essential for achieving permanency with caring adults. Plans should be youth-directed, focus on their strengths, and involve service providers and stakeholders in the process. States have adopted policies to engage youth in transition planning and provide necessary supports, such as documenting youth input and ensuring key documents are included in the plan. Transition planning for youth in foster care is crucial for achieving permanency with caring adults. Some states require a separate transition plan, with specialists assisting youth. Challenges include staff training, engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing. Hawaii and Nebraska have detailed transition planning processes involving youth and others in \"circles\" to celebrate the young person's transition. In Hawaii and Nebraska, transition planning for youth in foster care involves \"circles\" where youth and others celebrate the young person's transition to adulthood. These conferences are youth-driven and aim to generate options and resources for decision-making and goal-setting. Foster Club in Nebraska provides a transition planning kit with specific roles for the transition plan team and courts, including a checklist revisited at key intervals before aging out. The transition planning for youth in foster care includes a checklist revisited at key intervals before aging out, as well as a \"permanency pact\" to identify individuals who can provide support during the transition. Concerns remain about challenges faced by older foster youth and those who have aged out, such as difficulty in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Youth transitioning from foster care face challenges in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. The effectiveness of services they receive is not well understood, but a new national database may provide insight into their outcomes in education, employment, and contact with social services and the criminal justice system. Congress is focusing on increasing protections for vulnerable children in foster care, including those at risk of going missing or being victims of sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act aims to address these issues. The Families Act (P.L. 113-183), enacted in September 2014, aims to address issues faced by youth aging out of foster care. The Midwest Evaluation study shows that these youth are less likely to have positive relationships with caring adults and are estranged from their biological families. At age 26, former foster youth were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents compared to their peers. Alumni reported varying levels of closeness with their biological family members. Former foster youth in the study were not close to their biological family members, including their mother, father, grandparents, and other relatives. Despite federal protections, there is a need for additional policies to improve the transition to adulthood by encouraging strong connections to caring adults. Child welfare agencies play a role in ensuring permanent adult connections for youth aging out of care. Child welfare agencies play an active role in ensuring permanent adult connections for youth aging out of foster care. Permanency for these youth involves having a committed adult providing a safe and stable relationship, with options including adoption and relationships with teachers or mentors. Child welfare researchers caution against fostering unsustainable relationships with adults for youth in care. Limited research exists on facilitating healthy relationships between foster youth and their biological family. Advocates recommend initiating permanency planning before a youth leaves care to ensure lasting connections. Advocates urge policy makers and practitioners to initiate permanency planning before a youth leaves care. At the child's annual permanency hearing, the judge determines the permanency plan, which can include returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. If none of these options are feasible, \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) may be chosen with a compelling reason documented. APPLA was added to the statute in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 to address concerns about long term foster care. Advocates introduced APPLA as a permanent arrangement for children in foster care, emphasizing the need for a specific adult or couple to provide stable care. However, concerns have been raised that APPLA is being used as a default permanency goal, replacing long-term foster care. APPLA is being used as a default permanency goal for some children in foster care, with concerns raised about its use in place of long-term foster care. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth issued a white paper in December 2010, highlighting the importance of achieving permanency for children in foster care and the need for policy and practice changes to improve outcomes. The white paper suggested two options regarding APPLA: eliminate it as a case plan goal or restrict it to older teenagers after intensive family finding. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act prohibits APPLA for children under 16, effective one year after enactment. The law requires additional requirements for children in foster care with an APPLA plan, ensuring the state continues to seek a permanent family for them. The transition plan aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood. The transition plan requirement aims to help youth establish permanent connections in adulthood by considering local mentoring opportunities and making changes to federal child welfare law to assist youth in achieving permanency. This includes amending written case plan requirements to ensure a permanent living arrangement for children emancipating from foster care and documenting steps taken to find a permanent placement with a family or adult connection. The transition planning process for youth aging out of foster care includes efforts to establish adult connections and permanent living arrangements. States like Texas assist youth in identifying supportive adults for post-care support. The transition planning process for youth aging out of foster care includes efforts to establish adult connections and permanent living arrangements. As part of the youth's case plan, they are asked to identify a supportive adult for post-care support. Foster Club's Permanency Pact helps youth connect with caring adults to provide emotional and tangible support. Efforts to support permanency also include adoption for older youth through projects like Adoption Opportunity Grants. Adoption Opportunity Grants funded projects to demonstrate effective strategies for open adoption and securing permanent connections for older youth in foster care. Federal grants could also support mentoring programs for foster children, with legislation proposed to authorize funding for this purpose. The bills propose to authorize grants for mentoring foster children to support state and local child welfare agencies in promoting safety and well-being. Child victims of sex trafficking may be identified through child protective services, especially among foster care youth vulnerable to trafficking. Youth who run away from foster care are vulnerable to sex trafficking due to limited response capacity of child welfare agencies. Challenges include inadequate training, resources, high caseloads, and the perception that victims should be handled in the juvenile justice system. States may lack mechanisms to identify sex trafficked children not under parental care. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across various sectors to combat child sex trafficking. In the 113th Congress, hearings were held on child sex trafficking and the challenges faced by child welfare agencies. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act was passed to require state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for sex trafficked children. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children who are victims of sex trafficking or at risk of being victims. Procedures must be developed in consultation with various agencies and organizations, and relevant training for caseworkers must be ensured. Agencies must report to law enforcement authorities immediately or within 24 hours of receiving information. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates state child welfare agencies to report child or youth sex trafficking victims to law enforcement within 24 hours. Agencies must also annually report the total number of victims to HHS, which will then report to Congress and the public. HHS is required to submit a report summarizing demographic information and state efforts to provide specialized services for victims. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to report child sex trafficking victims to law enforcement within 24 hours. It also mandates HHS to establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking to advise on policies and best practices for combating domestic sex trafficking of minors. Congress will monitor state implementation of these requirements. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to report child sex trafficking victims to law enforcement within 24 hours. Congress will monitor how states implement these requirements, including providing guidance, serving youth not in foster care, reporting victims to the federal government, and identifying best practices for serving victims. State child welfare agencies are mandated to serve only children and youth victims already in the system. Congress may consider the extent of state implementation of the new law. Pending legislation like H.R. 5081 would require state child welfare agencies to identify and assess reports involving children who are sex trafficking victims. Children in foster care homes due to abuse and neglect may go missing, with limited guidance provided to states on serving missing children. Federal law focuses on children who run away from their placements. Law and policy provide limited guidance to states on serving missing children from foster care, focusing exclusively on those who run away from placements. Some child welfare stakeholders seek a more uniform response. A 2004 survey by the Child Welfare League of America found that many states have policies in place to prevent and recover missing foster care children, but implementation varies across jurisdictions. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act directs state child welfare agencies on locating missing children from foster care and addressing factors contributing to their disappearance, including potential sex trafficking victimization. The law requires agencies to develop protocols for expeditiously finding missing children, addressing reasons for running away, and assessing if they are at risk of sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care, including assessing potential sex trafficking victimization. Agencies must report information on missing children to the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement for inclusion in the FBI's database. Children missing from care raise issues about the role of child welfare agencies and the federal government in responding to these cases. Child welfare agencies are advised to follow best practice guidelines issued by the Child Welfare League of America in 2005. These guidelines recommend procedures such as recruiting and training a competent workforce, involving youth and family members in decision-making, examining the structure of facilities with high runaway rates, and taking corrective action when necessary. Child welfare agencies are advised to follow best practice guidelines to address structural and operational deficiencies that contribute to running behavior of children in care. States may need to consider how they define missing children and whether to report all cases to law enforcement, taking into account the limited resources of smaller agencies. Law enforcement agencies, especially smaller ones, may not have dedicated staff for missing persons cases and may not respond vigorously to certain types of incidents like frequent runaways. Coordination between child welfare agencies, law enforcement, and courts is crucial to prevent children from going missing. Federal child welfare policy outlines general requirements for these agencies. Courts can help prevent children from going missing by collaborating with child welfare agencies and law enforcement. Guidelines from CWLA and NCMEC encourage clear roles and definitions for missing children. State child welfare agencies report on children who run away from foster care placements through AFCARS. Child welfare agencies report on children who run away from foster care placements through AFCARS. Stakeholders have concerns that agencies may limit foster youth's participation in age-appropriate activities due to safety policies. States may need to track and locate children who are missing for reasons like abductions or negligence. Witnesses at a House Ways and Means Subcommittee hearing discussed the restrictions foster youth face in participating in normal activities like sleepovers, dating, driving, working, and sports due to safety policies. They highlighted that teenagers naturally seek independence and may engage in risky behaviors, necessitating a balance between safety and opportunities for foster youth. Prior to the enactment of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183), federal child welfare provisions did not specifically address promoting normalcy for youth in foster care. The law established a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for foster parents and caregivers to allow teenagers in foster care to engage in normal activities while balancing safety concerns. Teenagers exhibit more risk-taking behaviors due to changes in brain development during adolescence, making them more prone to risky behaviors. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act established a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for foster parents and caregivers to enable children and youth in care to participate in age-appropriate activities. Child welfare agencies must provide training on children's developmental stages and how to apply the standard for foster children's participation in various activities. States are required to revise licensing standards for foster family homes and child care institutions. The lack of adequate and affordable housing is a major concern for youth aging out of foster care. Studies have shown that rates of homelessness among former foster youth vary from 11% to 36%, with some youth couch surfing at the homes of family and friends. The Midwest Evaluation found that 24% of 23-year-olds reported being homeless at least once since exiting care. Former foster youth face challenges with housing, with some couch surfing at family and friends' homes. Emancipated youth may struggle due to lack of financial support, ties to family, early parenthood, and involvement with the juvenile justice system. The housing market also plays a role in their ability to secure affordable housing. This can impact their education and employment. States can allocate up to 30% of funds for room and board for youth ages 18 to 21 who age out of care. Former foster youth may struggle with housing challenges, including lack of financial support and ties to family. States can allocate up to 30% of funds for room and board for youth ages 18 to 21 who age out of care. However, these funds alone may not cover housing costs adequately. Nonprofit organizations offer housing programs for former foster youth, including single-site, scattered-site, and host homes. These programs focus on providing independent living supports. Most housing programs for former foster youth focus on independent living support, with options like single-site, scattered-site, and host homes. However, these programs lack rigorous evaluation to determine their effectiveness in preventing homelessness or improving housing stability. States offering extended foster care face challenges in finding suitable housing options, especially for college students during school breaks when campus facilities are closed. Some states require public universities to provide housing for foster youth in college during school breaks. California law mandates housing review for emancipated foster youth in college dormitories to ensure basic housing throughout the academic year. The Higher Education Act authorizes services for foster care youth, including housing support through Student Support Services. The Higher Education Act authorizes services for foster care youth, including housing support through Student Support Services and the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education. This allows for temporary housing during breaks in the academic year for disadvantaged college students who were in foster care or homeless before age 13. However, universities and colleges are not required to use funds for this purpose. The federal law allows owners of properties financed with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits to designate units occupied by low-income students who were in foster care as low-income units. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, or lack support networks. Youth in care and certain other groups are at higher risk of becoming disconnected from employment. Young people who have aged out of care are at greater risk of becoming disconnected from employment and education. A study in three states showed that at age 24, only three out of five emancipated youth were working, with lower earnings compared to their counterparts. Additionally, these youth had substantially lower average monthly earnings than the national average. The average monthly earnings for emancipated youth in three states were significantly lower than the national average of $1,535. Young people who have aged out of care face challenges in education, including multiple school placements, delays in enrollment, and lack of consistent education support. By age 26, only about 7% of youth who aged out of care attained a degree, compared to one-third of the general youth population. Foster care alumni may need additional support to complete their education. Young foster care alumni may require additional support to complete their education, including academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance. Federal and state child welfare laws address the educational needs of youth in or formerly in foster care, ensuring considerations for school proximity, education records, and collaboration with state agencies. The law requires child welfare agencies to work with education authorities to ensure foster children stay in their current school or enroll in a new one if necessary. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin\" at the same rate as foster care payments. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the education needs of vulnerable youth populations, including current foster youth. A summit in November 2011 brought together state teams to promote educational stability and improve outcomes for children in foster care. Teams were tasked with creating a plan for collaboration across systems. The summit in November 2011 brought together state teams to promote educational stability and improve outcomes for children in foster care. Recent legislation aims to improve access to education for children in foster care through federal education law. For example, S. 1094 would require state education agencies to ensure that a child in foster care remains in the same school. The bill aims to ensure educational stability for children in foster care by requiring state education agencies to keep them in the same school or facilitate immediate enrollment in a new school if necessary. It also mandates policies for credit transfer and partial credit for children changing schools. Federal education law addresses postsecondary needs of foster youth through supportive services and eligibility for Trio programs. Homeless children and youth are eligible for federal Trio programs, which provide mentoring, tutoring, and other services. These programs aim to identify potential post-secondary students from disadvantaged backgrounds, prepare them for higher education, and provide support services while in college. The programs include Talent Search, Upward Bound, Student Support Services, and Educational Opportunity Centers. Additionally, the FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to identify if they are or were in foster care. The FAFSA form may be modified to include a box for foster care identification and provide information on federal educational resources. Limited research exists on the effectiveness of independent living services for foster youth, with no national data on their transition to adulthood. The Midwest Evaluation and other studies have focused on the transition for youth in select regions of the country. A new national database, the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), will provide insight into the lives of youth when they leave care, but full implementation will take time. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program is the main source of funding for independent living services for foster youth. States receive $140 million annually for the program, with a 20% match requirement. Based on a 2008 survey, most states spend additional funds beyond the 20% match requirement to provide independent living services to youth. Federal funding alone may not be sufficient for states to carry out their independent living programs effectively. Research on independent living programs is limited, but evaluations of innovative programs are conducted by HHS. HHS contracted with the Urban Institute to evaluate independent living programs funded by P.L. 106-169 for foster youth. The evaluation aimed to assess the programs' impact on key outcomes like education, employment, interpersonal skills, pregnancy rates, and delinquency. 1,400 foster youth were randomly assigned to programs in California and Massachusetts, including employment services, life skills training, and tutoring/mentoring programs. The evaluation of independent living programs for foster youth in California and Massachusetts involved 1,400 participants in intervention and control groups. Surveys were conducted at three points over two years, along with in-person interviews and focus groups. Data on child and family demographics, placement history, health status, and delinquency were analyzed. The evaluation found no statistically significant impacts in the Los Angeles and Kern County programs. The evaluation of independent living programs for foster youth in California and Massachusetts found no statistically significant impacts in the Los Angeles and Kern County programs. However, the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care showed impacts on education outcomes. The Outreach program helps youth prepare for independent living and establish permanent connections with caring adults. It aims to achieve various outcomes such as obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, avoiding high-risk behaviors, and gaining employment. The program provides tailored services and emphasizes a youth development approach. The Outreach program for youth in foster care aims to help them transition to adulthood by providing tailored services and emphasizing a youth development approach. Social workers oversee a small caseload and have regular interactions with the youth to assist them with tasks like obtaining driver's licenses, applying for college, and gaining employment. The program focuses on educational, employment, and other outcomes to support the youth in making positive decisions about their lives. The evaluation of the Outreach program for youth in foster care showed that participants were more likely to enroll and persist in college compared to the control group. They also had better outcomes in remaining in foster care and receiving assistance in various areas. Staying in care and pursuing higher education were found to be closely linked. Overall, the program's youth reported similar outcomes to the control group in other measures. The evaluation of the Outreach program for youth in foster care showed that participants had similar outcomes to the control group in various areas like employment, housing, and delinquency. This raises questions about the effectiveness of independent living programs and classroom-based instruction in helping youth transition to independent living. The program's case workers for transitioning youth showed promise, but overall, the outcomes were not significantly better than for foster youth in areas other than education and remaining in care. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks demographic and outcome information of current and former foster youth to identify promising approaches for serving them. States have reported information to the database as required by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Act. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) tracks demographic and outcome information of current and former foster youth to assess state performance in independent living programs. States collect data on youth receiving independent living services and report this information twice each fiscal year. States collect and report information twice each fiscal year on eligible youth receiving independent living services, tracking their outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21. Financial penalties are imposed on states that do not meet data submission requirements."
