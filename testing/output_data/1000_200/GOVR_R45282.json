    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for registrations. Congress has authorized fee collection since 1954 to help fund EPA's pesticide regulatory activities. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework to partially cover costs of federal pesticide regulation activities. It modified provisions from 1988 to collect maintenance and registration service fees for EPA review of pesticide registrations. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established a fee framework for federal pesticide regulation activities, including reviewing applications, establishing tolerances, and amending labels. PRIA 2 in 2007 added new application categories, revised decision timeframes, and adjusted fee amounts. PRIA 3 in 2012 further amended the pesticide fee framework. The pesticide fee framework was reauthorized and amended by PRIA 3 in 2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 extended the framework, setting annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant. EPA can cancel pesticide registrations if maintenance fees are not paid. Small businesses receive fee reductions under Section 4. Section 4 of the pesticide fee framework authorizes EPA to cancel registrations, provides fee reductions for small businesses, exempts certain public health pesticides from maintenance fees, and deposits collected fees into a fund for EPA's use. Additionally, EPA is required to enhance information systems capabilities and can collect registration service fees starting from FY2018. EPA's authority to collect registration service fees under PRIA 3 is phasing out, with a 70% reduction in fees for FY2019 and expiration of fee collection authority by the end of FY2019. FIFRA Section 33 sets fee amounts for various registration actions, with specified timeframes for completion. EPA may adjust the fee schedule and timeframes as needed. Section 33 of FIFRA sets fee amounts and timeframes for registration actions, with provisions for fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for certain applications. EPA must receive authority to collect registration service fees through annual appropriations. The EPA Office of Pesticide Programs can assess registration service fees even if appropriations are below a certain level. Collected fees are deposited in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" and are subject to annual appropriations for expenditure. The EPA can use fee receipts from the Pesticide Registration Fund for various purposes, including application reviews, worker protection activities, grants, and education programs. The fund is audited annually by the Inspector General in accordance with FIFRA and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. The Inspector General audits the Registration Fund annually in accordance with FIFRA and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. EPA must report findings to Congress and allocate funds for pesticide program activities. Congress appropriated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018, with specific amounts for pesticide programs not readily available. Maintenance fees collected from FY2004 to FY2018 ranged from $21.4 million to $28.7 million. The EPA is authorized to collect registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. Collected maintenance and registration service fees from FY2004 to FY2018 ranged from $10.6 million to $28.7 million per fiscal year, providing one-fourth of the total appropriation for EPA's pesticide program activities. Congress has initiated legislative efforts to reauthorize fee collection, with separate versions of reauthorization legislation passed by the House and Senate awaiting resolution of differences. The House and Senate passed reauthorization legislation for pesticide fees, with the House passing H.R. 1029 and the Senate amending it to the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018. Both versions reauthorize fee collection through FY2023 and FY2025, increasing annual maintenance fees and directing EPA to set aside funds for expedited rulemaking. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 reauthorizes pesticide fees through FY2023 and FY2025, increasing annual maintenance fees and directing EPA to set aside funds for expedited rulemaking and guidance development related to pesticide efficacy evaluation. EPA is required to carry out two final rules by October 1, 2021, with one exception. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 directs EPA to finalize two rules by October 1, 2021, one addressing agricultural worker protection standards and the other focusing on certified pesticide applicators. The amendment also authorizes EPA to propose revisions to the standard regarding application exclusion zones. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report by October 1, 2021, on the use of designated representatives in relation to pesticide application and worker health and safety. The report will include recommendations to prevent misuse of pesticide information. House-passed H.R. 2 would enact H.R. 1029 into law, while the Senate version does not include a similar provision, leading to a request for a conference to resolve differences. The House requested a conference with the Senate on July 18, 2018, to resolve differences in the PRIA reauthorization. Previous PRIA reauthorizations were enacted without roll call votes, showing consensus. Disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of FIFRA regulations have delayed final enactment."
