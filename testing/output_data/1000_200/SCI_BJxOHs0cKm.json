    "content": "The text discusses the relationship between model generalization and the local properties of the optima, specifically focusing on the Hessian matrix. It introduces a metric to score the generalization capability of a model and proposes an algorithm to optimize the perturbed model. The text also mentions the success of deep models in various applications despite having more parameters than training samples. Many deep models with millions of parameters still generalize well, despite classical learning theory suggesting that model generalization is related to the complexity of the hypothesis space. Empirical observations show that over-parameterized models perform well on test data, indicating that the generalization capability is also influenced by the properties of the solution, such as the spectrum of the Hessian matrix. The generalization ability of a model is linked to the spectrum of the Hessian matrix at the solution, with large eigenvalues leading to poor generalization. Various metrics like BID15, BID1, and BID31 measure the \"sharpness\" of the solution, showing a connection with generalization. However, Hessian-based sharpness measures have limitations, especially in explaining generalization for RELU-MLP models. Bayesian analysis, like Mackay (1995), uses Taylor expansion to evaluate model simplicity based on the Hessian of the loss function. The Hessian of the loss function is used to evaluate model simplicity and the \"Occam factor\". BID34 penalizes sharp minima to determine optimal batch size. BID4 connects PAC-Bayes bound and Bayesian marginal likelihood for a new perspective on Occam's razor. BID19, BID7, BID28, and BID29 analyze generalization behavior of deep models using PAC-Bayes bound. Sharp minimums have complex structures in predicted labels, while flat minimums produce simpler classification boundaries. The paper explores the relationship between model generalization and the local \"smoothness\" of a solution from a PAC-Bayes perspective. It shows that the generalization error is linked to the Hessian of the loss function, its Lipschitz constant, parameter scales, and the number of training samples. The generalization error of the model is related to the Hessian, Lipschitz constant, parameter scales, and number of training samples. A new metric for generalization is introduced, leading to an optimal perturbation level selection. This perturbation-based algorithm utilizes Hessian estimation to enhance model generalization in supervised learning within the PAC-Bayes scenario. The PAC-Bayes theory focuses on minimizing expected loss by considering posterior and prior distributions over function classes. It suggests that the gap between expected and empirical loss is bounded by the KL divergence between these distributions. With perturbations around parameters, a PAC-Bayes bound can be established to optimize model generalization. The perturbation bound connects generalization with local properties around the solution parameters. Researchers have found a link between the generalization ability of models and second-order information around local optima. Researchers have found a link between the generalization ability of models and second-order information around local optima. In this section, the local smoothness assumption is introduced along with the main theorem, focusing on the neighborhood set around a reference point. The empirical loss function is required to be Hessian Lipschitz in order to control the deviation of the optimal solution. The Hessian Lipschitz condition is crucial for controlling the deviation of the optimal solution in numeric optimization. It models the smoothness of second-order gradients and is used to ensure the empirical loss function is well-behaved. The uniform perturbation theorem guarantees bounded model weights and loss function values with careful perturbation selection. The expected loss of a uniformly perturbed model is controlled by choosing perturbation levels carefully. The bound is related to the diagonal element of Hessian, Lipschitz constant, neighborhood scales, number of parameters, and number of samples. Perturbation level is inversely related to certain coordinates. Truncated Gaussian perturbation is discussed in Appendix B. If the empirical loss function satisfies the local Hessian Lipschitz condition, perturbation around a fixed point can be bounded. The perturbation of the function around a fixed point can be bounded by terms up to the third order. The \"posterior\" distribution of the model parameters is a uniform distribution with varying support for different parameters. The perturbed parameters are assumed to be bounded. The third-order term is also bounded. The proof procedure involves choosing a prior distribution with bounded model weights and solving for the minimum variance. The lemma guarantees the boundedness of model weights with high probability over n samples. The experiment treats a hyper-parameter as a variable for optimization. In the experiment, a hyper-parameter is treated as a variable for optimization. The spectrum of \u2207 2L is not sufficient to determine generalization power, especially for a multi-layer perceptron with RELU activation. Re-parameterization of the model can scale the Hessian spectrum without affecting model prediction and generalization. The proof details are provided in Appendix C and D. The model does not assume cross entropy loss or RELU-MLP. The optimal perturbation levels scale inversely with parameters, leading to a logarithmic change in the bound. Re-parameterization in RELU-MLP results in a small change in the bound. An approximate generalization metric is introduced assuming local convexity around w*. The text introduces a PAC-Bayes based Generalization metric called pacGen, which assumes local convexity around w* and requires estimating the diagonal elements of the Hessian for real-world data. The metric is calculated on every point and efficiency is improved by approximating certain values. The text discusses experiments on model training with varying batch sizes and learning rates, showing trends in the generalization gap and a proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ). The observations align with previous studies, indicating larger batch sizes lead to increased test loss-training loss gap. Additionally, decreasing learning rates result in a similar trend. The text discusses the impact of learning rate on generalization gap and introduces a metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ). It also mentions the success of adding noise to improve generalization and optimizing perturbed empirical loss for better model generalization power based on the PAC-Bayes bound. The text introduces a systematic way to perturb model weights for better generalization power based on the PAC-Bayes bound. The algorithm perturbs parameters with small gradients and decreases perturbation level as epochs increase. The algorithm perturbs model weights based on PAC-Bayes bound, capturing Hessian variation and decreasing perturbation with epoch. Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet 8 using Wide-ResNet BID36 model are compared.

Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet 8 using Wide-ResNet BID36 model are compared. Initialization and optimization steps are detailed for training with different optimizers and learning rates. Perturbation shows similar effects to regularization, improving test accuracy while decreasing training accuracy. PerturbedOPT outperforms dropout by applying varying perturbations to different parameters. The perturbedOPT algorithm improves test accuracy on the validation set by applying varying perturbations to different parameters based on local smoothness structures. The generalization power of a model is linked to the Hessian, smoothness of the solution, parameter scales, and number of training samples. The best perturbation level scales inversely with the square root of the Hessian, integrating it into the model generalization bound for the first time. This section introduces a new perturbation algorithm that adjusts perturbation levels based on the Hessian, improving model generalization. It also presents a new metric for testing generalization and demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in achieving better performance on unseen data using a toy example with a 5-layer MLP model. The sample distribution is visualized in FIG0 for a 5-layer MLP model with sigmoid activation and cross entropy loss. The model has two free parameters w1 and w2, trained on 100 samples. The loss function is plotted with respect to the model variables, showing multiple local optima. Different colors on the loss surface represent generalization metric scores (pacGen), with smaller values indicating better generalization power. The generalization metric scores (pacGen) are visualized in a 5-layer MLP model with sigmoid activation and cross entropy loss. The metric score around the global optimum suggests poor generalization capability compared to the local optimum. The color projected on the bottom plane indicates an approximated generalization bound. The local optimum has a similar overall bound compared to the global optimum. The labels predicted by the model are plotted for both the sharp minimum and the flat minimum. The sharp minimum approximates the true label better. The prediction from the sharp minimum and flat minimum in the model shows differences in complexity. Truncating the Gaussian distribution is necessary for bounded perturbation. The event probability is bounded by 1/2 using the inverse Gaussian error function. Coefficients are bounded to ensure a constant value. The variance decreases after truncation, affecting the bound approximation. The variance decreases after truncating the Gaussian distribution, affecting the bound approximation. Lemma 4 states that for a convex loss function and bounded model weights, with probability at least 1 - \u03b4 over n samples, a tighter bound can be obtained by optimizing the extra term \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter. The algorithm optimizes the extra term \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter to achieve a tighter bound. The proof involves rewriting inequalities and optimizing \u03c3 to minimize the right-hand side of the equation. The proof is similar to Theorem 6 in BID33, and \u03b7 in Lemma 3 cannot depend on the data. To optimize \u03b7, a grid is built based on specific values. The proof involves bounding the quadratic term on the right side of an inequality by selecting \u03b7. This is related to the generalization ability of the model and holds even with correlated perturbations. Another lemma discusses the \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz condition for local optimal points. The proof of Lemma 5 shows that at the local optimal point, the first order term is zero, even with random perturbations. Dropout and the proposed perturbation algorithm are compared using wide resnet architectures, with dropout being a multiplicative perturbation using Bernoulli distribution. The study compares dropout and a perturbation algorithm using wide resnet architectures. Results are reported for different dropout rates on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Specific model configurations and optimization parameters are detailed for each dataset. The study compares dropout and a perturbation algorithm using wide resnet architectures on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Results show that dropout with a rate of 0.3 works best for CIFAR-10, while a rate of 0.1 is more effective for CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet. The perturbed algorithm outperforms dropout in all experiments on validation/test data sets. The perturbed algorithm outperforms dropout methods by applying different levels of perturbation based on local smoothness structures, while dropout uses a single rate for all parameters."
