It provides funding for research, early career grants, and establishes a new Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy at DOE for energy technology research projects. The America COMPETES Act authorizes programs at government agencies like DOE, NASA, NSF, and ED. It includes funding for research, early career grants, and establishes an Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy at DOE for energy technology research projects. Additionally, it introduces new Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories and education scholarship programs for K-12 STEM teachers. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding for STEM education programs at various government agencies, including scholarships for K-12 teachers, grants for science and math schools, and mentoring for postdoctoral scholars. It also establishes new STEM education activities at ED, DOE, and NSF, and includes White House initiatives to promote innovation and competitiveness. The United States promotes competitiveness through various activities like the National Science and Technology Summit and the President's Council on Innovation. To maintain economic growth, U.S. companies must engage in trade, offer high-quality products, and embrace scientific and technological advances to create new goods, services, and jobs. Technological progress can be influenced by scientific advances, government activities, firm management, and serendipity. Since World War II, the United States has utilized direct and indirect policy approaches to enhance competitiveness. The Steelman report expressed concerns about future competition from other national economies. Interest in competitiveness peaked in the 1970s, with experts worried about competition from Japan, Europe, and newly emerging economies. In the 1970s, experts were concerned about the United States losing market share to Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries in various industries. This was due to declining technological superiority and lower productivity growth compared to competitors. In response to concerns about the United States losing market share to Japan and Europe in the 1970s, Congress passed several acts in the 1980s to boost innovation and competitiveness, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act, the Bayh-Dole Act, and the Federal Technology Transfer Act. In the 1980s, Congress passed several acts to boost innovation and competitiveness, including the Technology Transfer Act, National Cooperative Research Act, Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, and others. These actions aimed to increase corporate spending on research and development, establish support for innovative small firms, and improve the U.S. semiconductor industry through initiatives like SEMATECH. In the mid-1990s, the United States economy and technological innovation improved, leading to actions taken by U.S. manufacturers to enhance quality and efficiency. The nation succeeded in industries like Internet applications, biotechnology, and nanotechnology, while Japan's economy declined. Today's competitiveness concerns focus on globalization and issues like federal research funding, STEM education quality, and the number of Americans obtaining science and engineering degrees. The globalization of the economy has both positive and negative impacts on American companies, workers, and families. Increasing integration with the world economy can lead to higher productivity and living standards, but also raises concerns about job loss and lower wages as companies compete in a global market. The globalization of the economy raises concerns for workers in developing countries about job loss, lower wages, and benefits as American companies compete globally. Technology, increased world labor supply, and government policies drive this trend. The America COMPETES Act addresses these issues through direct and indirect policy measures. The America COMPETES Act addresses concerns about job loss, lower wages, and benefits for workers in developing countries due to globalization. It increases federal funding for basic research in technology fields and supports high-risk research at small and medium-sized businesses to enhance competitiveness and job creation. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve the U.S. labor pool's competitiveness by increasing STEM education and encouraging more students to pursue advanced STEM degrees. It also authorizes actions to identify possible government trade and investment policies. The America COMPETES Act authorizes actions to improve U.S. competitiveness by increasing STEM education and encouraging advanced degrees. It also supports government trade and investment policies, committees, and studies to address competitiveness concerns. Some experts believe actions should be taken to enhance U.S. competitiveness, while others have doubts about the proposed actions in the America COMPETES Act. Competitiveness can vary based on the perspective of individual domestic firms, multinational corporations, or domestic labor. For domestic firms, competitiveness is focused on trade and market share against imports or foreign firms. The economy's trade balance is a key measure of competitiveness. U.S. trade in advanced technology products is shown in Table 1, which includes various high technology products. The United States trade balance in advanced technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in the early 2000s, with the deficit growing steadily until 2007. Despite the growing deficit, it does not necessarily indicate a loss in the high technology race. The United States trade balance in advanced technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in the early 2000s, with the deficit growing steadily until 2007. The deficit reached $55.5 billion in 2008, but this does not mean the U.S. is losing the high technology race as many imports are from U.S. companies. However, the growing deficit may require closer policy scrutiny. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. declined sharply after 2000, impacting competitiveness. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined sharply after 2000, reaching a record $300 billion, but rebounded to $184 billion by 2006. Domestic labor defines competitiveness as the firm's ability to compete against foreign firms in export markets or within the United States. The United States is the largest recipient of foreign direct investments and the largest investor abroad. Key measures for domestic labor are employment levels and wages received. The United States is the largest recipient of foreign direct investments and the largest investor abroad. U.S. firms invested $249 billion abroad in 2006. Concerns about displaced workers and lower wages exist, but most economists believe that these investments do not lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes overall for Americans. Determining the science and engineering workforce and the jobs created is a challenging task according to NSF analysts. Determining the science and engineering workforce is challenging. NSF identifies five broad categories of occupations: computer scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, social scientists, and engineers. However, this classification does not include all individuals with science and engineering degrees who use their knowledge in their jobs. For example, a chemist teaching high school chemistry or an engineer managing a manufacturing plant are not included in NSF's analysis. Additionally, there are those in science- and engineering-related occupations who use their knowledge but may not have degrees in the field, such as patent attorneys or physicians. The need for science and engineering knowledge has increased for various occupations, including those outside traditional S&E fields. The science and engineering workforce could be much larger than government analyses suggest, with estimates ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006, according to the National Science Board. The most relevant number may be around 17.0 million. The size of the science and engineering workforce varied between approximately 5.0 million and 21.4 million individuals in 2006, with the most relevant number being around 17.0 million. These numbers reflect the various ways science and technical knowledge is used in the United States, differing from other data sources such as NSF, U.S. Census Bureau, and BLS. Additionally, NSF's data based on workers' reporting shows 12.9 million individuals needing at least a bachelor's degree level of science and engineering knowledge in 2003. The analysis based on workers' reporting shows 12.9 million individuals needing at least a bachelor's degree level of science and engineering knowledge in 2003. Statistical analysts struggle to account for the need of all workers to have a basic understanding of STEM and the impact of computerization on changing employment skills. The U.S. Census Bureau provides a long-term analysis of S&E workforce trends. The U.S. Census Bureau's analysis shows significant growth in science and engineering occupations, outpacing the total labor force. Recent data from BLS indicates a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the workforce since 2000, but projects a 21.4% growth in science and engineering occupations from 2004 to 2014. Occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with faster growth in computer-related occupations. Unemployment in S&E occupations was 1.6% in 2006. Compensation for most STEM occupations is above the U.S. labor force, with similar growth rates. Compensation for most STEM occupations is higher than the U.S. labor force, with similar growth rates. STEM workers earn between $53,000 to $58,000 annually, compared to $47,000 to $49,500 for professionals and $31,500 to $34,500 for all workers in 2005. S&E bachelor's degree holders see a 15% increase in real salary from 1993 to 2003. Median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after graduation are $65,000, higher than non-S&E degree holders at $49,000. Variance exists among STEM occupations, fields, and sub-fields. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures of competitiveness like trade balance and employment do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness. Factors such as foreign affiliate sales, global supply chains, and intangibles like knowledge are not considered. They suggest that in today's global economy, assessing trade balance is less useful, as value is created through intangible assets in multinational firms. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures like trade balance and employment do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness. They suggest assessing factors such as foreign affiliate sales, global supply chains, and intangibles like knowledge. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of STEM knowledge for all Americans and the need for more STEM-proficient teachers in K-12 education. The importance of STEM education lies in the need for teachers with STEM knowledge to inspire students, leading to a competitive workforce. Encouraging more Americans to pursue STEM fields is crucial for economic growth and innovation. STEM degrees open up diverse career opportunities beyond traditional roles. Science and engineering research funding is vital for U.S. competitiveness. Science and engineering research funding is crucial for U.S. competitiveness and economic growth. Current funding levels are insufficient compared to other countries, impacting industries and job creation. Additional federal funding will enhance competitiveness by creating new industries and improving existing ones. Analysis shows that U.S. students' scores in science and mathematics literacy are below the OECD average, highlighting the need for investment in STEM education. American students scored below the OECD average in science and mathematics literacy in 2006. Middle school mathematics teachers in the United States are not as well prepared as their counterparts in other countries, contributing to lower scores for American students. The United States also has a low rate of first university degrees awarded in STEM fields compared to non-STEM degrees globally. STEM degrees accounted for 16.8% of all first university degrees awarded in the United States, lower than the international average of 26.4%. Research shows that investment in research and development has a significant impact on U.S. economic growth, with R&D contributing to 5% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2004. However, there are questions about the exclusive benefits of U.S. investments in research programs, as research is international and other countries could also benefit. The text questions the extent of exclusive benefits from U.S. investments in research programs and STEM education, as research is international and other countries could also benefit. It also raises concerns about the federal government's influence in STEM education and whether investments will provide jobs for all Americans. Additionally, it questions the sufficiency of actions in enhancing U.S. competitiveness and whether any action is necessary at all in this regard. Some analysts question the necessity of actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness, doubting the need for more scientists and engineers and the quality of talent in China and India. Concerns also arise about potential oversupply and management issues with increased funding for research programs. The act focuses on direct and indirect measures to manage research programs effectively. Proponents suggest increased funding and tax policy changes to address concerns about U.S. competitiveness. Supporters of direct government assistance prioritize technologies with industry support, while advocates for indirect measures believe the market should decide on worthy investments to avoid political influences. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006 during his State of the Union address, responding to concerns about insufficient investment in science and technology research. The America COMPETES Act and ACI aimed to address U.S. competitiveness by prioritizing direct and indirect measures in managing research programs effectively. The America COMPETES Act and the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) aimed to increase research funding in science and technology, including at NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science. Both initiatives also focused on STEM education programs like Math Now and the AP/IB program. The America COMPETES Act authorized funding increases for research organizations like ARPA-E and the Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes, and encouraged agencies to allocate a percentage of their budget to high-risk, high-reward projects. The America COMPETES Act authorized funding increases for research organizations like ARPA-E and the Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes, and encouraged agencies to allocate a percentage of their budget to high-risk, high-reward projects, based on the National Academies Rising Above the Gathering Storm report. The America COMPETES Act calls for a 10% annual increase in federal investment in long-term basic research over the next seven years, based on the National Academies Rising Above the Gathering Storm report. This is deemed necessary due to stagnant funding in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences for the past 15 years, which hinders support for high-potential high-risk research. The National Academies emphasize that corporations are unlikely to fill this research gap. The National Academies recommend a 10% annual increase in federal investment in basic research over seven years, as corporations are unlikely to fill this gap. The committee believes this growth rate strikes a balance between urgency and efficiency in applying new funds. The Administration's choice of a 7% annual rate remains unexplained. The Administration has not explained why it chose a 7% annual rate for increasing funding for research agencies, despite the importance of federally funded science for the nation's economic competitiveness. The National Academies' 2005 report recommended increased funding for basic research in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering, areas that had been neglected compared to biomedical research. The National Academies' 2005 report recommended increased funding for basic research in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering, areas that had stagnated while biomedical research budgets soared. The report suggested reallocating existing funds or introducing new funds to support these areas. The American Competitiveness Initiative proposed doubling budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years. The America COMPETES Act emphasized NASA's role in promoting innovation, economic competitiveness, and STEM education. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes funding for NASA to support basic research, STEM education, and innovation. Concerns have been raised about the balance of funding in the President's FY2008 budget for NASA's Vision for Space Exploration and other initiatives. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the need for appropriate funding for NASA, questioning if the agency has the right priorities and if it is being asked to do too much with too little resources. The Act suggests allocating a percentage of basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes allocating a percentage of basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects that involve multidisciplinary work and a high degree of novelty. This provision aims to address concerns that current federal research funding review mechanisms may not be open to new, unproven ideas. Transformative research often does not fit within traditional project-focused or step-by-step research models, especially when review systems are dominated by experts invested in current paradigms or during times of limited budgets that discourage risk-taking. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes allocating a percentage of basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects that involve multidisciplinary work and a high degree of novelty. Transformative research often faces challenges within traditional project-focused or step-by-step research models, especially when review systems are dominated by experts invested in current paradigms or during times of limited budgets that discourage risk-taking. Investigators are hesitant to submit radical ideas to NSF due to low success rates, prompting concerns about lack of dedicated funds for transformative research. The National Science Board's report highlights the lack of dedicated funds for transformative research at the National Science Foundation. The House Committee on Appropriations recommends allocating $10 million for a new program focusing on transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E, a new federal organization in the Department of Energy aimed at enhancing transformative research. ARPA-E, authorized by the America COMPETES Act, aims to enhance economic and energy security by developing technologies to reduce energy imports, greenhouse gas emissions, and improve energy efficiency. It operates based on the DARPA research management model, focusing on revolutionary advances in sciences and accelerating technological innovations in energy sectors. ARPA-E, based on the DARPA model, focuses on sponsoring high-payoff research in areas where industry may not invest due to uncertainty. Similar initiatives have been proposed in the past, including the idea of a civilian technology agency for advancing energy technologies. In 1992, a National Academy of Sciences report recommended the government consider a civilian technology corporation or agency for energy research. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore proposed a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies. ARPA-E, inspired by DARPA, aims to bring excitement to energy research and attract top talent, focusing on creative and out-of-the-box ideas. The report proposed the creation of an ARPA-like organization for energy research, focusing on innovative and transformational projects. It suggested starting funding at $300 million and increasing to $1 billion per year over five to six years. The report proposed starting funding for ARPA-E at $300 million the first year, increasing to $1 billion per year over five to six years. The program's effectiveness would be evaluated at that point. National Academies committee members emphasized the importance of not jeopardizing basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science. They suggested that details of ARPA-E's organization and mission should be determined by the Secretary of Energy and the Under Secretary for Science in consultation with experts from the scientific and engineering communities. For more information on ARPA-E, refer to CRS Report RL34497. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish multidisciplinary Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories to apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations. The institutes, along with their partners, would support research on emerging technologies critical to global competitiveness and train science and engineering students. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories to collaborate with higher-education and industrial partners. The institutes aim to reshape engineering research and education to address challenges in global markets, national security, energy sustainability, and public health, requiring a cultural shift across various sectors of society. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs involving various sectors like the federal government, states, industry, foundations, and academia. These programs focus on recruiting and enhancing STEM teachers, supporting students through initiatives like summer institutes and research internships, and promoting outreach and mentoring for women and minorities. Additionally, the act includes a pilot program for grants to establish STEM specialty high schools and experiential learning opportunities. The America COMPETES Act includes a pilot program of grants to states for STEM specialty high schools, internships for students, centers of excellence in STEM education, summer institutes for teachers, a new Director for STEM Education at the Department of Energy, and a graduate research fellowship program called Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE). The Department of Education (ED) has introduced two new grant programs, Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow, aimed at improving STEM education. Additionally, a program called Math Now is focused on enhancing math instruction for elementary and middle school teachers through research-based tools and professional development. The Math Now program aims to improve math instruction for elementary and middle school students by providing teachers with research-based tools and professional development. Another initiative, the Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate (AP/IB) Program, seeks to expand low-income students' access to AP/IB coursework by training more high school teachers in math, science, and critical foreign languages. Additionally, increased support is provided for existing NSF programs such as the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, Math and Science Partnerships program, and STEM talent expansion program (STEP) to enhance mathematics and science education. The America COMPETES Act programs include partnerships, STEM talent expansion, Advanced Technological Education, Graduate Research Fellowships, and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship. These programs aim to advance STEM education and increase the number of students receiving STEM degrees. The DOE and its National Laboratories will manage some of these programs, marking a shift in their role towards K-12 STEM education. The America COMPETES Act programs managed by the DOE and its National Laboratories are facing opposition from the Administration. The DOE specialty schools for math and science aim to inspire students by providing interaction with DOE scientists and engineers actively conducting research. The Administration opposes America COMPETES Act programs managed by DOE and its National Laboratories, arguing that establishing or expanding K-12 specialty schools for math and science should not be a DOE responsibility. Supporters believe these schools will enhance academic achievement and serve as a \"nucleus of excellence\" in STEM education. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM fields. The Administration opposes America COMPETES Act programs managed by DOE and its National Laboratories, arguing that establishing or expanding K-12 specialty schools for math and science should not be a DOE responsibility. Proponents believe these schools will enhance academic achievement in STEM education. DOE National Laboratory Centers of Excellence in STEM education assist teachers in high-need public secondary schools using national laboratory equipment. The Administration believes establishing school-based centers is not DOE's role and would divert resources from surrounding communities. The America COMPETES Act reauthorizes STEM education programs at NSF and establishes a new program. The Administration opposes increasing funding for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and establishing funding for the Laboratory Science Pilot program. NSF is responsible for promoting quality math and science education at all levels across the United States. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program aims to increase the number of highly qualified K-12 math and science teachers in the U.S. by providing additional funding of $5,000,000 for a total of $15,000,000. This program encourages STEM undergraduate students and professionals to pursue careers in K-12 mathematics education. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program awards grants to higher education institutions to recruit STEM undergraduate students to become K-12 math and science teachers. Students receive scholarships and stipends in exchange for teaching in high-need school districts for two to six years. This program is based on successful models like UTeach and California Teach. The UTeach and California Teach programs are successful in better preparing teachers for the classroom. These programs are considered radical because they train science and mathematics teachers in their respective departments, rather than in education departments. Universities involved in the program have had to change their traditional viewpoint to prepare students for both research and education careers. The program also utilizes master K-12 classroom teachers to educate students and serve as role models. Additionally, the NSF authorizes a new program to provide grants to institutions of higher education to create or improve STEM education programs. The NSF authorizes a new program to provide grants for institutions of higher education to create or improve professional science master's (PSM) degree programs that emphasize practical training for high-need fields. PSM programs aim to meet industry workforce needs by combining advanced science or mathematics training with workplace skills valued by employers. Approximately 120 PSM programs at 60 institutions, developed with industry guidance, offer two years of academic training in emerging areas, internships, and \"cross-training\" in business and communications. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program awards grants to partnerships to enhance STEM instruction by improving school laboratories, providing professional development for teachers, and purchasing scientific educational materials. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new programs in the Department of Education, including the Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program to increase STEM teachers. A National Research Council report found poor quality of high school labs, especially in schools with non-Asian minorities and poor students. The Math Now program aims to improve math instruction by providing teachers with tools and professional development. The America COMPETES Act includes provisions for the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy. The America COMPETES Act directs the establishment of a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. President Bush established a National Science and Technology Committee (NSTC) on Technology subcommittee in response. The act also mandates the convening of a National Science and Technology Summit by the President through OSTP to assess the U.S. science and technology enterprises. The America COMPETES Act mandated the convening of a National Science and Technology Summit by the President through OSTP to assess the U.S. science and technology enterprises. This summit was held on August 18-19, 2008. The act also directs OSTP to submit a description of how the Administration's R&D budget priorities relate to the summit's conclusions and recommendations. Additionally, the Act requires OSTP to develop principles for the communication and open exchange of data by federal scientists and engineers. In response to this, the Bush Administration OSTP issued a memorandum to federal agencies sponsoring research, emphasizing the importance of robust and open communication of scientific information. The Federal government emphasizes the importance of open communication of scientific information to advance science and inform society. NASA's science communications policy serves as a model for other federal agencies. The America COMPETES Act tasks OSTP with studying barriers to innovation, but no action has been taken by the Bush Administration. The America COMPETES Act assigns actions to OSTP, including studying barriers to innovation and coordinating research infrastructure. Dr. John Holdren was confirmed as OSTP Director in 2009 and emphasized the importance of communication of scientific information by federal scientists and engineers. Dr. Holdren emphasized the importance of ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress, without political influence. He pledged to work with federal agencies to prevent censorship or distortion of technical judgments for ideological reasons. Dr. Holdren emphasized the need for scientific integrity in the federal government, highlighting the America Competes Act's requirement for open communication of data and results from federal scientists. President Obama issued a memorandum on Scientific Integrity in 2009, assigning the Office of Science and Technology Policy the task of ensuring transparency and preventing suppression or distortion of research findings. President Obama issued a memorandum in 2009 assigning the Office of Science and Technology Policy the responsibility for ensuring scientific integrity in the executive branch. The Director was tasked with developing recommendations for Presidential action within 120 days to guarantee integrity based on key principles. Each agency must have rules and procedures to maintain scientific integrity. Scientific information used in policy decisions should undergo established processes, including peer review. Agencies must disclose scientific findings unless restricted. Procedures should be in place to address any compromise in scientific integrity. Each agency must have procedures to ensure scientific integrity and address any compromise. Additional procedures, including whistleblower protections, should be adopted to maintain integrity in decision-making. Agencies must provide necessary information to the Director for recommendations to the President. Coordination with the Director is required for interim procedures to ensure scientific decision-making integrity. The FY2008 and FY2009 appropriation and FY2010 authorization for America COMPETES Act programs were summarized in Table 2. Funding from the Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act led to funding of some programs at authorized levels, while others were funded below or not funded. ARPA-E had a FY2008 authorization of $300.0. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL34736 and CRS Report RL34396. The FY2008 and FY2009 authorization levels for America COMPETES Act programs were summarized in Table 3. Some programs were funded below authorized levels, while others were not funded. The FY2009 appropriation for ARPA-E was $415.0 million, exceeding the authorized level. Maintaining funding levels at the authorization level may pose challenges for institutions and individuals sponsored by certain programs. The budget proposed in the Bush Administration for FY2009 did not align with the America COMPETES Act, making it difficult to determine the status of these programs in FY2010. The Bush Administration's FY2009 budget did not align with the America COMPETES Act, making it challenging to determine the status of programs. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request also did not realign existing programs with the Act. Insufficient evidence shows that new America COMPETES Act programs are funded. The Obama Administration requested FY2010 funding for America COMPETES Act programs, but at levels below authorization. Funding for new programs has not been proposed. The America COMPETES Act aims to fund federal R&D programs at record levels, with some programs not yet receiving appropriations. The act provides authorization levels only through FY2010, and the success of these programs will depend on receiving necessary funding. The purpose of the act is to invest in innovation through research and development to improve the competitiveness of the United States. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve the competitiveness of the United States by funding federal R&D programs. The act focuses on maintaining the country's top ranking in international competitiveness, despite increasing science and technology investments by other nations. Various evaluation mechanisms assess the nation's ability to compete globally. The evaluation mechanisms discussed assess the nation's competitiveness by using a combination of inputs, outputs, and outcomes. There are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness, as numerous indicators are available but may not provide an accurate assessment. Factors like necessity or serendipity can also influence innovation. Evaluating the quality and value of innovation is limited and can vary depending on perspective. Innovation's impact on quality of life and economic growth is limited and varies based on perspective. Increased spending on research and development does not guarantee new technologies. Innovation can occur without R&D due to market demand or minor product changes. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities all fund R&D and innovation. Differentiating between research and development is crucial in measuring innovation. Basic research is a focus of the America COMPETES Act, while the industrial sector plays a key role in technological development. The America COMPETES Act focuses on federal funding for basic research, while the industrial sector also plays a critical role in technological innovation. University-industry cooperation serves as a liaison between research and industry, with a focus on R&D funding and industry investment in specific sectors. The focus of government policy on innovation and competitiveness is influenced by factors such as funding allocation for research and development in different industrial sectors. Patent data may not fully capture innovation, as not all outcomes of R&D can be patented. The number of scientists and engineers may not directly correlate with a nation's innovative capacity, as new industries can be developed by individuals with or without college degrees. There are no guarantees that specific actions will lead to innovation or competitiveness. The government focuses on creating an environment for innovation to flourish, aiming for competitiveness with other nations. Monitoring and assessing policy effectiveness is crucial for making adjustments. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness plays a key role in measuring the impact of policies. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, comprised of key officials, monitors and advises on public laws and initiatives to promote innovation. It identifies opportunities, makes recommendations for improvement, and develops metrics to measure federal progress in enhancing innovation through talent development, investment, and infrastructure. Specific programs like ARPA-E are evaluated for effectiveness after four years of operation. In research and education, federal programs like ARPA-E and DOE summer institutes are evaluated for effectiveness and improvement. White House guidelines require evaluation based on quality, relevance, and performance, using a merit-based competitive process for funding decisions. The annual budget submission requires evaluation of STEM programs to improve teaching skills, increase STEM teachers, and enhance student achievement. Grants for STEM education programs aim to increase new STEM teachers in high-need schools, diversify STEM teachers, bring STEM professionals into teaching, and retain program participants. Independent evaluations assess the impact on student achievement, with reports to relevant committees. The independent evaluation assesses the impact of STEM programs on student academic achievement, with reports to relevant committees. Mechanisms are in place to monitor U.S. competitiveness, including indicators like the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and OECD's Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard. The OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard report provides information on innovation by regions and industries, trade competitiveness, and productivity based on various indicators. Output indicators such as economic trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages are monitored by agencies like the BEA, BLS, Census Bureau, and NSF. The NSF, BLS, and Census Bureau monitor output indicators regularly. The NSF releases a biannual Science and Engineering Indicators report. The BEA is conducting an analysis on the contribution of R&D to GDP growth. Input indicators like education quality, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity are monitored. These reports highlight policy areas for the US to focus on compared to its competitors. The US ranks first in the WEF competitiveness analysis but not in all areas. The United States ranks first overall in the WEF competitiveness analysis, but not in all sub-indicators. Key sub-indicators related to the America COMPETES Act programs include quality of primary education (28th), quality of math and science education in higher education (45th), capacity for innovation (9th), quality of scientific research institutions (2nd), and availability of scientists and engineers (12th). State-level competitiveness analysis is also available. The America COMPETES Act influences input/output indicators in analyses, such as human capital investment, research and development inputs, risk capital, technology workforce, and technology concentration. Various organizations use factors like high-tech jobs, R&D expenditures, and STEM degrees to assess the impact of the Act. The Act is an authorization act, meaning new programs and funding increases would not occur without proper funding. The COMPETES Act is an authorization act that requires proper funding for new programs and funding increases. Some programs established by the act in previous years were funded through appropriations acts. However, not all research and STEM education programs received appropriations at authorized levels in FY2009. This poses an issue for Congress as they deliberate the FY2010 budget. In FY2009, some America COMPETES Act programs received appropriations at authorized levels, while others did not. Congress is now considering funding for these programs in FY2010. The act provides authorization levels only through FY2010, and some newly authorized programs have never been funded. Policymakers are monitoring the impact of funding decisions to assess the act's effectiveness in enhancing U.S. competitiveness in R&D and STEM education. The America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69) originated as the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007 and the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act in the 110th Congress.
