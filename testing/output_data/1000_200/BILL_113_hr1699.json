    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" and its purpose and findings are outlined in Section 2. The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, including fish, to inform consumers about the production process. Congress recognizes the material changes in genetically engineered food, the FDA's labeling requirements, and the right of individuals in the US to know if their food was genetically engineered for various reasons. Over 60 countries, including the UK and EU countries, require labeling for genetically engineered foods. Over 60 countries, including the UK and EU countries, mandate labeling of genetically engineered food on food labels. The Codex Alimentarius adopted a text in 2011 allowing governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. Mandatory identification of genetically engineered food can help preserve economic value in exports and sensitive markets. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act are proposed. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act include a new section requiring clear disclosure for genetically engineered foods, with exceptions for certain types of food. The paragraph discusses the definition of genetic engineering in relation to food, specifically focusing on the use of genetically engineered processing aids or enzymes. The term 'genetically engineered' refers to a material intended for human consumption that is produced through genetic engineering or the offspring of organisms created through genetic engineering. 'Genetically engineered ingredient' is a material derived from an organism that has been genetically engineered, regardless of detectable molecular or cellular changes or the organism's suitability for human consumption. The organism must be detectable in the material and suitable for human consumption. Guaranty required for food misbranding violations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The guaranty required for food misbranding violations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act includes a statement that the food is not genetically engineered or does not contain genetically engineered ingredients, signed by a person residing in the United States who provided the food. The exclusion from penalties applies regardless of how the recipient uses the food. The recipient of food is subject to penalties regardless of how the food is used, including processing, repacking, or producing it. No one can avoid responsibility for misbranded food violations by transferring liability to another person, except for requiring a guaranty. The amendment specifies that a recipient cannot transfer responsibility for misbranded food violations to another person, except for requiring a guaranty. Additionally, the terms 'genetically engineered' and 'genetically engineered ingredient' are defined in section 403(z). The amendment addresses violations of misbranded food involving genetically engineered materials by agricultural producers, excluding intentional contamination. The Secretary must establish labeling regulations for agricultural producers regarding contamination not caused by negligence within one year of the Act's enactment."
