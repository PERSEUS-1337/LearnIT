    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". The findings of Congress highlight the significance of truancy as a warning sign for youth at risk. Truancy is linked to school dropout rates, welfare dependency, unemployment, and criminal behavior. High rates of truancy are associated with increased daytime burglary and vandalism, as well as a significant portion of violent juvenile crime occurring during school hours. Truancy is a significant issue with 44% of violent juvenile crime happening during school hours. 75% of children aged 13-16 arrested for crimes are truants. Cities report up to 70% of daily student absences are unexcused, with some cities reaching 4,000 absences per day. The social and economic costs of truancy are high, with only 34% of inmates completing high school and truants costing the nation $240 billion in lost earnings and taxes. Effective truancy prevention programs can reduce crime rates and improve school attendance. However, there is a lack of targeted funding for these programs in current law. Grants are available for truancy prevention programs to reduce crime rates and improve school attendance. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"eligible partnership,\" \"local educational agency,\" and \"qualified unit of local government.\" Eligible partnerships are partnerships between local government units and educational agencies. Local educational agencies are defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Qualified units of local government are those with specific statutes or regulations in place. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, will make competitive grants to eligible partnerships to reduce truancy and daytime juvenile crime. The maximum grant amount awarded in a fiscal year is $100,000. The term \"unit of local government\" includes cities, counties, townships, tribes, and other political subdivisions. The maximum grant amount awarded to eligible partnerships under this section is $100,000 per fiscal year, with at least 25% allocated for use by local educational agencies. Grants can be renewed for up to 2 additional fiscal years. Funds can be used for truancy prevention activities, including parental involvement and incentives for parental responsibility. Parental involvement in prevention activities, sanctions for habitually truant students, parental accountability, in-school truancy prevention programs, involvement of various community stakeholders, and technology for truancy prevention. The Attorney General may prioritize funding for programs that replicate model truancy intervention projects such as the Truancy Intervention Project in Fulton County, Georgia, the TABS program in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Roswell Daytime Curfew Program in New Mexico, and the Stop, Cite and Return Program in Rohnert. The Roswell Daytime Curfew Program in New Mexico, Stop, Cite and Return Program in Rohnert Park, Stay in School Program in New Haven, Atlantic County Project Helping Hand in New Jersey, THRIVE initiative in Oklahoma City, Norfolk project in Virginia, Community Service Early Intervention Program in Marion, Truancy Reduction Program in Bakersfield, and Grade Court program in Farmington, New Mexico are some of the truancy intervention projects mentioned. The Truancy Reduction Program of Bakersfield, California, the Grade Court program of Farmington, New Mexico, and other model programs determined appropriate by the Attorney General are authorized for funding of $25,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2001."
