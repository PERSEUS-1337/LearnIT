    "content": "The Act titled \"Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit Act of 2004\" provides a credit for farmer investment in value-added agricultural property under section 45G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit Act of 2004 offers a 50% credit on the basis of qualified value-added agricultural property placed in service during the taxable year for eligible persons or farmer-owned entities. The maximum credit for eligible persons is $30,000 per year. The credit under the Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit Act of 2004 for eligible persons is capped at $30,000 per year, reduced by creditable investments. For property placed in service by farmer-owned entities, the credit cannot exceed the eligible person's investments in the entity when the property is placed in service. The qualified investments made by an eligible person in a farmer-owned entity are reduced by previous investments in the same entity and in other farmer-owned entities when calculating the Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit. The Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit limits the aggregate qualified investments made by an eligible person to $30,000 per taxable year. Qualified value-added agricultural property refers to property used to add value to goods derived from organic matter on a renewable basis. The Agricultural Producers Value-Added Investment Tax Credit allows eligible persons to invest in property derived from organic matter on a renewable basis, with a useful life of 3 years or more, owned and operated by them or a farmer-owned entity. Eligible persons are those who actively participate in the taxable year. The term 'eligible person' refers to someone who actively participates in an eligible farming business during the taxable year. Material participation is determined similarly to section 2032A(e)(6), and for entities like corporations or partnerships, it is assessed at the shareholder or partner level. The term 'farmer-owned entity' refers to a corporation or partnership where eligible persons own majority voting power and stock value. Eligible farming businesses must not be passive activities. The term 'farmer-owned entity' includes entities where eligible persons own majority voting power and stock value, as well as partnerships and cooperatives meeting specific ownership criteria. Constructive ownership rules apply for determining ownership percentages. The family of an individual for tax purposes includes their spouse, children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren, along with their spouses if they reside in the same household or jointly operate farming businesses. Adopted children are also considered part of the family. For tax purposes, adopted children or those placed with the taxpayer for adoption are treated as children by blood. Qualified investments refer to cash payments for purchasing equity in a farmer-owned entity, specifically stock in a domestic corporation acquired between December 31, 2004, and January 1, 2011, solely in exchange for cash. The section discusses special rules for certain types of investments, including capital or profits interests in partnerships and patronage interests in cooperatives acquired between December 31, 2004, and January 1, 2011. Rules similar to section 1202(c)(3) apply. Special rules apply for married individuals filing separate returns, with adjustments to the income threshold. Regulations by the Secretary govern credit allocation for estates and trusts, with certain property restrictions. Basis adjustment is made for credits related to qualified agricultural property. The basis of qualified value-added agricultural property is reduced by the credit allowed to eligible persons and increased by recapture under certain dispositions within a 5-year period. Regulations similar to section 50(a) apply for ineligible cases. The basis of qualified value-added agricultural property is adjusted for credits and recapture in certain situations, with special rules for heirs of eligible persons in case of death. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for this section, and it will not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2010. The general business credit under Section 38(b) of the Code is amended to include a new paragraph regarding the credit allowed. The amendment adds a new paragraph (16) related to the value-added agricultural property investment credit for eligible persons. Additionally, it allows the credit against minimum tax and amends section 38 of the Code to include the value-added agricultural property credit. The amendment introduces a value-added agricultural property credit under section 45G and allows it to be used against minimum tax. It also amends section 38 of the Code to include this credit. Additionally, it limits the carryback of the value-added agricultural property investment credit before the effective date. The amendment introduces a value-added agricultural property investment credit under section 45G, limiting its carryback before the effective date. The amendment introduces a new paragraph (29) related to payments eligible for a credit under section 38, as specified in section 45G(d)(3). Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code.
