The Act \"Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995\" emphasizes the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children, as recognized by the Supreme Court. It highlights the invaluable role of parents in raising their children and the responsibility of parents to love, nurture, train, and protect their children.

Parents face increasing government intrusions in parenting decisions without compelling justification. The Act aims to protect parents' right to direct their children's upbringing while also ensuring children are protected from abuse and neglect. It acknowledges that parents have the responsibility to educate their children for literacy and self-sufficiency. The traditional 4-step process used by courts appropriately balances the interests of parents, children, and government.
