    "content": "The \"Voting Restoration Act\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to restore voting rights. The Voting Restoration Act aims to restore voting rights by addressing disparities in voting eligibility standards for ex-felons across different states. Congress asserts its supervisory power over federal elections to ensure voting rights are not denied based on race, sex, color, or previous servitude. In 13 States, ex-offenders face disenfranchisement even after completing their sentences. The process to regain voting rights is challenging, requiring a pardon or order from the Governor in 8 States, action from the parole or pardon board in 2 States, and a Presidential pardon for Federal offenders in 16 States. Approximately 3,900,000 Americans, or 2 percent of the adult population, are ineligible to vote due to felony convictions. Three-fourths of these individuals are on probation, parole, or are ex-offenders. In recent years, the number of incarcerated individuals has grown exponentially, with drug policies contributing to this increase. One in four prison inmates in 1998 was incarcerated for a drug offense, and drug offenders made up 58 percent of Federal prison inmates. Over one-third of women in prison are also incarcerated for drug offenses, which are predominantly nonviolent. Racially disparate sentencing laws have led to African-Americans being overrepresented in Federal drug charges. Minorities, particularly African-Americans, are disproportionately impacted by laws that strip felons of their voting rights. Currently, 13 percent of African-American men are unable to participate in Federal elections due to felony convictions. Congress should address these disparities to ensure all Americans have the right to vote in Federal elections. The purpose of this Act is to restore voting eligibility to individuals who have completed criminal sentences.

The Attorney General can bring a civil action in court for declaratory or injunctive relief to remedy a violation of the Act.
