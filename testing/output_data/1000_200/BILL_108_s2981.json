    "content": "The Act titled \"Conventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2004\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 includes findings and the sense of Congress. The global proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, and tactical missile systems poses a direct threat to US national security. Terrorist and insurgent groups using these weapons hinder peace efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Government Accountability Office estimates 500,000 to 750,000 MANPADS worldwide. Many countries with these weapons threaten international peace and security. Many countries possess stocks of MANPADS and other weapons but lack the means to eliminate or secure them. The US lacks a program to address conventional arms threat reduction and tactical missile elimination in other countries. The Department of State has not used the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund for this purpose since 2002. Congress believes the US should assist countries in securing, removing, or eliminating such weapons. The United States should provide assistance to countries in securing, removing, or eliminating stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems to combat proliferation threats. The government should prioritize combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons within its nonproliferation strategy. The United States policy is to help other countries safeguard or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. This includes a global program for the safeguarding and elimination of conventional arms. The Secretary of State is authorized to implement a global program to secure, remove, or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. This program may include activities such as humanitarian demining, destruction of small arms and light weapons, and assistance in safe handling and storage of these weapons. The authorized global program aims to secure, remove, or eliminate MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems. This includes cooperative programs with international organizations for safe handling and storage, utilization of funds for elimination or safeguarding, and management of weapons at locations where US funds were used for security. Actions are taken to ensure equipment and funds are used for security upgrades at storage locations. Actions are taken to ensure that equipment and funds for security upgrades at locations storing MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems are used for authorized purposes.
