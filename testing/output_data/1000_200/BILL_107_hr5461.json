    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Regional Comprehensive Emergency Preparedness, Coordination, and Recovery Act of 2002\". Congress finds that responders to the 9/11 terrorist attacks required coordination and support from various agencies at local, regional, state, federal, and private sector levels to ensure effective emergency response efforts and minimize loss of life and property damage. Response efforts are crucial for minimizing loss of life and property damage. Regional councils of governments, planning commissions, and development districts play a key role in coordinating comprehensive regional plans for emergency preparedness and recovery involving federal, state, local governments, and the private sector. Coordinated training, equipment acquisition, and recovery planning are essential for effective regional preparedness and mitigation. The purpose of this Act is to encourage and support these efforts. The purpose of this Act is to encourage and facilitate the development and implementation of regional emergency preparedness and coordination plans among Federal, State, and local governments and the private sector within the region to enhance preparedness and mitigation efforts. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"region\" refers to a designated planning area or district with boundaries established by State law or mutual agreement of local governments. The term \"regional council\" denotes a multipurpose association of governments in a planning region. \"Local government\" includes cities, counties, or townships within the United States. \"State\" encompasses the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or any U.S. territory. A \"stakeholder\" includes Federal, State, local, private, and nonprofit entities, such as local elected officials. The curr_chunk discusses various entities involved in regional emergency planning, including local elected officials, emergency management agencies, health professionals, schools, businesses, and utilities. The term \"regional plan\" is defined as a comprehensive emergency preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery plan. The curr_chunk focuses on the requirement to coordinate the development of regional emergency preparedness, coordination, and recovery plans. The regional councils defined in section 3(2) are responsible for convening all stakeholders within a region to coordinate the development of emergency preparedness plans. The required regional emergency response plan must include assessments of potential targets, available resources, equipment needs, establishment of a communication system, and a secure information repository. The regional councils are responsible for coordinating stakeholders to develop emergency preparedness plans, including a secure information repository with details on response resources and contacts for emergency services and medical facilities. Locations and contacts for area stakeholders involved in the operation and maintenance of essential services within the region, as well as key military personnel and facilities. Support facilities include existing shelters, schools, colleges, universities, churches, public buildings, major water and food supplies. Infrastructure details water treatment locations. Infrastructure details include the locations of water treatment and storage facilities, utilities lines, pipelines, generating facilities, sewer mains, communication facilities, radio and television studios, major bridges, and dams. Locations and capacities of shortwave radio facilities, volunteers, major bridges, dams, educational facilities, transportation facilities including ports and airports, local and regional transportation routes, at-risk populations with large population concentrations and schedules of major public events. Locations of hazardous and biohazard chemicals, fuel depots meeting EPA thresholds, and major concentrations of such chemicals. Planning activities under this section involve analyzing the possibility of a disaster, assessing potential impacts on life, property, and the environment, and utilizing Geographic Information Systems to evaluate hazards and consequences. Debris disposal planning includes identifying disposal locations and potential health hazards for personnel involved. The regional plan for utilizing Geographic Information Systems to assess hazards and emergencies must be approved by the designated agency's governing body and Governor within 12 months of receiving a planning grant. The plan should be updated annually based on threat assessments, trainings, and drills, with information available only to relevant officials and agencies for security purposes. The regional plan for securing key resources and critical infrastructure must involve public and private officials responsible for the plan. Computer technology is required for securing these resources. Measures should be taken to protect key resources in coordination with various agencies and entities. Continuous review and recommendations for improving security policies and procedures are necessary for sharing information with relevant entities. The curr_chunk involves governing the security of information and sharing it with relevant entities within the Federal Government and region, including government agencies, authorities, and the private sector. SEC. 5. FUNDING. An amount of not less than three percent of emergency preparedness and homeland security funds shall be allocated to the Department of Homeland Security for regional plan preparation. Allocations to regions will be based on population, plan preparation needs, vulnerability to disasters, and presence of critical facilities. Federal funding for local projects must align with regional plans."
