A marketplace can automatically reenroll individuals in a qualified health plan annually, as long as eligibility for subsidies is redetermined and changes in premiums and income are considered. Reenrollment limitations apply if the marketplace does not follow the specified processes for an individual.

The Secretary will establish rules for annual eligibility redeterminations and reenrollments for coverage and tax credits in the marketplace. Enrollees must provide authorization for disclosure of information and updated income details annually to maintain eligibility for subsidies. In this section, the marketplace requests updated income information annually to verify eligibility for credits or cost-sharing reductions. Enrollees are also provided with timely notices about rules for annual redeterminations and reenrollments. The term \"marketplace\" refers to State Based Exchanges and the Federally Facilitated Exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
