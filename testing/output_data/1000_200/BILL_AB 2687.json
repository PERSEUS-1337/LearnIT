It is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or higher. Blood alcohol concentration is measured in grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. If a chemical test shows a BAC of 0.08% or higher within three hours of driving, it is presumed that the person was over the limit while driving. It is illegal for a person addicted to drugs to drive a vehicle. This does not apply to those in an approved narcotic treatment program. Additionally, it is unlawful for a person with 0.04% or more alcohol in their blood to drive a commercial vehicle. If a chemical test within three hours of driving shows 0.04% or more alcohol, it is presumed the person was over the limit while driving. (e) Starting July 1, 2018, it is illegal to drive a motor vehicle with 0.04% or more alcohol in the blood when a passenger for hire is present. A passenger for hire is someone who pays or is expected to pay for the ride. In a prosecution, it is assumed the person was over the limit if a chemical test within three hours of driving shows 0.04% or more alcohol. (f) It is also illegal to drive under the influence of any drug. It is unlawful to drive under the influence of any drug or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs. Additionally, it is illegal to drive with a blood alcohol level of 0.08% or more, which causes bodily injury to another person.

It is assumed the person had 0.04% alcohol in their blood while driving if proven later. The law presumes that a person had 0.04% or more alcohol in their blood while driving if a chemical test within three hours after driving shows the same. It is illegal to drive under the influence of drugs or a combination of alcohol and drugs, leading to bodily injury to someone other than the driver. The act creates new crimes or infractions, eliminates existing ones, or changes penalties, without requiring reimbursement under the California Constitution."
