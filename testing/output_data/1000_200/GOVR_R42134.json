    "content": "Risk adjustment is the process of adjusting payments to health insurance plans based on the risk characteristics of enrollees. For example, payments can be adjusted to reflect higher costs for women compared to men, leveling the playing field for insurers. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage (MA or Medicare Part C) based on risk adjustment models that consider factors like age, geography, health status, and family size. However, these models do not fully explain the differences in expected health care spending. The report also discusses how risk scores for MA enrollees are generated and change over time, as well as how CMS audits the process. Medicare Advantage (MA) payments are risk-adjusted based on enrollees' demographics and health status. Private health plans provide Medicare benefits to enrollees in return for a monthly payment, regardless of service usage. Plans face financial risk if costs exceed payments, but can keep savings if costs are lower. CMS audits the risk-adjusted payments and addresses potential issues with the process. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are financially at risk if costs exceed payments, but can retain savings if costs are lower. Payments to MA plans are based on a comparison of each plan's estimated cost of providing Medicare covered benefits relative to the maximum amount the federal government will pay. Bids reflect each plan's estimate of how much it requires to cover an average beneficiary, including administrative costs and profit. CMS adjusts payments based on the characteristics of enrolled beneficiaries. The CMS adjusts payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on the characteristics of enrolled beneficiaries, such as age, gender, and health history. This risk adjustment methodology uses demographic and health factors to estimate next year's healthcare expenditures. CMS determines risk adjustment for MA plan payments based on beneficiary demographic and health factors. Age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability are considered straightforward, while health status is more complex, involving ICD-9-CM codes for diagnosis. Administrative data accuracy is generally stable over time. The process of risk adjustment for Medicare Advantage plan payments involves using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes to categorize conditions into hierarchical groups for payment purposes. There are over 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes that are mapped into diagnostic groups and condition categories, with a hierarchy imposed on them to code only the most significant manifestation of a disease. For example, Ischemic Heart Disease codes are organized into the Coronary Artery Disease hierarchy based on clinical severity. The ICD-9-CM Ischemic Heart Disease codes are organized into the Coronary Artery Disease hierarchy, consisting of four CCs arranged by clinical severity and cost. Hierarchical coding ensures that the most costly form of the disease dictates reimbursement. Only 70 HCC codes are used in the current CMS model to predict chronic conditions. In the current CMS model, 70 out of 189 hierarchical condition codes (HCCs) are used to predict Medicare expenditures. Starting in 2012, 87 HCC codes will be included in the model. ICD-9-CM codes are converted into HCC codes to predict costs based on diagnosed conditions. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC code. In the current CMS model, not all diagnoses result in an HCC. Some conditions are excluded from the model if they are not chronic or short-term illnesses, as they are not good predictors of future expenditures. The model uses the highest code in a related disease category and codes across unrelated categories are additive. The risk factors estimated for each condition are used to calculate a beneficiary's total risk score, which is then multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to determine the risk-adjusted base payment. Interaction effects between multiple conditions can sometimes result in greater costs than their additive effects. The presence of two or more conditions can result in greater costs due to interaction effects. For example, health care costs for individuals with both diabetes and congestive heart failure are higher than expected. Interaction effects also occur between certain diseases and disability, leading to higher costs. CMS has incorporated these interactions into the CMS-HCC model. The CMS-HCC model is a linear regression model that predicts expenditures based on diagnoses and demographic variables, including interactions between certain diseases and disability. The model uses actual claims data for Medicare Parts A and B to calculate relative risk factors for payment adjustments. The CMS-HCC model uses current claims data to calculate risk scores for Medicare beneficiaries based on health status and demographics. These risk scores are used to adjust payments to reflect individualized costs. CMS uses risk scores to adjust payments to Medicare Advantage plans, individualizing payments based on health status and demographics. The goal is to predict average expenditures, not individual costs. New enrollees' rates are based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement. The CMS uses risk scores to adjust payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on health status and demographics. Rates for new enrollees are determined by age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, not on diagnoses. CMS collects information from MA plans to update the risk score of each beneficiary. They are transitioning to encounter level data for more detailed information. CMS is transitioning to encounter level data for more detailed diagnostic information, allowing for risk score updates and payment adjustments directly from plan data. Risk scores can be adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1, based on data from the prior 12-month period. Errors in risk-adjusted Medicare Advantage payments can stem from age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, or disease. Error in risk-adjusted Medicare Advantage payments can arise from age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, or disease. Plans are audited by CMS to ensure that the payments claimed are supported by medical records, known as RADV audits. In February 2011, CMS proposed to extrapolate RADV error rates to entire plan contracts, aiming for $2.27 billion in savings over five years. CMS released a methodology for auditing Medicare Advantage plan data in December 2010, with final payment error calculation methodology in February 2012. Plans may face challenges as CMS seeks to recover larger amounts from them. CMS conducts audits at the contract level to estimate payment errors, potentially leading to challenges for Part C plans. The audits involve a three-step process: sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. CMS uses a sample size of 201 enrollees drawn from eligible Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the contract in January of the payment year. The enrollee sample for Medicare beneficiaries in MA contracts must meet specific criteria, including continuous enrollment, non-ESRD status, limited hospice care, full Medicare Part B coverage, and a diagnosis leading to CMS-HCC assignment for risk-adjusted payments. The enrollee sample for Medicare beneficiaries in MA contracts is divided into three equal groups based on risk scores. Each group consists of 67 randomly selected enrollees, with sampling weights ensuring representation of each group. For example, in a contract with 3,000 eligible enrollees, they would be ranked by risk. The enrollee sample for Medicare beneficiaries in MA contracts is divided into three equal groups based on risk scores. Each group consists of 67 randomly selected enrollees, with sampling weights ensuring representation of each group. Enrollee sampling weights are used to scale-up sample payment error findings to the population it represents. MA plans are informed of the audited enrollees and their HCC codes, and are required to provide evidence from medical records to substantiate each HCC code they were paid for within 12 weeks. The CMS contractor reviews medical records to validate HCC codes for payment. Plans must submit records for sampled enrollees within 12 weeks. If a diagnosis is confirmed, payment is justified; if not, it's considered an error. Plans can appeal findings, with final decisions binding unless reviewed by the CMS Administrator. Payment errors result in either overpayment or underpayment. The CMS contractor reviews medical records to validate HCC codes for payment. Plans must submit records for sampled enrollees within 12 weeks. Payment errors can result in either overpayment or underpayment, with corrections made based on supported HCCs from the RADV medical record review. Enrollee-level payment errors are defined as the difference between the original payment and the corrected payment. The payment error, whether positive or negative, is calculated for each sampled enrollee based on their enrollment in the MA selected contract. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is determined by multiplying the total payment error for each sampled enrollee by their sampling weight. The payment recovery amount for each audited MA contract is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, adjusted by a fee-for-service adjuster. The recovery amount for each audited MA contract is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, adjusted by a fee-for-service adjuster. The FFS adjuster addresses methodological concerns raised by the American Academy of Actuaries. Payment error calculation is depicted in Figure 4, with 201 eligible enrollees per contract selected for review. Each enrollee's total error in payment is established and extrapolated to the contract by weighting and adjusting for the time in the plan. The impact of each enrollee is extrapolated to the contract by weighting and adjusting for time in the plan. The error for each of the 201 sampled enrollees is summed, resulting in an estimated plan level error of $1,187.50. A 99% confidence interval is then calculated, with a range from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50, indicating a certainty that the actual error falls within this range. If the interval includes $0 or is below $0, the recovery amount would be limited to $0. The recovery amount in a hypothetical plan is constrained to $0 if the 99% confidence interval includes $0 or is below $0. If the interval does not include $0, a fee-for-service adjuster modifies the lower bound to determine the reimbursement amount to the government. The RADV audit results do not lead to additional payments to MA plans, as highlighted in recent studies on risk adjustment under Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage plans may enroll beneficiaries with below average costs to receive higher reimbursements, leading to concerns about disproportionate enrollment of high-cost individuals in certain plans. MedPAC and stakeholders are concerned about Medicare Advantage plans enrolling high-cost individuals but being reimbursed for average cost enrollees. There are doubts about improving the CMS risk adjustment model, with the American Academy of Actuaries expressing concerns about the audit process and the accuracy of Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments. The risk adjustment methodology used for Medicare Advantage plans may contain errors as adjustments were not validated. Concerns are raised about inconsistencies in applying risk adjustment factors developed with fee-for-service data to MA data without validation. The accuracy of the audit process and the data used for risk adjustments are questioned by stakeholders. The RADV audit data used to determine payment errors in Medicare Advantage plans may differ from the data used for risk adjustment modeling, potentially leading to inadequate payments for certain conditions like diabetes. If lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic in the audit data but were in the fee-for-service data used for risk scores, the risk score factor for diabetes could be understated, affecting payment accuracy. Stakeholders question the accuracy of the audit process and risk adjustment data used in Medicare Advantage plans. The inconsistency in data used for RADV audits and risk adjustment modeling in Medicare Advantage plans can lead to payment inaccuracies, especially for conditions like diabetes. This discrepancy may result in underpayment and payment inequities, affecting the overall risk profile of enrollees in affected MA plans. The Health Practice Council is concerned about the modified payment methodology not reflecting the true risk profile of enrollees. The Health Practice Council is concerned about the modified payment methodology for Medicare Advantage plans not accurately reflecting the risk profile of enrollees. There are worries about using unverified Medicare fee-for-service data for risk adjustment, which could lead to under or overcompensation for plans enrolling sicker or healthier beneficiaries. Some plans fear that RADV audit recoveries may pose significant financial risks. The Health Practice Council is concerned about the accuracy of risk adjustment coefficients for Medicare Advantage plans, as some plans fear that RADV audit recoveries could pose financial risks. Different models have been used to calculate risk adjustment for private plans under Medicare, with increasing complexity and explanatory power over the years. The risk adjustment models used to adjust Medicare private plan payments vary in complexity and explanatory power over the years. The R2 measure quantifies how well a model predicts beneficiary expenditures, ranging from 0 to 1. The Average Adjusted Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) model used by CMS explains 0.77% of the variation in beneficiary expenditures, with the most recent proposed model able to explain approximately 12.5% of the variation. Prior to 2000, private plan payments were risk-adjusted for demographic characteristics such as age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status. The AAPCC model includes demographic variables like age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status. These variables explain less than 1% of the variation in Medicare beneficiary expenditures. Private plan enrollees were found to be healthier than original Medicare enrollees, leading to higher payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology considering beneficiary health. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology by January 1, 2000. The Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model was used from 2000 to 2003, considering the worst principal inpatient diagnosis. However, the model had limitations as it did not account for illnesses with high expenditures that did not result in hospital admissions. The PIP-DCG model was used for risk adjustment from 2000 to 2003, but it did not consider illnesses with high costs that did not lead to hospital admissions. The CMS-HCC model, implemented in 2004, adjusts Medicare plan payments based on severity of illness and multiple diseases. The CMS-HCC model adjusts Medicare plan payments based on the severity of a beneficiary's illness, considering the accumulated effect of multiple diseases and interactive effects. Updates to the model, such as Version 12 and Version 21, account for changes in diagnosis codes and recalibrate with more recent data to explain a higher percentage of variation in Medicare expenditures. Version 21 of the CMS-HCC model includes updates to diagnosis codes and recalibration with recent data, increasing the predictive power to approximately 12.5%. It underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices. This version is set to be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans."
