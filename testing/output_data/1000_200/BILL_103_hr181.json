    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 1993\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a new provision for calculating the primary insurance amount for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B). This provision includes a transitional increase amount based on former law and the applicable percentage in relation to the year. The primary insurance amount is calculated by multiplying the excess under former law by the applicable percentage based on the year of eligibility for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for old-age insurance benefits eligibility in different years is as follows: 1979 - 60 percent, 1980 - 35 percent, 1981 - 30 percent, 1982 - 25 percent, and 1983 - 10 percent. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between the former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary amount. The applicable former law primary insurance amount is the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under the law in effect in December 1978 or as provided by subsection (d), modified as specified. The primary insurance amount is determined by specific rules, including the exclusion of certain subsections and the inclusion of calendar years after 1950. The primary insurance amount is determined by specific rules, including the exclusion of certain subsections and the inclusion of calendar years after 1950. This paragraph modifies the calculation method by considering any increases in the table. It applies only if it results in a higher primary insurance amount for the individual. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 1994. Recomputation of benefits is required for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for December 1987. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act to reflect the amendments made by the Act."
