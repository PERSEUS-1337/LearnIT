    "content": "During a confirmation hearing in January 2009, OMB Director-designate Peter Orszag discussed plans for oversight of the economic stimulus package. The incoming Administration favored creating a special oversight board chaired by a Chief Performance Officer. They planned to create a website with information about contracts and financial details. The Obama Administration established Recovery.gov to provide information on contracts and financial details related to stimulus legislation, aiming to track tax dollars and prevent waste in government spending. The House and Senate passed versions of the stimulus legislation in January and February 2009, with concerns raised about agencies' capacity to spend funds rapidly and oversight challenges. Negotiations were ongoing to reconcile differences between the two versions. In responding to a crisis, challenges arise in balancing speed with prudence and reconciling values of transparency, accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. Agencies and policymakers often have little time for planning or reflection. Long-term issues include building the capacity of federal agencies, Congress, and the President to better respond to crises and anticipating and avoiding preventable crises. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks described the importance of \"institutionalizing imagination\" to anticipate and avoid preventable crises. The federal government operates as a system of nested oversight, with Congress overseeing the President and agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget. Inspectors general and agencies like the Government Accountability Office assist in oversight.OMB is responsible for providing management leadership and oversight for many agencies within the executive branch. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has a statutory responsibility to provide management leadership and oversight for agencies within the executive branch. Oversight involves monitoring activities to ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and congressional intent, as well as avoiding mismanagement. Various tools such as monitoring, analysis, and evaluation are used in the oversight framework. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides oversight for executive branch agencies to ensure compliance with laws and congressional intent, avoiding mismanagement. Oversight includes monitoring, analysis, and evaluation to prevent fraud, bias, and inefficiency in funding allocations and policy execution. Implementation by agencies, nonfederal recipients, OMB, oversight board, and IGs will determine how these oversight perspectives are approached. Table 1 summarizes oversight provisions in House and Senate economic stimulus legislation, with bolded citations. References to \"the Act\" in each bill generally pertain to specific divisions, not the entire bill."
