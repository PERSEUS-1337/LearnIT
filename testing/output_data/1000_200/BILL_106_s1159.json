    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for all K-12 students. Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence. Participation in quality physical education programs leads to better health and fitness, especially important as the rate of overweight youth has more than doubled in the past 30 years. The percentage of young people overweight has more than doubled in the 30 years before 1999. Low activity levels contribute to obesity among children in the US. Obesity-related diseases cost over $100 billion annually. Inactivity and poor diet cause 300,000 deaths yearly in the US. Physically fit adults have reduced risk for heart attacks and stroke. Children are not active enough, with less than 1 in 4 getting vigorous activity daily. Surgeon General's 1996 Report emphasizes physical activity for health. The Surgeon General's 1996 Report and the Centers for Disease Control recommend daily physical education for all students in kindergarten through grade 12. Despite a resolution passed by Congress in 1987, little progress has been made in providing quality physical education programs for all children. It is essential for every student to have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education programs. Quality physical education programs are crucial for developing health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity for all students to adopt healthy lifestyles. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing students with a minimum of 150 minutes per week of instructional physical education and incorporating fitness education and assessment. The physical education program must include daily instructional physical education, fitness education, motor skills instruction, cognitive concepts about physical fitness, social and cooperative skill development, multicultural perspectives, and appropriate physical activity for all children. The physical education program must include daily instructional physical education, fitness education, motor skills instruction, cognitive concepts about physical fitness, social and cooperative skill development, multicultural perspectives, and appropriate physical activity for all children. Teachers of physical education should have baccalaureate degrees and receive professional development to stay updated. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC programs are not considered part of the curriculum for physical education programs assisted under this part. The Secretary must ensure equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies, as well as between agencies serving large and small student populations. Funds may include participation of private school and home-schooled students. Continued funding requires a report. \"Continued funding for multiyear grants or contracts under this part requires an annual report on activities and progress towards program requirements. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by June 1, 2003, detailing program success and making recommendations for program continuation and improvement. Administrative costs are also addressed.\" \"Administrative costs for local educational agencies receiving grant funds are limited to 7 percent. The Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 90 percent in the first year and 75 percent in subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other available Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed.\" Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 is set at $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 for each year from 2002 to 2004. The funds will remain available until expended."
