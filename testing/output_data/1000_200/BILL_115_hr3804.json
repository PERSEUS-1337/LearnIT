    "content": "The \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\" is the short title of this Act. The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use planning, leading to costly relief programs and disruptive security measures. It emphasizes the need for federal and state support in integrating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into comprehensive urban development. Disaster planning should be proactive, incorporating mitigation strategies from various professional fields like urban planning, architecture, and design to prevent property damage and human casualties. Federal and State governments should support integrating emergency preparedness into land use planning to reduce post-disaster recovery costs. Efforts to update land use statutes in many States to support comprehensive planning for safe communities and long-term hazard mitigation are underway. Coordination between State and regional investments with local plans requires additional State-level planning. Efforts to coordinate State and regional investments with local plans require additional State-level planning. Comprehensive urban planning integrates land use, transportation systems, water facilities, and safety considerations to promote safe and economically viable communities. Safe housing is crucial for community development, and modern planning techniques should ensure a variety of safe housing options for all community members. The Federal Government, State governments, Tribal governments, and Native Hawaiian organizations should support land use planning and community development efforts to improve housing safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate hazards and improve emergency preparedness efforts. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate hazards and improve emergency preparedness efforts. To be eligible for the grant, a State or local planning director must demonstrate that their land use planning legislation goals align with guidelines including citizen engagement and stakeholder involvement in the planning process. In developing land use plans, stakeholder involvement and multi-disciplinary planning processes are essential. Multi-jurisdictional cooperation and multi-agency coordination are necessary for assessing risks from natural hazards and terrorist acts. Land use plans must include implementation elements. Land use plans must include implementation elements such as a timetable for action, roles and responsibilities, consistency with budget objectives, and decision-making framework for infrastructure development. Comprehensive planning should incorporate risk assessment and mitigation into State or locally adopted comprehensive plans. The State or local government must incorporate risk assessment and mitigation into comprehensive plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans. Plans should be regularly updated and adhere to professional planning standards. Grant funds can be used for various purposes as outlined. Grant funds received by a State or local government can be used for developing land use plans, assessing critical infrastructure, developing geographical information systems, acquiring technology for risk assessment, and updating building codes and regulations. The curr_chunk discusses various strategies for enhancing security and mitigating risks related to land use, including updating building codes, implementing CPTED initiatives, assessing vulnerability, and promoting interagency cooperation. The curr_chunk focuses on identifying natural hazard areas and integrating them into comprehensive plans, land use regulations, zoning, and building codes. Grants under this program are capped at $1,125,000 with a maximum federal share of 90%, which can be increased for Tribal governments or Native Hawaiian organizations. The Secretary is also tasked with encouraging coordination of land use planning for Federal land. The Secretary encourages coordination between Federal land management agencies and State or local planning directors. The Inspector General conducts audits to ensure grant funds are used as specified. Audit results influence future grant awards. In this section, audits conducted by the Inspector General influence future grant awards based on recommendations. Definitions for \"land use planning legislation\" and \"comprehensive plan\" are provided. The curr_chunk discusses the regulation and management of land, natural resources, development practices, and infrastructure investments for future land use and urban development. It defines the term \"State\" to include various entities and the term \"State planning director\" as a designated state official. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to land use regulation, including \"director,\" \"local planning director,\" and \"Tribal government.\" These terms designate officials responsible for drafting and updating comprehensive plans and guidance documents at the state, local, and tribal levels. SEC. 4. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING RESEARCH. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with various partners, will conduct research on land use and community planning to mitigate natural hazards and terrorism threats. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans, assessing the impact of security strategies on communities, and using mapping tools for risk assessment. A report to Congress is due within 2 years. The Secretary will report to Congress on best practices in community security and safety planning, including evaluations of land use codes, software tools for safe development, security design standards, and incorporating safety into infrastructure planning. The Secretary will evaluate best practices for incorporating safety and security into infrastructure planning, considering regional, State, and local differences, and focusing on risk reduction and cost effectiveness. Authorization of Appropriations: $57,250,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2019 through 2023. $56,250,000 for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4."
