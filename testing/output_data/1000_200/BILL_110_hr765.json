    "content": "Increase and extension of credit for certain flexible fuel hybrid vehicles. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include new credits for flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicles and qualified alternative fuel motor vehicles. The new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle credit is determined under subsection (e) and the new qualified alternative fuel motor vehicle credit is determined under subsection (f). The new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle credit is determined under subsection (e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The credit amount for a new hybrid flexible fuel motor vehicle placed in service during the taxable year is determined according to a specified table. The credit amount for a vehicle based on city fuel economy ranges from $1,500 to $3,500, depending on the percentage increase compared to a comparable vehicle. The city fuel economy for determining the credit on a new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle is based on E-85 ethanol gallon equivalent, while the comparable vehicle's fuel economy is based on gasoline gallon equivalent. The text discusses the certification requirements for a flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicle to qualify for a tax credit based on achieving a certain city fuel economy using E-85 ethanol. The credit is not applicable if a vehicle already qualifies for a different hybrid motor vehicle credit. The text discusses amendments to the tax credit for flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicles, including an extension of termination date to December 31, 2014, and vehicles included in the numeric limitation. Conforming amendments are also made to subsections (i)(5) and (i)(6) of the tax code. The tax credit for flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicles is amended to change subsection references. Subsection (k) of section 30(B) is also amended to exclude new flexible fuel hybrid motor vehicles from certain provisions. The tax credit amendments include changing subsection references in various sections of the Code, with an effective date after December 31, 2006."
