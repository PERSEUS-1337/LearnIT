    "content": "This report, General Management Laws: Major Themes and Management Policy Options, is a companion to CRS Report RL30795, General Management Laws: A Compendium. The main objectives are to identify and describe major general management laws, assist Congress in overseeing executive branch management, and help with potential changes to management laws and legislation. The compendium profiles selected general management laws regulating executive branch activities and administration. Maintaining the quality and implementation of these laws is crucial for accountability. The companion report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to general management laws for the executive branch. It complements the compendium, which includes over 90 entries describing these laws. The report reflects the status of general management laws at the end of the first session of the 108th Congress and will be updated accordingly. The compendium includes over 90 entries describing general management laws for the executive branch, organized into seven functional categories. These categories cover areas such as Information Management, Financial Management, and Human Resources Management. The report focuses on major themes and policy options related to these laws for Congress. The report provides historical background on the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, focusing on key developments and issues in general management laws for the executive branch. The report discusses the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, debates on their constitutional powers, and the system of checks and balances. Scholars have noted that both branches manage the executive branch, as established by the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution established a system of separated powers and checks and balances. Justice Robert Jackson emphasized the interdependence and autonomy of branches in managing the executive branch. Congress has the power to establish administrative agencies and make laws according to Article I, Section 1 and Section 8 of the Constitution. The U.S. Constitution grants legislative powers to Congress and executive powers to the President. Congress has the authority to make laws necessary for executing its powers, while the President is tasked with ensuring laws are faithfully executed. However, the President's power is limited and must not be used to frustrate congressional intentions. Article II of the U.S. Constitution does not grant the President power to frustrate congressional intentions. It outlines the President's ability to seek written opinions from department heads and appoint officials. In 1789, Congress passed laws establishing the Treasury Department and setting salaries for department secretaries. After the establishment of the Treasury Department in 1789, Congress enacted a law to set annual salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of the Treasury, State, and War, and imposed a salary cap for clerk positions. By 1801, the Federalists had created an administrative system with an independent chief executive, effective delegation of authority, and a fiscal system for the government. After ascending to power in 1801, the Democratic-Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, accepted the Federalist framework for government administration. Congress became more active in dealing with the administrative system, as the country grew in size and population. Federal employment increased significantly from 1816 to 1861, and the organization of executive departments became more complex. The growth of federal employment in government administration from 1816 to 1861 led to a more complex structure of executive departments. By 1860, departments consisted of the Secretary, bureaus handling routine business, and a field service. Various historical events post-Civil War contributed to the expansion of the administrative state. The Progressive Movement, Great Depression, two world wars, and social policy challenges led to the growth of the administrative state. By 1946, Congress delegated much legislative authority to agencies, relying on their expertise for policy making. Agencies were seen to sometimes exercise legislative powers, prompting Congress to expand general management laws to improve executive branch practices. Congress expanded general management laws to address various aspects of the executive branch, including increasing transparency through legislation like the Administrative Procedure Act, Freedom of Information Act, and Federal Advisory Committee Act. They also established inspectors general, enacted the Congressional Review of Regulations Act, and required agency strategic planning with the Government Performance and Results Act to improve oversight and accountability. The Government Performance and Results Act (1993) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act (1974) were passed by Congress to improve oversight and influence over the budget process. The Chief Financial Officers Act (1990) and other laws were also enacted to enhance agencies' financial management capacities. These general management laws aim to bring disciplined management to executive branch agencies, but there is debate over whether they promote flexibility or stifle initiative. The debate over whether laws promote flexibility or stifle initiative in executive branch agencies depends on the viewpoint of the questioner and the situation at hand. Scholars and practitioners often compare management practices in the public and private sectors, seeking to learn from each other. Numerous controversial issues remain for Congress to consider. Management and public administration scholars often compare practices in the public and private sectors, looking for lessons learned. However, they caution against applying private-sector principles to government agencies without recognizing key differences. Public and private management are similar in unimportant respects, but operate under different laws with distinct purposes. Government has coercive power under the Constitution and public law. The government has coercive power under the Constitution and public law, with checks and balances to prevent abuse. Federal agencies operate under laws authorized by Congress, the President, and the courts. In contrast, private companies operate under laws that regulate the market economy but do not dictate operations. Under the framework of law, companies are primarily accountable to their owners or shareholders. Government agencies have restrictions on retaining earnings, allocating resources, and setting goals, unlike private sector organizations. Control over agency operations is largely external to the organization. Government agencies face challenges in managing their operations as control over revenues, resources, and goals is largely vested in external entities such as legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups. The difficulty in measuring agency performance and differences between public and private sector management practices raise public policy issues. The compendium of general management laws presents themes that may prompt Congress to consider management policy options. When examining general management laws, Congress must consider how much discretion to grant the executive branch in determining agency actions. This debate revolves around the flexibility agencies have in implementing laws and adapting to changing circumstances. Giving discretion can lead to quicker regulatory processes and increased responsiveness. Discretion allows agencies to be more responsive to changing circumstances, enabling quicker regulatory processes and initiative in management actions. It also allows the executive to make decisions that may not have support from Congress. This can lead to conflicts between the President or agency and Congress, as they may have different views on what actions to take. Some argue that granting discretion to the executive branch can lead to lack of congressional oversight and put key decisions in the hands of unelected agency officials, impacting transparency and accountability. Congress faced this tension in 2002 and 2003 when considering granting discretion to DHS and DOD for their human resources management systems. Similar situations arose in 1993 with the Clinton Administration's NPR recommendations on procurement policy. The National Performance Review (NPR) recommended ways to streamline procurement policy, leading to the passage of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. Congress can address delegation situations by setting conditions for authority delegation to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch and reduce risks. This helps balance flexibility with accountability in regulatory decision-making. Congress can address delegation situations by setting conditions for authority delegation to ensure its intentions are carried out by the executive branch. This can include goals, sanctions, probation periods, or sunsets, as well as screening and selection mechanisms to avoid poor performance. Profit-sharing relationships can also be established to incentivize agencies to behave in ways that benefit both the agency and the government as a whole. Congress can increase accountability and transparency by requiring agencies to report their actions, milestones, and obtained information. This can be done through hearings to analyze agency problem-solving and organizational capacity. The use of information technology allows for real-time and frequent updates, although some argue that excessive reporting requirements can be burdensome. Some argue that excessive reporting requirements can be burdensome, and reports to Congress may not always be utilized. Congress can implement institutional checks to oversee agency actions, such as involving additional agencies in regulatory processes or requiring independent studies. The tension between standardization and customization in agency management laws is a frequent issue for Congress. Standardization can improve transparency and accountability in the executive branch, with the Administrative Procedure Act as an example. Congress can use institutional checks like independent studies or committee vetoes to oversee agency actions. Standardization in the executive branch, exemplified by the Administrative Procedure Act, enhances transparency and accountability. The CFO Act of 1990 mandated audited financial statements for major departments, leading to clean opinions in FY2002. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act extended similar requirements to other agencies, promoting accountability by shifting the burden of proof to agencies. Customization in agency management aligns with internal and external environments. Congress uses various tools to direct agency actions, including authorizing statutes and appropriations. Small agencies were not previously required to prepare audited financial statements, showing a level of customization in general management laws. The Department of Homeland Security was established with specific directives in mind. Until recently, small agencies were not required to prepare audited financial statements. The Department of Homeland Security's CFO position was initially exempt from CFO Act requirements. DHS and the DOD were granted authority to customize aspects of their HRM systems. This shows a move towards standardization or customization, with a mixed approach balancing both. The mixed approach in applying general management laws allows for exceptions and flexibility, as seen in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. Standardization, customization, and mixed approaches each have advantages and disadvantages in agency management. Customization in agency management can reduce transparency and accountability if not reported in real-time. It can also lead to different entities working at cross-purposes, causing budget pressures. Congress has policy options to address these issues, with the decision depending on the specific problem and stakeholders involved. One option to address issues in agency management is to regularly assess the need for increased customization or standardization in general management law for better transparency and efficiency. Analytical support can be obtained from various sources like agency management, program evaluations, and outside evaluators. Another option is to reduce the burden on Congress by requiring real-time updates on the current state of affairs in situations where customization is prevalent. The executive branch is required to maintain real-time descriptions of the current state of affairs and comparisons across agencies to assist Congress in monitoring the situation. Fragmentation of civil service laws may complicate monitoring and analyzing government-wide developments, particularly in areas like pay and performance management. Reporting requirements in areas of widespread customization could help reduce the burden on Congress and the public in examining customization and standardization. The executive branch is required to maintain real-time descriptions of the current state of affairs and comparisons across agencies to assist Congress in monitoring the situation. Reporting requirements in areas of widespread customization could help reduce the burden on Congress and the public in examining customization and standardization. Central management agencies could report how certain management policies are customized to facilitate government-wide analysis and comparisons. Most organizations in the private and public sectors manage themselves with a functional orientation or structures, which can boost efficiency through specialization but may hinder organization-wide coordination if too inward-looking. Functional silos can develop, leading to problems in decision-making and general manager development. Functional silos can hinder organization-wide coordination and lead to missed opportunities. Management literature emphasizes the importance of integrating functional perspectives within a broader general management perspective. Different backgrounds and experiences shape individuals' viewpoints, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to problem-solving and decision-making. The importance of integrating functional perspectives within a general management perspective is highlighted to overcome limited views and drive towards a complete understanding of problems or opportunities. This approach combines multiple functional viewpoints to develop a holistic problem-solving toolbox. An integrated general management perspective combines various functional viewpoints to address executive branch management problems, utilizing general management laws to provide mutual support to each other. Integration can be achieved through changes to laws, agency statutes, appropriations, and other legislative tools. Congress can integrate functional perspectives by leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for more timely financial and performance reporting, utilizing the Federal Enterprise Architecture for real-time results, directing appropriations for hiring contract oversight specialists, and restructuring budget accounts. Leveraging functional perspectives through various laws and acts to improve contract management, oversight, budget alignment, and program evaluations across agencies. The history of federal government management reform involves efforts to improve agencies' performance and practices through general management laws. Despite these efforts, progress has been challenging. Despite efforts to improve agency management practices through general management laws, progress has been difficult to achieve. Congress faces challenges in overseeing executive branch management, particularly in measuring agencies' progress. Measurement systems can motivate action but may also create perverse incentives. Measurement systems can motivate action and commitment but can also create perverse incentives. For example, rewarding employees based solely on short-term profits may lead to neglect of long-term research and development. Achieving clean financial audits may seem like good fiscal management, but not if achieved through manual workarounds of deficient systems. Agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported persistent management problems in executive branch agencies over the last 25 years. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported major management problems in executive branch agencies in areas like financial management, acquisition, information technology, human resources, and strategic planning. GAO released reports detailing \"high risk\" areas and challenges, noting progress but also highlighting remaining work to be done. Management reform initiatives have been pursued by presidential administrations. Several management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations, including President Ronald Reagan's Reform '88, President George H. W. Bush's efforts in financial and information resources management, and President William Clinton's NPR. Concerns about government management were frequently expressed by Congress during this period, with recommendations made to improve central management, procurement, information resources management, financial management, and human resources management. Senator Fred Thompson released a report in June 2001 highlighting \"urgent federal government management problems.\" Fred Thompson, Chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, released a report in June 2001 concluding that the administration of President George W. Bush faced \"urgent federal government management problems\" related to the federal workforce, financial management, information technology, and overlap and duplication. President Bush's Office of Management and Budget later introduced the President's Management Agenda (PMA) in August 2001, consisting of five government-wide initiatives aimed at improving management. Under the PMA, agencies are evaluated quarterly by OMB based on red, yellow, or green \"stoplight scores\" to assess progress in areas such as human capital, financial performance, electronic government, and budget integration. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) evaluates agencies quarterly based on red, yellow, or green \"stoplight scores\" to assess progress in key management areas. Green indicates meeting all standards for success, yellow for partial achievement, and red for serious flaws. OMB assesses progress on a case-by-case basis against established deliverables and timelines, with green meaning implementation is on track, yellow indicating issues requiring adjustment, and red showing serious problems. The five government-wide PMA initiatives are evaluated quarterly using red, yellow, or green \"stoplight scores\" to assess progress. Green indicates meeting all standards, yellow for partial achievement, and red for serious jeopardy. The initiatives utilize general management laws to achieve their goals. The PMA initiatives leverage various general management laws to achieve their goals, with agencies reporting significant progress. However, there are concerns about transparency in PMA evaluation practices and congressional oversight. Observations about PMA measurement practices reveal a lack of transparency in evaluation practices outside the executive branch. OMB assessments using the Program Assessment Rating Tool were more transparent, with detailed worksheets showing evidence used for assessments. Subjectivity may be a challenge due to stoplight scoring criteria. The PMA's measurement practices lack transparency, with subjective criteria making objectivity challenging. Initiatives like the Expanded Electronic Government and Strategic Management of Human Capital require specific criteria for success. Independent evaluation organizations have not verified agency stoplight scores, and the PMA does not cover all aspects of general management laws, such as contract oversight and small business concerns in Competitive Sourcing. The PMA does not address contract oversight, small business concerns, or real property management issues. Various entities have tried to improve agency management practices over the years, including agency IGs, GAO, OMB, and Congress. Representative Stephen Horn has been involved in measurement efforts to assess general management laws across agencies. Measurement efforts have been made to assess general management laws and functional areas across agencies, with representatives issuing letter grades for agency performance in financial management and information security. Congress can consider options to ensure agencies comply with these laws and improve their management practices. Congress could monitor agency progress in improving management practices through existing oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs, or consider independent verification and validation methods. Critics argue that Congress may not use these tools effectively or frequently enough. Congress could increase oversight of the executive branch by utilizing tools like GAO and agency IGs to verify PMA stoplight scores. This could enhance congressional confidence in executive branch measurements, but may be perceived as micromanagement. Additionally, Congress could request access to final PMA stoplight worksheets for transparency, allowing for public discussion on management issues. Congress could enhance oversight of the executive branch by directing GAO or IGs to develop measures for systematically measuring agency progress in improving management practices. This option aims to make management improvement measurement more systematic and easily comparable across agencies, but could increase workload and costs for GAO, IGs, and agencies. Additionally, Congress could amend GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports. Congress could require the establishment of milestones and timelines for improvement in addressing major management problems and building agency capacity. This could be included in the government-wide performance plan, potentially increasing workload for agencies and OMB personnel. Another theme is the creation of agency \"chief officer\" positions and interagency collaboration. The compendium of general management laws highlights the establishment of agency \"chief officer\" positions, including inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. These positions head various functions within executive branch agencies. Table 1 summarizes key information about agency \"chief officer\" positions, including their functions, establishment laws, statutory provisions, appointment rules, and reporting relationships. Some officers are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by agency heads. Reporting relationships vary among chief officers. The establishment of agency \"chief officer\" positions, such as IGs, CFOs, CIOs, CHCOs, and CAOs, aimed to address the lack of attention to functional perspectives in executive branch agencies. These positions were created to elevate functional perspectives within agency management ranks to tackle long-standing issues. Each group of chief officers was placed into an interagency council by statute or executive order. The establishment of agency \"chief officer\" positions aimed to address functional perspectives in executive branch agencies. Chief officers were placed into interagency councils by statute or executive order, with varying memberships. The Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management chairs or vice-chairs each council, allowing the Executive Office of the President to influence their activities. President Ronald Reagan established the first council. President Ronald Reagan established the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) in 1981, with agency IGs as members. The PCIE aimed to coordinate government-wide efforts to combat fraud and waste. It provided leverage for IGs to secure resources and enhance their independence. Standing committees were formed to facilitate idea-sharing and collaboration among IGs. The PCIE, established in 1981, aimed to coordinate government-wide efforts to combat fraud and waste. It provided a mechanism for IGs to work together and develop their own work plans. Despite being praised for its value in promoting collaboration, the PCIE was also criticized as a \"trade union\" for IGs. In the late 1980s, the PCIE was criticized as a \"trade union\" for IGs. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils, the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the ECIE for IGs appointed by agency heads. The CFO Council was created by the CFO Act of 1990, which also established the DDM position in the President's Office of Management and Budget with chairperson status over the CFO Council. The DDM was tasked with establishing general management policies in the executive branch. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, oversees general management policies in the executive branch for various functions. In 1994, the council took steps to increase its effectiveness, such as broadening membership and setting its own agenda. OMB supported these recommendations, and the CFO Council formed committees for special emphasis areas. The CFO Council, established in 1990, has been successful in overseeing general management policies in the executive branch. It has served as a model for other interagency efforts, leading to the establishment of additional chief officer councils. These chief officer positions have been important in bringing focus to their functional perspectives, although they face some difficult challenges in their efforts to improve. Observers have identified challenges facing chief officers in improving agency management practices, including high turnover among CIOs, change management difficulties, and performance measurement issues. Agencies continue to struggle with management difficulties due to budget pressures and lack of attention from political appointees. Management scholars caution against functional silos hindering a more integrated general management perspective. Public management scholars have highlighted the benefits of interagency collaboration, emphasizing the importance of setting up networks to share knowledge and best practices. Testimony from a former OMB official also supports the role of interagency councils in improving federal management. Research suggests that setting up networks for knowledge sharing among human capital officers in different parts of the Federal Government is crucial for organizational performance. Attention has been given to the \"knowledge management\" perspective, but management theorists warn against a narrow functional perspective that may harm other functions or the agency overall. Scholars and practitioners have emphasized the importance of interagency collaboration and networks for sharing knowledge and best practices. Some scholars and practitioners suggest re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President to improve federal executive branch management. Questions arise about the need for additional chief officers in executive branch agencies, preserving institutional memory for political appointees, making councils statutory, funding and accountability to Congress. Should Congress establish agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) to ensure government services are available in emergencies and address security risks for federal agencies? Many CSOs focus on information technology but some handle all security responsibilities. Establishing statutory CSO positions could lead to turf battles between CIOs and CSOs, but it may bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management at federal agencies. Some argue that requiring additional chief officers would be excessive, as many agencies already have systems in place. Observers note that agencies often lack the capacity and commitment to adequately evaluate program performance and results. Many agencies lack the capacity and commitment to evaluate program performance effectively. Congress could establish \"chief program evaluation officer\" positions in major agencies to address this issue, although critics argue it may be excessive. If Congress decides to alter or establish new chief officer positions, appointments can vary between political and career positions. Political appointees offer a functional perspective, while career officials provide continuity across administrations. In enacting the CFO Act, Congress reflected both functional and institutional perspectives by appointing political CFOs and career deputies. Reporting relationships for CFOs and CIOs are mandated to be direct to the agency head, while CHCOs and CAOs have discretion. The appropriateness of these relationships in addressing management needs and problems is questioned. The argument for a direct reporting relationship to the agency head is to ensure the chief officer's personal access to senior leadership. However, adding another direct report could overwhelm agency heads with too many subordinates. Congress may consider making IG councils statutory instead of continuing as organizations established by executive order. The vice chair of the PCIE believes codification of IG councils would require modest appropriations but improve training, strengthen IG-Congress relationship, and enhance coordination between IG offices. Funding for interagency councils is self-financed through MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. The funding for interagency councils is self-financed through MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. The CHCO Council is funded out of the Office of Personnel Management budget, while the CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Council are funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements under Title VI general provisions. The funding for interagency councils is self-financed through MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. Congress could consider altering the reporting and strategic planning requirements for the interagency councils to improve control and leverage over their activities. This could potentially enhance institutional memory and continuity across presidential administrations. Some interagency councils lack reporting and strategic planning requirements. For instance, the IG councils report only to the President. The CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils do not have statutory requirements to report to Congress or prepare strategic plans. Congress could mandate submission of plans or reports to enhance transparency and accountability.OMB could be required to lead the interagency chief officer councils and submit an overall plan as part of the government-wide performance plan. The lack of reporting and planning requirements for some interagency councils could be addressed to increase transparency and accountability. Implementing planning and reporting requirements may enhance transparency but could also limit the President's discretion and increase costs for the councils or OMB."
