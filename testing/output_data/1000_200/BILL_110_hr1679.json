    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Caribbean Coral Reef Protection Act\" and states its policy. The United States policy is to deny Cuba financial resources that threaten national security, Florida's marine environment, and the Cuban people's freedom. It also aims to deter foreign investments in Cuba's petroleum resources. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 is amended to exclude aliens who contribute to Cuba's ability to develop petroleum resources off its coast. The Secretary of State will deny visas and exclude aliens from the US who invest over $1,000,000 in enhancing Cuba's ability to develop petroleum resources off its coast. Spouses, minor children, or agents of these individuals are also affected. The Secretary of State can waive visa denials for individuals investing in Cuba's petroleum resources if it's necessary for medical reasons, litigation, or if specific requirements are met. Definitions include the Cuban Communist Party as an agent. The term 'investment' in relation to petroleum resources in Cuba includes activities undertaken pursuant to an agreement with the Cuban government or a nongovernmental entity after January 10, 2005, for the development of petroleum resources off Cuba's coast. The term 'investment' in relation to petroleum resources in Cuba includes activities for the development of petroleum resources off Cuba's coast, such as purchasing ownership shares, participating in royalties, and selling goods or services related to the development. The term 'petroleum resources' includes petroleum, natural gas, by-products, and liquefied natural gas. The amendment applies to aliens seeking admission to the US after the enactment of the Act. The amendment imposes sanctions and prohibits the facilitation of the development of Cuba's petroleum resources, including petroleum, natural gas, by-products, and liquefied natural gas. If the President determines that a person has made an investment of $1,000,000 or more contributing to Cuba's petroleum development or trafficked in confiscated US property after January 10, 2005, sanctions will be imposed, including prohibiting loans and guarantees from US institutions. The Export-Import Bank and other US instruments are prohibited from providing any financial support for exports to sanctioned persons. Additionally, specific licenses for exporting goods or technology to sanctioned persons are also prohibited under various US statutes. Prohibitions on financial institutions may include preventing designation as a primary dealer in US Government debt instruments and serving as a repository of government funds for sanctioned persons. Sanctions may include prohibiting financial institutions from serving as agents or repositories for US Government funds. Additionally, the US Government is prohibited from procuring goods or services from sanctioned individuals. Sanctions imposed under subsection (a) will end if the President certifies that certain requirements of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act have been met. It is illegal for US persons to assist Cuba in developing petroleum resources off its coast. The Secretary of State must report to the Committee on Foreign Affairs every 180 days. The Secretary of State must report every 180 days to congressional committees on investments exceeding $1,000,000 that enhance Cuba's ability to develop offshore petroleum resources.

The Secretary of State must submit annual reports assessing the environmental impact of Cuba's petroleum development on submerged lands and Florida's marine environment, using environmental impact statements as a model.
