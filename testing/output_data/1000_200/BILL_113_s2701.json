    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Stopping Illegal Obamacare Subsidies Act\" and limits auto-enrollment in health plans until inconsistencies are resolved as outlined in a report by the Inspector General. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will make public the steps to clear inconsistencies in eligibility for healthcare programs within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, methods to monitor progress in resolving inconsistencies will be disclosed within the same timeframe. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services use methods to monitor progress in resolving inconsistencies in the Federal Exchange and State Exchanges. Premium assistance tax credits and cost-sharing programs will be suspended for plan year 2015 until all inconsistencies related to invalid social security numbers are resolved. The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services must resolve all inconsistencies in applicant information before enrollment in a qualified health plan. During the inconsistency period, individuals can enroll but cannot access premium assistance credits or reduced cost-sharing programs. During the inconsistency period, individuals who cooperate with requests for additional information may retroactively receive benefits from the premium assistance credit program or reduced cost-sharing program if later determined eligible. Failure to provide requested information may result in withdrawal from these programs. During the inconsistency period, individuals must provide accurate information to re-enroll in a qualified health plan to receive benefits from the premium assistance credit program or reduced cost-sharing program. Failure to do so may result in disenrollment and withdrawal from these programs. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"inconsistencies\" refer to differences in self-attested information provided by an applicant for health plan enrollment and eligibility determination for tax credits, Medicaid, or CHIP, compared to data from the Federal Data Services Hub or other sources, including citizenship, income, employer-sponsored coverage, incarceration status, or other factors affecting eligibility for financial assistance programs. The term \"inconsistency period\" refers to a 90-day period starting from the date a notice of an inconsistency is sent to the applicant, impacting eligibility for financial assistance programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
