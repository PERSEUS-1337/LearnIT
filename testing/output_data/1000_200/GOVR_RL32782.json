    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed \"Clear Skies\" to address emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The proposal aimed to amend the Clean Air Act with emission caps on electric utility emissions, implemented through a tradeable allowance program in two phases: 2010 and 2018. The modified version of Clear Skies (S. 131) introduced in the 109th Congress by Senator Inhofe has sparked debate on its cap-and-trade implementation scheme. The debate surrounding the Administration's Clear Skies proposal has focused on its cap-and-trade implementation scheme, aiming to deliver guaranteed emissions reductions of SO2, NOx, and mercury at a fraction of command-and-control costs. EPA has already used a regional cap-and-trade program to control NOx emissions and proposed similar regulations for SO2 and NOx reductions over 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia. The Clear Skies proposal includes cap-and-trade regulations for emissions reductions over 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia for SO2 and NOx. Additionally, there are provisions to alter existing sections of the Clean Air Act for affected electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. EPA believes certain CAA provisions are no longer necessary with Clear Skies. The Environment and Public Works Committee discussed the potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the Clean Air Act, suggesting that regulations such as New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain could be eliminated and combined into a simplified regulatory process for utilities. The report examines how this legislation would affect electric generating units and other industrial sources. This report analyzes the potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the Clean Air Act, specifically focusing on electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. Changes proposed by Clear Skies would mainly affect Title I of the Clean Air Act, with distinctions based on factors like location, existing vs. new facilities, and fuel type. Despite amendments in 1990, the original structure from 1970 and 1977 remains the foundation of the Act. The Clean Air Act established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to regulate air pollutants. The addition of Title IV in 1990 did not alter the Act's basic requirements, serving as a supplemental provision. EPA sets primary NAAQS for pollutants like SO2, NOx, and PM. The Clean Air Act established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants like SO2, NOx, and PM. EPA sets primary NAAQS to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. States are responsible for implementing the standards through State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to reduce emissions from existing facilities. Areas not meeting NAAQS require new sources to install Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent overall emissions from increasing. The 1970 Clean Air Act mandates new sources to install Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent overall emissions from increasing. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are imposed on major new stationary sources of air pollution, including fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. EPA reviews these standards every eight years. The Clean Air Act mandates NSPS for SO2, NOx, and PM10 for new sources, regardless of location. Interstate pollution is addressed through mechanisms like the NOx SIP Call, controlling emissions from 20 states and DC. Regional commissions and state petitions also play a role in addressing noncompliance with NAAQS. EPA encourages states to work together to tackle the ozone problem in the eastern US. Under the Clean Air Act, states are given emission budgets to achieve in any way they choose. EPA successfully encouraged states to implement regulations through a cap-and-trade program. Existing sources in nonattainment areas are subject to state controls to meet NAAQS, while sources in attainment areas are mostly free from controls. New sources must adhere to NSPS as the minimum requirement. The 1977 CAA introduced the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program to address ambient concentrations of pollutants like SO2 and NOx. The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program under the Clean Air Act focuses on controlling pollution in clean air areas by allowing limited degradation based on classification. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT). States can reclassify areas to allow for more pollution up to the NAAQS. The New Source Review (NSR) program requires installation of Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for new sources. State permitting agencies determine BACT based on energy, environmental, and economic impacts. BACT must be at least as stringent as federal NSPS, but can be more so. The regional haze program focuses on visibility impairment from air pollution in national parks and wilderness areas, requiring sources built between 1962 and 1977 to install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART). EPA promulgated regulations in 1999. Sources built between 1962 and 1977 are required to install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to address visibility impairment from pollutants like sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates. In 1999, the EPA implemented a regional haze program with stricter controls on NOx and SO2 emissions. Additionally, the Clean Air Act establishes a regulatory program for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) like mercury, with MACT standards set for major pollution sources. The EPA Administrator must ensure that MACT standards are at least as stringent as the best controlled similar source for new sources or the average of the best performing 12% for existing sources. Electric utilities received special treatment under Section 112, with regulations addressing residual risks from HAPs. EPA initially found MACT standards necessary for electric generating units but later proposed a cap-and-trade program as an alternative approach. In 2004, the EPA proposed replacing the MACT standard with a cap-and-trade program for electric generating units. States can enforce stricter HAP standards than federal ones. Clear Skies would make various changes to current laws, including new authorities and programs. Clear Skies proposes changes to current laws, including new cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions and national emission standards for electric generating units. It also removes certain authorities related to hazardous air pollutants and modifies provisions like BART and conformity for several years. The Clear Skies proposal includes new cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions, national emission standards for electric generating units, and changes to hazardous air pollutant provisions. It also removes certain authorities related to major sources and establishes a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution. The Clear Skies proposal includes stricter requirements for petitions on interstate air pollution control, reduced penalties for noncompliance in the SO2 cap-and-trade program, preemption of state NOx and mercury regulations, elimination of NSR and BART requirements, establishment of a 50 km zone for PSD requirements, extension of deadlines for meeting ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS, and a moratorium on Subpart 2 provisions for ozone. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury, with emissions caps set in two phases. Phase 1 would establish caps for EGUs of 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. This proposal also includes stricter requirements for interstate air pollution control petitions and a moratorium on Subpart 2 provisions for ozone nonattainment areas. The Clear Skies proposal introduces a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury emissions in two phases. Phase 1 sets caps for EGUs at 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowances are allocated based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors like fuel type. A small pool of allowances is reserved for new units. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury emissions in two phases. A small pool of allowances is set aside for new units, with more stringent emission standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs compared to current NSPS. The National Emission Standards would apply to fewer units than the current NSPS. The proposed National Emission Standards for bituminous-fired EGUs would apply to fewer units compared to the current NSPS. Non-utility sources can opt into the cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions through alternative methods of determining allowances based on emissions and output. Units would receive allocations based on their baseline emissions starting in 2010. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would receive allocations based on their baseline emissions for SO2, NOx, and Hg starting in 2010. They would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants under certain regulations and could be permanently exempt if EPA accepts their application. Additionally, opting units would no longer be considered major sources for certain purposes. The ClearSkies proposal allows units to opt into a cap-and-trade program, receiving allocations based on baseline emissions. Opting units would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants and could be permanently exempt if EPA accepts their application. Units opting in would no longer be considered major sources for certain purposes. Additionally, a new \"transitional area\" category would be established in place of nonattainment designations for areas meeting new ozone and PM 2.5 standards by 2015. EPA or state modeling would determine eligibility for this designation. The ClearSkies proposal introduces a transitional area category to replace nonattainment designations for areas meeting new ozone and PM 2.5 standards by 2015. EPA modeling shows that most nonattainment counties would qualify for this status. This change extends deadlines for reaching attainment and removes statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. The Clear Skies proposal would exempt certain industries from major emitting facility status under the Clean Air Act for 20 years. This exemption includes NSR, BART, and BACT requirements for the PSD program, unless located near designated national parks. In nonattainment areas, affected units would be exempt from NSR, LAER, and offset requirements. Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units in nonattainment areas from NSR, LAER, and offset requirements. Units must show emissions control and good combustion practices within three years of enactment. Changes to hazardous air pollutant provisions would preclude regulation for electric utility steam generating units, except for certain exceptions. The Administrator would have the authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units based on public health concerns and emission control effects. Any standards imposed would require a peer-reviewed study and could not take effect before January 1, 2018. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutant regulations. The Clear Skies proposal would exempt units opting into the cap-and-trade program from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutant regulations and MACT standards. It also introduces changes to Section 126 petitions under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator may mandate controls on upwind sources if pollutants contribute significantly to nonattainment. The amendment limits SIP submission requirements for affected units under Section 126. The Administrator must consider emissions reductions for relevant nonattainment areas when reviewing petitions. Cost-effectiveness of emission reductions from affected units is a condition for making a finding. Clear Skies would replace the Clean Air Act's existing Section 411 in 2008, reducing penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program. Noncompliance penalties were set at $2,000 per ton of excess emissions in 1990, adjusted for inflation to $2,890.59 in 2004. Section 406 of the bill would set new requirements. The Clear Skies bill would reduce penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program. In 2004, the adjusted penalty amount would have been $2,890.59, but the bill sets it at $2,000 with no inflation adjustments. States can still enforce stricter limits, but under cap-and-trade programs, they cannot interfere with the transfer of allowances, potentially allowing increased emissions in other jurisdictions. The Clear Skies bill allows increased emissions in another jurisdiction equal to any reduction achieved in a more stringent state for covered pollutants. It limits the ability to control out-of-state pollution and exempts EGUs from NSR for 20 years, with new emission standards for new EGUs but not for modified units. Reconstruction is defined as replacing components exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost. The standards for reconstructed units would not apply unless it is feasible to meet them. There is no specific cost criterion for modifications requiring NSR, but it is considered to be below a 50% threshold. EPA's attempt to establish a 20% threshold was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The bill eliminates BART requirements for major sources under the Clean Air Act. The Clear Skies Act, introduced in December 2003, aims to exempt EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART requirements for 20 years. It also specifies that affected units near Class I areas must comply with PSD requirements to protect visibility. The Clear Skies Act exempts EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART requirements for 20 years. It requires affected units near Class I areas to comply with PSD requirements to protect visibility. Additionally, the Act extends deadlines for nonattainment areas to meet new ozone and PM2.5 standards. The Clear Skies Act extends deadlines for nonattainment areas to meet new ozone and PM2.5 standards. Transitional areas can avoid penalties until 2015 if they demonstrate attainment through modeling. If they fail to meet the standards by 2017, they will be designated nonattainment and must impose controls to reach attainment by 2022. Ozone transitional areas are exempt from certain statutory requirements until 2017. The EPA has proposed to eliminate the provisions of Subpart 2 for ozone nonattainment areas, which include specific requirements such as LAER standards, offset requirements for new sources, RACT for existing sources, and inspection programs for vehicles. These requirements may still apply to areas that fail to meet the 1-hour ozone standard. The EPA has proposed to eliminate specific requirements for ozone nonattainment areas that fail to meet the 1-hour ozone standard. Transitional areas under Clear Skies may be able to roll back statutory requirements if they demonstrate attainment by 2015. This includes the elimination of conformity requirements for federally funded projects in ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas. The proposed Clear Skies legislation aims to reclassify ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" suspending conformity requirements until 2018. Changes to Title I would affect electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program, with a significant shift in emission control variables and allowances not based on attainment status. The emission limitations under Clear Skies are not tied to whether EGUs are in attainment or nonattainment areas, allowing the allowance system to operate regardless of location. This would eliminate states' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas and restrict trading, impacting emissions control and enforcement mechanisms. Clear Skies eliminates state enforcement mechanisms for EGUs, allowing for allowance trading without state restrictions. State standards would not be completely controlling, potentially creating additional allowances for sale to upwind utilities. Clear Skies aims to reduce the need for stronger state and local standards for ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS by establishing a transitional designation for areas. Clear Skies introduces a transitional designation for areas not meeting air quality standards, aiming to bring them into compliance by 2015 without the need for additional controls. It also includes provisions to protect Class I areas and allows states to designate areas for protection that do not meet Clear Skies' requirements. Clear Skies aims to protect areas that do not meet Class I requirements by 2015 without additional controls. The controversy lies in the disparity between new and existing sources under Title I and Title IV of the CAA, which Clear Skies attempts to address by setting up allowance reserves for new sources. However, existing sources receive more generous allocation formulas, and new source allowances are on a first-come, first-serve basis. Table 4 outlines the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies. Existing sources receive more generous allocation formulas compared to new sources, which operate on a first-come, first-serve basis. Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards and residual risk standards do not apply to new or existing Electric Generating Units (EGUs) or other industrial sources opting into the cap-and-trade program. The absence of unit-specific standards under Clear Skies would make it difficult to address mercury \"hot spots.\" States setting more stringent standards would not have complete control, and extra reductions could result in additional allowances for sale. The Administrator retains authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under strict conditions. The Administrator retains authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under strict conditions, including a requirement for a peer-reviewed study of public health concerns on an individual unit basis with notice and opportunity to comment. Any standards cannot be implemented before 2018. Former Administrator Whitman has identified the central issue in Clear Skies' interaction with the Clean Air Act: Are the targets stringent enough to permit the relaxing or removal of some provisions of the Clean Air Act designed to achieve the same thing with respect to electric utilities? Clear Skies will not achieve the 8-hour ozone NAAQS or the fine particulate NAAQS within the current CAA compliance deadlines. EPA's analysis indicates that. Clear Skies, as currently drafted, would remove electric utility control options for states to achieve NAAQS attainment and PSD increments. Mercury controls under Clear Skies are also problematic, with many states issuing fish consumption advisories due to contamination. Mercury contamination has led to fish consumption advisories in 45 states. Clear Skies proposes modest controls on mercury from electric utilities, potentially limiting state options for further reductions. The Administration argues that Clear Skies will achieve reductions sooner and at a lower cost, despite extending compliance deadlines. The Clean Air Act's Clear Skies proposal extends compliance deadlines for states to meet air quality standards. Early reductions in a cap-and-trade program may lead to increased emissions later on. This flexibility can complicate compliance strategies for state and local authorities."
