Airlines need this insurance for loan agreements, lease agreements, and to comply with foreign countries' requirements. After 9/11, the cost of war risk insurance increased, leading the U.S. government to expand the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure coverage for U.S. air carriers. The U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to provide insurance coverage for U.S. air carriers when the commercial market was unable to do so. Private insurers now offer coverage for loss or damage to passengers and aircraft hulls in the event of a terrorist attack, but coverage for third-party damage caused by war or terrorism is limited. Airline insurance is a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines collectively paying around $2.3 billion for basic coverage. The cost of airline insurance is a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines paying approximately $2.3 billion in 2011. This translates to about $60 per flight or $0.80 cents per passenger. Insurance prices vary depending on factors such as location, size, fleet age, safety record, and deductible levels. The private market for aviation risk insurance is deemed adequate, but could be impacted by a major terrorist incident. Commercial insurers provide war risk coverage for most airlines, including U.S. carriers. The aviation insurance market has been soft in recent years, with ample availability and lower prices. However, a series of airliner losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flights 370 and 17, as well as attacks on airports, may lead to a potential 50% increase in insurance premiums. Some insurers are willing to provide war risk coverage to U.S. air carriers. Some aviation insurers predict a significant rise in insurance premiums due to recent aviation losses and attacks on airports. The industry could see premiums increase by as much as 50%, with war risk insurance premiums potentially tripling. However, it is uncertain how the commercial market will react, and there may be a shortage of private coverage, especially impacting U.S. air carriers flying to EU destinations. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers and aircraft operators flying within, into, out of, or over EU territory to have insurance for aviation-specific liabilities, including war- and terrorism-related risks. Non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU must comply with insurance requirements for third-party liability, making war risk insurance mandatory. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates war risk insurance for non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU. Prior to 1951, aviation war risk insurance had 48-hour cancellation clauses, causing concerns for operators during the Korean War airlift. The Secretary of Commerce was given authority to provide war risk insurance under a 1951 law amendment. The Secretary of Commerce was granted authority to provide war risk insurance for U.S.- and foreign-flag aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. Coverage included aircraft, cargo, personal effects, and liabilities. Premium rates were set by the Secretary of Commerce within defined bounds. A revolving fund was established within the Treasury to fund the insurance program. The federally provided war risk insurance for aviation could be underwritten by authorized companies. Disputes over claims could be resolved in federal district court. The program continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and was later delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation in 1966. The hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 in 1968 marked the beginning of international terrorism. In 1968, the hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 in Rome marked the start of international terrorism. The following year, PFLP members hijacked a TWA flight to Damascus, Syria, and attempted to hijack four airliners in 1970, successfully taking three to Dawson's Field in Jordan. The fate of the third aircraft hijacked on September 6, 1970, a Pan Am 747, is relevant in discussing insurance coverage for terrorist acts. The hijackers diverted the plane to Beirut and then Cairo, where an explosive caused its destruction. The aircraft was insured under various policies split between FAA and commercial insurers. The Dawson Field hijackings of September 6, 1970, led to the expansion of federal aviation war risk insurance coverage by the FAA, as commercial insurers had reservations about insuring Boeing 747s. The government set the rate at 20 cents per $100 of insurance, which was less than what the private market would have charged post-hijackings. The government offered new insurance at twice the price of commercial insurance before the hijackings, but less than what the private market would charge post-hijackings. This emergency response was part of the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program due to the Middle East crisis. A 1973 court decision ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed in Cairo was covered under the airline's standard policy, not its war risk policies, defining \"act of war\" as an operation for military advantage. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a decision narrowing the definition of war for insurance claims related to the 9/11 attacks. Insurers offering \"all risk\" policies were found liable for the destroyed aircraft claim. Prior to 9/11, aviation war risk insurance was provided by the government under indemnification agreements with the Department of Defense. In the 1990s, over 99% of war risk insurance issued by FAA for DOD charter flights was without premiums. Premium war risk insurance was only available for specific foreign locations deemed necessary for U.S. foreign policy interests. Last determinations were made during the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. During Operation Desert Storm, air carriers canceled flights to the Middle East due to high war risk insurance rates. Premiums for flights to Israel increased significantly. TWA and Pan Am suspended flights to Israel and other high-risk locations. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue flights from Israel under a government-issued war risk policy. FAA did not insure Tower Air's flights to Tel Aviv after Iraqi missile attacks. After Iraqi Scud missiles were fired into Israel, FAA reportedly would not insure Tower Air's flights from New York to Tel Aviv but did continue to insure outbound passenger flights from Tel Aviv to New York. In response to the 9/11 attacks, commercial insurers cancelled third-party liability war risk coverage for airlines and significantly increased premiums for other war risk insurance. Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-42) amending the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to include acts of terrorism. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) extended the program through December 31, 2003. The Risk Insurance Program was expanded to include acts of terrorism under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296), which has been extended multiple times. The current program authority expires on September 30, 2014. The program also includes coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at limits carried by air carriers. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was expanded under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include coverage for acts of terrorism. The program set comprehensive coverage limits based on existing commercial insurance policies and capped rates at twice the premium paid as of June 19, 2002. Coverage would begin with the first dollar of any covered loss incurred. This expansion was part of the government's response to the 9/11 attacks. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) was created in response to the 9/11 attacks to provide broader reinsurance for terrorism losses in the commercial property/casualty insurance market. It covers terrorism damage for most lines of commercial insurance and may apply to airlines that purchase commercial insurance instead of relying on the FAA's Aviation War Risk Insurance Program. TRIA has been extended multiple times and was set to expire in December 2014. As of January 2014, the FAA's Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provided coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers, with total maximum per occurrence coverage of $68 billion. Premiums paid are collected in the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, which had a balance of $2.2 billion as of July 31, 2014. However, between April and August 2014, 17 U.S. air carriers switched to commercial coverage, leaving the FAA insuring 27 carriers covering approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. The FAA currently insures 27 air carriers, with coverage ranging from $100 million to $3 billion per occurrence. The total maximum exposure of all premium insurance is $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. Premium collections for FY2015 are estimated to be $18 million, assuming Congress extends the program and no carriers cancel their policies. Congress extends the existing program through FY2015, offering coverage that reimburses 100% of losses with no deductibles or coinsurance. Coverage includes hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability, which encompasses various risks beyond war or terrorist attacks. The policy excludes coverage for hostile detonation of weapons, strikes, riots, political or terrorist acts, malicious acts, and government seizures. Payments for ransom or extortion demands are not covered. The policy excludes coverage for government seizures, hijacking, weapon detonation, and FAA regulations on premium charges. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program limits premiums charged on risk assumed by the program to no more than twice the premium paid to the Department of Transportation for third party policy as of June 19, 2002. The program has paid over $10 million for losses related to claims from specific incidents since the 9/11 attacks. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program has paid over $10 million for losses related to claims from three specific incidents. These incidents include an attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in December 2009, the seizure of an unattended SkyWest aircraft by a fugitive in July 2012 resulting in a total loss, and damage to an insured Boeing 767-223 aircraft in April 2014. Total claims paid to date amount to $9.6 million for the SkyWest incident and $256,890 for the Boeing 767-223 aircraft. The Secretary of Transportation proposed a reform to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, seeking permanent authorization with reduced scope. The proposal includes providing war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons and offering full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days in case of private insurance market disruption. The Secretary of Transportation proposed a reform to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, seeking permanent authorization with reduced scope. This includes providing war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons and offering full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days in case of private insurance market disruption. The proposal also aims to continue providing non-premium war risk insurance for carriers operating under Department of Defense contracts in support of national defense. The President's FY2014 budget had previously proposed changes to allow collaboration with commercial insurers to establish a shared-risk model for aviation war risk coverage. This would have gradually shifted 20% of the war risk insurance market annually to commercial insurers, reducing FAA's share to 20% by FY2018. The FY2014 budget proposed gradually shifting 20% of the war risk insurance market annually to commercial insurers, reducing FAA's share to 20% by FY2018. The airline industry has opposed changes to the program, arguing that it would be costly if offered by commercial insurers. Airlines for America President stated that ending the War Risk Insurance program would undermine the economic viability of the U.S. airline industry. A4A opposes proposed changes to the War Risk Insurance program, citing potential high costs, inadequate insurance protection, and service reductions. They recommend maintaining the status quo and extending the program for three years. The Secretary of Transportation's March 2014 proposal to end the program due to budgetary concerns is not supported by A4A. Two approaches to reduce budgetary costs from government insurance programs: increase funds coming in or reduce funds going out. Increasing premiums or seeking higher returns on funds can raise revenue, while reducing assumed risk can lower payouts. Premiums collected by FAA totaled $165 million in FY2013, with potential to increase by raising statutory cap to eliminate implicit subsidies. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, currently over $2 billion, may increase premiums to eliminate implicit subsidies and seek higher returns on funds invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Premiums received by insurers are typically invested until claims are paid, with potential for some airlines to seek insurance in the private market or operate with less coverage. Private insurers invest in a variety of instruments with higher returns than U.S. Treasury securities. In 2013, private property/casualty insurers earned $67.6 billion on $1.48 trillion in investments, significantly more than the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund's $26 million in interest on federal securities. If the Fund had similar returns, it could have earned $91 million. Private insurers' investments are riskier, with policies not covering full losses, unlike Treasury securities. Private insurance policies do not cover the full amount of potential losses, leaving the insured to bear some risk through deductibles, co-insurance, and coverage limits. Government coverage since 2002 offers full coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance, with varying maximum coverage limits for airlines. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program also covers non-traditional risks like vandalism and labor disturbances. Private insurers often share risks among two or more insurers, especially for large risks. Reinsurance is used to spread risk among insurers, and contracts can be tailored for desired risk sharing. Loss sharing can be a percentage of the loss or occur at a certain level of loss. Loss sharing in reinsurance agreements can be tailored to achieve desired risk sharing among companies. It can involve a percentage of the loss or occur at a specific level of loss. Private insurers enter into these arrangements not only for financial risk sharing but also to leverage each other's expertise and capacity in insurance operations. For example, one insurer may excel in risk assessment and underwriting but lack financial capital, while another may have high capital but lack expertise. A well-constructed loss-sharing arrangement benefits both insurers. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act created a loss-sharing program mixing loss sharing based on the level of loss and a percentage of the loss. The government covers 85% of losses once they reach 20% of an insurer's premiums. The program was intended to expire quickly, reducing the government's share of future losses to zero, but has been reauthorized with a more gradual decrease in government coverage. Improved international guidance for informed risk decisions in conflict zones could stabilize private market war risk insurance. After the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17, insurers are reconsidering coverage for flights in high-risk regions like the Middle East and Africa. Insurers are considering withdrawing coverage for flights in certain areas in the Middle East and Africa due to concerns about inconsistent risk assessment by airlines. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has convened a task force to collaborate on assessing conflict zone risks for civilian aircraft more effectively. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is working on a more unified approach to assess conflict zone risks for civilian aircraft. Countries responsible for air traffic services over conflict zones are supposed to identify hazards and establish procedures to avoid risks, but not all countries share information or take necessary precautions. This lack of consistency can lead to insurers considering withdrawing coverage in certain regions. In July 2014, FAA issued restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict with Gaza. This led to foreign airlines suspending service, prompting Israeli authorities to request resumption of flights. The events highlight the challenges of disseminating warnings and restrictions that impact travel, with some governments being cautious in their guidance to airlines. Improved processes for assessing conflict zone hazards to civil aviation, issuing warnings, and restricting flights could address concerns over private market war risk insurance premiums and coverage by potentially reducing uncertainties and ambiguities in assessing risk. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers and aircraft operators to be insured for aviation-specific liability, including acts of war, terrorism, hijacking, sabotage, unlawful seizure of aircraft, and civil commotion. The insurance requirements for aviation include coverage for acts of war, terrorism, hijacking, sabotage, and civil commotion. Minimum insurance coverage per passenger is higher than the Montreal Convention's requirement, with different minimums for commercial and non-commercial operations. Third-party liability insurance is also specified based on the aircraft's maximum take-off mass. The insurance requirements for aviation include coverage for acts of war, terrorism, hijacking, sabotage, and civil commotion. Minimum insurance coverage per accident depends on the aircraft's maximum take-off mass, ranging from 750,000 SDRs to 700 million SDRs. Sanctions for infringement of the regulation are effective, proportional, and dissuasive, including withdrawal of operating license and refusal of landing rights. The federal government provides insurance programs for aviation war risk and terrorism risk. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, created by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, was established in response to the 9/11 attacks. It provided federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when the private sector was unable to offer affordable coverage. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, established in response to the 9/11 attacks, provides federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when the private sector is unable to offer affordable coverage. The program has been reauthorized multiple times due to the insurance industry's unwillingness to cover terrorism risk. The current version of the program does not directly provide coverage to businesses at risk of terrorism losses but offers government reinsurance for private insurers. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering specific commercial property/casualty coverage for terrorism losses. Private insurers are required to offer terrorism coverage and would cover any losses, with TRIA reimbursing them for some of their losses. There are no upfront premiums for government coverage, and any losses covered under TRIA would be paid from the government's general fund. Post-event recoupment fees on commercial insurance policies may be applied to recover the government's costs. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering commercial insurance coverage for terrorism losses. TRIA coverage is limited and operates through private insurers, with limits and deductibles from private insurance policies also applying. A minimum of $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act is required for federal funds to flow under TRIA. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) does not have federal limits on the cost of terrorism coverage. Private insurers must offer coverage under the same terms as insurance against other causes, but can charge a separate premium for terrorism coverage. State laws may limit terrorism premiums."
