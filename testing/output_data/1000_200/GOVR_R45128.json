    "content": "Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018 (H.R. 1625), which included the Agriculture appropriations bill. The total enacted Agriculture appropriation is $23.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than the previous budget. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act included amendments to the House-reported version, with a discretionary total of $23.3 billion for Agriculture, $2.1 billion more than FY2017. The Trump Administration proposed a $15.8 billion discretionary total, while the House and Senate bills proposed $20 billion and $20.53 billion respectively. The overall total of the enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation is $146 billion, including mandatory spending. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds USDA and FDA, with discretionary spending as the primary focus. It includes CFTC funding in even-numbered fiscal years and is under the jurisdiction of House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The bill's scope is detailed in Figure 2. The Agriculture appropriations bill primarily focuses on discretionary spending, which is controlled by annual appropriations acts. Mandatory spending, on the other hand, is controlled by budget rules during the authorization process. In FY2018, discretionary appropriations were 16% of the total, while mandatory spending comprised a larger portion at $123 billion. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% ($23.3 billion) of the total, while mandatory spending comprised $123 billion, about 84% of the total. The main discretionary spending items include programs like WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, and farm assistance. Mandatory spending items include SNAP and child nutrition programs. The main mandatory spending items in Agriculture appropriations include SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs. SNAP is an \"appropriated entitlement\" requiring annual funding, while CCC operates on a line of credit. Agriculture appropriations have fluctuated over time, peaking in FY2010, declining through FY2013, and increasing since then. Agriculture appropriations have fluctuated over time, peaking in FY2010, declining through FY2013, and increasing since then. The discretionary spending authorized for each appropriations title since FY2008 is shown in Figure 3, with adjustments for inflation and other factors in Figure 4. The Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget request later than expected. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request for USDA proposed a 21% reduction and elimination of funding for some programs. Congress reminded the Administration of its authority to determine final funding levels for FY2018. The Trump Administration proposed a 21% reduction and elimination of funding for some USDA programs in its FY2018 budget request. The Administration's request was not consistent with some agency proposals, leading to congressional appropriations committees evaluating the request and considering their own bills in the summer of 2017. The Trump Administration requested $15.82 billion of discretionary spending for Agriculture appropriations, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. The House Appropriations Committee incrementally made \"302(b)\" allocations to its subcommittees to facilitate markups beginning in June 2017. The Agriculture Subcommittee was allowed nearly $20 billion of discretionary budget authority for FY2018. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on June 28, 2017, by voice vote. On July 12, 2017, the full Appropriations Committee passed and reported an amended bill (H.R. 3268, H.Rept. 115-232) by voice vote. The House passed an eight-bill consolidated appropriation (H.R. 3354) with Agriculture on September 14, 2017. The House passed an eight-bill consolidated appropriation (H.R. 3354) on September 14, 2017, which included Agriculture as Division B. The bill aimed to reduce funding for rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research compared to FY2017. The total discretionary budget for Agriculture in FY2018 was $1.13 billion less than FY2017. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $20.53 billion for the Agriculture Subcommittee in FY2018. The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its bill on July 18, 2017, and the full Appropriations Committee passed the amended bill on July 20, 2017. The Senate-reported bill had a discretionary total of $20.53 billion, $352 million less than FY2017. The Senate-reported bill for FY2018 allocated $776 million more than the House-passed bill without the CFTC. It made fewer reductions compared to FY2017, reducing rural development by $119 million and agricultural research by $57 million while increasing foreign food aid by $140 million. Additionally, it made $220 million more in reductions through rescissions and changing mandatory programs than the House-passed bill. FY2018 began without an enacted appropriation, leading Congress to pass CRs to fund the government. The first Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY2018 continued FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies, including a 0.6791% reduction and increased funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. The first Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY2018 maintained FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies, including increased funding of about $238 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. Two additional CRs extended provisions and anomalies to December 22, 2017, and January 19, 2018, respectively, with a waiver of PAYGO rules for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to prevent sequestration of mandatory spending. The government experienced multiple shutdowns due to the lack of further CR or appropriations, leading to the passing of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which raised budget caps, provided disaster assistance for agriculture, and extended sequestration effects. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 authorized supplemental appropriations for crop and livestock losses from 2017 disasters, revised agriculture programs, and raised discretionary spending caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provided $3.6 billion in disaster assistance in FY2018, including block grants for hurricane and wildfire losses, funding for conservation and watershed recovery, rural water and wastewater recovery, and dairy programs. It also added $1.4 billion in mandatory funding for the successor to the current farm bill, with provisions for permanent disaster assistance programs and cotton programs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included provisions for disaster assistance, farm commodity programs, base acre reallocation, crop insurance, and budget cap increases for discretionary spending in FY2018 and FY2019. It also extended sequestration on mandatory accounts under the BCA for FY2026 and FY2027. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act increased nondefense discretionary spending by $68 billion and defense spending by $85 billion. The Agriculture portion received a total of $23.3 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of $2.1 billion from FY2017. The overall enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation totaled about $146 billion. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation totals about $146 billion, with an increase in spending primarily through additional funding in General Provisions for various programs. This includes extra funding for rural water programs, expanding rural broadband, Food for Peace foreign food aid, and opioid enforcement and surveillance at FDA. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriation includes $94 million for opioid enforcement and surveillance at FDA, $138 million increase in agricultural research spending, $134 million increase for Food for Peace, and no CHIMPS imposed, costing about $740 million. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriation costs about $740 million due to the absence of usual CHIMPS. Sequestration is a process of automatic budget reductions triggered when federal spending exceeds statutory goals. Sequestration is authorized in the BCA for discretionary spending through FY2021 and for mandatory spending through FY2027. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration on discretionary spending, but it still applies to certain accounts of mandatory spending. The original FY2021 sunset on sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended four times. The original FY2021 sunset on sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended four times by Congress through various Bipartisan Budget Acts to avoid sequestration of discretionary spending or as a budgetary offset for other bills. Mandatory sequestration has been extended until FY2027, with exemptions for some farm bill mandatory programs. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, such as nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. Crop insurance is mostly exempt, while farm commodity programs, disaster assistance, and conservation programs have been subject to sequestration. Nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture accounts are reduced by a 6.6% sequestration rate in FY2018. In FY2018, nonexempt mandatory spending in agriculture accounts is reduced by a 6.6% sequestration rate, resulting in a $1.3 billion reduction from authorized funds. Sequestration rates and canceled budget authority are detailed in tables within the Agriculture appropriations bill."
