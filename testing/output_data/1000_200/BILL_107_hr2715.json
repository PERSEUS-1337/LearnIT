The Congress finds that the greater Southern California metropolitan region, the second largest urban concentration in the US, lacks sufficient park and recreation lands per population. This deficiency deprives residents of health benefits and increases the risk of crime. The Rim of the Valley Corridor surrounding the San Fernando and La Crescenta valleys offers various benefits such as health, spiritual welfare, reduced crime, lower social tension, and increased educational opportunities for urban populations. These assets deserve increased protection to continue providing public benefit in the future. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, including parts of various mountain ranges, contains endangered habitats and unique ecotones. A key feature is the escarpment of the San Gabriel Mountains within the Angeles National Forest, managed for watershed and recreational purposes. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, including parts of various mountain ranges, contains endangered habitats and unique ecotones. The Angeles National Forest is primarily managed for watershed, recreational, and habitat values, not for commercial exploitation. Privately owned lands within the corridor are critical for additional scenic, environmental, recreational, and open space values and should be brought under public protection through voluntary incentives. The State of California has adopted the Rim of the Valley Master Plan to protect the area's natural and recreational resources, but efforts have been hindered by a lack of support. Efforts to protect the natural and recreational resources of the Rim of the Valley Corridor have been hindered by a lack of financial resources, technical assistance, and expertise that the Federal Government could provide. The study of Rim of the Valley Corridor for establishment as a unit of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is proposed. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a special resource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California to evaluate its national significance and feasibility of becoming part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The study will follow criteria for potential inclusion in the National Park System. The Secretary will consult with the Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee during the study for potential inclusion in the National Park System. Establishment of Advisory Committee. The Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee is established to advise the Secretary of the Interior on a study and recommend boundaries for a new recreation area that reflects the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee will recommend boundaries for a new recreation area that reflects the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, including lands, waters, and interests as depicted on maps. The Committee must submit a recommendation to the Secretary of the Interior within 365 days after its first meeting, including proposed boundaries maps. The Committee, consisting of 24 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, will recommend boundaries for a Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area. Public participation in the recommendation process is required. The Committee consists of members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior to recommend boundaries for a Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area. Public participation is required. The entities involved in the recommendation process include the board of supervisors of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, as well as various city councils such as Thousand Oaks, Agoura Hills, Westlake Village, Malibu, Calabasas, Burbank, Glendale, La Canada-Flintridge, Pasadena, Sierra Madre, and South Pasadena. The city councils of Sierra Madre, South Pasadena, Santa Clarita, Moorpark, and the board of supervisors of Los Angeles county, along with other entities, are appointed to represent the unincorporated communities within the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor. This includes officials from the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and the Angeles National Forest. The Committee overseeing the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor includes representatives from various districts and agencies such as the Angeles National Forest, California Department of Parks and Recreation, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, Conejo Recreation and Park District, and Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District. The Committee selects a chairperson and vice chairperson from its members. The Committee overseeing the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor selects a chairperson and vice chairperson from its members.
