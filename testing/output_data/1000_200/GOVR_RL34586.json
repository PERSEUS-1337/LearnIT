    "content": "This report focuses on child survival and maternal health programs conducted by USAID from FY2001 to FY2008. It discusses how advancements in addressing malaria can improve maternal and child survival. UNICEF reported a 60% drop in under-five mortality since 1960, but still, 26,000 children under five die each day. Despite a 60% drop in under-five mortality since 1960, 26,000 children still die each day. Most child deaths occur in developing countries, with nearly 90% caused by neonatal infections and five infectious diseases. Undernutrition is a significant underlying cause of these deaths, highlighting the importance of monitoring maternal and child health as a barometer for overall health conditions. Some health experts emphasize monitoring maternal and child health as a key indicator of overall health conditions. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) aim for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality. Progress in achieving these goals is influenced by factors like undernourishment, lack of clean water access, poverty, and susceptibility to infectious diseases. UNICEF identified 62 countries not making progress in this area. Children in developing countries are more likely to be impoverished and susceptible to infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. UNICEF reported that 62 countries were not progressing towards the Millennium Development Goal on child survival, with the majority in Africa. Maternal health is closely linked to child survival, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. Access to adequate diets, safe water, and sanitation facilities could prevent most of these deaths. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) states that many maternal deaths in developing countries could be prevented with access to proper nutrition, water, sanitation, literacy, and healthcare during pregnancy. UNICEF estimates that 20% of maternal deaths are due to undernutrition and 75% are caused by obstetric complications. Young mothers under 20 are at higher risk for complications like toxemia, anemia, and premature delivery, leading to higher maternal mortality rates and increased risk of delivering low birth weight babies. Pregnancy-related complications are the leading cause of death among 15- to-19-year-olds globally. The United Nations estimates that adolescents give birth to 15 million infants each year. Girls aged between 15 and 19 years are at higher risk of maternal mortality compared to women in their twenties. Maternal death rates vary by region, with hemorrhage being a significant cause in Africa and Asia. In industrialized nations and Latin America, hemorrhage accounts for a smaller percentage of maternal deaths. In Africa and Asia, hemorrhage causes a significant percentage of maternal deaths, while in industrialized nations and Latin America, it accounts for a smaller proportion. Regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest percentage of skilled birth attendants, leading to higher maternal mortality rates. UNICEF reports that many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality nationwide, with 80% of priority countries facing this challenge. Many countries lack the capacity to reduce mortality nationwide, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. Health workforce shortages are a significant issue, with only South Africa and Swaziland meeting the minimum standard. Access to health workers, clean water, and nutritious food is crucial for improving child and maternal survival rates. Sub-Saharan Africa faces the greatest proportional shortage of health care workers globally. The World Health Organization estimates that sub-Saharan Africa suffers from the greatest proportional shortage of health care workers globally, with 36 out of 57 countries facing critical shortages. To meet the minimum threshold of 2.5 health care professionals per 1,000 people, countries in Africa would need to increase their number of health workers by about 140%. The U.S. Agency for International Development has committed over $6 billion in funding to improve child survival worldwide, supporting research that has led to life-saving interventions and technologies. Over the past 20 years, USAID has committed more than $6 billion to global child survival efforts, with a significant portion allocated to addressing key health issues like acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, HIV/AIDS, measles, neonatal complications, and undernutrition. This funding was provided from FY2001-FY2008, with Congress appropriating $3.4 billion for child survival and maternal health efforts. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that nearly 10 million children die each year, with the majority of these deaths preventable through interventions and technologies developed with USAID support. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) emphasizes the impact of hunger and malnutrition on child mortality. WHO-supported studies show that undernourished children are at a higher risk of death from infectious diseases. Good nutrition improves child survival, health, and cognitive development, while undernutrition weakens the immune system. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation and fortification, improving child health and cognitive development. Micronutrient programs add vital immune-building micronutrients to processed foods, while research on biofortified crops aims to enhance the nutrient content of basic foods. Biofortified crops, such as maize, beans, and sweet potatoes, are being developed to enhance their vitamin and mineral content. USAID's nutrition programs, including micronutrient supplementation, aim to address malnutrition-related infant and child deaths. The organization emphasizes the importance of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life to prevent disease and ensure adequate nutrition. USAID supports nutrition programs with a focus on exclusive breastfeeding for infants to prevent diseases and ensure adequate nutrition. They spend about $30 million annually on programs including Vitamin A, iodine, food fortification, anemia packages, and zinc. In communities affected by HIV/AIDS, USAID integrates safe infant feeding practices with programs to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of adequate nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin intake to prevent pneumonia. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of preventing pneumonia through adequate nutrition, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements. International health organizations advocate for immunizations against infections like Hib and pertussis, as well as expanding access to vaccines for Streptococcus pneumoniae. USAID has supported immunizations for millions of children and the treatment of child pneumonia cases since 2002. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy was developed in the mid-1990s by UNICEF, WHO, and USAID to address childhood illnesses. USAID has expanded the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy, which integrates interventions for various childhood illnesses. Malaria affects approximately 40% of the world's population, with over 500 million people becoming severely ill each year. USAID has been involved in malaria eradication efforts since the 1950s, and in 2005, the President proposed the President's Malaria Initiative. USAID has been engaged in malaria eradication efforts since the 1950s. In 2005, the President proposed the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), aiming to increase support for U.S. international malaria programs by over $1.2 billion from FY2006 through FY2010 in 15 targeted countries. USAID coordinates all PMI activities in partnership with the CDC. PMI reached over 6 million people in its first year and over 25 million within two years. In its first year, PMI reached over 6 million people and within two years, over 25 million. Activities included indoor residual spraying, distributing insecticide-treated nets, training health workers, and purchasing anti-malarial tablets. HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable, but not curable. Most children acquire HIV from their infected mothers during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Successful interventions can reduce mother-to-child transmission risk to 2%. The risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission can be reduced to 2% with successful interventions. Nevirapine is a widely used drug to prevent transmission, costing between $0.29 and $0.40 per dose. Early diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy are crucial for children as HIV progresses faster in them. The cost of ART for children is significantly higher than for adults, with an estimated annual supply of generic ARTs costing about $260 per child. The cost of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children is significantly higher than for adults, with a one-year supply of a standard three-drug regimen costing $2,000 per child. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs, charging about $0.16 per day or $60 per year. ART is not the only treatment to reduce child mortality among HIV-positive children, as treatment of opportunistic infections like pneumonia is also important. Health experts emphasize that ART is not the sole treatment for reducing child mortality in HIV-positive children. Treating opportunistic infections like pneumonia can also improve survival rates. Cotrimoxazole, a pneumonia drug, has been shown to decrease mortality by 30% in HIV/AIDS children, costing $0.03 per day or $10 per year. Only 10% of the 4 million children in need of the drug are currently receiving it. USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions since 1986, with PEPFAR implementing agencies providing over $289.2 million in care and support initiatives by September 2007. PEPFAR advancements have provided over $289.2 million to support 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children. Food and nutrition programs have reached 332,000 OVC, 50,000 pregnant or lactating women, and 20,000 severely malnourished individuals on ART. Child-focus programs offer training, promote technology use, support income-generating activities, and connect families to essential health care. Support for HIV-infected adults receiving treatment also benefits children by providing a nurturing environment. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for HIV/AIDS care and support programs. Pediatric treatment received $191.5 million in funding, benefiting 85,900 children. PMTCT services supported over 10 million pregnancies, preventing 157,000 infant HIV infections. Research by UNICEF, WHO, and USAID found ORS, fluids, breastfeeding, and antibiotics could prevent and treat diarrhea. Since 2002, USAID has provided over $1.5 billion for the treatment of child diarrhea with ORS, training health workers, promoting breastfeeding, and emphasizing hygiene practices like handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea prevalence among children. USAID supports handwashing with soap in poorer communities, where it is not common. In Burkina Faso, only 1% of mothers use soap after using the toilet. In Lucknow, India, 13% of mothers use soap after cleaning a child. Public-private partnerships promote handwashing with soap to reduce diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. WHO states that measles immunization is a cost-effective intervention for preventing childhood deaths. Measles immunization is a cost-effective intervention for preventing childhood deaths, with the vaccine costing less than $1 per dose. The vaccine can be combined with rubella and/or mumps vaccines for added protection, with bundled doses costing around $0.33 to $1.50 if bought through UNICEF. Immunization coverage rates for measles vaccination vary by region, with about 80% of children vaccinated in 2006 according to WHO and UNICEF estimates. In 2006, about 80% of children were vaccinated for measles, up from 72% in 2000. From 2000 to 2006, 478 million children received measles vaccinations in priority countries, resulting in a 68% decrease in global measles mortality. USAID supports immunization programs but does not specify its approach. USAID-supported immunization programs in over 100 countries train health workers, improve service delivery, and partner with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Maternal health programs focus on healthy pregnancy outcomes through various interventions like nutritional supplementation, immunizations, and HIV prevention. USAID advocates for skilled birth attendants and community planning for all births. USAID supports maternal health programs that advocate for skilled birth attendants and community planning for all births. This includes training birth attendants to prevent infant deaths and educating families on recognizing birth complications and accessing emergency care. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality, with 32% of deaths attributed to postpartum hemorrhage. Low-cost interventions, such as training birth attendants and using drugs like oxytocin, can prevent and treat this condition. USAID reports that these interventions can prevent 60% of hemorrhages. Sepsis and infections contribute to nearly 10% of maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Unhygienic delivery practices, such as using unclean hands or instruments, can lead to sepsis. USAID supports distributing delivery kits and training birth attendants to prevent infections during childbirth. USAID trains birth attendants to prevent sepsis during childbirth by identifying signs of infection and using antibiotics. They also train healthcare providers to recognize and treat hypertensive disorders, including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Delivery complications, such as prolonged or obstructed labor, can lead to maternal and infant mortality or long-term disabilities. Obstetric fistula is a common issue as well. Obstetric fistula is a common consequence of prolonged or obstructed labor in low-resource settings, especially among young girls and women who were stunted due to undernourishment. Delaying pregnancy until the girl's pelvic region is fully developed, ensuring access to emergency obstetric care, and performing caesarean surgery when needed can prevent obstetric fistula. USAID has supported fistula prevention and repair programs since 1989 and 2005, respectively. USAID has been supporting fistula prevention programs since 1989 and repair programs since 2005. These programs aim to increase access to emergency obstetrical care, delay child marriage, train communities to identify labor complications, and reduce stigma around obstetric fistula. Complications from unsafe abortions contribute to 13% of maternal deaths globally, with regional variations such as 12% in Latin America and the Caribbean and 4% in Africa. USAID's international family planning programs have helped avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the last 20 years. Appropriations to USAID's global health programs, including HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, grew significantly from FY2001 to FY2003. Higher funding for HIV/AIDS programs during this time period was in support of the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. During this time period, USAID's programs focused on supporting the President's International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, with a majority of funds directed towards tuberculosis and malaria programs. Congress also showed strong support for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, increasing appropriations for U.S. contributions. Discussions about USAID's health programs centered on global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, with some Members questioning the Administration's focus on HIV/AIDS over other global health interventions like child survival and maternal health. Congress provided significant funding for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2004 through FY2008, totaling $19.7 billion. In comparison, USAID's child survival, maternal health, family planning, and reproductive health initiatives received $4.6 billion during the same period. Appropriations for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria far exceeded support for other health programs, leading to calls for better integration of health programs. Congress consistently increased funding for USAID's global health programs under President George W. Bush, focusing mainly on specific diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. However, funding for other health issues such as child survival and maternal health remained relatively unchanged. Despite the positive response to increased funding for disease-specific programs, concerns were raised about the lack of support for other health initiatives. Many health experts are concerned that while there is an increase in U.S. commitment to combat diseases like HIV/AIDS, other life-saving interventions for women and children in sub-Saharan Africa are being overlooked and underfunded. They argue that funding should also be increased for programs addressing child survival, maternal health, and voluntary family planning to improve overall health outcomes. Family planning activities protect women's health by reducing high-risk pregnancies and children's health by spacing pregnancies. They also prevent HIV/AIDS, reduce abortions, and stabilize population growth. Some oppose funding family planning due to concerns about abortions and coercive practices. Research shows that family planning can improve the health outcomes of adolescent girls in developing countries where early pregnancies are common. Research indicates that teenage mothers face higher risks during pregnancy and delivery, including low birthweight babies, toxemia, anemia, premature delivery, and obstetric fistula. Girls aged 15-19 are twice as likely to die from childbirth compared to women in their twenties, with those under 15 being five times more likely to die. Delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete and timely caesarean surgery can prevent obstetric fistula. Repairing the condition costs around $300, which is unaffordable for many affected young girls and women in certain countries. Advocates suggest increasing health system funding to reduce maternal mortality. Advocates recommend increasing health system funding to reduce maternal and child mortality in affected countries. Strengthening health systems is crucial for providing essential interventions like vaccinations and prenatal care. UNICEF highlights the need for donor support to improve health systems and reduce mortality nationwide. Supporters urge Congress to coordinate USAID's health assistance with other donors for better outcomes. Advocates recommend increasing health system funding to reduce mortality in affected countries. Supporters urge Congress to direct USAID to better coordinate health assistance with other donors and health ministries to improve efficiency and outcomes. WHO's International Health Partnership promotes creating compacts with countries for long-term financing and development support. Country compacts are contracts between the international community and recipient countries for health financing. They involve mutual accountability, one country health plan, monitoring and evaluation, budget harmonization, and benchmarks for government performance. Critics highlight the importance of recipient governments in improving health systems, citing political will as a key factor in low health spending in developing countries. IMF reports that lack of political will is a major reason for unspent health funds. According to WHO, countries with severe health worker shortages spend about $33 per person on health annually, while the U.S. spends $2,548 per capita. Africa spends less than 1% of the world's health expenditure. African leaders pledged to increase health spending, with the Abuja Declaration calling for at least 15% of national budgets to be allocated to healthcare. According to the Progress Report on the Implementation of the Abuja Declarations, 33% of AU States allocated 10% or more of their budgets to health by 2004. Only Botswana spent at least 15% on health. Some argue that structural adjustment programs limit African governments' ability to increase health investments. Lending practices have limited African governments' abilities to invest in public health and health worker education, leading to shrunken health budgets and a decline in education quality for medical students. This has resulted in a shortage of health supplies, insufficient medicine stocks, and a brain drain of African health workers. Discussions on the impact of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform on public health infrastructures are often biased, with mixed results reported by the International Development Research Center. The International Development Research Center reported mixed results on the impact of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform on public health infrastructures. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health, including increased support for maternal and child health and authorization of funds for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions. In 2008, bills authorized $50 billion and $48 billion for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions. The House version passed with provisions for linkages to NGOs for access to HIV/AIDS education and testing in family planning and maternal health programs. The Senate version of the bill did not include language on family planning. The Global Poverty Act of 2007 aims to reduce global poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goal of reducing extreme poverty. The U.S. Commitment to Global Child Survival Act of 2007 provides assistance for improving maternal and child health in developing countries. The House and Senate versions of bills aim to improve family health worldwide by amending the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. H.R. 1225 focuses on voluntary family planning programs, H.R. 2114 provides a contribution to the United Nations Population Fund for obstetric fistula, and H.R. 2604 supports the United Nations Population Fund for women's health and dignity activities. H.R. 2604, United Nations Population Fund Women's Health and Dignity Act, provides support for activities to save women's lives, limit abortion, and promote family planning in developing countries. S. 1998 focuses on reducing child marriage, while S. 2682 directs funding to maternal and child health through the United Nations Population Fund. The United Nations Population Fund is supported for maternal and child health purposes. H.Res. 1045 calls for reducing nuclear weapons and preventing their proliferation, with savings directed towards child survival, hunger, and education. H.Res. 1022 affirms commitment to promoting maternal health and child survival. H.Res. 1022 affirms the House's commitment to promoting maternal health and child survival through international investment and participation, recognizing their importance to families, societies, and global development. The House agreed to the resolution, as amended, without objection."
