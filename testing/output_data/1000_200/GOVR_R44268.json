    "content": "Operation Ranch Hand was a U.S. military program during the Vietnam War that sprayed millions of gallons of herbicides, including Agent Orange, over southern Vietnam. The herbicides contained TCDD, a toxic and carcinogenic compound. Dioxin \"hot spots\" have been identified in Vietnam, with high contamination levels at airbases like Bien Hoa and Danang. The A Luoi Valley was a crucial part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail used by North Vietnamese forces. The A Luoi Valley, south of Quang Tri and west of Danang, was a key segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, heavily sprayed during the Vietnam War. The former U.S. military base in the valley is a recognized \"hot spot\" for Agent Orange contamination. Recent U.S. efforts to address environmental damage and health issues in Vietnam have helped improve bilateral relations. President Obama pledged continued support for cleanup efforts, including removing unexploded landmines and bombs, and assisting with dioxin cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base. The United States will assist in the cleanup of dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa Air Base in Vietnam, following successful efforts at Danang Airport. The Trump Administration continues to provide assistance for addressing the Agent Orange/dioxin issue, as pledged by President Obama. President Trump and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc have committed to working together on war legacy issues. The joint statement between Trump and Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc committed to addressing war legacy issues, including dioxin remediation at Da Nang and Bien Hoa Airports, and the removal of unexploded ordnances. The environmental remediation of Danang Airport was celebrated on November 10, 2017, and a Memorandum of Intent was signed for dioxin decontamination at Bien Hoa. Congress has allocated $254.8 million for Agent Orange/dioxin cleanup and health programs in Vietnam. The legislation has appropriated separate amounts for environmental remediation of Agent Orange/dioxin and health and disability programs in Vietnam. Congress allocated $254.8 million for cleanup and programs in Vietnam, subject to provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act. The 115th Congress authorized the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds for these purposes. Section 1052 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 authorized the transfer of funds for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup in Vietnam from the Department of Defense to USAID. The State Department has delegated responsibility for the funds to USAID, with allocations made under the Economic Support Fund and Development Assistance accounts. The Department has delegated responsibility for administering appropriated funds to USAID. Most of the environmental remediation efforts have focused on Danang airport cleanup, with funds also used for disability support programs in Vietnam. Danang airport cleanup is completed, and joint dioxin removal operations are planned at Bien Hoa airbase. Discussions are ongoing on addressing health and disability issues related to dioxin exposure among Vietnamese nationals. State Department and USAID, along with Vietnamese ministries, administer programs funded by the appropriated funds. In 1999, Vietnam's central government created Office 33 to oversee its policy on Agent Orange and dioxin, with representatives from various ministries. Congressional interest has focused on two main issues. The U.S. Congress has shown interest in allocating funds for environmental remediation of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam and health programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. They are also overseeing the State Department and USAID's use of funds for these activities, particularly focusing on the rate of fund obligation. Funding specifically for the Agent Orange/dioxin issue in Vietnam began in May 2007 with the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. The U.S. Congress allocated funds for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam and health services near contaminated sites. The State Department designated USAID to handle the $3 million appropriation, setting a precedent for future assistance. The 111th Congress later appropriated a total of $18 million for dioxin cleanup and health services in Vietnam. In March 2009, the 111th Congress allocated $3 million for Agent Orange/dioxin cleanup and health care in Danang. Congress later passed additional funding in 2010 and 2010 for remediation at Danang Airport. State Department and USAID also provided funds for environmental cleanup at the airport. The 113th Congress continued to appropriate funds for Agent Orange/dioxin environmental remediation in Vietnam and related health services, renewing appropriations in FY2013 through various Acts. The 113th Congress renewed appropriations for environmental remediation and health programs in areas affected by Agent Orange/dioxin contamination until being superseded by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. Funds were allocated for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and assistance for the Government of Vietnam, including the military, for such purposes. Funds appropriated under \"Development Assistance\" for health/disability activities in areas contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin in Vietnam. $7.5 million for health/disability programs and $15.0 million for environmental remediation of dioxin. Funds allocated for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites and assistance for the Government of Vietnam. The S.Rept. 114-79, accompanying P.L. 114-113, allocated funds for environmental remediation and health/disability programs in areas contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin in Vietnam. The Committee intended for health/disability funds to be implemented by Vietnamese organizations to address the needs of individuals with severe mobility or cognitive disabilities. Funding for FY2017 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). Funding for FY2017 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) allocates funds for dioxin remediation and health/disability programs in Vietnam. $20,000,000 is designated for dioxin remediation activities, while $10,000,000 is allocated for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The funds are to be implemented by Vietnamese organizations and entities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated funds for dioxin remediation and health/disability programs in Vietnam, including assistance to the Government of Vietnam. $20 million was designated for remediation activities, and $10 million for programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated funds for dioxin remediation and health/disability programs in Vietnam, including assistance to the Government of Vietnam. $20 million was designated for remediation activities, and $12.5 million for programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The State Department has designated USAID as the responsible agency for the obligation of funds appropriated for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam. USAID has obligated significant amounts of funds for environmental remediation projects and health- and disability-related services from FY2007 to FY2017. Since FY2007, USAID has obligated $20.3 million for health and disability services, drawing congressional attention for slower utilization compared to environmental remediation funds. Congress has designated health services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas. The health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas have received funding from Congress since FY2007. Approximately $20.3 million has been obligated by USAID for these services, with specific allocations outlined in various legislative reports. It is uncertain if all funds have been utilized according to the designated locations. Funds for health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas have been allocated by Congress since FY2007. USAID has obligated approximately $20.3 million for these services, with specific allocations detailed in legislative reports. However, there are concerns about whether the funds have been consistently obligated according to the designated locations. In FY2010 to FY2013, funds were largely obligated to Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) for a disability support program, with a shift back to direct obligations by USAID in FY2014 following consultations with relevant parties. USAID has returned to directly obligating funds for health- and disability-related services in smaller amounts as of FY2014. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, funded by congressional appropriations, has faced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, funded by congressional appropriations, faced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. The estimated completion date was extended to March 31, 2017, with decontamination completed in August 2017. Soil samples showed high levels of TCDD toxic equivalents, exceeding international standards. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, funded by congressional appropriations, faced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. Soil samples at Danang airbase exceeded the international maximum standard of 1.0 ppb. The project began in December 2009 with a memorandum of understanding between the State Department and Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. USAID and Office 33 were designated as implementing agencies, with $6.0 million in funds appropriated for the project. An Environmental Assessment recommended the use of thermal treatment for dioxin containment at Danang airport. In June 2010, USAID completed an Environmental Assessment of Danang airport recommending thermal desorption for decontamination. The estimated cost was $33.7 million with potential challenges increasing costs by 50%. A Memorandum of Intent was signed with Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence in December 2010 to start the project in 2011 and complete it by October 2013. The Prime Minister approved the project in February 2011, and USAID posted a Request for Proposals in May 2011. In February 2011, MND approved the environmental remediation project at Danang airport. USAID awarded contracts to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. in July 2012. The project was launched in August 2012, with onsite work starting on August 20, 2012. An internal USAID audit in November 2014 revealed six contracts awarded for the project. Six contracts awarded for environmental assessment and remediation project at Danang airport, including assessment of Bien Hoa airbase. Thermal desorption of contaminated soil done in two phases, with Phase 1 starting in April 2014 and Phase 2 excavation beginning in January 2015. The excavation for Phase 2 at Danang airport began in January 2015, involving draining three small lakes and removing exposed lake beds. The treatment of 45,000 m3 of Phase 2 soil started in November 2016 and was completed in August 2017. Progress was delayed due to weather conditions during Vietnam's rainy season and the need for more soil decontamination than initially estimated. Additionally, the secondary treatment facility was shut down in July 2014 for system changes, and raising the ambient temperature of Phase 1 soil took longer than expected. USAID's Office of Inspector General conducted an internal audit in November 2014, identifying potential risks. The USAID's Office of Inspector General conducted an internal audit in November 2014, highlighting risks in the environmental remediation project at Danang Airport. The audit identified issues with inclement weather, cooling treated soil, lack of a formal risk management plan, inaccurate performance data from CDM, and inadequate training for Vietnamese officials. Recommendations were made for better risk management, training, and data documentation. The completion of the project was marked with a ceremony on November 7, 2018. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project took longer and cost more than initially projected by USAID due to underestimating contamination. 162,500 cubic meters of soil were contaminated, not 72,900 as expected. Dioxin had percolated three meters deeper than anticipated. USAID utilized funds for health/disability activities in areas contaminated with dioxin as part of its support program. The U.S. government has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, regardless of the cause of the disability, including funds specifically appropriated for health services in areas near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites. State Department and USAID utilized funds for health services to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang between FY2007 and FY2010. In 2012, USAID approved a three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang and other areas. The program aimed to build on previous accomplishments and include relevant public health activities. The PDSP program, with a focus on Danang and other high-need areas, aimed to provide assistance to persons with disabilities through grants for health services, therapy, training, and awareness. USAID funded the program with $9 million, and VNAH worked on disability policy for the Government of Vietnam. The PDSP program, headquartered in Danang, extended to provinces heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. USAID awarded nearly US$900,000 in grants to local partners and organizations. In June 2014, USAID adopted a new approach to assist persons with disabilities in Vietnam, aiming to provide expanded opportunities for vulnerable populations. USAID aims to provide direct assistance to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life for persons with disabilities in Vietnam. They will offer physical, occupational, and speech therapies, as well as training to practitioners in high-poverty provinces like Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue. The provinces of Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue have been identified as heavily sprayed areas by the Aspen Institute. USAID will directly administer a new approach in these locations, with a focus on environmental cleanup. The Bien Hoa airbase, a dioxin \"hot spot\" where Agent Orange spraying missions occurred during the war, is being considered for a cleanup similar to Danang airport. Soil samples from Bien Hoa showed high levels of dioxin contamination, prompting mitigation measures by the Vietnamese government. The Vietnamese government has conducted mitigation measures to contain dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase, with a passive landfill completed in 2009. A study by Hatfield Consultants found other dioxin \"hot spots\" at the airbase, leading to contaminated soil spreading into nearby water bodies. The UNDP has been working with Office 33 and MONRE to map out the dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase. The UNDP has been working with Office 33 and MONRE for five years to map out dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase. An estimated 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments are located on or nearby the airbase, with treatment costs estimated at $250 million. USAID contracted CDM International Inc. to conduct an environmental assessment, which determined five different treatment methods for remediation. The estimated costs for treating contaminated soils at Bien Hoa Airbase range from $137 million to $794 million, with potential variations of 40% less to 75% more. Over $3.7 million has been spent on assessing environmental remediation. Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence has allocated $11.8 million for infrastructure construction for dioxin decontamination at the airbase. The Ministry of National Defence allocated $11.8 million for infrastructure construction at Bien Hoa airport for dioxin decontamination. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent to work together on the decontamination project, with a $183 million aid agreement signed later for the same purpose. The Ministry of National Defence and USAID signed a $183 million aid agreement for decontamination of Bien Hoa airport. The project is expected to take 10 years and cost $390 million, with 500,000 cubic meters of soil to be decontaminated. A memorandum of understanding was signed with Shimizu Corporation for a decontamination factory using a filtered sponge technique. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the airport in October 2018. The technique for decontamination at Bien Hoa airport is expected to cost half as much as in-pile thermal desorption. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the site in October 2018, stating it was America keeping its promise to remediate past issues. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam focuses on providing assistance for environmental damage and oversight of aid utilization by the State Department and USAID. The State Department and USAID have requested funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam, with Congress generally appropriating funds for health and disability services in affected areas. Various programs for persons with disabilities have been conducted near known Agent Orange sites using these funds. The Obama Administration budget requests did not explicitly include funding for health and disability assistance programs in areas contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 designates funds for health and disability services in these contaminated areas, with a minimum of $12,500,000 allocated for such programs. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 (H.R. 326) allocates not less than $12,500,000 for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. Assistance will be provided for individuals with severe mobility impairment or cognitive disabilities. Covered individuals, defined as Vietnamese residents affected by Agent Orange exposure, will receive medical care, nursing services, vocational training, and medical equipment. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 allocates funds for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. Covered individuals, defined as Vietnamese residents affected by Agent Orange exposure, will receive medical care, nursing services, vocational training, and medical equipment. Additionally, the Act requires assistance for repairing homes, supporting research on health issues, and providing aid to healthcare institutions in Vietnam. The Secretary of State is tasked with providing assistance to healthcare institutions in Vietnam for individuals affected by Agent Orange exposure and remediating high-risk areas. Priority is given to heavily sprayed areas and military bases where Agent Orange was handled. Quarterly reports on the Act's implementation must be submitted to Congress by the Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs. Congress oversees the implementation of the Act, focusing on funding for environmental remediation and health services in Agent Orange-contaminated areas in Vietnam. Concerns include rising costs at Danang airport and slow utilization of funds for health services by USAID. The estimated cost of Danang airport remediation increased from $33.7 million in 2010 to $116 million. The estimated total cost of environmental remediation at Danang airport increased from $33.7 million in 2010 to $116 million. USAID faced cost overruns and delays but managed to keep the project going. However, the utilization of funds for health services in Agent Orange-contaminated areas has been slow, with only 63.5% of funds appropriated from FY2011 to FY2017 being obligated. USAID has obligated 63.5% of funds appropriated from FY2011 to FY2017. There are concerns about the effectiveness of using health services funds and congressional dissatisfaction with State Department and USAID management. Congress has included language in legislation appropriating funds for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam. The US Congress has allocated funds for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam, with specific amounts detailed in accompanying reports or statements."
