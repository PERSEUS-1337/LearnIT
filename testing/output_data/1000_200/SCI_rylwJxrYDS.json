This enables the application of NLP algorithms that require discrete inputs. Experiments show BERT pre-training achieves state-of-the-art results in phoneme classification and speech recognition tasks. Research on learning discrete speech representations has gained recent interest, with approaches including autoencoding and self-supervised learning of continuous speech representations. In this paper, the vq-wav2vec algorithm learns discrete representations of speech segments for future time step prediction. Acoustic models are trained by quantizing raw audio with vq-wav2vec and applying BERT for transcription output. This approach combines research on continuous speech representations and context prediction tasks. The vq-wav2vec algorithm learns discrete representations of speech segments by utilizing a Gumbel-Softmax approach and online k-means clustering. These representations are then fed into a Deep Bidirectional Transformer (BERT) for training on unlabeled speech data, showing improved performance compared to traditional methods on TIMIT and WSJ benchmarks. This approach enables the application of NLP algorithms to speech data. The WAV2VEC model learns audio representations through a self-supervised context-prediction task, enabling speech recognition using NLP algorithms. The WAV2VEC model learns audio representations through a self-supervised context-prediction task, enabling speech recognition using NLP algorithms. The model is trained to distinguish future samples from distractors by minimizing contrastive loss. BERT is a pre-training approach for NLP tasks using a transformer encoder model for text representation. The vq-wav2vec approach learns vector quantized representations of audio data using a future time-step prediction task. It follows similar architectural choices as wav2vec, with convolutional networks for feature extraction and a quantization module to build discrete representations. The vq-wav2vec approach utilizes a quantization module to create discrete representations of raw speech data, replacing dense representations with one-hot representations from a fixed size codebook. This process involves mapping segments of speech to dense features, quantizing them into discrete indices, and optimizing context prediction tasks. The quantization module employs Gumbel-Softmax and online k-means clustering techniques for vector quantization. The text discusses the use of Gumbel-Softmax and vector quantization techniques in creating discrete representations of raw speech data in the vq-wav2vec approach. This involves mapping speech segments to dense features, quantizing them into discrete indices, and optimizing context prediction tasks. The approach includes multiple vector quantizations over different parts of the representation to prevent mode collapse. In the vq-wav2vec approach, the vector quantization technique is used to create discrete representations of raw speech data. The codebook variable representation is chosen based on the Euclidean distance to the input features. Gradients for the encoder network are obtained by back-propagating the loss. The final loss includes a future prediction task and a stop gradient operator with a hyper-parameter \u03b3. The VQ-Wav2vec approach uses vector quantization to create discrete representations of raw speech data. The loss function includes a future prediction task and a stop gradient operator with a hyper-parameter \u03b3. The codebook vectors are adjusted to be closer to the encoder output, and a strategy is described to independently quantize partitions of z to mitigate mode collapse issues. In this strategy, partitions of the dense feature vector z are independently quantized into larger dictionaries for improved downstream performance. Each row is represented by an integer index, allowing the full feature vector to be represented by indices. Two vector quantization approaches can be applied to each group, with the codebook variables either shared or not shared across groups. The codebook variables can be shared or not shared across groups in vector quantization. Sharing them yields competitive results. A vq-wav2vec model can discretize audio data for algorithms requiring discrete inputs. Using BERT pre-training on the discretized data improves speech recognition by predicting masked input tokens. The text discusses improving speech recognition by modifying BERT training to mask spans of consecutive discretized speech tokens, making the prediction harder and improving accuracy. The models are pre-trained on Librispeech data and evaluated on TIMIT benchmarks. After training vq-wav2vec, models are evaluated on TIMIT and Wall Street Journal datasets. The encoder has 8 layers with 512 channels each, kernel sizes, and strides. Fairseq implementation of wav2vec is used with 34 \u00d7 10 6 parameters. Phoneme labels are considered for TIMIT, while acoustic models are trained on 31 graphemes for WSJ. The aggregator consists of 12 layers with 512 channels, a stride of 1, and increasing kernel sizes. Skip connections are introduced between each block in the encoder network. Training includes 400k updates with wav2vec context prediction loss, warming up for 500 steps and using a cosine schedule for learning rate annealing. The batch size is 10, with random cropping of 150,000 frames for each example. For experiments on the 100h Librispeech subset, a smaller model with specific kernel and stride configurations is used. The model is trained for 40k updates with Gumbel-Softmax models employing 2 groups and 320 latents per group. The temperature \u03c4 is annealed from 2 to 0.5 over 70% of updates to allow the model to learn before committing to a single latent. After training on 960h of Librispeech and quantizing the dataset, 13.5k unique codewords combinations were obtained. The VQ-Wav2vec model on full Librispeech yielded 23k unique codewords. BERT base models have 12 layers, model dimension 768, inner dimension 3072, and 12 attention heads. The learning rate is warmed up over the first 10,000 updates to a peak value of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125, then linearly decayed over 250k updates. Training is done on 128 GPUs with a batch size of 3072 tokens per GPU. The training setup includes using BERT small with model dimension 512, FFN size 2048, 8 attention heads, and dropout 0.05. Models are trained for 250k updates with a batch size of 2 examples per GPU. Wav2letter is used as the acoustic model, trained for 1k epochs on 8 GPUs for TIMIT and WSJ using the auto segmentation criterion. Decoding on WSJ involves using a lexicon and a separate language model. The study evaluates different models for speech recognition, including vq-wav2vec and BERT, on the WSJ benchmark. They compare results with wav2vec and consider different setups with and without language models. The accuracy of wav2letter with different inputs is reported, showing promising results with vq-wav2vec and Gumbel-Softmax. The study compares vq-wav2vec with Gumbel-Softmax and BERT training to achieve a new state of the art WER of 2.34 on nov92. Gains are largest without a language model. Gumbel-Softmax uses 13.5k codewords, enabling BERT training with a small vocabulary. Comparisons are made with k-means for vector quantization, including a model with 39m codewords to test for improved performance. The study compares vq-wav2vec with Gumbel-Softmax and BERT training to achieve a new state of the art WER of 2.34 on nov92. Comparisons are made with k-means for vector quantization, including a model with 39m codewords to test for improved performance in phoneme recognition. Table 2 compares Gumbel-Softmax and k-means clustering performance, showing that Gumbel-Softmax is more accurate without BERT, but differences disappear with BERT. K-means performs better in a 4-gram LM setup, but also evens out with BERT training. The large codeword model reduces the gap to the original wav2vec model. Moving on to the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, vq-wav2vec and BERT achieve a new state of the art of 11.67 PER, a 21% error reduction compared to wav2vec. Preliminary experiments involve training a standard sequence to sequence model for speech recognition after audio discretization. In preliminary experiments, an off-the-shelf Big Transformer was trained on the vq-wav2vec Gumbel-Softmax discretized Librispeech corpus. Results show promise, although not as good as the state of the art due to lack of data augmentation. The study investigates vq-wav2vec's ability to compress audio data by varying codebook size and measuring accuracy on TIMIT phoneme recognition without BERT training. Compression is measured with bitrate and accuracy tradeoff on the phoneme recognition task. The study explores compressing audio data using vq-wav2vec with varying codebook sizes and measuring accuracy on TIMIT phoneme recognition without BERT training. Compression is evaluated based on bitrate and accuracy tradeoff on the phoneme recognition task, with experiments conducted on the Librispeech subset. Various lossy compression algorithms are used as baselines for comparison. The study evaluates compressing audio data using vq-wav2vec with different codecs and bitrate settings. Results show that masking entire spans of tokens performs better than individual tokens. BERT training on discretized audio data is robust to masking large parts of the input. vq-wav2vec, a self-supervised algorithm, improves performance on WSJ and TIMIT benchmarks by leveraging BERT pre-training. Future work includes applying other algorithms requiring discrete inputs to audio data and exploring self-supervised pre-training algorithms. In future work, the plan is to explore self-supervised pre-training algorithms for audio data and finetune pre-trained models to output transcriptions. The study also investigates the relationship between variables and groups, showing that multiple groups are beneficial compared to a single group with many variables."
