    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to pulmonary hypertension. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic, and incurable lung disorder with a poor survival rate. Approximately 300 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year, with the majority occurring in women aged 21 to 40. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) can affect men and women of all ages and ethnicities, with about 6 to 10 percent of cases being familial. The disease can progress to the point where patients are bedridden, and diagnosis remains challenging due to its low prevalence and lack of a good animal model for study. PPH is a challenging diagnosis, often confused with other heart and lung conditions. A registry in 1981 followed 194 PPH patients for up to 7.5 years, contributing valuable knowledge. Research is ongoing to understand the immunologic and genetic factors involved in PPH progression. During 1996-1997, millions of Americans took anorexic drugs linked to PPH. SPH has known causes like emphysema and bronchitis. Other causes include inflammatory diseases. Causes of pulmonary hypertension include disorders like emphysema, bronchitis, inflammatory diseases, collagen vascular diseases, congenital heart diseases, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Director of the Institute will intensify and coordinate research activities on pulmonary hypertension, including collaborating with other national research institutes and agencies. Grants and contracts will be provided to public or nonprofit private entities for Centers of Excellence in this area. The Director of the Institute will provide grants or contracts to public or nonprofit entities to develop and operate research centers for pulmonary hypertension. These centers will conduct research, training programs, and provide information on the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the disease. The Director of the Institute will provide grants or contracts to public or nonprofit entities to develop and operate research centers for pulmonary hypertension. These centers will conduct research, training programs, and provide information to health professionals and the public. Stipends may be provided for scientists and health professionals enrolled in training programs. Coordination of information among centers and regular communication will be ensured by the Director. The Director will establish research centers for pulmonary hypertension, with each center using facilities of a single institution or a consortium of institutions. At least three centers will be established for a maximum of 5 years, with the possibility of extensions. Regular communication and reporting will be required among the centers. The Director will establish research centers for pulmonary hypertension, with each center operating for up to 5 years, extendable for additional 5-year periods based on peer review recommendations. The Director will also establish a data system for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data on pulmonary hypertension patients, and a clearinghouse for information dissemination. The Director of the Institute will establish an information clearinghouse to enhance understanding of pulmonary hypertension. Public input will be solicited for feedback on NIH programs related to primary hypertension. Biennial reports on activities conducted and supported will be prepared. The Director of the Institute will prepare biennial reports on activities conducted and supported under this section, with authorized appropriations up to $25,000,000 for each fiscal year 2004 through 2008."
