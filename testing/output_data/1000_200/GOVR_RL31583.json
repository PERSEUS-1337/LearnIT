    "content": "The federal K-12 education assistance legislation, starting from the IASA in 1994 to the NCLB in 2001, focused on granting flexibility to grantees. The NCLB expanded existing flexibility authorities and introduced new ones for state and local administration of federal K-12 education programs. This report outlines these authorizations for flexibility and will be updated periodically to reflect new developments and impacts. The report defines \"flexibility\" as the authority to waive federal program requirements for state or local aid recipients meeting eligibility criteria. This includes consolidating programs, transferring funds, and waiving specific requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The report focuses on federal involvement in K-12 education through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), excluding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The ESEA programs are authorized through FY2008, with discussions on potential amendments and extensions by the 110th Congress. The report will be regularly updated to reflect legislative developments. It reviews federal K-12 education program requirements, sources, purposes, and concerns expressed by some stakeholders. The report discusses federal K-12 education program requirements, sources, purposes, and concerns expressed by stakeholders. It also covers special flexibility authorities that allow for waivers of certain requirements. Federal K-12 education programs have accountability requirements to ensure funds are used appropriately, with flexibility in areas like eligibility and allocation. These programs focus on student populations with special needs, such as disadvantaged or limited English proficient students. Federal K-12 education programs target student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas. These programs are often referred to as \"categorical\" programs due to their focused nature. The ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs authority is considered a \"block grant\" due to its broad range of activities. Federal requirements or guidance to recipients of federal aid can be categorized as \"requirements\" or \"non-regulatory policy guidance.\" \"Requirements\" must be met by grantees as a matter of law, derived from the authorizing statute or other federal statutes. Program regulations are published in the Federal Register. Program regulations, published in the Federal Register and integrated into the Code of Federal Regulations, supplement statutory language for complex issues prioritized by the U.S. Department of Education. Non-regulatory policy guidance is also provided for many programs by ED. The U.S. Department of Education issues program regulations in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations. Additionally, non-regulatory policy guidance is published for many programs, including \"Dear Colleague\" letters and Q&A documents. Grantees are not legally required to follow this guidance, but may perceive it as reducing challenges to their use of federal aid. Grantees often view non-regulatory guidance as equivalent to regulations, especially in competitive grant programs where certain priorities are set by the Department of Education. While not mandatory, following these priorities increases the chances of receiving support. The Department of Education sets priorities for grant programs, especially for applicants from low-income families. These priorities, published in the Federal Register, are not mandatory but increase the likelihood of receiving support. In recent years, there has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations at all. Non-regulatory policy guidance is often provided instead. The Department of Education provides non-regulatory policy guidance for ESEA programs, with regulations being briefer and addressing fewer issues since the early 1990s. For example, regulations for ESEA Title I-A focus on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation. The trend towards minimal regulations continued after the NCLB of 2001, with the Department regulating only when necessary. The Department of Education intends to regulate only if absolutely necessary, focusing on nonregulatory guidance for Title I programs to provide flexibility and clarification. This guidance informs schools, parents, and other parties about different approaches to meet program goals for K-12 education assistance. The federal elementary and secondary education program requirements aim to establish accountability for appropriate use of federal aid funds. This includes target accountability, outcome accountability, and fiscal accountability to ensure funds are focused on eligible localities, improve student achievement, and assure financial responsibility. The federal elementary and secondary education program requirements focus on improving student achievement, enhancing K-12 instruction, and ensuring fiscal accountability by assuring financial integrity and preventing the replacement of state or local funds with federal aid funds. Specific requirements include targeting resources to high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high priority services, conducting audits, enhancing parental participation, implementing staff qualifications, and providing equitable treatment for pupils in non-public schools. The federal elementary and secondary education program requirements focus on improving student achievement, enhancing K-12 instruction, ensuring fiscal accountability, targeting resources to high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high priority services, conducting audits, enhancing parental participation, implementing staff qualifications, providing equitable treatment for pupils in non-public schools, and evaluating the effectiveness of federally supported instructional services. Grantees that violate regulations may have to repay funds or face sanctions, although these are rarely imposed. Additional general requirements apply to all recipients of federal education assistance. Federal education assistance recipients must adhere to program-specific and general requirements outlined in regulations such as EDGAR and OMB circulars. Additional regulations cover civil rights, student privacy, and compliance with child nutrition programs. Other federal agency regulations may also apply, such as those related to workplace safety and environmental protection for LEAs and schools. State and local educational agencies have wide discretion in using federal education assistance, with regulations from federal agencies other than ED applying to LEAs and schools as employers. Complaints about specific requirements often focus on selected types, leaving room for state and LEA discretion in areas such as grade levels, subject areas, and instructional techniques. Complaints about ESEA and related program-specific requirements often focus on prohibitions against commingling funds, restrictions on resource use, targeting aid, eligibility thresholds for flexibility, and outcome accountability under NCLB. These requirements aim to establish fiscal accountability. The NCLB establishes outcome accountability requirements to focus federal funds on students with the greatest needs and improve education services. The categorical approach of larger ED programs directs aid at high-need pupil groups, but this may lead to fragmentation of services, inefficient resource use, and partial treatment of needs. Coordination between special program instruction and regular instruction may be challenging in low enrollment LEAs with small grants. The traditional federal categorical approach in education has been criticized for leading to fragmented instruction and focusing more on targeting resources rather than improving achievement for pupils with multiple special needs. Difficulties may arise from implementing federal programs in states with varying educational policies and demographic conditions. Some problems with categorical program structures may stem from misunderstandings of federal statutes and regulations. Some program structures and requirements may result from misunderstandings of federal statutes and regulations or strict state interpretations. State and local education officials often complain about constraints on federal fund use, including cross-cutting requirements for K-12 education assistance recipients. A 1998 GAO report highlighted concerns expressed by LEA staff regarding these requirements. LEA staff often struggle to access current, concise information on federal requirements for K-12 education assistance. They also face concerns about the costs of meeting administrative responsibilities and meeting required timelines. LEA staff face challenges in meeting administrative responsibilities and required timelines for federal education programs. Various authorities allow waivers for federal K-12 program requirements, with limitations on types of requirements, programs affected, and eligibility. Waivers can be requested on a case-by-case basis or through blanket authority, with varying levels of additional accountability. Some federal authorities provide flexibility in the use of funds for education programs, with different levels of accountability. Five types of special flexibility include Ed-Flex, Secretarial case-by-case waivers, schoolwide program authority under ESEA Title I-A, Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs. These authorities were established before the NCLB of 2001. The Ed-Flex authority allows the Department of Education to delegate waiver authority to states for certain ESEA programs. Initially authorized for six states in 1994, it was expanded to 12 states in 1996 and later modified in 1999. The cap on participating states was removed, and technical amendments were made in 2001. In 2006, legislation extended Ed-Flex authority until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. Legislation in 2006 extended Ed-Flex authority until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A (P.L. 109-211). The original Ed-Flex authority was granted to 12 states, with 10 states obtaining Ed-Flex status under P.L. 106-25. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002, and the authority for ED to grant Ed-Flex authority to additional states expired in FY2004. Ed-Flex authority is granted to a state for up to five years, and recent congressional action (P.L. 109-211) addressed the expiration of authority for the 10 Ed-Flex states by January 2007. Under P.L. 109-211, all 10 Ed-Flex states retain their authority until ESEA Title I, Part A is reauthorized. States must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, monitor performance, and submit annual reports to ED. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain requirements for federal programs such as ESEA Titles I-A, I-B-3, I-C, I-D, I-F, II-A, II-D-1, III-B-4, IV-A-1, V-A, and the Perkins Act. States must submit annual reports on outcomes to the Department of Education. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain requirements for federal programs like ESEA Titles I-A, I-B-3, I-C, I-D, I-F, II-A, II-D-1, III-B-4, IV-A-1, V-A, and the Perkins Act. States must report outcomes annually to the Department of Education. ED interprets Ed-Flex statutes as allowing states to waive some administrative requirements of GEPA and EDGAR for state-administered programs. Certain requirements related to fiscal accountability and equitable participation cannot be waived unless the purposes are met to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Education. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain federal program requirements for ESEA Titles I-A, I-B-3, I-C, I-D, I-F, II-A, II-D-1, III-B-4, IV-A-1, V-A, and the Perkins Act. States must report outcomes annually to the Department of Education. Local waivers are to be terminated if student performance has been unsatisfactory. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive federal program requirements for certain ESEA Titles. States must report outcomes annually to the Department of Education, and local waivers will be terminated if student performance is inadequate. States are required to submit annual reports on waivers granted, including information on the effects on student performance. ED will make state reports available to Congress and the public, summarizing the effects of Ed-Flex waivers on state reform efforts and pupil performance. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive federal program requirements for certain ESEA Titles. States must report outcomes annually to the Department of Education, and local waivers will be terminated if student performance is inadequate. However, a report prepared in 2001 lacked information on the use of Ed-Flex authority by states or programmatic impacts. No subsequent annual reports have been published by ED. Another type of federal education program flexibility authority consists of waivers granted to SEAs or LEAs on a case-by-case basis by the U.S. Secretary of Education, with a focus on Title IX, Part D of the ESEA. The ESEA Title IX, Part D allows the Secretary of Education to waive requirements for educational programs. Requests for waivers must include specific educational goals and methods for measuring progress. Certain requirements cannot be waived under this authority. The ESEA Title IX, Part D allows the Secretary of Education to waive requirements for educational programs, but there are limitations on what can be waived. Certain prohibitions, such as those related to school finance, religious instruction, sex education, and charter school eligibility, cannot be waived. Waivers granted under this authority may not exceed four years. The Secretary of Education can grant waivers under ESEA Title IX-D for up to four years, with the possibility of extension if it improves student achievement. Waivers can be terminated if pupil performance does not justify continuation or if the waiver is no longer necessary. The Secretary must publish waiver decisions in the Federal Register. The Department of Education failed to publish these notices for several years but eventually did so in response to a memorandum. Between January 2002 and December 2006, the Department of Education granted 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D, with most being related to administrative cost limitations and fund obligation periods. Other waivers were granted for reasons such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, participation in pilot programs, and providing supplemental educational services. Between January 2002 and December 2006, the Department of Education granted 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D, mainly for administrative cost limitations and fund obligation periods. Some waivers were also granted for reasons like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, pilot programs, and providing supplemental educational services. Additionally, waivers allowed LEAs to provide SES instead of school choice and exceptions to ESEA Title I-A requirements for fiscal accountability and school selection. Annual reports on waiver effects were required starting in FY2002, but it is unclear if any have been submitted. Another waiver authority applies to schools in the Public Charter Schools program under ESEA Title V, Part B. The PCS waiver authority under ESEA Section 5204(e) allows for waivers of any requirement over which the Secretary of Education has administrative authority, with few exceptions. This authority has been used infrequently and for limited purposes, mainly not discussed in the report. Eligible schools under ESEA Title I-A with 40% or more low-income students can conduct schoolwide programs. Schools with 40% or more low-income students under ESEA Title I-A can implement schoolwide programs with flexibility in fund usage across various federal education programs. These programs aim to improve services for all students, exempting them from certain regulations while meeting program intents and addressing beneficiaries' needs. Title I-A and other federal program funds must supplement, not supplant, other funds received by schools. Schoolwide programs under IDEA allow flexibility in fund usage but still require meeting program requirements. This authority is significant for Title I-A programs, as most other programs focus on LEAs rather than individual schools. The ability to use Title I-A funds on a schoolwide basis provides significant flexibility compared to traditional targeted assistance programs. Schoolwide programs have few additional requirements and have seen rapid growth in recent years. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB, allowing high poverty schools to provide special assistance to all disadvantaged pupils. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of pupils from low-income families, aiming to provide special assistance to all disadvantaged pupils. However, questions arise about the effectiveness of this rationale for schools just meeting the new threshold, with little evidence on the achievement effects of this expansion. Additionally, small, rural LEAs have the flexibility to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs under P.L. 106-554. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows small, rural LEAs with specific criteria to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. LEAs with low attendance or in rural areas can combine funds from programs like Teacher Training, Technology, and Safe Schools. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) permits small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among various ESEA programs to address the challenge of insufficient grant amounts. This flexibility allows for more effective use of funds by combining and transferring them for authorized activities under different programs. The \"REAP Flex\" authority allows small, rural LEAs to combine and transfer funds among different program activities, similar to the Transferability authority under NCLB. This flexibility applies to 100% of funds for small, rural LEAs, compared to 50% for other LEAs, and includes programs like ESEA Titles III and IV-B. Additionally, eligible LEAs can receive supplementary grants for various purposes. The small, rural schools flexibility authority allows LEAs to transfer funds among different program activities. Participation in REAP Flex is widespread, with approximately 51% of eligible LEAs participating in 2005-2006. Funds are often transferred from Titles II-A and IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A. Rural LEAs find this flexibility useful due to small formula allocations in eligible programs. The evaluation found that many LEAs found the small school flexibility useful as their formula allocations were too small for significant school improvement activities. There was confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authority at the LEA level. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, offers special flexibility for states and LEAs in using federal aid funds, considered a block grant in K-12 education. The ESEA Title V-A program, considered a block grant in K-12 education, provides flexibility to states and LEAs in using federal aid funds. Funds are allocated to states based on population aged 5-17, with a majority going to LEAs based on state-developed formulas. The ESEA Title V-A program ensures that no state receives less than 0.5% of total grants. Funds are allocated to LEAs based on state-developed formulas that consider enrollment, high-cost pupils, and disadvantaged families. States must suballocate at least 85% of the grant received in FY2002 to LEAs. The ESEA Title V-A program requires states to suballocate a minimum of 85% of the grant received in FY2002 to LEAs. States must also suballocate 100% of Title V-A grants above the FY2002 level, with exceptions for states receiving the minimum grant amount. Of the funds retained by states, only 15% can be used for administrative costs, while the rest must be used for specified programs and services. The ESEA Title V-A program requires states to suballocate a minimum of 85% of the grant received to LEAs for various education reform projects, school improvement programs, and technical assistance. LEAs can use the funds for innovative assistance programs such as charter schools, same-gender schools, school nurses, and programs to improve academic achievement for disadvantaged students. Title V-A program under ESEA allows LEAs to use funds for various education reform projects and school improvement programs. The program was first enacted in 1981 as Chapter 2 of ECIA, consolidating federal K-12 education programs. It is considered a block grant due to broad authorized use of funds and prohibits SEAs from influencing LEA decisions on fund usage. The Title V-A program under ESEA allows LEAs to use funds for education reform projects and school improvement programs. A recent study found that recipient LEAs used Title V-A funds for instructional materials, educational technology, and targeted academic services. Large LEAs were especially likely to use these funds for teacher professional development. The Title V-A program under ESEA allows LEAs to use funds for education reform projects and school improvement programs. A recent study found that large LEAs were especially likely to use Title V-A funds for teacher professional development and school-based improvement efforts. However, resources or services funded by this program were not frequently targeted at high-need pupils or schools. Appropriations for Title V-A have steeply declined over the years, with the possibility of the program being effectively terminated due to zero funds provided in FY2008. The Title V-A program under ESEA is facing a decline in funding, raising the possibility of its termination. Limited support for increased funding is due to the program lacking clear constituencies. Funding for Title V-A has been supplemented by other sources, and its future funding may rely solely on these sources. Limited information on the program's effectiveness has reduced incentives to maintain its funding level. The ESEA Title V-A program is facing funding challenges and may be at risk of termination due to limited support and unclear constituencies. To address concerns, the program was amended by NCLB to require annual summaries on how it contributes to improving student academic achievement. SEAs and LEAs have the option to increase Title V-A funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. Additional provisions adopted before NCLB enactment are also noted for potentially increasing funding. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) introduced flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, allowing states and LEAs to consolidate applications, plans, and funds for administrative convenience. These provisions, found in Parts B and C of ESEA Title IX, offer additional flexibility beyond the Title V-A program's funding challenges and potential termination. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) provided flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, allowing LEAs to transfer funds among specified programs. LEAs could transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among programs like Teacher and Principal Training Fund, State and Local Technology Grants, Safe and Drug Free Schools, and Innovative Programs block grant. Funds could not be transferred out of ESEA Title I-A. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 allowed LEAs to transfer funds among specified programs, including Teacher and Principal Training Fund, State and Local Technology Grants, Safe and Drug Free Schools, and Innovative Programs block grant (Title V-A). LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can only transfer 30% of their grants to address AYP standards. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds, except for administrative funds, among specified programs. Transferability authority for states is limited due to restrictions on fund transfers. The Transferability authority allows LEAs to suballocate funds to LEAs or state administration. The authority is significant, with approximately $3.5 billion in FY2008 appropriations for programs subject to it. The process is simple, with no specific application needed, but program requirements still apply to transferred funds. The range of purposes for transferred funds is wide, including the Innovative Programs block grant. The Transferability authority allows LEAs to suballocate funds to LEAs or state administration, with approximately $3.5 billion in FY2008 appropriations. Program requirements still apply to transferred funds, including restrictions on fund transfers across fiscal years. Participation in Transferability is relatively modest, with confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities affecting estimates of participation levels. LEAs participating in Transferability often moved funds between ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A. This was done to compensate for reductions in formula grants, target resources on underperforming schools, or utilize funds with more flexibility. Many LEAs did not participate in Transferability for various reasons. The evaluation report found that LEAs cited reasons for not participating in Transferability, such as lack of information, satisfaction with existing flexibility, or insufficient funding levels. A new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows up to seven states to consolidate their state administration and activity funds under various federal programs. The State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows states to consolidate funds from various federal programs for five years, with the possibility of renewal if requirements are met. States may lose this authority if they fail to meet AYP requirements for two consecutive years or fail to comply with terms. The State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows states to consolidate funds from federal programs for five years, with the possibility of renewal if requirements are met. Selected states must enter into agreements with 4-10 LEAs, with at least half having child poverty rates of 20% or more. LEAs can align their funds with state uses and states can specify purposes for LEAs' funds under the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant. The State-Flex program allows states to consolidate funds from federal programs for five years, with the possibility of renewal. Only one state, Florida, has been granted State-Flex authority but withdrew before implementation. Under Local-Flex authority, up to 80 LEAs can consolidate funds from various programs for use in the Teacher and Principal Training, Technology Grants, Safe and Drug Free Schools, and Innovative Programs. LEAs can consolidate funds from various federal programs for State and Local Technology Grants, Safe and Drug Free Schools, and Innovative Programs. They can use up to 4% of the funds for administration and must meet state AYP requirements to maintain authority. Renewal is possible if goals are met. The Local-Flex program allows LEAs to consolidate funds for various programs, with certain requirements that cannot be waived. Seattle, Washington, was the only LEA to participate, but its eligibility was suspended for failing to make AYP. There has been little interest from states and LEAs in participating in the program. In 2002, the Department of Education conducted competitions for State-Flex and Local-Flex authority, but there was minimal interest from states and LEAs. Only one LEA participated in Local-Flex, and no states in State-Flex. Barriers to participation included additional responsibilities with few benefits, limited organizational capacity, and lack of information dissemination. A new round of competition for these authorities began in 2004. In 2004, a new round of competition for State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities was announced by the Department of Education. Participants would receive preference in future grant competitions due to their comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and academic achievement. These authorities are broader compared to Transferability authority. State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities offer broad flexibility in fund usage under ESEA programs, with limited participation from states and LEAs despite multiple invitations to compete. The scope of State-Flex authority is restricted in certain aspects. The State-Flex authority offers limited flexibility in fund usage under ESEA programs, with states responsible for meeting administrative responsibilities. The share of funds for state administration varies from 1% to 26.5% across different programs. The State-Flex authority offers limited flexibility in fund usage under ESEA programs, with states responsible for meeting administrative responsibilities. Participating LEAs in the state demonstration program might have diminished flexibility, as their use of funds must align with state use and LEA use of Title V-A funds. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance, as those funds can already be used for a wide range of activities. Comparing State-Flex and Local-Flex authority with flexibility authorities in earlier versions of H.R. 1 is instructive. The final provisions of the State-Flex and Local-Flex authority in the NCLB are similar to the House version of H.R. 1, allowing local flexibility demonstrations in 100 LEAs. The Senate version of H.R. 1 proposed broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, which was not included in the final legislation. This Senate program would have provided greater flexibility than the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 1 would have provided greater flexibility than the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. The scope of the flexibility/performance agreement authority was limited to 7 participating states and 25 LEAs in other states. The types of program requirements remained similar, but the range of ESEA programs subject to the flexibility authority was broader with higher funding levels. The flexibility authority under the Senate-passed version of H.R. 1 was broader and involved higher funding levels compared to State-Flex and Local-Flex. Participating states could reallocate funds among LEAs to target concentrations of poor children, unlike State-Flex. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 1 provided broader flexibility authority with higher funding levels compared to State-Flex and Local-Flex. Participating states could reallocate funds among LEAs to target concentrations of poor children, with an additional requirement to exceed AYP goals by a statistically significant amount. This report also addresses cross-cutting issues related to the new forms of flexibility introduced. The special flexibility authorities introduced in the NCLB allow states and LEAs to use federal aid funds according to their priorities, with limitations on participation and program requirements. Exceptions include Transferability authority, Innovative Programs block grant, and Title I-A schoolwide programs. States and LEAs can waive federal program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes, except for certain exceptions. These flexibility authorities, introduced under the NCLB, aim to increase accountability while allowing for some degree of flexibility in ESEA and related federal programs. Around 12-16% of LEAs have utilized at least one of these flexibility authorities. The most widely used flexibility authority among small, rural LEAs is REAP Flex. Limited information exists on the impact of special flexibility on pupil achievement. Common characteristics and cross-cutting issues associated with flexibility authorities are discussed. The current flexibility authorities may not fully address the primary concerns of states and LEAs. The current flexibility authorities, including ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority and Secretarial case-by-case waiver authorities, have limitations in addressing the concerns of states and LEAs regarding restrictions on federal funds and administrative burdens. The authority is restricted to schools with low-income pupil rates somewhat above average, and the significance of this authority is limited to programs other than Title I-A. Waivers must be individually requested from the U.S. Secretary of Education or through the Ed-Flex authority, requiring applications from LEAs to their SEAs. The Ed-Flex authority allows LEAs to request waivers from the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers under this authority. While most states and LEAs can transfer funds, they are limited to 50% of the received funds. Rural LEA flexibility is only available to low-enrollment LEAs. State-Flex authority is limited to seven states. Local-Flex authority is available to a maximum of 80 LEAs. Participation in these authorities is low due to limited flexibility. The limited flexibility provided by these authorities is a likely reason for low participation rates. Certain requirements cannot be waived, such as fiscal accountability and ESEA Title I-A standards. Many flexibility authorities do not cover Title I-A, and states cannot reallocate funds among LEAs. A 1999 GAO report found that existing flexibility authorities do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs. Ed-Flex States have varying implementations of the waiver process. A 1999 GAO report highlighted that the flexibility authorities in place at that time did not alleviate the main regulatory burdens faced by states and LEAs. Some SEA staff view Ed-Flex as having limited value due to the few programs and requirements that can be waived, while others see it as promoting innovation and flexibility. These observations also apply to newer authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002. The new authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002 provide additional flexibility in federal education programs, but their impact may be relatively marginal compared to the increased flexibility already seen in programs like ESEA Title I-A under NCLB. The new authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002 provide additional flexibility in federal education programs, but their impact may be relatively marginal. Waivers can remove federal regulatory barriers to local educational reform, but limited information is available on their use. Pre-NCLB waivers were used for few purposes not clearly related to innovation. ESEA Title IX-D authority allowed some states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining AYP. The ESEA Title IX-D authority has been used to allow states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining AYP. Recent studies show that flexibility authority was mainly used to move funds between different education programs, with a focus on compensating for reductions in formula grants under Title I-A and V-A. Many LEAs used authorities to compensate for reductions in formula grants under ESEA Title I-A and V-A, target resources on schools failing to meet progress standards, and have flexibility in fund usage. Pre-NCLB waivers were commonly used to waive requirements such as low-income pupil thresholds, targeting funds on schools with high low-income populations, deadlines for standards adoption, and limitations on fund use for teacher recruitment programs. The curr_chunk discusses limitations on the use of funds under pre-NCLB programs related to teacher recruitment and training, including the Class Size Reduction and Eisenhower Professional Development Programs. It questions whether schools with low percentages of low-income students should be granted flexibility in using funds. The curr_chunk highlights concerns about the limited impact of schoolwide Title I-A programs due to funding constraints and questions the effectiveness of waivers in dispersing funds among low-poverty schools. Waivers may also undermine accountability requirements for ESEA Title I-A programs. The use of waivers to delay meeting deadlines for implementing ESEA Title I-A standard and assessment requirements may undermine accountability. LEAs and states often requested waivers for various requirements related to teacher hiring, funding allocation, and professional development in response to local conditions. Following the enactment of NCLB, waivers such as Ed-Flex and other pre-NCLB flexibility authorities have become less relevant. The NCLB lowered the schoolwide program eligibility threshold to 40% of pupils from low-income families nationwide. The CSR and Eisenhower programs were consolidated into a more flexible ESEA Title II program. Limited substantive waivers have been granted under ESEA Title IX-D in the post-NCLB era. The impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement is limited. Few substantive waivers have been granted under ESEA Title IX-D in the post-NCLB era. Limited information is available on the impact of special flexibility on pupil achievement. States with Ed-Flex authority have submitted annual reports to ED, but the information provided has been of limited value. Anecdotal information on the achievement effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers in a few LEAs was included in a 1999 ED report. The report primarily focused on whether affected LEAs or schools met state AYP standards at the time. The 1998 ED report on Ed-Flex highlighted three major ways in which Ed-Flex authority supports standards-based reform in states: facilitating program coordination and planning, streamlining program administration, and allowing for instructional program development without constraints of federal or state requirements. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to streamline program administration by reducing paperwork and shifting focus towards outcomes to improve student achievement. However, the limited data on improved pupil outcomes raises questions about the effectiveness of special flexibility granted to states, LEAs, or schools. The availability of sufficient information to analyze the benefits and impact of special flexibility authorities remains a concern. The effectiveness of special flexibility authorities granted to states, LEAs, or schools is questioned due to limited data on improved pupil outcomes. The lack of information available makes it difficult to evaluate the significance, advantages, and disadvantages of these flexibility authorities. The focus on outcomes associated with these authorities is a key consideration. The special flexibility authorities granted to states, LEAs, or schools raise questions about whether the emphasis on outcomes associated with them is a sufficient substitute for other forms of accountability requirements. These outcome accountability requirements include goals set by states and LEAs, as well as meeting state-established adequate yearly progress (AYP) requirements under ESEA Title I-A. The GAO study found that states granted Ed-Flex authority differed in clarity and specificity of outcome goals. Five states had set no specific objectives for LEAs or schools granted waivers, while only one state had established outcome objectives linked to those affected. ED oversight of Ed-Flex implementation was limited to collecting annual reports. The GAO study found that Ed-Flex implementation oversight by the ED was limited to collecting annual reports from states with varying levels of detail. The current flexibility authorities do not require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states, focusing instead on generally applicable outcome requirements like meeting AYP. The emphasis is on outcome accountability requirements for states and LEAs with special flexibility authority under NCLB.
