    "content": "Poverty rates have been rising since 2000, with only three significant declines between 2000 and 2015. Policymakers are reexamining the drivers of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. A snapshot of poverty in 2015 shows a diverse group of families and individuals affected. The data presented in this report highlights the diverse characteristics of people in poverty, emphasizing the importance of work in their economic well-being. Factors such as living arrangements and family dynamics also play a significant role in determining economic fortunes. Considerations such as living arrangements and family dynamics influence economic well-being. This snapshot focuses on the composition of people in poverty, showing how different groups contribute to the overall poverty population. For example, larger populations like non-Hispanic whites may have lower poverty rates but still represent a significant share of the poverty population, while smaller populations like American Indians may have higher poverty rates but a smaller share in the overall population. Poverty is a lack of resources to meet basic needs, with different demographic groups having varying poverty rates. The official measure of poverty used by the U.S. Census Bureau is family-based, where a person's poverty status depends on their income and the income of family members they live with. For more information on poverty rates and trends, refer to CRS Report R44644, Poverty in the United States in 2015: In Brief. The poverty status of an individual is determined by their money income and the income of family members they live with. The poverty threshold varies based on family composition, with income below the threshold indicating poverty. The official poverty measure has been in place for about 50 years. The official poverty measure, in place for 50 years, determines poverty based on family income. It has limitations like not considering taxes, non-cash benefits, assets, or regional living costs. The Census Bureau now has a supplemental poverty measure for research purposes. The Census Bureau's supplemental poverty measure (SPM) considers modern resource-sharing arrangements and adjusts for taxes, transfers, and housing costs. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had income below the poverty threshold, accounting for 13.5% of the population. Attention has been on the very poor, with a focus on \"deep poverty\" defined as income below 50% of the poverty threshold. In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million people, close to half of those in poverty, lived in deep poverty with income below 50% of the poverty threshold. Children made up one-third of the population in poverty, with 14.5 million children affected. In 2015, 14.5 million children were in poverty, representing 33.6% of the population in poverty. Working-age individuals (18-64) made up the largest share of the poor population at 56.6%. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group in both the total population (61.4%) and the poverty population (41.2%). Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group overall (61.4% of the total population) and in poverty (41.2%). Hispanics were the second largest group (17.8% of the total population) and represented 28.1% of the poor. Non-Hispanic African-Americans were the third largest group in both populations, with 12.3% and 22.0% respectively. Minority groups were over-represented in poverty, including Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, and others. Whites and Asians were under-represented in poverty. The racial and ethnic composition of people in poverty by age group is influenced by overall demographic trends. Children are more diverse than adults, with minorities over-represented in poverty for all age groups. Women make up a larger share of the population in poverty, possibly due to heading single-parent households. Women are over-represented in poverty, possibly due to heading single-parent households. Men earn more on average. Poverty policies differ for children, working-age adults, and aged adults. The report explores poverty among children, working-age adults, and aged adults, highlighting the central role of work as the primary means of economic support. Work can include one's own work, family members' work, or past work for retirement income. Living arrangements are also considered due to the importance of sharing resources for economic well-being. Children accounted for one-third of people in poverty in America in 2015. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. They rely on adult caretakers for support, often from earnings. The composition of poor children and children in the total population by the number of adult workers in the family is shown in Figure 7. More than 90% of children in the total population lived in households with adult workers. Among children in the total population, over 90% lived in families with at least one adult earner, and 50.3% lived in families with two or more earners. Two-thirds of poor children lived in families with earners, with 57.5% having one earner and 10.5% having two or more. The number of potential adult earners in a child's family depends on the family type, with single-parent families having one earner and married couples having at least two earners. In 2015, children in female-headed families made up the majority of those living in poverty, while children in married couple families accounted for one-third of poor children. Despite a low poverty rate for children in married couple families, the large population size meant a significant number of poor children lived in this family type. Married-couple families were underrepresented among children in poverty compared to the overall population. Poor children were more likely to live in larger families. Children in poverty are more likely to live in larger families, which require higher income thresholds to meet their needs. This results in larger families being disproportionately represented among poor children, with 27% of poor children in families with four or more children compared to 14.2% in the overall population. Earnings, not family size, determine poverty levels, leading to a higher likelihood of poverty in larger families. In America, the majority of people in poverty are working-age adults, representing 56.6% of all individuals in poverty. Among working-age adults who are poor, the majority do not have earnings from work, with only 38.8% working either full- or part-time. Among working-age adults who are poor, 61.3% did not have earnings from work. 38.8% were working in some capacity, with 10.4% working full-time all year. Reasons for not working included illness, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and job availability. Educational attainment is linked to success in the workforce. Among working-age adults who are poor, educational attainment plays a significant role in workforce success. Higher levels of education are associated with higher earnings and more stable employment. In 2015, the largest group of poor working-age adults had a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential. This group accounted for 55.5% of poor working-age adults. Additionally, 25.1% of poor working-age adults did not have a high school diploma, which is more than twice the share in the overall population. Among working-age adults who are poor, those with only a high school diploma continue to represent the largest share. Family living arrangements were more prevalent in the overall population compared to the poor, with 41% of all working-age adults in poverty living outside of a family. In 2015, 41% of working-age adults in poverty lived outside of a family, including those living alone, with cohabiting partners, or other unrelated adults. The poverty status of individuals living with others is based on each person's income, with no pooling of resources assumed. Aged adults are the least likely to be living below the poverty line, accounting for 9.7% of the population in poverty with a poverty rate of 8.8% in 2015. In 2015, aged adults accounted for 9.7% of the population in poverty with a poverty rate of 8.8%. Income from past work, family members, and continued work plays a crucial role in the economic well-being of aged adults. Social Security income is a key source of support for aged persons and their families, with 62.4% of poor aged persons receiving it in 2015. In 2015, Social Security was received by 62.4% of poor aged persons, compared to 86.0% of the total aged population. Retirement, disability, or survivor pensions were received by 48.5% of all aged persons, but only 7.7% of poor aged persons. Earnings from current work were received by 40.7% of aged persons' families, with only 11.0% of families of poor aged persons receiving them. In 2015, most aged adults lived in families with income derived from work, including Social Security or pension income. Even among aged persons who were poor, almost three in four lived in families with work-derived income. A significant portion of aged adults who were poor lived alone. In 2015, half of aged adults in poverty lived alone, a significantly higher rate than the overall aged population. Aged adults in poverty were less likely to be living in families. The report provides basic information about the 43 million Americans below the poverty line in 2015, showing they are a diverse group including children, working-age adults, and aged adults living alone or in families. Certain groups are over-represented among those living in poverty, such as women. The report highlights that certain groups, including women, minorities, children, and individuals living alone or outside of families, are over-represented among those living in poverty. Income from work plays a central role in determining poverty status, with children relying on their parents' or family members' work, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults on past work or the work of those they live with. Despite earnings from work, two-thirds of children in poverty in 2015 came from families with at least one adult earning income. In 2015, over seven out of ten elderly individuals in poverty had some form of work-based income. The complexity of circumstances leading to poverty, both individual and systemic, require further exploration for effective federal policy interventions."
