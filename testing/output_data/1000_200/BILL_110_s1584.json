    "content": "The \"Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007\" redesignates sections and adds new findings and purposes to the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. The Congress finds that in 2007, the Survey of the Coast, established by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, evolved into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, providing services related to surveying, mapping, charting, and water observations. The need to maintain federal expertise in hydrographic data and services is crucial for supporting a safe marine transportation system and promoting international trade. The increasing congestion in the nation's marine transportation system, along with the expected doubling of international maritime commerce in the next 20 years, highlights the importance of this expertise. Nearly half of the cargo transiting U.S. waters consists of oil, refined petroleum products, or other hazardous substances. Nearly half of the cargo transiting U.S. waters is oil, refined petroleum products, or other hazardous substances. Hydrographic data and services support national needs for the Great Lakes, coastal waters, emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, and ocean science advancement. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is the leading civil authority for establishing and maintaining these services. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in cooperation with other agencies, establishes national standards for hydrographic data and services. The Director of the Office of Coast Survey serves as the U.S. National Hydrographer and represents the U.S. internationally. NOAA's expertise supports boundary demarcation and jurisdiction, including the Exclusive Economic Zone. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in cooperation with other agencies, establishes national standards for hydrographic data and services to support safe and efficient international trade and interstate commerce. This includes hydrographic surveys, electronic navigational charts, real-time tide, water level, and current information, shoreline surveys, and geodesy. The purposes of this Act are to augment NOAA's abilities and provide accurate and up-to-date hydrographic data for various benefits. The curr_chunk provides support for homeland security, emergency response, ecosystem management, and coastal resiliency through hydrographic data and services. It also includes applications for storm surge, tsunami, coastal flooding, erosion, and pollution monitoring, as well as habitat restoration and sea-level trend analysis. Additionally, it aims to enhance integrated ocean and coastal mapping and observations through increased coordination and cooperation. The curr_chunk focuses on promoting improved integrated ocean and coastal mapping, supporting research and development in hydrographic data and related technologies, and providing national and international leadership for hydrographic and related services, sciences, and technologies. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to define hydrographic data as information acquired through various surveying methods for providing hydrographic services, and to include the management, maintenance, and dissemination of related information. The Coast and Geodetic Survey Act defines the functions and duties of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, including the production of nautical charts and databases derived from hydrographic data. SEC. 5. CHANGES IN FUNCTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and provide hydrographic services. The Administrator may procure, operate vessels, equipment, and technologies for safe navigation and hydrographic data acquisition. They shall also maintain real-time hydrographic monitoring systems to enhance navigation safety and efficiency. The Administrator may acquire hydrographic data and provide services to support conservation, manage resources, save lives, protect property, and respond to emergencies for homeland security and maritime awareness. The Administrator has the authority to create joint centers, enter contracts, and award contracts for hydrographic data acquisition. SEC. 6 amends Section 305 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 by changing references in subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(2) from \"303(a)(3)\" to \"304(a)(3).\" SEC. 7 involves changes in the Hydrographic Services Review Panel. Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to change references and membership composition of the panel overseeing hydrographic matters. Voting members must be highly qualified in relevant fields, with nonvoting members from specific organizations. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to change references and membership composition of the panel overseeing hydrographic matters. Voting members must be highly qualified in relevant fields and will be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. SEC. 8 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to authorize appropriations of $168,771,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 for carrying out the Act."
