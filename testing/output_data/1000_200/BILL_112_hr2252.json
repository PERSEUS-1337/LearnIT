    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citizens' Self-Defense Act of 2011\". The Congress finds that police are not legally liable for failing to protect individual citizens, as courts have ruled that their duty is only to the public at large. For example, in Warren v. District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, the court stated that municipalities only have a duty to the public, not individual community members. Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith also emphasized this point. In a study, it was found that police often do not respond to calls for help promptly, with a significant number of crimes going unanswered within an hour. As a result, citizens frequently resort to using firearms to defend themselves, with over 2.4 million people in the United States using guns for self-defense annually. Firearms are used 60 times more often to protect honest citizens than to harm them. Out of 2.4 million self-defense cases, over 192,000 are by women defending against sexual abuse. In 92% of cases, citizens only brandish or fire a warning shot to scare off attackers. Less than 8% result in the attacker being killed or wounded. Despite seeking to defend their families, law-abiding citizens using firearms in self-defense are often prosecuted. In 2001, two brothers used firearms to protect their lives and business from burglaries in Reisterstown, Maryland. They shot and killed one burglar and injured two others. The grand jury decided not to press criminal charges against them. In 2001, two brothers in Reisterstown, Maryland, shot and killed 1 burglar and injured 2 others during a burglary. The injured men were charged with burglary, and 2 others were also charged in connection with previous burglaries at the brothers' warehouse. In a similar incident in 2008 in Waukegan, Illinois, a store clerk shot and injured a robber and faced potential criminal charges for not having a firearm owner's identification card. In September 2009, a Lithonia homeowner from Dekalb County, Georgia, was charged with aggravated assault for shooting someone attempting to break into his home. The homeowner did not have a firearm owner's identification card and violated Illinois law by carrying a gun in a place of business. In January 2004, a Wilmette, Illinois homeowner was charged with misdemeanors for owning handguns and violating the village handgun ban ordinance after shooting a home intruder. The resident faced fines for not renewing his firearm owner's identification card. The homeowner confronted and shot an intruder who entered the house twice. The intruder stole the family's car to go to the hospital and was charged with burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. Law-abiding citizens using firearms for self-defense should not be sued by violent felons they defended against. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is protected by law. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is reaffirmed for individuals not prohibited by law. This includes using firearms in defense against imminent serious bodily harm, during a violent felony, or in defense of one's home during a felony. The right to possess firearms for self-defense is protected by law, allowing individuals to bring legal action for damages or relief if this right is violated. The court may award attorney's fees to the prevailing party, and there is a 5-year statute of limitations for such actions. The right to possess firearms for self-defense is protected by law, allowing legal action for damages if violated. The prevailing party may receive attorney's fees, and there is a 5-year statute of limitations for such actions."
