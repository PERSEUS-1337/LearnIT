Federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP, with individual tax revenues also stable at 8.1% of economic output. Payroll tax revenue has increased while excise tax revenue has decreased. The corporate tax revenue has declined over time, currently accounting for 1.3% of GDP. In 1952, it generated 32.1% of federal tax revenue, but now it only contributes 8.9%. Individual and payroll taxes now generate 41.5% and 40.0% of federal revenue, respectively. The decline in corporate tax revenue can be attributed to factors such as tax rate changes and the size of the tax base. The decline in corporate tax revenue can be attributed to factors such as tax rate changes and the size of the tax base. A lower average effective corporate tax rate explains a portion of the decline in revenue, which has decreased from a post-WWII high of 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010. The effective tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, leading to lower corporate tax revenue. This decrease is driven by a reduction in the top statutory rate and changes in the tax base. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased over time due to reductions in the statutory rate, investment tax credits, Section 199 deductions, and changes in depreciation rules. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased over time due to changes in depreciation rules, including the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and temporary enhancements like \"bonus depreciation\" in 2002 and 2009. Other factors such as inflation and foreign tax credits have had small effects on the effective tax rate. The effective corporate tax rate has generally fallen over time due to changes in depreciation rules and temporary enhancements like \"bonus depreciation.\" However, there have been spikes in the average effective tax rate around 2000 and 2007 during recessions when businesses were experiencing losses. This led to businesses carrying back losses to reduce their tax liability and receive tax refunds. The average effective corporate tax rate has decreased over the years, but during recessions, businesses faced higher taxes due to limited carryback periods for losses. Congress extended the carryback period from two to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. Additionally, the decline in corporate tax revenue is also attributed to a shrinking nonfinancial corporate tax base as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations not subject to corporate income tax. Partnerships and S corporations, known as \"pass-throughs,\" have seen an increase in their share of business income in the United States, rising from 4% in 1980 to 45% in 2007. This shift has led to a smaller corporate tax base and a decrease in corporate tax revenues. The shift towards partnerships and S corporations, known as \"pass-throughs,\" has led to a decrease in the corporate tax base and revenues. C corporations decreased from 17% of all businesses in 1980 to 6% in 2007, while S corporations increased in popularity due to tax incentives. By 2007, S corporations represented 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. The shift towards partnerships and S corporations has decreased the corporate tax base and revenues. S corporations now represent 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. Corporate profitability has fallen significantly since 1966, as measured by the profit to asset ratio. Nonfinancial corporate profitability has fallen significantly since 1966, with economists attributing this to changes in profitability rather than tax rates. Potential explanations include a shift to more volatile industries, a change in the age distribution of corporations, and the rise of younger, less profitable firms. Nonfinancial corporate profitability has declined significantly since 1966, attributed to changes in profitability rather than tax rates. Potential reasons include a shift to more volatile industries, a change in the age distribution of firms, and the rise of less profitable younger companies. Factors contributing to lower profits include profit-shifting to lower-tax countries, discrepancies in reported income for tax and financial accounting purposes, and declining corporate tax revenues over the past six decades. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades due to factors such as decreasing effective corporate tax rates, a shift towards pass-through business structures, and falling corporate sector profitability. Understanding these reasons is crucial for the ongoing tax reform debate. The corporate tax base has eroded, leading to a decline in corporate tax revenues. The focus of the tax reform debate is on reducing statutory rates and achieving revenue neutrality by broadening the tax base. Research suggests that reducing the top corporate rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing all corporate tax expenditures and making changes to business taxation. Reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% would involve repealing corporate tax expenditures, changing tax preferences for noncorporate businesses, and implementing other business tax reforms. This could lead to some business activity shifting back to the corporate sector and expanding the tax base. Additionally, reforms to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas may help reduce profit shifting to low-tax countries, further expanding the domestic corporate tax base. The section also explains the calculation of average effective tax rates and provides data sources for the variables used in the calculation. The equation for the average effective tax corporate tax rate calculation (AECTR) includes superscripts for government levels (F for federal, SL for state and local) and a subscript for the year."
