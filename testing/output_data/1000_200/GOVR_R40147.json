    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, particularly related to buildings, have become a major concern in recent decades. Buildings, including residential, commercial, and government structures, are recognized as a significant source of environmental impact due to their construction, operation, and demolition. This impact includes resource depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, and effects on human health. U.S. buildings consume vast amounts of resources annually, especially in terms of electricity for lighting. Buildings in the United States have a significant environmental impact, consuming resources like electricity and water, producing waste, and accounting for 40% of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This results in high environmental and financial costs, costing consumers over $430 billion annually. The location and design of buildings also affect stormwater management and human health. Buildings' impact on stormwater management, energy consumption, and human health is influenced by their location and design. Proximity to public transportation can reduce energy needs, while indoor air quality affects occupant health and productivity. Addressing these issues is crucial for mitigating environmental and health impacts in construction and renovation projects. Green building addresses environmental and health impacts in construction, renovation, and operations of buildings. It has gained significant interest since the 1990s and involves various stakeholders such as construction firms, building owners, lawmakers, and government agencies. This report discusses green building concepts, federal policies, and associated issues. The report discusses green building concepts, federal policies, and associated issues. It covers the definition of green building, environmental impacts it addresses, tools for ensuring compliance, statutory authorities, and federal agency programs related to it. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s, with milestones such as the formation of the Committee on the Environment within the American Institute of Architects. The concept of green building emerged in the 1990s with the formation of the Committee on the Environment within the American Institute of Architects. It has since expanded to encompass environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment, with varying definitions and practices along a continuum. Some practices are criticized as \"greenwashing\" for being purely marketing tools. Green building aims to reduce environmental impacts by implementing integrated design, construction, and operation practices. Examples include zero-impact and minus-impact buildings, with the goal of significantly decreasing the environmental footprint compared to standard practices. The environmental footprint of buildings is the overall impact on the environment, including the human environment. Green building is a relative concept that involves integration across several factors to achieve improvements in environmental performance. It can be applied to any class of building and utilizes techniques like energy-efficient systems and design features to influence occupant behavior. Green building techniques, such as energy-efficient systems and design features to influence occupant behavior, are often decided in the design phase and can impact a building's environmental footprint throughout its lifecycle. The term green building is used interchangeably with sustainable building, with a focus on maintaining environmental footprints. Sustainable building, also known as green building, aims to maintain small environmental footprints to support future human activity and ecosystem functioning. High-performance building, on the other hand, includes factors like security in addition to environmental aspects. Federal statutory definitions outline the integration and optimization of various attributes for high-performance buildings. High-performance buildings focus on energy conservation, environment, safety, security, durability, accessibility, cost-benefit, productivity, sustainability, functionality, and operational considerations. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 defines high-performance green buildings, emphasizing elements like energy, water, materials, waste, and health. Siting, related to transportation, ecology, and smart growth, is also crucial in green building design. The siting element in green building design has gained prominence in recent years, focusing on transportation, ecology, and smart growth. High-performance buildings also prioritize serviceability, productivity, functionality, disaster resilience, and climate resilience. These objectives have become more important due to natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, as well as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown. The goals of green building projects vary based on stakeholders' needs, including expected occupants. Local factors like climate zone and flood risk influence design priorities. Energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, and energy storage technologies are key elements in reducing energy footprint. The importance of energy efficiency in buildings is highlighted, with a focus on utilizing renewable energy sources and energy storage technologies. Federal laws mandate reductions in energy use for federal buildings, with significant potential energy savings from widespread deployment of energy efficiency measures. The energy intensity of federal buildings decreased by over 22% from 2003 to 2015, but consumption in 2015 still exceeded federal goals. While energy is important in green building, focusing solely on energy may not make a building green. Water usage reduction in buildings can lead to cost savings and better water resource management, especially in arid regions or during droughts. Water management in green building involves reducing water usage through measures like reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, wastewater recycling, and landscaping to minimize irrigation needs. It also includes managing rainwater, on-site water, and run-off. Low-impact development aims to mimic natural water handling processes through techniques like using porous materials, green roofs, and holding ponds. These methods, collectively known as green infrastructure, help control stormwater at its source. The choice and use of materials in green building can significantly impact the environmental footprint. Environmentally preferable materials, such as those with recycled content or made from renewable resources, can reduce resource depletion, pollution, and energy usage. These materials are designed to minimize health risks from pollutants like VOCs. However, there is debate over what qualifies as environmentally preferable, due to a lack of consistent vocabulary in describing sustainability. The environmental impacts of a building's waste stream can be reduced through waste-reduction efforts like source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy. Efficient use of materials and recycling can help minimize waste from standard demolition and construction processes. Landscaping can also be planned to reduce chemical pollutants and recycle waste like lawn clippings through mulching. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is crucial for occupant health, with factors like ventilation, air filtration, and materials selection playing key roles in reducing pollutants such as mold, radon, carbon monoxide, asbestos, and VOCs. Efficient waste management practices, including recycling and composting, can help reduce environmental impacts in buildings. Techniques for maintaining high IAQ include adequate ventilation, air filtration, and using materials without toxic substances. Overall IEQ encompasses factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design. Building location can impact environmental footprint, with considerations for transportation access and ecological sensitivity. Building orientation and proximity to vegetation affect heating and cooling requirements. Green building considers factors like building orientation, proximity to vegetation, and climate-related risks. Productivity and utility are important aspects often overlooked. Studies show that green buildings can improve occupant productivity. The influence of IEQ on worker comfort and productivity is significant. Green buildings can enhance productivity, but trade-offs with serviceability can occur. Resilience to hazards like earthquakes and hurricanes can prolong a building's useful life. The focus on resilience in green building design includes practices like resistant construction, on-site power generation, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling. Climate-resilient design aims to prepare for severe weather events and climate change. Green building emphasizes integration across elements and stages to improve performance and minimize environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. The approach in green building design focuses on improving performance and minimizing environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. Integration across elements and stages allows for better assessment of environmental impact and balance among competing goals. The use of information technology in building operations can enhance integration and performance. Energy efficiency in green building design requires a balance between sealing the building envelope for improved efficiency and addressing air exchange to prevent indoor pollutants and mold growth. Active ventilation with heat exchange can help achieve this balance. Prioritizing elements based on cost, feasibility, and occupant priorities is crucial in some cases. Prioritizing elements in green building design is essential due to cost, feasibility, and occupant priorities. Choices made during construction must consider the impact on the entire life cycle of the building. For example, using concrete walls for insulation may have higher carbon emissions than wood. Energy usage during building operation is significant, so planning for post-occupancy is crucial. A green building approach helps assess the impact of actions at each stage. A green building approach can reduce problems by assessing the impact of actions at each stage. Elements like environmentally preferable products and on-site renewable energy generation are interdependent and can affect occupant health and productivity. Systems and tools have been developed to set criteria for green and sustainable buildings, falling into categories like rating systems, certifications, standards, and codes. In the 1990s, professional organizations in the building sector developed rating and certification systems to standardize green building practices. Rating systems assign points to buildings for meeting criteria, with well-known systems like LEED combining both rating and certification. LEED combines rating and certification into a single system, assigning points to buildings for meeting green building design criteria. Certification validates that a building meets specified requirements, with an independent third party conducting the assessment. USGBC's LEED is the most prevalent certification system in the United States. LEED, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), is the most prevalent certification system for green buildings in the United States. It was launched in 1998 as a voluntary, consensus-based system and has become a benchmark for green building design. Over 37,300 commercial buildings worldwide have been certified by LEED as of April 2017. USGBC offers certification for various categories of buildings, including new construction, existing buildings, interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, neighborhoods, and more. Operations and maintenance certification is also available for existing buildings. LEED certification is available for various types of buildings, with a focus on six green building elements. Buildings must meet mandatory requirements and earn a certain number of points to achieve certification levels: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. The system has been criticized for its checklist approach but remains a widely used benchmark for green building design. The LEED rating system, along with other certification systems like BREEAM, assess buildings for green building compliance. LEED offers certification levels from Certified to Platinum based on total score, while BREEAM In-Use is an online system for existing commercial buildings with no prerequisites. LEED v4 was released in 2013, while BREEAM originated in the UK in 1990 and was introduced in the US in 2017. BREEAM In-Use is an online rating system for existing commercial building performance in the United States since 2017. Unlike LEED, it has no prerequisites and offers ratings from Acceptable to Outstanding based on nine impact categories. Certifications must be renewed annually. Green Globes, developed in Canada, is based on BREEAM and awards between one and four Globes based on points earned out of 1000. Green Globes awards between one and four Globes based on points earned out of 1000 across six elements. Like BREEAM In-Use, there are no mandatory provisions for certification. The Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building, Petal, and Zero Energy Building Certification, with criteria falling into seven performance areas. Living Building Certification requires meeting requirements in seven performance areas: water, energy, health, materials, equity, and beauty. Petal Certification needs compliance with at least three of the seven Petals, including water, energy, or materials. Zero Energy Certification entails generating all energy needs on-site without combustion. Certification under the Living Building Challenge includes a 12-month assessment of actual building performance. Different green building ratings systems emphasize various aspects, with suitability depending on local conditions and priorities. Different green building ratings systems emphasize various aspects, with suitability depending on local conditions and priorities. Some programs certify buildings for specific elements like energy efficiency (Energy Star), indoor air quality (Indoor airPLUS), water efficiency (WaterSense), and overall environmental performance (Zero Energy Ready Home, Passive House/ PHIUS+). Federal statutes and policies mandate green building requirements for federal offices, leading to the use of third-party certification systems. Federal statutes and policies require green building standards for federal offices, leading to the use of third-party certification systems. The General Services Administration (GSA) recommends agencies use these systems, which simplify compliance with guidelines, reduce the need for extra staff, and provide a recognizable sustainability label. Some agencies have internal policies for certification under available rating systems. EISA mandated the identification of a third-party certification system by the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense (DOD). The EISA mandated the identification of a third-party certification system by the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense. As of 2013, GSA recommended federal agencies use either LEED or Green Globes for new construction and major renovation projects, aiming for a LEED Silver rating or Two Globes under the Green Globes system. The 2014 Department of Energy rulemaking on green building certification sets minimum criteria for rating systems eligible for federal agency use. Many states and local jurisdictions require green building certification for government and commercial buildings, with some offering incentives. Green building rating systems have influenced model building codes and standards. Building codes are mandatory regulations that specify minimum requirements for building design and construction. They have historically focused on health and safety but can cover various aspects of a building's design. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a baseline for energy efficiency in building codes. State and local jurisdictions may incorporate model codes and standards into mandatory laws. This section discusses comprehensive green building codes and standards that address multiple elements, excluding those solely focused on energy efficiency. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 set a baseline for energy efficiency in building codes. State and local governments can adopt national model codes for regulating buildings. Green building codes add environmental design requirements beyond minimum codes, and can be mandatory or voluntary. Green building model codes can be mandatory or voluntary for meeting green building objectives. Model codes and mandatory building codes incorporate technical standards created by recognized standards development organizations. Some organizations have used the standards-development process to create general green building standards. Buildings meeting a standard may be certified as having met the criteria. Specific requirements in green building codes and standards may be achievable through prescriptive or performance pathways. Green building standards, whether mandatory or voluntary, can be achieved through prescriptive, performance, or outcome-based pathways. These standards are developed through a consensus process involving multiple stakeholders and may be adopted by jurisdictions with or without modifications. Accreditation by organizations like ANSI ensures the credibility of these standards. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredits standards developed through a consensus process involving multiple stakeholders. The International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE are the main developers of national green building codes in the United States. The ICC released the International Green Construction Code (IgCC) in 2012, which includes sustainability measures for the entire construction project and its site. The International Green Construction Code (IgCC) is an overlay code that includes sustainability measures for construction projects and sites. It can be adopted alongside other ICC codes and offers various compliance pathways. The IgCC covers most building types except low-rise residential buildings, which are referred to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard (NGBS). The NGBS is a rating system developed in partnership with ASHRAE and NAHB. Standard 189.1, developed by ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES, is a high-performance green building standard for nonresidential and residential buildings over three stories. It covers site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. Some requirements have been adopted for Department of Defense properties. Standard 189.1, developed by ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES, is a high-performance green building standard for nonresidential and residential buildings over three stories. It covers site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. Elements of Standard 189.1 have been incorporated into the building requirements for Department of Defense properties. In 2015, the ICC and ASHRAE announced a partnership to fully integrate Standard 189.1 into the 2018 version of the IgCC, aligning it with the LEED rating system. Various state, local, and tribal authorities have also developed their own green building codes, and federal laws and policy instruments have provisions related to green building practices. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) requires agencies to procure products with recycled content. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) contained incentives and requirements for energy and water efficiency in buildings. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) included energy and water efficiency requirements for appliances and building materials. State and local policies also influence green building efforts. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) mandated energy and water conservation programs for congressional buildings, a 20% reduction in energy consumption by federal buildings by 2015, promotion of energy-efficient products procurement, establishment of a testbed program for advanced building efficiency, setting energy consumption targets for new federal buildings, and requiring sustainable-design principles for new federal buildings. It also continued funding for DOE's weatherization assistance program and set improvement goals for state energy conservation plans. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) set a goal of 25% improvement in state energy conservation plans by 2012 from a 1990 base. It authorized funding for rebate programs, energy-efficient appliances, public building energy efficiency, and established the Energy Star labeling program. It also set energy and water conservation standards for products and directed agencies to purchase energy-efficient products. EPACT 2005 also set energy-efficiency standards for public housing and directed the Department of Housing and Urban Development to develop an energy strategy. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) provided a legislative framework for federal green building efforts, including energy efficiency standards for appliances and lighting. It also required energy-efficient lighting in GSA leased facilities and mandated adherence to energy efficiency and renewable energy requirements set by the agency. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) mandated energy-efficient lighting in GSA leased facilities and set requirements for energy efficiency and renewable energy in residential, commercial, and federal buildings. It increased funding for DOE's low-income weatherization program and established energy-efficiency standards for manufactured housing. EISA also required DOE to create an Office of Commercial High-Performance Green Buildings to promote green commercial buildings. Buildings to promote green commercial buildings, including zero-net-energy buildings, in partnership with federal and nonfederal entities. EISA increased energy reduction targets for federal buildings, requiring a 30% reduction by 2015 and zero-net energy use by 2030. It also mandated the use of green building certification systems, water conservation guidelines, and stormwater runoff requirements for property development. Agencies must commission new building equipment to operate at design specifications, plan for maintenance, and measure energy and water savings. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) mandated federal agencies to ensure that new building equipment operates at design specifications, plan for maintenance, and measure energy and water savings. It also required the installation of advanced metering devices in federal buildings, regular evaluations of energy and water use, and the use of energy-efficient technologies in GSA facilities. Additionally, the act extended the assessment period for energy costs from 25 to 40 years and mandated that any new major equipment installed must be energy efficient. The Energy Independence and Security Act mandated federal agencies to ensure new building equipment operates efficiently and to use energy-efficient technologies in GSA facilities. It established an Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings to coordinate green building development in the federal sector. The act also included provisions for greening schools, energy-efficiency assistance for public facilities, updated energy-efficiency standards for housing, and green building research projects. Title V of the Energy Independence and Security Act includes energy-efficiency provisions for the U.S. Capitol complex and promotes energy efficiency in executive branch agencies. It authorizes research and development for energy efficiency, provides funding for green building conversions, and supports green retrofits for housing. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated funds for high-performance green buildings and small businesses to improve energy efficiency. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-11) directs GSA to develop model leasing provisions to encourage energy and water efficiency measures in commercial buildings. It also amended EISA to include provisions for improving energy efficiency in tenant spaces. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 directs DOE to study energy efficiency in commercial buildings, collect occupant energy-use information, develop a Tenant Star recognition label, establish energy conservation standards for grid-enabled water heaters, and implement energy efficiency benchmarking requirements for federal agencies leasing space. Additionally, DOE is directed to study the impact of state and local performance benchmarking policies on commercial and multifamily buildings. President Obama signed Executive Order (E.O.) 13693 in 2015, replacing previous orders to enhance federal sustainability efforts. The new targets for federal agencies by FY2025 include reducing building energy intensity by 2.5% annually and potable water consumption intensity by 36%. The order also aims for at least 25% of total building energy to come from renewable sources. The Executive Order 13693, signed by President Obama in 2015, aims to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% annually and potable water consumption intensity by 36% by FY2025. It also targets producing a minimum of 25% of building energy from clean sources and ensuring new buildings achieve net-zero energy and possibly net-zero water or waste by FY2030. The order includes climate-resilient design elements in federal buildings and directs agencies to comply with revised Guiding Principles for Sustainable Buildings. In 2006, federal agencies signed a memorandum of understanding on high performance and sustainable buildings. The Guiding Principles for federal buildings were first established in 2006 and have been revised in 2008 and 2016 to reflect advancements in green building design. Compliance with E.O. 13693 led to an 18% increase in sustainable federal buildings between FY2014 and FY2015, with a goal of achieving compliance in the entire inventory by FY2025. The federal government has issued Guiding Principles for green building design, with revisions in 2008 and 2016 to address a broader set of issues. The government owns or leases about 273,000 buildings in the US, costing nearly $6.1 billion in energy bills. EISA and other policies require federal agencies to implement green building practices. GSA and DOD control three-quarters of federal building floorspace. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages 425 million square feet of space in over 8,500 buildings, requiring LEED certification for new construction and major renovations.

HUD also oversees programs for lead hazard control, healthy homes, and green building impacts. The building industry in the U.S. is a significant part of the economy, with construction and renovation work exceeding $1 trillion in 2016. The market for green building has grown due to government requirements, investment returns, and environmental concerns. In 2005, only 2% of new construction was green building. The percentage of green building in the United States has increased significantly over the years, with green construction spending growing faster than general construction spending. By 2013, green building accounted for 20% of new residential and commercial construction, up from 2% in 2005. Spending on green construction tripled from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014, with projections indicating that green building activities will generate $303.4 billion in GDP between 2015 and 2018. New institutional construction, driven by certification requirements for public buildings and schools, is expected to further boost green building growth. The rise of certified-green floorspace is increasing among existing buildings, with the National Green Building Adoption Index reporting a significant increase in LEED or Energy Star certified office space from 5% in 2005 to 38% in 2016. However, a large portion of U.S. buildings still do not meet green building criteria, making rapid retrofitting or replacement challenging. Green building efforts can impact a building's financial performance by influencing construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The costs of implementing green building measures play a significant role in design and construction decisions, but obtaining accurate cost information can be difficult. The costs of implementing green building measures can impact design and construction decisions, but obtaining accurate cost information can be challenging. Higher perceived initial costs are a top obstacle for green building in the United States, with features like high-efficiency appliances and high-performance windows contributing to these costs. Limited empirical evidence exists on the financial performance of green building investments, as the flexibility in designing individual green buildings makes generalizing about cost performance difficult. Higher costs for green building in the United States can stem from various sources, including more expensive features and design costs. However, a DOE review found that construction costs for green buildings are comparable to conventional buildings. Proponents argue that operational cost savings will offset the initial investment. Green building proponents claim that operational cost savings from reduced utility usage and selling renewable energy back to the grid can offset higher initial investment costs. Studies show green certification is linked to lower utility expenses, but it only accounts for 19% of a building's operating costs. Mixed evidence exists on whether green certification reduces overall operating expenses. Additionally, green-labeled buildings may command price premiums in the real estate market. Certification reduces operating expenses and green-labeled buildings can command price premiums in the real estate market. However, some factors like short-term ownership or leasing can reduce incentives for green building investments. Owners' financial return depends on premium charges to tenants, while tenants' return relies on long-term tenure. Investments by tenants in green building renovations may be limited by constraints on capital availability, especially for significant energy users like educational institutions and hospitals. Cost barriers are decreasing as green building practices become more widespread, with financial incentives from states and municipalities making investments more financially attractive. The \"triple bottom line\" concept in green building considers social and environmental returns along with financial ones. Green building efforts focus on design and construction, but actual environmental performance is crucial. Certification requirements historically did not include post-construction building performance. Certification requirements historically did not include post-construction building performance. Factors like inadequate maintenance, alterations to building controls, and changes in building use can affect the performance of green buildings. It is uncertain if a green building will perform significantly better or worse than a conventional one. Studies evaluating green building performance show that resource-use efficiency may be demonstrated, but savings could be offset by other factors. Green building efforts have helped reduce energy-use intensity in U.S. homes built since 2000, but these homes use more total energy due to their larger size and increased electronic appliances. The energy performance of green buildings has a significant difference between predicted and measured energy use, known as a \"performance gap.\" Closing this gap is a concern for the construction industry, leading to an emphasis on postoccupancy performance assessment by rating system developers. In response to concerns, rating systems like LEED now require building-level energy and water meters for postoccupancy performance assessment. Other systems, such as BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification, include performance parameters in certification criteria. Building codes are also shifting towards outcome-based compliance for energy usage. The 2015 IgCC introduced an outcome-based compliance pathway for energy usage, allowing builders to meet requirements through actual performance. Commissioning building systems can improve environmental performance, especially for energy use, and can be applied to new or existing buildings. Organizations can also develop an environmental management system (EMS) to meet international standards, which require an explicit environmental policy and commitments to improve environmental performance and prevent pollution. Building managers can improve environmental performance by implementing an environmental management system (EMS) with performance measurement tools for early fault detection and resource use analytics. Tools like GSAlink have identified thousands of instances of sub-optimal equipment performance. Studies on green building performance face challenges due to a lack of consensus on criteria. Many studies have attempted to measure and evaluate green building performance, but a lack of consensus on defining criteria and outcomes makes it hard to compare results. Recent studies show mixed evidence on whether green buildings outperform conventional ones, with some falling below design expectations. LEED ratings are primarily used in selected studies, showing that LEED-certified buildings perform 24% better on average than others. A study of energy use by over 100 LEED-certified buildings in the U.S. market found that, on average, they performed 24% better than other buildings. However, about one in seven performed worse than average. Criticisms of the study included sample bias and inappropriate baselines for comparison. Another assessment using the same data concluded that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. A GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most of which had LEED certification, found that, on average, the buildings performed better than the national average in various areas including energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions. Some buildings did perform worse than the national average in certain areas. The study found that many LEED-certified buildings did not meet federal energy consumption requirements, with most consuming more electricity than the national average. This suggests a disconnect between the strategies employed and actual energy performance. The findings from studies on LEED certification do not consistently show reduced building energy consumption. Limited sample sizes and proprietary performance data hinder comprehensive assessments. Improved access to building performance data is crucial for accurate evaluations and enhancing environmental targets for green buildings. Methods for measuring the performance of green buildings are still underdeveloped, with some elements like energy and water use being easier to quantify than others. Disagreements exist on the most relevant metrics, such as energy use intensity (EUI), which can be measured per square foot, per occupant, or based on commuter transportation energy usage. The Advisory Committee proposed two new methodologies for measuring EUI: energy use per occupant and area-based EUI including commuter transportation energy. Building energy use patterns may vary based on the metric used. A study warned that inaccurate occupancy data could complicate calculating occupancy-adjusted EUI. Commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not correlate well with intended outcomes. Regular measurement and adjustment of building performance are crucial for long-term environmental sustainability. The importance of regular measurement and adjustment of building performance for long-term environmental sustainability is emphasized. Federal agencies are required to measure their buildings' performance against specified energy use targets, with more stringent targets for new construction. Challenges exist in determining accurate baseline energy consumption levels and consensus on specific measurement goals or metrics may be lacking. Uncertainties and gaps exist in measuring green building performance, making effective application challenging. Developing appropriate measurement science is a top research need for progress in green building. Federal agencies vary in progress towards meeting green building goals, with challenges in obtaining reliable data. Scorecards were used to track agency progress towards federal sustainability goals in various areas such as GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, fleet petroleum use, and green buildings. The scorecards included numeric reports and color scores (green, yellow, red) to indicate progress status. Green meant on track or met targets, yellow showed some progress, and red indicated lack of progress. Federal progress towards buildings-related goals was discussed. Federal progress towards buildings-related goals is discussed, including the Green Building Goal and Energy Intensity Goal. Some agencies have surpassed the 15% compliance target for green buildings, while others have not met the 30% energy intensity reduction goal set for 2015. E.O. 13693 set a goal for federal facilities to reduce energy intensity by 30% from 2003 levels by 2015, but many agencies did not meet this target. The government-wide energy intensity only declined by 22% during this period. E.O. 13693 now directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015, with progress reported starting from FY2016. Additionally, E.O. 13693 replaced the previous potable water intensity goal with a new goal of a 36% reduction from 2007 levels by 2025. Some agencies have already achieved the earlier goal, while others are making progress towards the new target. Some critics have concerns about green building rating and certification systems, noting that they lack caps on performance metrics like energy use, making sustainability claims relative. They argue for more integrative design criteria and new approaches beyond mere environmental impact mitigation, such as maintenance or enhancement of ecosystem services. Some observers worry that new builders may not appreciate the importance of an integrative approach to green building design, viewing green measures as add-ons rather than integral parts of projects. The limited scientific and technological knowledge base in green building makes it challenging to identify the most appropriate approaches, necessitating substantial research for improvement. Substantial research is needed to improve the knowledge base in green building. Differences in goals and perspectives among proponents can complicate issues. Identifying objective criteria for elements like siting is challenging. Congress may face questions about the effectiveness of federal green building programs and coordination methods. Extending federal efforts to support green building adoption and implementation nationwide and setting priorities are key considerations. Congress could extend federal efforts to support green building adoption and implementation nationwide by prioritizing elements such as siting. To facilitate growth in scientific and technical knowledge, Congress could take actions through appropriations, new statutory requirements, and tax laws. GAO reports have identified numerous federal initiatives related to green building, but few focus on the integrative sense of green building. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified 94 initiatives across 11 agencies related to green building in the nonfederal sector. However, most initiatives focused on specific elements like energy, IEQ, or water, rather than the integrative sense of green building. GAO recommended agencies coordinate to assess initiative performance. Congress should examine federal agencies' implementation of green building programs and their impact on nationwide adoption. Coordination of agency efforts should also be evaluated. Additionally, agencies like the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs support green building practices. In addition to various federal agency programs supporting green building practices, Congress could consider providing stronger incentives, funding rebate programs, and regulatory actions to promote energy efficiency and green building adoption. Considerations may include expanding mortgage and tax incentives, funding specific programs, and addressing regional differences in climate requirements. Congress could consider regulatory actions to enhance current green building efforts in federal agencies, ensuring integration and harmonization across agencies. Energy efficiency is a priority due to concerns about fossil fuel imports, climate change, and inefficient energy use. Given concerns about fossil fuel imports, strategic vulnerability, climate change effects, and inefficient energy use in buildings, Congress should assess the balance of federal green building efforts. It may be necessary to strengthen existing programs or establish new ones. Additionally, Congress should consider if the current incremental approach to green building is sufficient or if modifications or acceleration are needed. R&D funding for green building is supported by federal and private-sector sources, but levels may be inadequate. R&D funding for green building, supported by federal and private-sector sources, may be insufficient to address current needs. Studies show low funding levels for green building in federal nondefense R&D and construction sector investment. Prioritization of R&D funding for different elements of green building varies, with energy being a higher priority. Congress may need to consider modifying funding levels and priorities to incentivize increased investment in green building efforts. Congress may need to consider modifying federal funding levels and priorities to incentivize increased investment in green building efforts, including creating incentives for private-sector R&D funding and ensuring a knowledgeable workforce for construction and operation of green buildings."
