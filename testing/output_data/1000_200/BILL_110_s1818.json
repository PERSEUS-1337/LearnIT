    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act\". It includes findings related to mercury in manufacturing. Congress finds that mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. Approximately 10 percent of women of childbearing age in the United States have mercury in their bloodstreams at levels that could harm their unborn babies. Additionally, around 630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk of neurological issues due to mercury exposure in utero. The main source of mercury exposure in the U.S. is through consuming mercury-contaminated fish. The ultimate solution to mercury pollution is to reduce global mercury use and releases to lower contamination levels in the environment, rather than reducing fish consumption, as uncontaminated fish is a crucial and healthy food source. Mercury pollution is a significant issue globally, with 24,000 to 30,000 tons of mercury used at chlor-alkali plants worldwide. This pollution is transboundary, affecting bodies of water locally and globally. In the United States, only 8 out of 30 chlorine plants still use the outdated mercury cell process, with 5 plants yet to commit to phasing out mercury use. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States has only 10 percent of chlorine and caustic soda production coming from plants using the mercury cell process. Cost-effective alternatives are used in the remaining 90 percent. Other countries like Japan have already banned the mercury cell process due to contamination risks and direct/indirect mercury release from products. Despite the limited use of mercury cell facilities in the chlor-alkali industry in the US, the release of mercury from products is a concern. The industry and the EPA struggle to track mercury disposition and accurately estimate emissions. It is crucial for the US to actively reduce mercury supply, demand, and releases both domestically and internationally. Congress declares the need to develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions in the US, including reducing exposures to mercury for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, there is a focus on reducing mercury releases from existing reservoirs. A new section is added to the Toxic Substances Control Act regarding the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. Effective January 1, 2012, the manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must submit annual reports to the Administrator and the State identifying certain information. Operators of chlor-alkali facilities must submit an annual report to the Administrator and the State, detailing the types and quantities of mercury-containing hazardous and nonhazardous waste generated, the mercury content of the waste, how each waste was managed, and the volume of mercury released into the air or water. The annual report from chlor-alkali facilities must include details on mercury released into the air or water, volume of mercury in equipment, and forms of mercury in products for sale. The Administrator may allow combining and submitting the report to avoid duplication. The Administrator may allow combining the required annual report from chlor-alkali facilities with reports under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Additionally, for chlor-alkali facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, a comprehensive mercury inventory must be conducted within 1 year, considering mercury purchased and used during the facility's life and closure. The Administrator must consider various factors when assessing a chlor-alkali facility's mercury inventory, including the total mercury purchased, remaining in equipment at closure, estimated mercury in waste, and aggregate mercury releases. Records of mercury purchases must be obtained for this assessment. The Administrator must obtain mercury purchase records and other necessary information from chlor-alkali facilities to determine the magnitude and nature of mercury releases into environmental media. An advisory committee called the Mercury Storage Advisory Committee with 9 members is established for this purpose. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members, including 2 appointed by the Speaker of the House and Senate majority leader, 1 as Chairperson and 1 as Vice-Chairperson. Other members include the Administrator, Secretary of Defense, and a representative of State environmental agencies. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members, including representatives from State environmental agencies, State attorneys general, the chlorine industry, the mercury waste treatment industry, and a nonprofit environmental organization. The Administrator appoints the members within 45 days of the section's enactment. The Administrator appoints members of the Committee within 30 days. The Committee must hold an initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. Meetings are called by the Chairperson, and a majority of members constitute a quorum. A report must be submitted to Congress within 1 year of enactment, detailing findings and recommendations on environmental, health, and safety issues. The Committee must submit a report to Congress within 1 year, detailing findings and recommendations on environmental, health, and safety requirements related to preventing the release of elemental mercury and worker exposure. The report should also include the estimated annual cost of storing elemental mercury, optimal size and number of Federal facilities for storage, and the estimated quantity of elemental mercury for a 40-year period. The report to Congress must detail findings and recommendations on preventing elemental mercury release and worker exposure. It should include estimated storage costs, optimal Federal facility size, and quantity of mercury for a 40-year period, including from recycling and export prohibitions. The report to Congress must detail findings and recommendations on preventing elemental mercury release and worker exposure, including estimated storage costs, optimal Federal facility size, and quantity of mercury for a 40-year period. This includes addressing barriers to private sector storage, advantages and disadvantages of consolidating storage, and the optimal plan for storing excess mercury from public and private sources. The Committee will provide recommendations on preventing mercury release and worker exposure, including storage costs, Federal facility size, and long-term disposal options. Members will be compensated at a rate equal to the annual rate of basic pay prescribed for level V of the Executive Schedule. The Committee members will receive compensation at the Executive Schedule rate for their duties, and Federal employees serving on the Committee will not receive additional compensation. Travel expenses, including per diem, will be provided for Committee members. The Committee members shall receive travel expenses, per diem, and funding necessary for their duties. The Committee will terminate 180 days after submitting its report. The Administrator will establish regulations for transfer to storage by July 1, 2008. The Administrator will establish regulations by July 1, 2008 for the transfer and storage of mercury from closed chlor-alkali facilities. Elemental mercury must be transferred to a storage facility by that date. Additionally, a health assessment for operating chlor-alkali facilities must be conducted by July 1, 2009. The Administrator will conduct a health assessment of employees at the chlor-alkali facility in coordination with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. The Administrator may also establish necessary regulations to carry out this section. The Administrator may establish regulations for the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing."
