    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are causing conflict between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage for M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs, affecting benefits and stakeholders. States and local entities play a significant role in M&I water supply development, as recognized in the 1958 Water Supply Act. Development is constrained, with states and local entities having a prominent role in water supply development. The federal government primarily invests in infrastructure for flood control, navigation, irrigation, and multipurpose projects. Congress recognizes state primacy in developing water supplies for various purposes. Investments in water resources infrastructure primarily support flood control, navigation, irrigation, multipurpose dams, and diversion facilities. Federal projects were mainly constructed by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers. Construction of large federal dams has slowed since the 1960s due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Reservoir planning now focuses on operating existing reservoirs and managing for new objectives. In recent decades, reservoir planning has shifted towards balancing objectives for existing reservoirs rather than new projects. The Corps is authorized by Congress to construct dams and water infrastructure, with each dam operated to meet authorized purposes and federal laws. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have M&I storage as an authorized purpose. Congress has also included additional requirements for all Corps projects, such as fish and wildlife protection. The Corps is authorized by Congress to provide M&I water supply through the 1958 WSA and the Flood Control Act of 1944. The focus is on the implementation of the 1958 WSA by the Corps and data on 44 Corps reservoirs. The report focuses on the implementation of the 1958 Water Supply Act by the Corps, providing data on 44 Corps reservoirs with storage reallocated under the Act's discretionary authority. Congress granted the Corps M&I water supply authority in the 1958 WSA, limiting their decision-making without congressional approval. The 1958 Water Supply Act granted the Corps authority for M&I water supply, with limitations on reallocations that affect authorized purposes or cause major operational changes, requiring congressional approval. The Corps developed guidelines for implementation, including criteria for reallocations not needing congressional approval. The Corps adopted provisions for determining reallocation without congressional approval, allowing up to 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet for domestic, municipal, or industrial water supply. Questions arose about Corps' discretionary authority and reservoir reallocations after a federal court decision on operations at Lake Lanier. Several reservoirs have had storage reallocated under the Corps' authority, with attention drawn to a federal court decision regarding operations at Lake Lanier. Lawsuits related to Lake Lanier were consolidated and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in 2007. A 2009 court order addressed whether the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by not seeking congressional approval for changes made in Lake Lanier operations to provide water supply. The court largely agreed with Florida, Alabama, Alabama Power Company, and Southeastern Federal Power Customers, who argued that congressional approval was necessary due to major operational changes that harmed authorized purposes. The court found that the Corps had reallocated over 21% of Lake Lanier's storage without congressional approval since the mid-1970s, totaling roughly 260,000 acre-feet. This reallocation began with operational changes shifting storage from hydropower to municipal and industrial (M&I) supply. The court determined that the Corps exceeded its authority to reallocate, raising concerns about water reallocation at other Corps facilities. The Corps has reallocated water storage at various reservoirs, with 44 reservoirs receiving M&I storage authority from the 1958 WSA. Lake Texoma has seen over 50,000 AF reallocated for M&I use, with 84,099 AF approved in 1985. Other reallocations at Lake Texoma have had specific congressional approval. The Corps reallocated 84,099 AF from hydropower to M&I use at Lake Texoma in 1985 with specific congressional approval. The reallocation did not significantly harm the lake's authorized purposes and did not require significant structural modifications. The transfer was allowed under the 1958 WSA, even though it exceeded the policy limit of 50,000 AF without congressional approval. The reallocation of water supply at Cowanesque Lake represents almost 30% of storage, a mix of project-specific direction from Congress and Corps' discretionary authority under the 1958 WSA. Mentioned in P.L. 99-88 and discussed in H.Rept. 99-236, the reallocation should not seriously affect authorized purposes or result in major changes, as evaluated by the Corps. The 2009 court order questioned the Corps' evaluations related to Lake Lanier operations and the sufficiency of reallocation analyses. Unauthorized withdrawals for M&I uses at Lake Cumberland have not been authorized or stopped. The extent of unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at other Corps facilities is largely unknown. The 2009 court order raised concerns about the Corps' operations at Lake Lanier for M&I water supply. Unauthorized withdrawals for M&I uses at other Corps facilities are largely unknown. Operations at Corps dams have evolved over time, with reallocations often occurring without national attention or litigation. The Corps' discretionary authority for reallocations under the 1958 WSA is a policy issue of relevance, especially for M&I reallocation at federal facilities. Questions arise regarding the interpretation of this authority, handling multiple reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, and unauthorized withdrawals. Current policies reflect numerous decisions and tradeoffs. The Corps' discretionary authority for reallocations under the 1958 WSA is a policy issue of relevance, especially for M&I reallocation at federal facilities. Questions arise regarding interpretation of this authority, handling multiple reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, and unauthorized withdrawals. Current policies reflect decisions and tradeoffs that may need reexamination as more reallocations are requested, including considerations on transition, stakeholder impacts, charging for storage space, and crediting return flows. These issues are part of broader water policy questions for Congress, such as the federal role in municipal water supply and potential impacts of climate change on water resources. The federal role in municipal water supply is a complex issue, especially in the face of potential climate change effects like extended drought. Current water infrastructure operations, laws, and institutions may need reexamination to address national interests and challenges. However, enacting changes to federal facilities is difficult due to differing opinions and the impact on various constituencies."
