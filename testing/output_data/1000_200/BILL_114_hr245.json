It includes provisions for submitting informal claims and requests for increase or reopening of claims. Additionally, Section 5110 is amended to specify effective dates for applications. In determining the date of receipt of an application for benefits, the Secretary considers an informal communication as the filing date if the necessary application forms are submitted within 180 days. If forms are not submitted within 180 days, the completed application form date is considered the filing date. The Secretary considers the application filed on the date the completed form is submitted. Additionally, the Secretary will address and adjudicate reasonably raised claims that arise during the claims process. The amendments made by this Act regarding the treatment of reasonably raised claims will be effective on the date of enactment and apply to claims submitted on or after that date."
