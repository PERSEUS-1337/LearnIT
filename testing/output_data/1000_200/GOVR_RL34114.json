Congress has three formal methods to combat noncompliance, including the inherent contempt power to detain and imprison a contemnor until compliance is achieved. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to detain and imprison a contemnor until compliance with a subpoena is achieved, encouraging compliance. The criminal contempt statute permits Congress to refer a contempt citation for criminal prosecution, serving as punishment but not necessarily encouraging compliance. Congress can also seek judicial enforcement of a subpoena through the courts. Congress may rely on the judicial branch to enforce a congressional subpoena by seeking a civil judgment from a federal court. If the court finds noncompliance, the party may be held in contempt of court. Civil enforcement may be necessary for compliance, especially with executive branch officials. This report examines Congress's contempt power, procedures for inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement of subpoenas, and the challenges in enforcing contempt against executive branch officials. The power of Congress to enforce contempt actions against executive branch officials is discussed in relation to its authority to investigate and obtain information. Congress's contempt power is essential for its legislative function and can be enforced through civil judgments from federal courts. The challenges in enforcing contempt against executive branch officials are examined in this report. The Supreme Court has firmly established that Congress's power to seek and enforce informational demands is essential to its legislative function. This authority was established in two Supreme Court rulings from the 1920s Teapot Dome scandal. In McGrain v. Daugherty, the Court described the power of inquiry as necessary for effective legislation when Congress lacks the necessary information. The power of inquiry is essential for Congress to effectively legislate, as it often lacks the necessary information. Compulsion is needed to obtain accurate and complete information, as voluntary requests are often unavailing. This power was regarded as necessary and appropriate when the Constitution was framed, allowing the legislative function to be effectively exercised. The Supreme Court upheld a witness's conviction for contempt of Congress in Sinclair v. United States, despite the witness refusing to answer questions citing a pending lawsuit. The Court rejected the argument that the lawsuits provided an excuse for withholding information, emphasizing Congress's power to investigate. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that Congress can require disclosures to aid its own constitutional power, even if the information may also be useful in pending lawsuits. This authority is as far-reaching as Congress's power to enact and appropriate funds. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's extensive investigative authority, stating that it can demand disclosures to support its constitutional power, including probing into government departments for corruption, inefficiency, or waste. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's investigative power to probe government departments for corruption, inefficiency, or waste, recognizing the importance of uncovering maladministration. Congress's inherent contempt power, necessary for effective investigation and legislation, was upheld in early Supreme Court decisions. The inherent contempt power allows individuals to be brought before Congress, tried, and potentially imprisoned for non-compliance. This power was upheld in Supreme Court decisions such as Anderson v. Dunn and McGrain v. Daugherty. The purpose of imprisonment can be punitive or coercive, with the option for release upon compliance. In 1818, Anderson, a non-Member, was accused of bribery by a Member of the House of Representatives. The House resolution led to Anderson's arrest, granting him counsel and defense witnesses. After a guilty finding, the Speaker reprimanded and discharged him. The House found a non-Member guilty of contempt in 1818, leading to his arrest and granting him counsel and defense witnesses. The process included attachment by the Sergeant-at-Arms, appearance before the bar, specification of charges, identification of the accuser, compulsory process, counsel, a hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of penalty. Judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus could be sought, focusing on whether the House acted within its jurisdiction and if due process standards were met. The House's contempt proceedings in 1818 involved granting the accused counsel and defense witnesses, with a process that included attachment, charges, accuser identification, compulsory process, a hearing, guilt determination, and penalty imposition. Judicial review via habeas corpus could be pursued to ensure jurisdiction adherence and due process standards. Inherent contempt precedents often led to incarceration, but fines could be an alternative to avoid habeas corpus challenges. Inherent contempt proceedings in Congress could potentially involve imposing fines instead of incarceration, drawing on the courts' authority to fine for contemptuous behavior. This argument finds support in dicta from a 1821 Supreme Court decision questioning the extent of punishing power of legislative bodies. In Kilbourn v. Thompson, the Court suggested that Congress may compel testimony in investigations similar to a court of justice. Punishment for contempt of Congress may include fines, but only if the testimony is required in a matter within Congress's jurisdiction. The House has the power to conduct inherent contempt proceedings, allowing it to cite offenders for contempt without needing assistance from other branches. While fines for contempt of Congress are possible, there is no precedent for Congress imposing them. The contemnor can seek limited judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus, but inherent contempt has its limitations. The inherent contempt process allows Congress to cite offenders for contempt without outside assistance, but it has limitations. Imprisonment can only last until the end of the current session of Congress, and the process is seen as outdated and ineffective. It has not been used since 1935, and holding initial fact-finding before a special committee could streamline proceedings. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by the House and Senate, with 8 considered successful in meting out punishment, obtaining testimony, or producing documents. However, these proceedings were seen as time-consuming, cumbersome, and sometimes ineffective due to the trial at the bar of the chamber concerned. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as an alternative to the inherent contempt procedure, allowing for judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States Attorney. Despite a criminal contempt referral in 1858, most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the house rather than through the criminal contempt method. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as an alternative to the inherent contempt procedure. Most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the house rather than through the criminal contempt method. Today, the statutory provisions are codified as 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194, outlining penalties for failing to testify or produce documents when summoned as a witness. The procedure outlined in U.S.C. Section 194 for referring a recalcitrant witness to the courts for criminal prosecution involves committee approval, reading the committee report on the floor, House approval of a resolution authorizing the Speaker to certify the report to the U.S. Attorney, and certification by the Speaker to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution. This process is punitive and aims to deter similar conduct in the future. The procedure for referring a recalcitrant witness to the courts for criminal prosecution is punitive in nature, aiming to deter similar conduct in the future. Once a witness is voted in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate with the committee. In some cases, compliance with subpoenas after contempt citations have been voted may result in the House not pursuing further proceedings. Contempt citations were voted before referral to grand juries. It is unclear if the U.S. Attorney's duty to present contempt to the grand jury is mandatory or discretionary. Case law provides conflicting guidance, as seen in Ex parte Frankfeld where witnesses were released due to procedural errors. The court ordered the release of witnesses due to procedural errors in Ex parte Frankfeld. Congress prescribed a mandatory procedure for dealing with uncooperative witnesses, requiring certification of facts to the district attorney. The court mandated the submission of facts to the district attorney regarding uncooperative witnesses, leaving no discretion. The U.S. Attorney is then obligated to present the case to the grand jury. The court ruled that the Speaker's certification of contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory. This discretion is exercised when Congress is not in session, and failure to do so can result in reversals of convictions, as seen in the Wilson case. The court ruled that the U.S. Attorney's function may be discretionary, not mandatory, similar to the Speaker's duty. U.S. Attorneys typically have broad prosecutorial discretion, even with mandatory language in statutes. Congress can turn to the judicial branch for enforcement of a congressional subpoena through civil enforcement, where a court can declare compliance with the subpoena as legally obligatory. The district court can issue an order for compliance with a congressional subpoena, leading to contempt of court if not followed. The House has pursued civil enforcement through authorizing resolutions, while the Senate has a specific civil enforcement procedure. This procedure allows the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to enforce, validate, or prevent noncompliance with a subpoena. The District of Columbia has jurisdiction over civil actions to enforce, secure declaratory judgments, or prevent noncompliance with subpoenas or orders issued by the Senate or its committees. The Senate may seek compliance directly or first seek a declaration of validity before court enforcement. The decision to use a two-step enforcement process is at the Senate's discretion. The court's jurisdiction in enforcing a congressional subpoena is limited to reviewing its validity. If the subpoena does not meet legal standards, the court cannot enjoin the congressional proceeding but can refuse to order compliance. Compliance may lead to a trial if the individual still refuses to comply. The court can order compliance with a subpoena, and if the individual still refuses, they may face contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when it comes to subpoenas issued to federal government officers. The House of Representatives can authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement to compel compliance with a subpoena, as seen in the 2008 case involving Harriet Miers. In 2008, the House Judiciary Committee sought civil enforcement of a subpoena against Harriet Miers, marking the first attempt to do so solely by resolution of a single house. The federal courts' jurisdiction over such claims was clarified in the case of Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers. In 2012, the House authorized another committee to enforce a subpoena in federal court. In 2012, the House authorized a congressional committee to pursue civil action in federal court to enforce a subpoena against an executive branch official. The lawsuit was filed on August 13, 2012, seeking compliance with the subpoenas. The court rejected the Department of Justice's motion to dismiss on jurisdictional and justiciability grounds on September 30, 2013. The court rejected the Department of Justice's motion to dismiss based on jurisdictional and justiciability arguments. The court has denied motions for summary judgment from both parties and ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents. The court has yet to reach the merits of the executive privilege question. Following previous cases, House committees can seek civil enforcement of subpoenas with authorization from the full House. Authorization for civil enforcement of subpoenas or orders by private counsel must be granted by resolution of the full House. Without this authorization, courts will not entertain civil motions on behalf of Congress or its committees. While some argue that jurisdiction requires a measure passed by both houses and signed by the President, it seems that an authorizing resolution by the House could allow for civil enforcement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Department of Justice acknowledges that properly authorized procedures are preferred for enforcing subpoenas against executive officials, but the executive branch maintains that Congress cannot. The executive branch prefers civil enforcement over inherent or criminal contempt procedures when enforcing a subpoena against an executive official. The Department of Justice has directed U.S. Attorneys not to pursue criminal contempt prosecutions in such cases. This stance is supported by legal opinions from the mid-1980s and past actions in contempt proceedings. The DOJ has declined to prosecute officials in contempt proceedings, leading Congress to rely on civil enforcement for subpoenas. The 2014 IRS controversy with Lois Lerner suggests a shift in the executive branch's stance on criminal contempt for executive officials. The House held IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt for refusing to testify about the IRS targeting politically active conservative groups. Despite the House's approval, the DOJ has not pursued a criminal case against Lerner. The House approved a contempt citation against Lois Lerner for refusing to testify about the IRS targeting conservative groups. The DOJ has not taken action to pursue a criminal case against Lerner, citing her personal Fifth Amendment privilege as the reason for noncompliance with the committee subpoena. Unlike past cases involving executive privilege, this dispute does not involve such privileges but rather Lerner's constitutional right against self-incrimination. The DOJ's decision not to prosecute for contempt of Congress in this case extends beyond past controversies. The DOJ's exercise of prosecutorial discretion in not pursuing a criminal contempt charge against executive branch officials extends beyond cases involving executive privilege. Congress faces obstacles in enforcing subpoenas through criminal contempt, especially when the President endorses noncompliance. The lessons from past disputes suggest that punishing officials for noncompliance may be difficult in many circumstances. The DOJ may not prosecute executive branch officials for criminal contempt if the President endorses their noncompliance, citing prosecutorial discretion. However, in cases where the President does not endorse the official's actions, such as ignoring a congressional subpoena for personal reasons, criminal contempt could still be used to punish officials, even though the executive branch may choose not to prosecute. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute officials for criminal contempt, even if the President does not endorse their actions. Congress can enforce its subpoenas through civil action, but this may not adequately protect congressional prerogatives due to delays in obtaining a final ruling. This was evident in the Miers case, where a favorable decision was received but could not be enforced before the end of the Bush Administration. The Miers litigation, which never reached a decision on the merits by the D.C. Circuit, was dismissed at the request of the parties after approximately 19 months. The committee gained access to information the Bush Administration had refused to disclose, but the change in administrations and the passage of time diminished their ability to effectively utilize it for oversight. Congress may not be able to rely on the executive branch to enforce subpoenas directed at executive branch officials. Congress may not always be able to rely on the executive branch to enforce subpoenas directed at executive branch officials. In such situations, Congress can exercise its own constitutionally based authorities to enforce a subpoena through inherent contempt, as civil enforcement may not always lead to a prompt resolution of the dispute."
