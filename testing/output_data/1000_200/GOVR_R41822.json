    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering proposals to limit government risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. In 2008, their capital proved inadequate due to increased mortgage defaults and borrowing costs. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury purchased over $175 billion of special preferred stock to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Treasury and the Federal Reserve also bought nearly $1.4 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. Bills introduced in Congress may reduce the enterprises' future size by eliminating certain advantages. Some bills introduced in Congress may reduce the future size of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by increasing their costs of doing business, imposing new limitations on the types of mortgages they can purchase, and increasing regulatory oversight and disclosure. These changes could potentially allow other securitizers to compete more effectively with the enterprises. Some bills in Congress aim to increase regulatory oversight and disclosure for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with proposing higher capital requirements to reduce risks. Other legislative proposals include setting deadlines for the enterprises to return to stockholder control or be dissolved, as well as making provisions for replacing them in the secondary mortgage markets. Some legislative proposals aim to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the secondary mortgage markets due to their financial difficulties. In 2008, they entered voluntary conservatorship under the FHFA, with the Treasury providing financial support to keep them solvent. Homeowners rely on them for mortgage money. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac indirectly support homeowners by purchasing mortgages from lenders and packaging them into MBS. They back almost half of the nation's home mortgages and provide a guarantee for loan repayment. The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of the enterprises and the housing finance system. The Obama Administration presented three alternatives for the future of the housing finance system, including a system with targeted government mortgage programs, a privatized system with government guarantee during crises, and a privatized system with government reinsurance of private mortgage insurance. No legislation has been introduced to implement these proposals yet. H.R. 31, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, would require the director of FHFA to make quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 12 specific areas, including total liabilities, executive compensation, foreclosure mitigation efforts, and mortgage fraud prevention efforts. The bill, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, mandates quarterly reports by the FHFA director on various aspects including foreclosure mitigation, mortgage fraud prevention, enterprise investments, capital levels, underwriting standards, and mortgage buyback policies. The reports will be reviewed by the FHFA inspector general and shared with Congress, with all information posted on the FHFA website. The bill requires quarterly reports by the FHFA director on foreclosure mitigation, mortgage fraud prevention, investments, capital levels, underwriting standards, and mortgage buyback policies. The reports will be reviewed by the FHFA inspector general and shared with Congress, with all information posted on the FHFA website. The IG will also examine FHFA's loss mitigation policies, including the impact of principal reduction on financial condition and foreclosure rates. There is some overlap with current reporting requirements, such as the FHFA's quarterly Report on Financial Performance and monthly Foreclosure Prevention and Refinance Report. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up H.R. 31 in 2011, emphasizing oversight importance. H.R. 463 aims to subject Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to FOIA requests. H.R. 1221 seeks to limit executive pay at the enterprises. No action has been taken on H.R. 463. The bill aims to suspend compensation packages approved by FHFA and requires excess pay in 2010 to be turned over to the Treasury. Executive salaries would be based on profitability, with a maximum pay of $155,500 in 2011. The enterprises would be covered by TARP provisions on executive compensation and corporate governance. FHFA currently has the authority to reject salaries, but the bill would remove this power. The bill would remove FHFA's discretion in rejecting enterprise salaries. H.R. 1222, GSE Subsidy Elimination Act of 2011, aims to require enterprises to charge guarantee fees reflecting mortgage risk and capital costs. FHFA could phase in higher fees over two years or impose them at a higher level after two years. H.R. 1223, GSE Credit Risk Equitable Treatment Act of 2011, aims to prohibit differential treatment of mortgage-backed securities issued by enterprises. Regulatory determinations on low-risk mortgages would align with Dodd-Frank requirements. FHFA's authority as conservator or receiver includes implementing these provisions. The Dodd-Frank Act requires joint regulations to implement risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS. QRMs would be exempt from this requirement. H.R. 1223 aims to prohibit differential treatment of MBS issued by enterprises. Scott G. Alvarez testified that Dodd-Frank does not exempt enterprises from the risk retention requirement. The Federal Reserve's general counsel testified that Dodd-Frank does not exempt enterprises from the risk retention requirement for MBS. The proposed rules would allow the enterprises' guarantees to satisfy the risk retention requirements only if they were in conservatorship or receivership. H.R. 1224, GSE Portfolio Risk Reduction Act of 2011, would require the enterprises to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over five years. Fannie Mae's portfolio was $789 billion and Freddie Mac's was $697 billion at the end of 2010. The financial support agreements between Treasury and the GSEs require reducing mortgage portfolios to stay within a cap that decreases annually, reaching $250 billion in 2022. Bills H.R. 1224, H.R. 1182, and S. 693 aim to reduce portfolios over five years, while H.R. 408 and S. 178 propose a four-year reduction. H.R. 1224 excludes delinquent mortgages repurchased to fulfill guarantees from portfolio limits. FHFA could order enterprises to reduce risk. The Committee on Financial Services marked up H.R. 1224 and H.R. 1225, which would require enterprises to request permission from the Secretary of the Treasury to issue new debt. FHFA could order enterprises to reduce risk by reducing portfolios more rapidly. H.R. 1225 was forwarded to the full committee, giving the Secretary of the Treasury authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The authority was previously used to control debt issuance but fell out of practice. H.R. 1226 aims to repeal affordable housing goals set by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. The Improvement Act, H.R. 1226, would repeal affordable housing goals set by previous acts and eliminate funding for housing trust and capital magnet funds. FHFA must report to Congress on the bill's impact on multifamily properties, loans to low-income and rural borrowers, with recommendations to increase mortgage credit. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets forwarded H.R. 1226 to the full committee for consideration. If the housing goals are not repealed, enterprises must continue to meet them. H.R. 1226 was marked up by the Committee on Financial Services and forwarded to the full committee. H.R. 1227, the GSE Risk and Activities Limitation Act of 2011, would restrict FHFA from approving new products while enterprises are in conservatorship or receivership. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets also marked up H.R. 1227 and sent it to the full committee for consideration. FHFA could announce a new policy to restrict new product approvals while the GSEs are in conservatorship. H.R. 2425 would prohibit Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae from dealing with mortgages registered with MERS. MERS is facing legal challenges regarding its authority in foreclosures and ownership history. Some employment contracts between enterprises and employees cover legal expenses. H.R. 2428 would require enterprises to propose legal fee reductions to FHFA. H.R. 2428, GSE Legal Fee Reduction Act of 2011, would require enterprises to propose a methodology for determining \"reasonable\" legal expenses for employees. H.R. 2436, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Taxpayer Payback Act of 2011, aims to prevent a reduction in dividend rates paid to Treasury. H.R. 2439, Removing GSEs Charters During Receivership Act of 2011, would give FHFA the power to revoke an enterprise's charter. H.R. 2441, Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011, would eliminate the Housing Trust Fund. H.R. 2441, Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011, aims to terminate the Housing Trust Fund, Capital Magnet Fund, and Hope Reserve Fund established by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The enterprises' financial conditions prevented contributions, but $80 million was allocated in the FY2010 budget for the Capital Magnet Fund. H.R. 2440, Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2011, directs FHFA to identify non-mission critical assets held by the enterprises, such as patents and mortgage data, and submit a plan to sell them to Congress. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would also be required to release loan and appraisal data in a non-disclosing manner. H.R. 2462, Cap the GSE Bailout Act of 2011, would set a maximum amount of support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. The Treasury initially limited support to $100 billion for each enterprise, later raised to $200 billion each. Amendments allowed for unlimited support in 2010-2012, with the $200 billion limits applying outside of those years. FHFA would have the authority to provide additional financial support if the private secondary mortgage market was not viable. In late 2009, the PSPA was amended to provide unlimited support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2010-2012, with $200 billion limits outside of those years. Several companion bills were introduced in Congress with different provisions for the enterprises, including bills to replace them. H.R. 408 and S. 178, titled the Spending Reduction Act of 2011, address various issues beyond Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform. The Spending Reduction Act of 2011, including the GSE Bailout Elimination and Taxpayer Protection Act, aims to terminate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conservatorships within 24 months. After leaving conservatorship, the enterprises would need to reduce their portfolios to $250 billion each over four years. Additionally, they would no longer have housing goals. H.R. 1224 proposes a five-year plan starting one year after enactment, removing housing goals for enterprises similar to H.R. 1226. Provisions in H.R. 408 and S. 178, such as leaving conservatorship 24-30 months after enactment, returning to stockholder control or dissolution under receivership, and a 10-year wind-down period followed by dissolution, are not included. FHFA would have strengthened authority to set and enforce minimum capital levels. The proposed legislation includes provisions for FHFA to set and enforce minimum capital levels, establish a nationwide conforming loan limit of $417,000 with no high-cost exceptions, and restrict the enterprises from purchasing mortgages above the area median home price. Additionally, the minimum downpayment for mortgages purchased would be 5% in the first 12 months after leaving conservatorship, increasing to 7.5% in the second 12 months and 10% thereafter. The proposed legislation includes provisions for FHFA to enforce minimum capital levels, establish a nationwide conforming loan limit of $417,000, and restrict enterprises from purchasing mortgages above the area median home price. The minimum downpayment for mortgages would be 5% in the first 12 months after leaving conservatorship, increasing to 7.5% in the second 12 months and 10% thereafter. Additionally, the enterprises would be required to pay all state and local taxes, register stocks with the SEC, and be charged for government benefits. H.R. 1182 and S. 693 propose changes to the enterprises' portfolios, guarantee fee increase, and affordable housing goals. They also aim to end conservatorship in 24 months, phase out charters for new business, and repeal SEC registration exemptions for MBS and subordinated. H.R. 1859, Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011, proposes various changes including increasing the minimum capital required for enterprises, increasing borrower downpayment requirements, and requiring enterprises to pay all state and local taxes. Additionally, the bill authorizes FHFA to charter housing finance guaranty associations for pooling and securitizing mortgages. H.R. 1859, Housing Finance Reform Act of 2011, authorizes FHFA to charter housing finance guaranty associations to pool and securitize single-family and multifamily mortgages. Associations would guarantee timely payments to investors with a backup guarantee from the federal government. They would specialize in specific markets and have a maximum mortgage size based on national and area median prices. The proposed changes include lowering the mortgage limit to $256,000, with higher limits in Honolulu and San Jose. Mortgages can only be purchased with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or less, unless certain conditions are met. FHFA would regulate housing finance associations and could wind down enterprises as new associations are chartered. During the transition, enterprises would not have affordable housing goals and would be required to pay state and local taxes. H.R. 2413, the Secondary Market Facility for Residential Mortgages Act of 2011, proposes creating a federal corporation to purchase and securitize mortgages meeting specific underwriting standards. The corporation would charge guarantee and reinsurance fees, adjusted to maintain market share below 50%. Guarantee fees aim to cover mortgage payments during normal times, while reinsurance fees compensate Treasury for federal guarantees. Eligible mortgages would be based on quality, not location or volume provided by the seller. The proposed federal corporation would purchase and securitize mortgages meeting specific underwriting standards. Mortgages eligible for purchase would be for 30 years or less, be for no more than 80% of the sales price of the house (or 90% with seller participation or private mortgage insurance), with a maximum size based on a formula used in FY2011. FHFA would oversee the facility."
