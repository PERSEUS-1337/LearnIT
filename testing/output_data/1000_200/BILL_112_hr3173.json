FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds that nearly 2,600 marine facilities and 13,000 US-flag vessels require workers to carry a TWIC under the MTSA. Over two million transportation workers have applied for a TWIC, costing $132.50 and requiring multiple trips to an enrollment center.\" The TWIC enrollment process requires workers to make multiple trips to an enrollment center, costing $132.50 for a card valid for five years. This process is not mandated by statute or regulation but is driven by a DHS policy decision. The TWIC enrollment process aligns with FIPS-201 standards but may deviate when necessary. Unlike other government credentials, TWIC serves as a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce. The TWIC is a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce and does not grant unescorted access to secure areas without authorization. DHS has the authority to develop a more convenient enrollment process, unlike other government-issued documents like passports. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC issuance. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC biometric readers, which has not been issued as of August 2010. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC biometric readers, which has not been issued as of August 2010. It is urgent that the TWIC application process be reformed by the end of 2012 to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens. The Secretary of Homeland Security should deploy TWIC readers promptly for security purposes. Funds awarded for TWIC projects should not expire before the issuance of the final TWIC reader rule. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) application process will be reformed to require only one in-person visit to an enrollment center within 90 days of the enactment of the Act."
