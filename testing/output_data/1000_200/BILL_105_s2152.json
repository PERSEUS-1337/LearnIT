    "content": "The Act titled \"Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998\" is established for the purpose of providing microcredit opportunities. Congress finds that over 1 billion people in the developing world live in severe poverty, with high child mortality rates and preventable deaths from malnutrition and disease. Women in poverty face greater workloads and fewer opportunities than men, but aiding the poorest, especially women, can positively impact family incomes, child nutrition, health, and education. The poor in the developing world, especially women, lack stable employment and social safety nets, leading many to turn to self-employment. However, they struggle to access credit at reasonable rates, often resorting to high-interest money lenders. An international Microcredit Summit in 1997 aimed to expand access to credit for self-employment and financial inclusion. The Microcredit Summit in Washington, D.C., aimed to provide credit and financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families, particularly women, by 2005. This initiative would help nearly half of the world's 1 billion absolute poor by enabling them to expand their incomes and businesses through access to affordable loans. Nongovernmental organizations like the Grameen Bank and Accion International play a crucial role in developing sustainable microcredit programs to empower the poor in fighting hunger and poverty. Microcredit institutions like the Grameen Bank and Accion International have successfully lent to the very poor, with high repayment rates. They not only reduce poverty but also decrease dependency on foreign assistance by generating interest income to cover costs. These institutions leverage resources by recycling loans, providing credit, training, and mobilizing for sustainable development. The development of sustainable microcredit institutions is crucial for poverty reduction and economic development. In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative with increased funding, aiming to support programs providing credit to the poorest. However, funding for microenterprise activities decreased in fiscal year 1996, with only a small portion benefiting the poorest with loans under $300. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial to achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999. Providing the United States share of the global investment needed for the Summit's goal will require a modest increase in funding for international microcredit programs, with a focus on institutions serving the poorest. To reach millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is important to expand successful microcredit institutions and help them access capital. PVOs and NGOs have shown expertise in developing networks of local microcredit institutions for the very poor. AID should prioritize investing in these organizations. AID should prioritize investing in PVOs and NGOs to expand successful microcredit institutions globally and lead efforts to support microenterprise for the poorest. Coordination of efforts at the operational level is crucial to promote best practices in providing financial services to the poor. The Act aims to continue and expand AID's commitment to developing microcredit institutions, making microenterprise development a key part of AID's economic growth strategy, supporting US PVOs and NGOs to provide financial services to microentrepreneurs, and increasing assistance for providing credit to the poorest, especially women in developing countries. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"AID\" refers to the United States Agency for International Development. The terms \"microcredit\", \"microenterprise\", \"poverty lending portion of mixed programs\", and \"mixed programs\" are defined under the 1994 Microenterprise Initiative of AID. \"PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations\" include private voluntary organizations and international, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations active in the region or country of the project. International, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations active in the region or country of the project, with the capacity to develop and implement microenterprise programs for the poor, especially women. SEC. 4. MICROENTERPRISE ASSISTANCE. The President, through the Administrator of AID, is authorized to establish programs for microenterprise assistance in developing countries. Programs will be carried out by US PVOs and other organizations. Eligibility criteria will be set by the Administrator of AID to determine eligible entities for carrying out the purposes described. Eligibility criteria for microenterprise assistance programs include lack of access to formal financial sector, serving the poorest people, focus on working with poor women, and a plan for financial self-reliance. $160,000,000 of funds for fiscal year 1999 will be used for these programs. In fiscal year 1999, $160,000,000 of funds will be used for microenterprise assistance programs, with additional funds allocated for poverty lending and support of NGOs. In fiscal year 1999, $160,000,000 will be used for microenterprise assistance programs, with additional funds allocated for poverty lending and support of NGOs. Not less than $35,000,000 will be provided for United States PVOs and nongovernmental organizations, and $10,000,000 for the private voluntary organizations matching grant program. The term \"to support poverty lending\" refers to funds lent to the poverty target population in low-income countries, amounting to $300 or less in 1997 US dollars, and funds used for institutional development of entities engaged in making small loans to the poverty target population. The term \"poverty target population\" refers to the poorest 50% of individuals living below the poverty line in a foreign country, as defined by the national government. This includes funds lent to this population in low-income countries and funds used for institutional development of entities making small loans to them. SEC. 5. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. The Administrator of AID is required to strengthen mechanisms for microenterprise programs and develop mechanisms for targeting microcredit to the poorest population. A monitoring system must be established to measure the performance of assistance programs under section 4. The Administrator of AID must establish performance systems to measure project goals and provide recommendations for enhancing assistance to the very poor, especially women. Additional monitoring requirements include tracking microenterprise credit amounts and loans to the poverty target population. The Administrator of AID must monitor funding allocated to organizations providing loans under $300 to the poverty target population. They are required to report annually to Congress on progress towards expanding access to credit for the world's poorest families, especially women. Additionally, a summary of collected information must be included in AID's annual presentation to Congress."
