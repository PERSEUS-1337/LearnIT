    "content": "The Act titled \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\" is established for the purpose of enhancing local energy supply and resiliency. Congress finds that a significant amount of energy in the United States is released as waste heat from power plants, industrial facilities, and buildings. This waste heat can be recovered and used for heating, cooling, or converted into electricity. Renewable energy resources in communities in the United States can be used to meet local thermal and electric energy requirements, strengthening energy supplies' reliability and resiliency. Utilizing local waste heat and renewable energy resources enhances industrial competitiveness, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and decreases emissions of air pollution and carbon dioxide. District energy systems offer various benefits such as reducing emissions, increasing energy supply resiliency, keeping energy dollars local, tapping waste heat and renewable energy resources, expanding combined heat and power systems, serving various institutions and areas, and helping cut peak power demand. District energy systems help cut peak power demand and reduce power transmission and distribution system constraints by shifting power demand through thermal storage, generating power near load centers with a CHP system, and meeting air conditioning demand through chilled water delivery. Evaluation and implementation of district energy systems involve technical, economic, legal, and institutional issues, often requiring technical assistance. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and keep energy dollars in local economies. Lack of capital funding is a major barrier to utilizing local waste heat and renewable energy resources. The Act aims to promote local energy infrastructure to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, and keep energy dollars in local economies. This includes providing technical assistance and facilitating low-cost financing for construction through loan guarantees. The Act aims to promote local energy infrastructure to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, and keep energy dollars in local economies by providing technical assistance and facilitating low-cost financing for construction through loan guarantees. The Act promotes local energy infrastructure through a Loan Guarantee Program for combined heat and power systems and district energy systems. The Loan Guarantee Program supports local energy infrastructure, including systems that recover energy from waste or renewable resources, generate electricity using combined heat and power, distribute electricity in microgrids, store thermal energy, and transfer thermal energy via district energy systems. The Loan Guarantee Program supports local energy infrastructure, including systems that recover energy from waste or renewable resources, generate electricity using combined heat and power, distribute electricity in microgrids, store thermal energy, and transfer thermal energy via district energy systems. A microgrid is a controllable entity that can connect and disconnect from the grid to operate in both grid-connected or island-mode, while a renewable energy resource includes biomass and gaseous or liquid fuels. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" includes heating or cooling energy from renewable sources, natural cooling sources like cold water, and other renewable thermal energy sources. The term \"thermal energy\" refers to heating energy in the form of hot water or steam for space heating, and cooling energy in the form of chilled water or ice for air conditioning. Waste energy is energy contained in exhaust gases or steam. The Secretary of Energy determines renewable thermal energy sources. The curr_chunk describes waste energy sources that can be utilized, including exhaust gases, hot liquids, flared gas, waste gas, and condenser water from various systems. The curr_chunk outlines waste energy sources that can be used in facilities, including exhaust gases, hot liquids, flared gas, waste gas, and condenser water. These sources should not be currently used in existing facilities or conventionally used in new facilities. The curr_chunk outlines a technical assistance program. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance to eligible entities for local energy infrastructure planning and design, including assistance with waste energy, renewable energy resources, utility interconnection, contract negotiation, and permitting. The program provides technical assistance for local energy infrastructure planning and design, including waste energy, renewable resources, utility interconnection, contract negotiation, permitting, marketing, business planning, financial analysis, and engineering design. Eligible entities can receive assistance regardless of their profit status. Information dissemination includes case studies and computer software for infrastructure assessment and maintenance. The program offers assistance for local energy infrastructure planning and design to nonprofit or for-profit entities. Grants can cover costs for initial assessment, feasibility studies, guidance on overcoming barriers, and detailed engineering. The program offers technical assistance for local energy infrastructure planning and design to eligible entities. Applications must be submitted to the Secretary following specific guidelines. Priority is given to projects with the highest potential for reducing fossil fuel use. The Secretary prioritizes projects based on maximizing fossil fuel elimination, enhancing energy supply reliability, reducing environmental impact, promoting renewable energy, boosting industrial competitiveness, and creating local jobs. Rules and procedures for program administration must be adopted within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must adopt rules and procedures for program administration within 180 days of the Act's enactment. $150,000,000 is authorized to carry out this section for fiscal years 2014 through 2018. SEC. 5. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR LOCAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. Amends Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include a Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program. The Secretary may provide loan guarantees for local energy infrastructure projects under the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013. $4 billion of loan guarantee authority will be reserved for this purpose, utilizing unobligated funds from section 1703 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. SEC. 6. Definition of Investment Area: Amends the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act to include local energy infrastructure projects as defined in the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013."
