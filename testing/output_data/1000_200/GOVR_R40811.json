    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to unnaturally high accumulations of biomass. Congress is urged to provide more funding and authority for activities that reduce biomass fuels, such as prescribed burning and thinning. Federal agencies already have broad authorities for fuel reduction efforts, funded through annual appropriations for hazardous fuels treatments. Insufficient reporting on hazardous fuel treatment funding and accomplishments hinders Congress's ability to assess progress in reducing biomass fuels. Information on funding for thinning and wildfire protection activities is inadequate for comparing benefits and costs. Improved reporting, disaggregated by ecosystem or fire regime, could enhance understanding of appropriations' nature, extent, and results. Improved reporting on funding and results, disaggregated by ecosystem or fire regime, can aid Congress in allocating appropriate funding. Wildfires in temperate ecosystems are inevitable due to dry conditions and various ignitions. Fires can range from low-intensity surface fires to high-intensity crown fires, depending on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. The behavior of wildfires, whether they are surface fires or crown fires, depends on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Fire protection efforts focus on altering fuel properties to prevent or minimize damages caused by crown fires. Four key characteristics of biomass fuels that affect wildfire behavior are moisture content, size, distribution, and total quantity. Moisture content is crucial as it controls the flammability of the fuel by requiring heat to evaporate the moisture before combustion. Green foliage and dead biomass moisture content fluctuates based on weather conditions. The moisture content of biomass fuels is crucial for their flammability. Green foliage and dead biomass contain varying levels of moisture, with green foliage having higher levels. Fuel with up to 20%-30% moisture can be ignited, but even biomass with 100% moisture can burn in high winds. Wildfire fuels are categorized based on the time it takes for their moisture content to decrease by two-thirds. Fine fuels dry out in about an hour, while woody twigs and branches take around 10 hours. The moisture content of biomass fuels is crucial for their flammability. Fine fuels dry out in about an hour, while woody twigs and branches take around 10 hours. Larger size classes like 100-hour and 1,000-hour time lag fuels also play a role in spreading fires. Fuel distribution and flammability are crucial factors in the spread of fires. Different fuel sizes, such as fine fuels and larger 100-hour and 1,000-hour time lag fuels, contribute to the intensity and damage caused by fires. Fuel compactness, or porosity, affects resistance to burning, with highly compact fuel beds being more resistant. Additionally, the arrangement of fuels horizontally and vertically impacts the rate of spread, with closely packed fuels slowing moisture loss and restricting air flow to the fire. Fuel compactness affects resistance to burning by reducing ventilation, slowing moisture loss, and restricting air flow to the fire. Continuity of fuels is crucial for fire spread, with firelines breaking the continuity to control wildfires. Factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed determine the width of the break needed to prevent fire spread. Steep slopes and high winds can reduce fuel moisture content and raise temperatures, making the fuel more susceptible to ignition. High winds on steep slopes can bring the fire closer to fuel, reducing moisture and raising temperatures, making it more flammable. Wind can spread firebrands, increasing fire spread. \"Fuel ladders\" help fires reach the canopy, turning surface fires into crown fires. Wind is crucial for sustaining crown fires by increasing convection. The fuel load for wildfires varies widely, ranging from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre. It includes dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees, excluding live commercially valuable trees. Despite excluding live crown biomass, the total mass and density play a crucial role in fire intensity and spread. The total mass, density, and continuity of live crown biomass significantly impact sustaining crown fires. Not all fuel is consumed in a wildfire, with larger fuels like tree branches and stems being less consumed compared to fine fuels. Fuel characteristics and resulting fires are influenced by different ecosystems. Some ecosystems are adapted to different types of fires, such as low-intensity surface fires or high-intensity crown fires. Ecosystems in the United States adapted to frequent wildfires have large amounts of fine fuels like grasses and needles. Forested frequent-fire ecosystems have fire-resistant trees and open spaces due to frequent fires killing seedlings and shrubs. Ecosystems dominated by fire-resistant trees like ponderosa pine and southern yellow pine have open spaces due to frequent fires killing seedlings and shrubs. These ecosystems have few small to mid-sized trees, reducing the risk of crown fires. Surface-fire ecosystems make up 34% of U.S. wildlands, historically fueled by grasses and needles. Grazing and logging have altered fuel loads, leading to an increase in branches and small to mid-size trees. Fuel loads of branches and small to mid-size trees have expanded due to logging practices emphasizing large pines. Fire suppression has further increased fuel loads, leading to higher risk of catastrophic crown fires in surface-fire ecosystems. Activities reducing fuel loads have been shown to decrease wildfire severity. Ecosystems adapted to periodic, high-intensity crown fires are characterized by dense, uniform fuels and infrequent fires, with examples like chaparral and lodgepole pine. The classic example of lodgepole pine, a species adapted to crown fires, grows in dense stands with serotinous cones that release seeds after fire. Crown-fire ecosystems make up 42% of US wildlands, with large biomass fuels. Human activities like grazing and logging have not significantly impacted fuel loads or fire behavior in these ecosystems. Fuel treatments may not prevent catastrophic crown fires, as seen in southern California chaparral. Large fires in southern California chaparral are not dependent on old age classes of fuels, making it unlikely that fuel manipulation can prevent them. Wildfires are patchy and do not completely destroy all vegetation, as seen in the Yellowstone fires of 1988 where only about half of the reported burned area was severely affected. Crown fire ecosystems often leave some areas lightly burned or unburned. Some ecosystems consistently burn with crown fires of limited scale, mixed with low-intensity surface fires. Whitebark pine is a classic example, growing slowly in harsh conditions, allowing other species to germinate. Mixed-intensity fires kill competing species, but some pines survive and spread seeds through Clark's nutcrackers. Some pines survive fires and spread seeds through Clark's nutcrackers, ensuring regeneration in burned areas. Different species can coexist in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems under certain conditions. The consequences of fuel reduction activities in these ecosystems are not well understood. Fuel reduction activities in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems in the Sierras are not well understood. It is uncertain if fuel levels, sizes, and distributions are unnatural, leading to abnormal crown fires. The impact of fuel reduction on wildfire extent and severity is unclear. While reducing fuel loads may help suppress wildfires and prevent crown fires in some ecosystems, it may not be suitable for all. Additionally, reducing fuel loads does not necessarily protect structures and communities from wildfires. Reducing fuel loads may not be effective in protecting structures and communities from wildfires, as shown by the Hayman Fire in 2002. Evidence from the fire indicates that reducing fuel loads did not prevent the destruction of homes, with 53% being destroyed by crown fires. Despite high-severity burns, 83% of homes within the fire perimeter survived relatively unscathed. Reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders may be necessary for safe low-intensity wildfire and prescribed fire use in surface-fire ecosystems. Proposed activities include prescribed burning, thinning, release, pruning, and salvage logging. However, some caution that these activities may not always reduce the risk of crown fires. Thinning and prescribed fires can alter microclimate, increasing surface fire intensity and the risk of crown fires. Prescribed burning is the intentional use of fire under specific fuel and weather conditions. Prescribed burning is a method used to reduce fine and small fuels by intentionally setting fires under specific conditions, such as high moisture levels and low wind speeds. This process is not completely controlled and can lead to extensive damage if conditions change. Prescribed burning eliminates fine and small fuels through burning and decomposition, converting biomass to smoke and ashes. However, it has limitations as it does not affect large diameter fuels and is not selective in reducing tree density or crown density. Escaped prescribed fires can lead to wildfires, prompting caution from fire managers with excessive personnel and equipment. Wildland fire use allows wildfires to burn with monitoring, avoiding aggressive suppression efforts. Federal land management agencies have policies in place for this practice to achieve fire management objectives. Wildland fire use, also known as \"let-burn\" or prescribed natural fire, allows wildfires to burn with monitoring instead of aggressive suppression efforts. Thinning involves cutting and removing trees in a stand, which can be commercial or precommercial depending on tree size. Thinning alters biomass fuels depending on the approach used and what is done with the leftover biomass. Thinning alters biomass fuels by removing trees based on different approaches: Low thinning removes small and poorly formed trees, Crown thinning removes larger trees to open the canopy, and Selection thinning removes less desirable trees. Thinning has advantages over prescribed burning as it is controlled, can eliminate ladder fuels, and reduces crown density. Thinning has advantages such as eliminating ladder fuels and reducing crown density, but it leaves slash on the ground which increases fuel load in the short run. Thinning operations in forests can leave slash on the ground, increasing fuel load temporarily. Mechanical treatments like crushing or chopping are possible but labor-intensive and costly. Thinning may not always aim to reduce biomass fuels but can also concentrate growth on fewer stems for larger, more valuable trees. In crown-fire ecosystems, thinning may not offer effective wildfire protection. Thinning in forests may not provide effective wildfire protection, especially in crown-fire ecosystems. However, in surface-fire and mixed-fire regime ecosystems, thinning combined with prescribed burning can reduce the risk of catastrophic crown fires. The effectiveness of this combination is limited and costly compared to other alternatives. Other activities like logging are sometimes suggested to reduce fuel loads. Logging, especially salvage logging of stands with dead trees, is sometimes proposed to reduce fuel loads. However, commercial logging focuses on large trees and does little for fuel ladders, leaving substantial slash behind. The effectiveness of commercial logging in reducing canopy fires is untested in scientific literature. Salvage of standing dead trees may reduce fuels, but its impact is debated. Salvage of standing dead trees and pruning can alter fuels for wildfire protection. Pruning focuses on removing lower tree branches to reduce crown density and fuel ladders. Five federal agencies are responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands. The Forest Service (FS) and other federal agencies like the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) are responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands. Each agency has the implicit authority to reduce fuels for wildfire protection within its mandate to preserve and protect the lands and resources under its jurisdiction. This authority has been established since the late 1800s, with specific directives for fire protection and conservation of natural resources. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) have broad authority to manage public lands for conservation, preservation, and habitat protection. The BIA has explicit direction for Indian forest land management. The BIA has specific direction for Indian forest land management activities, including forest land development, protection against wildfire, and biomass fuel reduction activities. The agencies have funding programs and authority to use general management funds for these activities. The Forest Service has funding accounts for activities like prescribed burning to reduce biomass fuels. Hazardous Fuels funding increased significantly in FY2001 and FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation, but has since declined. Ecosystems and specific activities funded are not reported. Funding for thinning and related activities within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account of the National Forest System line item has fluctuated over the years. In FY2008, about 20% of appropriations to this account funded thinning and related activities, but the portion used for thinning varies annually. The portion of thinning funded primarily for wildfire protection is unknown. The FS has three mandatory spending accounts that provide funds for activities to reduce biomass fuels, including Brush Disposal (BD) which collects deposits from timber purchasers for slash treatments in national forests. These treatments involve mechanical and manual efforts, as well as prescribed burning, to reduce fire hazards. Funding for thinning and related activities within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account fluctuates annually. The FS has three mandatory spending accounts for fuel reduction activities: Brush Disposal (BD), Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund, and stewardship contracting. These accounts collect deposits from timber purchasers for various forest improvement projects, including thinning for wildfire protection. Funding allocation for thinning and its impact on wildfire protection remains unknown. The FS has mandatory spending accounts for fuel reduction activities, including stewardship contracting. Deposits are collected from timber purchasers for projects like thinning for wildfire protection. Funding allocation for thinning and its impact on wildfire protection is unknown. DOI agencies have similar accounts for forest stewardship activities. The Hazardous Fuels sub-account provides funding for prescribed burning and other fuel reduction activities, but details on the portion used for prescribed burning and ecosystems treated are not reported. Wildland Fire Management is now funded as a department-wide program, with funding allocated through various accounts for fuel reduction activities. DOI fuel reduction funding in the Hazardous Fuels sub-account increased in FY2001 and has remained stable since. Thinning and other fuel reduction activities are funded through general land and resource management accounts for DOI agencies. Funds from specific accounts can be used for activities to improve wildfire protection by reducing fuel loads. The BLM, NPS, FWS, and BIA have various accounts that could fund activities to reduce wildfire threats by reducing biomass fuels, protecting natural and cultural resources, and managing wildlife habitats. The BLM, NPS, FWS, and BIA have funding accounts for activities that reduce wildfire threats by reducing biomass fuels, protecting resources, and managing habitats. The BLM has a Forest Ecosystem Health and Recovery Fund for fuel reduction activities, but the portion used for this purpose is unknown. The FS has programs for wildfire protection assistance that may include fuel reduction, while other agencies lack similar programs. The FS has two wildfire protection assistance programs that can include fuel reduction. One program is State Fire Assistance, providing technical and financial aid to states for fire prevention and prescribed burning. The other program is Volunteer Fire Assistance, offering assistance for fire control and prescribed burning. Eligibility is limited to rural areas. The FS provides technical and financial assistance for fire prevention, control, and prescribed burning to rural volunteer fire departments. Funding allocation is at the agency's discretion, with a focus on fuel reduction. The Community Wildfire Protection program aims to expand outreach, education, and establish defensible space around homes. The FS offers technical and financial assistance for community outreach, education, and establishing defensible space around homes. No funds have been allocated for this program yet, but State Fire Assistance funding could be used. Other assistance programs are available for forest stewardship, forest health protection, and emergency restoration. The amount of funds that could contribute to wildfire protection through biomass fuel reduction is unknown."
