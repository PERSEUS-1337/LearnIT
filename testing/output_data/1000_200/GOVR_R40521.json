    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that provides funding for special education and related services. It requires states to offer a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children with disabilities aged 3 to 21, identify and evaluate all children with disabilities, and create individual education programs (IEPs) for those receiving services. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures that children with disabilities receive special education and related services through individual education programs (IEPs). Parents are involved in planning and overseeing their child's education as part of the IEP team. IDEA also mandates that children with disabilities be educated alongside non-disabled peers whenever possible, and provides procedural safeguards such as due process hearings and the right to appeal to federal court. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures that children with disabilities receive special education and related services through individual education programs (IEPs). The most recent reauthorization of IDEA was P.L. 108-446 in 2004, which included specific authorizations for appropriations through 2011. Congress is currently identifying potential issues for the next reauthorization. The IDEA definition of a child with a disability is categorical and requires special education and related services. The IDEA definition of a child with a disability is categorical, requiring special education and related services. In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District, the court examined whether a child diagnosed with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD qualified as a child with a disability under IDEA. In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District, a child diagnosed with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD was deemed a child with a disability under IDEA. The court found the child met the categories of serious emotional disturbance and other health impairments, struggling academically due to ADHD. The need for special education and related services was emphasized in court decisions. In L.I. v. Maine School District, a child with Asperger's Syndrome and an adjustment disorder was considered a child with a disability under IDEA, despite high grades and non-disruptive behavior. The court rejected the idea that IDEA only applies to children with disabilities that significantly impact educational performance. In Board of Education of Montgomery County v. S.G., a child with schizophrenia was also deemed a child with a disability under IDEA, even though the disability did not directly affect school performance. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the argument that a child with missed school due to hospitalizations and hearing voices would not benefit from IDEA services. The Ninth Circuit ruled that a child with ADHD, depression, and other disorders was not eligible for IDEA services if her behavior did not adversely affect her educational performance. The Fifth Circuit also found no adverse educational effect from a child's ADHD in a separate case. In School District v. AD, the Fifth Circuit found no adverse educational effect from the child's ADHD. In Mr. and Mrs. N.C. v. Bedford Central School District, the Second Circuit examined whether a child with dysthymic disorder met the requirements for seriously emotionally disturbed under IDEA regulations. It was noted that even if the child qualified as seriously emotionally disturbed, there was insufficient evidence of adverse educational impact. IDEA requires states to have policies and procedures in place to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities in need of special education, known as child find. The Ninth Circuit ruled in Compton Unified School District v. Addison that failing to evaluate a ninth grader who struggled academically and exhibited unusual behavior could violate IDEA's child find requirement. The Supreme Court is considering whether parents can file due process complaints for negligence when school officials fail to provide an educational program for their child with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures that children with disabilities have the right to a due process hearing if school officials fail to provide an appropriate educational program. The core requirement of IDEA is to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) for children with disabilities, which includes special education and related services. A key decision on FAPE requirements was made in the case of Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School. The Supreme Court decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 established the requirements of FAPE under IDEA, emphasizing the need for specialized instruction tailored to provide educational benefit to children with disabilities. The Court determined that FAPE is achieved when access to individualized education programs is sufficient to confer educational benefit upon the child. The Court in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley (1982) established that FAPE is met when a handicapped child receives personalized instruction and support services to benefit educationally. The instruction must meet state standards, approximate grade levels, and align with the child's IEP. Mainstreaming involves monitoring educational progress through grading and advancement systems, ensuring the IEP enables educational benefit in regular classrooms. The Supreme Court established in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley (1982) that FAPE should be formulated in accordance with the Act's requirements. States are not required to maximize each child's potential, but rather ensure progress and measurable gains. Courts must avoid imposing their views on educational methods, leaving the responsibility to state and local agencies. Determining if children with disabilities are receiving sufficient educational benefits presents a challenge under IDEA. The Supreme Court's decision in Rowley (1982) established that determining if children with disabilities are receiving sufficient educational benefits under IDEA is a complex issue. The Court did not establish a specific test for adequacy but focused on the individual case. Lower courts have varied in interpreting Rowley, with some emphasizing access to education over educational progress in determining the adequacy of an IEP. In Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes, the Eighth Circuit emphasized Rowley's \"access to education\" requirement and found the IEP adequate despite low reading scores. Some courts interpret IDEA narrowly, focusing on educational services only, while others, like in Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16, require more than minimal educational benefit from an IEP. In Unit 16, the Third Circuit clarified that an IEP must provide more than minimal educational benefit, as stated in Rowley. The Fifth Circuit also emphasized the need for meaningful educational benefits in Cypress-Fairbanks Indep. School District v. Michael F. Four factors were identified to assess this: individualized program, least restrictive environment, coordinated services, and demonstrated academic and nonacademic benefits. Academic achievement testing and grades are used by courts to measure educational benefit, as seen in Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District. In Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District, courts use academic achievement testing and grades to measure educational benefit under IDEA. The Third Circuit emphasized that above-average intellectual ability requires more than a negligible benefit. Procedural violations must affect the child's substantive rights to constitute a violation of FAPE. FAPE requires timely implementation of IEP services, with exceptions for certain procedural violations. In N.B. and C.B. v. Hellgate Elementary School District, failure to evaluate a child in all areas of suspected disability was deemed a denial of FAPE. Additionally, scheduling an IEP meeting without parental agreement also constituted a denial of FAPE. The Supreme Court's analysis in Rowley regarding educational standards is somewhat confused by changes in the term's usage. Currently, \"educational standards\" refer to specific content-based standards outlining what a child should know. The 1997 Amendments to IDEA reflected this shift towards standards-based education. P.L. 105-17 significantly altered IEP requirements, including the need for a statement of the child's present levels. The 1997 Amendments to IDEA reflected the standards-based education movement, changing IEP requirements to include present levels of educational performance, measurable annual goals, and access to the general curriculum. P.L. 108-446 emphasized high expectations and access to the general curriculum for children with disabilities. The 2004 Amendments to IDEA require specially designed instruction and related services to be based on peer-reviewed research. There have been arguments about the impact of NCLBA on FAPE requirements for students with disabilities, but these have not been successful. The final regulations state that peer-reviewed research is necessary for designing instruction and related services under IDEA. A court case, Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District, ruled that an eclectic approach without peer-reviewed research can still satisfy IDEA requirements. The court emphasized that decisions under IDEA must meet its requirements, not necessarily be the best decision. After identifying a child with a disability, an Individualized Education Team creates an IEP with specific criteria. The IEP includes academic levels, goals, services, and integration with non-disabled peers, playing a crucial role in implementing FAPE. The IEP is a key component of IDEA and is crucial for providing educational benefits to children with disabilities. It does not have to be perfect but must be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits. In a specific case, flaws in the IEP did not compromise the child's right to an appropriate education or deprive him of educational benefits. The court found that flaws in the child's IEP did not compromise his right to an appropriate education or deprive him of educational benefits, leading to no violation of IDEA. Similarly, evidence supporting the adequacy of the IEP in another case indicated the child's likely educational progress, also not constituting an IDEA violation. Lack of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not automatically invalidate it, as procedural violations without substantive harm were not considered violations of IDEA. Lack of progress in one school year does not necessarily indicate an IDEA violation, as IDEA does not guarantee success. The court in Nack held that lack of progress in one school year does not always indicate an IDEA violation, as IDEA does not guarantee success but requires sufficient specialized services. However, courts have found that an IEP not providing educational benefits violates IDEA, as seen in cases like A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board and M.L. v. Federal Way School District. In contrast, R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District found that not including a regular education teacher on the IEP team did not violate IDEA. The input of parents in an IEP has been the subject of recent decisions, with courts limiting their control over the content. For example, in Shelby S. v. Conroe Independent School District, a school could conduct an independent medical evaluation without parental consent. In Lessard and Lessard v. Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School District, an IEP was not deemed deficient due to incompleteness. In a recent case, the First Circuit ruled that an IEP was not procedurally deficient despite being incomplete. The court highlighted the challenge of drawing a precise line between parental input and school responsibilities in the IEP process. Despite limited parental control, courts have sided with parents in IEP cases, such as when a lack of notice or failure to inform parents of their rights violated IDEA. Additionally, determining a child's placement before an IEP meeting and scheduling meetings without considering parental availability were found to violate procedural requirements. The school's placement before the IEP meeting violated IDEA's procedural requirements, denying the student FAPE. FAPE includes special education and related services like transportation, speech-language pathology, and counseling. Related services under IDEA include nurse services, counseling services, orientation and mobility services, and medical services for diagnostic purposes. Two Supreme Court cases have addressed the concept of related services, specifically regarding what constitutes a medical service. In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, the Court ruled that schools must provide necessary medical services, such as clean intermittent catheterization, to students with disabilities. In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, the Court ruled that schools must provide necessary medical services, such as clean intermittent catheterization, to students with disabilities. The Court held that services affecting both the medical and educational needs of a child must be provided under IDEA if the service is necessary to help a child with a disability benefit from special education and can be provided by a qualified person who is not a physician. Services that could be provided outside the school day would not need to be provided. Tatro drew a distinction between services that had to be provided by a doctor and those that could be provided by a non-physician. In 1999, Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F. involved a paralyzed child who required substantial medical services, including suction on his tracheotomy tube and manual air pumping. The school denied the services, proposing a test based on factors like continuous care and cost. The Supreme Court rejected this test, stating that the medical services exclusion only applied to physician or hospital services. The Supreme Court, in line with the IDEA's purpose of inclusive education, limited the medical services exclusion to physician or hospital services. The 2004 reauthorization allowed states to establish risk pools for high-need children with disabilities. Recent IDEA cases emphasize federal court discretion in defining necessary services for disabled children. The federal court defines services required for a child with a disability to benefit from special education under IDEA. Recent court decisions follow a two-pronged approach to determine the least restrictive environment for students with disabilities. The federal court defines services required for a child with a disability to benefit from special education under IDEA. Recent court decisions follow a two-pronged approach to determine the least restrictive environment for students with disabilities. Placement in the regular classroom with supplementary services should be attempted first. If not feasible, the school must consider mainstreaming the child to the maximum extent appropriate. Factors include efforts to accommodate the child, educational benefits in regular vs special education, and potential negative effects on other students. A case example highlighted disruptions caused by a child with disabilities in a regular classroom. The court upheld the decision that the student could not be educated full time in a regular classroom due to disruptive behaviors. P.L. 94-142, the original version of IDEA, provided grants to states for children with disabilities and outlined requirements for receiving federal funds. The law included a \"stay put\" provision to maintain the child's current educational placement during disputes between the school and parents. The \"stay put\" provision in IDEA ensures that a child with disabilities remains in their current educational placement during disputes. This provision was included to prevent the discriminatory practice of expelling such children from school. In the case of Honig v. Doe, the Supreme Court ruled that schools cannot unilaterally expel students with disabilities, even in cases of severe misconduct. The Supreme Court ruled in Honig v. Doe that schools cannot unilaterally expel students with disabilities, even in cases of severe misconduct. The court stated that schools can temporarily suspend a student for up to 10 days if they pose an immediate threat to others. In cases where parents refuse to change the student's placement, schools can seek judicial relief under section 1415(e)(2), known as a Honig injunction. The Honig injunction allows schools to seek judicial relief in cases where students with disabilities pose a threat. Amendments to IDEA in 1994, 1997, and 2004 expanded the provision to include weapons, drugs, and serious bodily injury situations. Some court cases have addressed the application of the stay put requirement during transitions from Part C. The stay put provisions in IDEA have been the subject of disciplinary actions. Courts have debated whether the stay put requirement applies during transitions from Part C to Part B. Part B applies to school-aged children and requires FAPE in an IEP, while Part C applies to infants and toddlers and requires early intervention services in an IFSP. The Third Circuit in Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit held that the stay put provision requires continued conductive education until disputes are resolved, while the Eleventh Circuit in D.P. v. School Board of Broward County disagreed. The Eleventh Circuit in D.P. v. School Board of Broward County disagreed with the application of the stay put provision to children seeking initial admission to a public school program. Other issues related to the stay put provision have involved mediation, private school placement, resource room transitions, and appeals processes in the courts. Sammons v. Polk County School Board questioned if a mediation request triggers the stay put provision, while L.M. v. Capistrano Unified School District addressed the application of the provision to a child without an implemented IEP. In L.M. v. Capistrano Unified School District, the Ninth Circuit ruled that a child unilaterally placed in a private school by parents could not use the stay put provision. E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken held that the stay put placement was the previous school year's placement. A child's move from a resource room to an inclusion classroom did not trigger the stay put provision. Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District confirmed the provision's application during appeals. The Ninth Circuit confirmed the stay put provision's application during appeals in Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District. In N.D. v. State of Hawaii, a novel application of the provision failed due to fiscal concerns leading to school closures. The Ninth Circuit found no violation when public schools in Hawaii reduced instruction days, stating the provision does not cover system-wide changes affecting all students. Congressional interest in seclusion and restraints led to the passing of the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act.\" The House passed H.R. 4247, the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act,\" addressing seclusion and restraints for children with disabilities. IDEA emphasizes positive behavioral interventions but does not prohibit the use of restraints. State laws may dictate the use of restraints for children with disabilities. The Department highlighted that state laws may regulate the use of restraints for children with disabilities, emphasizing that restraints should align with the child's IEP and the need for positive behavioral interventions. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA, but in Honig v. Doe, it ruled that suspensions longer than ten days violated IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision. The Court suggested that educators can use alternative methods like study carrels and timeouts. In Honig, educators can use normal procedures like study carrels, timeouts, detention, or a ten-day suspension. Despite no specific language in IDEA, cases have challenged the use of restraints and seclusion. Courts generally do not find violations if necessary to prevent harm or if the child is progressing academically. The exhaustion requirements of IDEA have been considered in cases involving seclusion and restraint. The exhaustion requirements of IDEA apply to situations involving the use of seclusion and restraint. In C.N. v. Willmar Public Schools, parents challenged the improper and excessive use of these procedures in their child's IEP. The Eighth Circuit ruled that parents must follow IDEA due process procedures and file for a hearing while the child is still in the school district. The Second Circuit vacated a district court's injunction against a New York State regulation banning aversive interventions, upholding the regulation as a rational choice consistent with the purposes of IDEA. The Department of Education has stated that disability harassment is not explicitly prohibited in IDEA. The Department of Education has stated that disability harassment may result in a denial of FAPE under IDEA. Courts have found that severe harassment can deny access to educational benefits, violating IDEA. Claims of harassment must be tied to IDEA and show denial of FAPE. Retaliation claims are subject to IDEA's exhaustion of administrative remedies. ADA and Section 504 may also lead to actions for retaliation in advocating for IDEA violations. Several circuits have held that protecting special education students' rights is crucial. Section 615 of IDEA provides procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, including protections for a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Parents or schools can file a due process complaint within two years of knowing about a violation. The 2004 reauthorization allows schools to also file complaints. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added provisions for schools to file complaints, with a requirement for a resolution session before due process hearings. Mediation of disputes is also allowed under the current law. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added provisions for schools to file complaints, with a requirement for a resolution session before due process hearings. Provisions allowing for mediation of disputes under IDEA were added in the 1997 reauthorization and retained in the current law. Judicial enforcement of agreements reached through a resolution session or mediation was also provided for in the 2004 reauthorization. Several court decisions have addressed issues regarding the resolution session, including confidentiality of information disclosed and the presence of attorneys during the process. In Amy S. v. Danbury, the Sixth Circuit held that mediation agreements signed by parents, represented by counsel, limit judicial enforcement to agreements reached through dispute resolution or mediation. The court rejected a claim where parents alleged breach of a mediation agreement by the school. The court rejected a claim of breach of a mediation agreement by the school, stating that tutoring services were still available. In another case, the court addressed issues regarding a due process complaint not meeting IDEA's pleading requirements. The court found that the due process complaint notice must meet statutory requirements on its face, with no hearing or appeal allowed for the hearing officer's determination. The court expressed concern that state officials could dismiss complaints without federal court review. The Eighth Circuit affirmed a dismissal without prejudice, noting that IDEA does not allow LEAs to sue SEAs for non-compliance. In cases like Traverse Bay Area Intermediate School District v. Michigan Department of Education and Lake Washington School District No. 414 v. Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings, courts have ruled that LEAs cannot sue SEAs for noncompliance with IDEA, as the statute limits complaints to specific issues related to a child's identification, evaluation, or placement. The Supreme Court also addressed this issue in Winkelman v. Parma City School District. In Winkelman v. Parma City School District, the Supreme Court ruled that parents can bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights, including their child's entitlement to a free appropriate public education. Justice Kennedy emphasized that IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues. The Court examined IDEA's statutory language, emphasizing the protection of rights for children with disabilities and their parents. Procedural rights were established to ensure this protection, indicating that parents have a personal interest in IDEA's goals. IDEA provides parents with both procedural and substantive rights, without differentiation between them. The Court found that IDEA provides parents with both procedural and substantive rights, without differentiation between them. Concerns about increased costs to states due to potential lawsuits were deemed insufficient to argue that IDEA failed to provide clear notice before imposing new conditions. Additionally, IDEA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to educational agencies if a parent's action is deemed to have an improper purpose. The Supreme Court allows courts to award attorneys' fees to educational agencies if a parent's action is for an improper purpose, such as harassment or unnecessary delay. Non-attorney parents can assert their own claims but cannot circumvent existing consent decrees. In Woodruff v. Hamilton Township Public Schools, parents' amended claims were found insufficient. In Woodruff v. Hamilton Township Public Schools, the Third Circuit dismissed parents' amended claims as not personal to them. Parental rights under Winkelman extend to Section 504, ADA, and IDEA cases, but not all courts agree. D.A. and M.A. v. Pleasantville School District found Winkelman specific to IDEA. Other parental rights issues are not directly tied to Winkelman. Blanchard v. raised the issue of parents recovering damages under IDEA. In Blanchard v. Morton School District, the Ninth Circuit stated that money damages were not available under IDEA for a child with a disability. The Second Circuit addressed the rights of a noncustodial parent in Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City, emphasizing that a noncustodial biological parent does not have legal authority to make educational decisions under IDEA regulations. The Fuentes court emphasized that the noncustodial biological parent lacks legal authority to make educational decisions under IDEA regulations. IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA address the education rights of individuals with disabilities, with each statute playing a significant role in providing educational programs for individuals with disabilities. The ADA and Section 504 are civil rights statutes that protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination. While Section 504 applies to entities receiving federal funds, the ADA has broader coverage. The interaction of these statutes in educational settings has been examined by courts, noting differences in coverage. IDEA ensures the provision of FAPE through detailed due process requirements. IDEA contains detailed due process requirements to ensure FAPE, including impartial hearings. The burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing was clarified in the 2005 case of Schaffer v. Weast, where the party seeking relief carries the burden of proof. The burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing lies with the party seeking relief, as clarified in the 2005 case of Schaffer v. Weast. Justice O'Connor rejected arguments that the burden should be on the school system, noting that IDEA safeguards parents' procedural rights and provides mechanisms for information sharing. The Court emphasized the rights of parents under IDEA, including the right to review records, have an independent evaluation, receive information about options considered by the school district, and receive attorneys' fees if they prevail. Issues regarding services for children with disabilities in private schools and who pays for them have been contentious. IDEA allows children with disabilities to be placed in private schools by the local or state educational agency, with the full cost covered by the agency. IDEA allows children with disabilities to be placed in private schools by the local or state educational agency, with the full cost covered by the agency. Parents can unilaterally place their child in a private school, but reimbursement may be required if certain conditions are met. The IDEA allows children with disabilities to be placed in private schools by the local or state educational agency, with full cost covered. Reimbursement may be required if the agency fails to provide a free appropriate public education in a timely manner. Recent Supreme Court cases have addressed tuition reimbursement for parents who place their child in a private school without prior special education from a public school. In a 2007 decision, the Supreme Court allowed private school reimbursement for parents of a child with a disability, even if the student had never received special education services from the public school district. This ruling did not set a precedent for lower courts, leaving the issue unsettled. However, in 2009, the Supreme Court authorized reimbursement for private special-education services under IDEA in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. The Supreme Court ruled in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. that IDEA allows reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE. Recent lower court decisions have found that if a child is making educational progress with an IEP, they may not be entitled to private school placement. For example, in M.H. and J.H. v. Monroe-Woodbury Central School District, parents were not entitled to tuition reimbursement as the child's IEP was deemed adequate. The Supreme Court ruled in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. that IDEA allows reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE. Recent lower court decisions have found that if a child is making educational progress with an IEP, they may not be entitled to private school placement. Courts have held that reimbursement for private school tuition is barred if parents arrange for private school educational services without notifying the LEA of their problems with their child's IDEA services. Reimbursement is also barred if the parents act unreasonably in their relations with the school. The Supreme Court ruled in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. that IDEA allows reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE. Reimbursement for private school tuition is barred if parents arrange for private school services without notifying the LEA of their problems with their child's IDEA services or if they act unreasonably in their relations with the school. If a school district deprives a child with a disability of FAPE, the child may be entitled to private school reimbursement or compensatory education. Compensatory education is awarded to compensate for a previous inadequate program, based on the Supreme Court's ruling in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts. The 1985 Supreme Court ruling in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts allows parents to obtain reimbursement for private school tuition if the public school program violates FAPE. Lower courts have used this ruling to award compensatory education, but there is ambiguity on how it should be awarded. Some courts grant compensatory education for the same amount of time appropriate services were withheld, while others focus on the student's need to be appropriately educated under IDEA. The IDEA emphasizes the need for students to be appropriately educated and may require more services in compensatory education. Section 1983 allows suits for deprivation of rights under state law, with courts differing on whether damages can be awarded under IDEA. Some courts allow damages while others do not. Some courts allow damages under IDEA, while others do not. The Supreme Court in Smith v. Robinson held that prevailing parties can only seek remedies within the IDEA statute, not through other laws like the Rehabilitation Act or Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Award Act. Congress responded to this decision by enacting changes in 1986. In response to the controversial decision in Smith v. Robinson, Congress enacted the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986, providing for attorneys' fees under IDEA. Subsequent amendments in 1997 and 2004, such as P.L. 105-17 and P.L. 108-446, allowed for reductions in fees and added provisions for attorneys' fees in certain situations, including against parents or their attorneys. The ADA allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded to a prevailing party, but the \"catalyst theory\" was rejected by the Supreme Court. Attorneys' fees under IDEA are only available when there is a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties. Attorneys' fees can be awarded to the prevailing party in administrative and judicial proceedings under IDEA, even without a finding of a denial of FAPE. However, fees have not been awarded when a child's disability has not been determined. Judicial approval is required for attorneys' fees related to settlement agreements. Attorneys' fees can be awarded to the prevailing party in administrative and judicial proceedings under IDEA, even without a finding of a denial of FAPE. However, fees have not been awarded when a child's disability has not been determined. Courts will only award attorneys' fees for relief obtained through a settlement agreement if that agreement received judicial approval. Attorneys' fees will not be awarded for voluntary settlements or purely private settlement agreements that are not judicially sanctioned. Additionally, in Drennan v. Pulaski County Special School District, a party was not awarded attorneys' fees for failing to perform certain court-ordered duties. Relatives other than parents, such as grandparents, may be awarded attorneys' fees. Courts have discretion in determining the amount of fees based on the party's degree of success. The court has discretion in awarding attorneys' fees based on the party's degree of success. Refusal to attend a meeting for a proposed settlement does not necessarily lead to a reduction in fees. Fee caps were first imposed on IDEA cases in the District of Columbia in FY1999. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows courts to award attorneys' fees to State or local educational agencies if a parent's complaint is found to be frivolous. In El Paso Independent School District v. Berry, the Fifth Circuit upheld the award of attorneys' fees against a lawyer who refused to accept offered relief and used stonewalling tactics. The Sixth Circuit found that attorneys' fees could be awarded to a local educational agency (LEA) against a lawyer who refused relief and stonewalled the evaluation of a student. However, this fee provision did not apply to private schools. The Ninth Circuit emphasized that unsuccessful parent actions in court are not necessarily frivolous, as lawyers should not be discouraged from taking on meritorious IDEA cases. Cases have examined whether the LEA was the prevailing party, as seen in El Paso Independent School District v. Richard R. In El Paso Independent School District v. Richard R, the school district did not prevail on educational issues and was not entitled to attorneys' fees. Similarly, in District of Columbia v. Straus, fees were not awarded because the school district was not a prevailing party. The court highlighted concerns about districts ignoring legal obligations until sued, complying, and then seeking attorney's fees. The court may award attorney's fees to prevailing parents in IDEA cases, with some lower courts interpreting this to include expert witness fees. In Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, parents argued that the language on costs could cover expert witness fees based on legislative history. The Supreme Court, in a decision written by Justice Alito, held that IDEA does not authorize prevailing parents to recover fees they have paid to experts. The majority opinion stated that Congress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause, and the statutory language did not provide clear notice for recovering expert fees. H.R. 1208 and S. 613 were introduced in the 112th Congress to amend IDEA to include expert fees. The legislative history was deemed insufficient. H.R. 1208 and S. 613 in the 112th Congress aimed to amend IDEA to cover expert witness fees. IDEA offers two dispute resolution methods: impartial due process procedures and state complaint resolution. The Department of Education oversees IDEA implementation. Court decisions have addressed systemic complaints under IDEA. In Lake Washington School District No. 414 v. Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings, a court rejected an LEA's suit against the SEA for a \"systematic violation of the IDEA.\" Congress established P & A's to advocate for individuals with developmental disabilities, often filing class action lawsuits for systemic violations, including cases involving special education students' rights and access to records."
