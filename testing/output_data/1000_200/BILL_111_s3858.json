    "content": "The \"H-2A Improvement Act\" allows nonimmigrant status for dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders coming temporarily to the United States for agricultural labor. Special rules are established for aliens employed in these roles. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders, allowing them to be admitted for an initial period of 3 years with the possibility of extension for an additional 3 years. Special rules for dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders under Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act allow for an initial 3-year admission period with the potential for a 3-year extension. Employers filing petitions for H-2A workers in these positions are exempt from showing seasonal or temporary nature, and eligible aliens can adjust to lawful permanent resident status after maintaining H-2A worker status for at least 33 years in the US. The special rules under Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act allow dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders to be admitted for an initial 3-year period with a possible 3-year extension. Eligible aliens can seek immigrant visas under specific criteria and can be petitioned by their employer or themselves without the need for labor certification. No determination is required for an immigrant visa under section 203(b)(3)(A)(iii) for an eligible alien. Filing a petition or application for adjustment of status based on the petition will not be a basis for denying other petitions or requests related to H-2A workers. The Secretary of Homeland Security will extend the stay of an eligible alien with a pending or approved petition for an H-2A worker in 1-year increments until a final determination is made on the alien's eligibility for adjustment of status to a lawful permanent resident. The Secretary of Homeland Security will extend the stay of an eligible alien with a pending or approved petition for an H-2A worker in 1-year increments until a final determination is made on the alien's eligibility for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Nothing in this paragraph may prevent an eligible alien from seeking adjustment of status in accordance with any other provision of law."
