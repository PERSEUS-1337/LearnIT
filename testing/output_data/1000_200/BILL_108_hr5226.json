The Secretary of Agriculture can provide emergency financial assistance to producers who have suffered crop losses in 2003 or 2004 due to damaging weather conditions. This assistance will be administered similarly to the Agriculture Appropriations Act of 2001. The Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 allows for assistance to producers who experienced crop losses, with eligibility criteria including obtaining insurance for insurable commodities and filing paperwork for noninsurable commodities.

The Secretary may waive requirements for producers on a farm if they enter into a contract agreeing to additional insurance coverage for insurable commodities or filing paperwork for noninsurable commodities. The Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 requires producers to obtain insurance for insurable commodities and file paperwork for noninsurable commodities by the State deadline. Violation of the contract requires producers to reimburse the Secretary for assistance received. Payment limitations restrict assistance to 95% of the crop's estimated value in the absence of losses.

The Tree Assistance Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Agriculture will use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide emergency assistance to producers who suffered tree losses between December 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004. Additionally, $15,000,000 will be used to reimburse eligible forest landowners for tree losses under the tree assistance program. The Secretary of Agriculture will allocate $50,000,000 from the Commodity Credit Corporation for the Emergency Conservation Program, providing assistance to participants with the maximum cost share percentage. The Commodity Credit Corporation will be utilized to implement this Act, and regulations will be established accordingly. The Secretary of Agriculture may issue regulations to implement the Act without following certain procedures, and congressional review will be conducted using specific authority. SEC. 7. OFFSET.
