    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Technology Retraining and Investment Now Act for the 21st Century\". The Congress finds that the value added by workers in the US and other countries is increasingly dependent on educational and training investments. The disparity in investment between the US and its trading partners is leading to declining educational performance in the US compared to other countries in a global marketplace. In an increasingly global and competitive marketplace, United States-based businesses struggle to fund worker education and training, unlike their counterparts in other countries. The current global workforce environment puts pressure on domestic companies to utilize highly educated knowledge workers from other countries. It is crucial for the United States government to reverse this trend to preserve national security, a strong middle class, and the welfare of workers, while remaining competitive globally through public-private partnerships. Public-private partnerships in the United States, like the research and development tax credit, help advance the needs of citizens, businesses, and communities. Businesses excel at training the workforce by adapting to new methods and eliminating ineffective programs, especially with a large number of baby boomers retiring in the next 20 years. The United States aims to train its workforce for high-paying information and communications technology jobs to support retiring baby boomers. The Act encourages businesses and individuals to invest in education and training for knowledge workers in professions like information or communications.
