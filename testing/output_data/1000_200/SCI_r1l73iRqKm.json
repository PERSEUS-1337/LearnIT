    "content": "In open-domain dialogue, intelligent agents struggle to incorporate knowledge into conversations. Existing models often rely on generic responses rather than utilizing recalled knowledge as context. To address this, a new dataset grounded in Wikipedia knowledge was created. Architectures were developed to retrieve, read, and use this knowledge to generate natural responses. The best dialogue models were successful in conducting knowledgeable discussions on various topics, as confirmed by both automatic metrics and human evaluations. The best dialogue models are able to conduct knowledgeable discussions on open-domain topics, aiming to enable humans to communicate effectively with machines. These models must comprehend language, employ memory, reason about concepts, and generate captivating responses. Current state-of-the-art approaches, such as sequence to sequence models, attempt to address these skills but face challenges in bringing them together effectively. The current state-of-the-art approaches, like sequence to sequence models, aim to address skills needed for open-domain dialogue but struggle with memory and knowledge utilization. To converse intelligently, speakers require direct knowledge memory mechanisms. In this work, the focus is on open-domain dialogue where speakers engage in chit-chat, broadening or focusing on related themes, exchanging new information and personal viewpoints. In this work, the authors design Transformer Memory Networks to facilitate intelligent conversations by combining Memory Network architectures and Transformer architectures. They create a supervised dataset of human-human conversations to train the models, as no public domain dataset of sufficient scale exists. The authors designed Transformer Memory Networks to enable intelligent conversations by combining Memory Network and Transformer architectures. They created a dataset of human-human conversations using crowd-sourced workers, with diverse discussion topics and conversations involving 201,999 utterances. The dataset links topics to Wikipedia, allowing for training and evaluating conversation models with a memory component that recalls and grounds knowledge from existing text. Transformer Memory Network architectures were tested in this setup, showing their ability to engage in knowledgeable conversations compared to baselines like standard Memory Networks or Transformers. The new benchmark in ParlAI aims to improve engaging conversations with humans by incorporating knowledge recall. Existing dialogue tasks often lack explicit knowledge utilization, unlike the Transformer Memory Networks designed for intelligent conversations. Knowledge conditioning is typically used in goal-directed dialogues, such as airline or restaurant booking, by accessing databases through API calls. Our work focuses on investigating unstructured knowledge across a wide range of topics, potentially spanning all of Wikipedia. Unlike goal-directed dialogues that use knowledge conditioning for tasks like airline or restaurant booking, our research delves into question answering by retrieving and conditioning knowledge. This contrasts with existing models like SQuAD and Open-SQuAD, which rely on neural models to answer questions based on Wikipedia paragraphs. Our work does not address question answering directly but explores similar themes through a sequence of questions and answers in dialogue form. The QuAC dataset explores dialogues in question and answer format, while our work focuses on natural human dialogues with a variety of utterances. Previous works have used Memory Networks for dialogue on movies and Reddit discussions, linking to structured knowledge. Other works have used unstructured text for discussing news articles and local businesses. Our work compares Memory Networks BID19 and Transformers in dialogues using Foursquare tips as knowledge, developing an architecture that combines these approaches for multi-turn dialogue in an open-domain setting. Our paper introduces models for full multi-turn dialogue in an open-domain setting, where two participants engage in chitchat with one being a knowledgeable expert (wizard) and the other a curious learner (apprentice). The goal is to delve deeply into a chosen topic while keeping the conversation engaging and fun. The task involves a wizard and an apprentice engaging in deep conversation on a chosen topic, with the wizard having access to relevant information from Wikipedia to craft engaging replies. The task involves a wizard and an apprentice engaging in deep conversation on a chosen topic, with the wizard using relevant knowledge from Wikipedia to craft engaging replies. The conversation flow includes choosing a topic, sending messages back and forth, and responding based on selected sentences until one participant ends the chat. The task involves a wizard and an apprentice engaging in deep conversation on a chosen topic using relevant knowledge from Wikipedia. The conversation ends after a minimum of 4 or 5 turns each. Data collected from these conversations will be used to replace the human wizard with a learned agent. Topics include diverse subjects like commuting, Gouda cheese, music festivals, podcasts, bowling, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The wizard has access to passages of knowledge relevant to the dialogue context. The dataset collection process involves using a retriever to present relevant articles to the annotator during dialogue. The retriever uses TF-IDF weighted bag-of-word and n-gram vectors for comparison. The top articles are retrieved for dialogue turns and the original topic. The wizard can click on article titles to expand them for more information. During data collection, the wizard can select an article title in the dialogue UI to expand it and choose a relevant sentence for their response. The dialogue model is trained to replace the wizard and has access to a knowledge source like Wikipedia. Extensions of Memory Network BID19 and Transformer BID21 models are developed to retrieve relevant information from a large memory based on the dialogue history. The Memory Network BID19 and Transformer BID21 models are extended to retrieve relevant information from a large memory based on dialogue history, read and attend to the retrieved knowledge, and generate the next dialogue utterance. Two classes of models are developed: retrieval models that select from a set of candidate responses and generative models that produce responses word-by-word. The input to both models is the current dialogue context at each turn, with the goal of generating responses. The model extends Memory Network BID19 and Transformer BID21 to retrieve information from a large memory based on dialogue history. It uses standard information retrieval techniques to select candidates for fine-grained selection, improving performance. The model extends Memory Network BID19 and Transformer BID21 to retrieve information from a large memory based on dialogue history. It uses standard information retrieval techniques to select candidates for fine-grained selection, improving performance. The system effectively calls the IR system three times with different queries, providing better performance. The top 7 articles are retrieved for each lookup, and sentences are flattened with article titles prepended for independent attention by the neural model in the next stage. An attention mechanism is used for fine-grained selection of knowledge sentences for producing the next dialogue turn.

The top 7 articles are retrieved for each lookup, and sentences are flattened with article titles prepended for independent attention by the neural model in the next stage. An attention mechanism is used for fine-grained selection of knowledge sentences for producing the next dialogue turn. Knowledge sentences are encoded with a Transformer encoder BID21, and dot-product attention is performed between memory candidates and dialogue context for utterance prediction. Different variants of knowledge attention and utterance prediction are considered for retrieval and generative models. The model utilizes a Transformer to encode dialogue context and candidate responses, minimizing cross-entropy loss during training. Two versions, Two-stage and End-to-end, are considered, both focusing on finding relevant knowledge and incorporating it into the response generation process. Beam search with a beam width of 5 is used to select the best response. The model employs a Transformer to encode dialogue context and candidate responses, using BPE encoding BID16 for effective rare word copying. In the End-to-end version, a shared Transformer encoder encodes all candidates and dialogue history, producing an attention prediction over the memory. The best knowledge is concatenated with the dialogue encoding and passed into a Transformer decoder. The model is trained to minimize negative log-likelihood.

The best knowledge is concatenated with the dialogue encoding and passed into a Transformer decoder. The model is trained to minimize negative log-likelihood. In the Two-stage version, two separately trained models are used for knowledge selection and utterance prediction. Knowledge dropout is employed to improve decoder performance. The model uses knowledge dropout to enhance decoder performance by preventing the model from attending to knowledge during training. This technique helps the generator handle errors better and speeds up training. The experimental setups and results are described, including the ability of models to select knowledge and predict human-selected knowledge in dialogue history. Transformers are compared against various baselines in the study. The study compares Transformers against various baselines in a two-stage architecture for dialogue generation. Transformers perform best when pretrained on a large dataset like Reddit. The best performing Transformer model is used in a generative Memory Network for the full dialogue task. Further analysis using other models is provided in the appendix. In dialogue generation, models are evaluated with knowledge in two settings: using gold knowledge chosen by a human or predicting which knowledge to use. Transformer Memory Networks are applied, improving model performance. Results show that adding knowledge enhances all models, with significant improvements when using gold knowledge. Generative experiments compare End-to-end and Two-stage Transformer models. Performance significantly improves when models are provided with gold knowledge compared to models without access to knowledge. Generative experiments compare End-to-end and Two-stage Transformer Memory Network models to baselines, showing that both models utilize knowledge in their responses. The Two-stage model performs better with predicted knowledge, while the End-to-end model excels in experiments with gold knowledge. The End-to-end model outperforms the Two-stage model in gold knowledge experiments, suggesting better knowledge utilization. Additional knowledge selection supervision in the End-to-end model improves performance on every metric. Knowledge dropout also proves beneficial. The conversation revolves around the preference for physical books over e-books due to the sensory experience and ownership feeling. Additionally, human evaluation of models using crowd-sourced workers is mentioned, with a focus on dialogue ratings. The study collected 546 conversations with ratings from 464 workers to evaluate dialogue partners based on engagingness and knowledge. Retrieval models outperformed generative models in terms of human engagingness. The study collected 546 conversations with ratings from 464 workers to evaluate dialogue partners based on engagingness and knowledge. Retrieval models significantly outperformed generative models in human engagingness evaluation, with both types trending towards using knowledge. Generative models showed improved engagingness ratings with the use of knowledge and conveyed more knowledge than retrieval models on both seen and unseen data sets. In this work, dialogue agents are developed with large memory systems containing encyclopedic knowledge to engage in open-domain conversations. Transformer Memory Network models are used to retrieve and output responses, either in retrieval or generative modes. The gap between retrieval and generative models is larger on unseen data, with retrieval models limited to responses from the training set. Additional analysis and examples can be found in the appendices. The Transformer Memory Network models are designed to retrieve and attend to knowledge from the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset for generating responses in dialogues. The benchmark dataset encourages further exploration in this research direction, with future work focusing on improving the engagingness of retrieval responses and investigating the relationship between retrieval and reasoning processes. The research focuses on using generative models for knowledge-grounded dialogue, learning to retrieve and reason simultaneously, and exploring the relationship between dialogue and existing QA tasks. The dataset includes conversations between a wizard with access to an information retrieval system and an apprentice. Knowledge retrieval is based on dialogue history, with apprentices asking questions in 13.9% of cases. The dataset involves conversations between a wizard and an apprentice, with apprentices asking questions 13.9% of the time. The wizard answers questions 39.5% of the time and makes new statements 49.3% of the time. Topics are chosen from the Persona-Chat dataset, where personas are created by crowdworkers. Each persona consists of 4-5 sentences describing interests, which are mapped to relevant topics. The dataset involves conversations between a wizard and an apprentice, with topics chosen from the Persona-Chat dataset. Each persona consists of sentences describing interests, mapped to relevant topics. A total of 1,431 topics were obtained for the task, with 2-3 related topic choices presented per dialogue during data collection. Additional experiments were conducted on knowledge selection tasks, testing the performance of models trained for the full dialogue task on knowledge selection. The results show that the retrieval system could effectively select relevant knowledge. The retrieval system performance and auxiliary loss impact on generative models were analyzed through human evaluation experiments. Human-human conversations differed significantly from bot conversations, with humans engaging in more small talk and using topics as icebreakers. The study analyzed the impact of retrieval system performance and auxiliary loss on generative models through human evaluation experiments. Humans engage in more small talk and use topics as icebreakers in conversations, contrasting with human-bot interactions where models tend to produce factual sentences. The retriever without knowledge is prone to non sequiturs, while the retriever with knowledge sticks to the chosen topic but struggles if the subject changes. The study compared retrieval methods for dialogue systems, showing that a two-stage retrieval system outperformed other models in terms of F1 score but not Recall@1. Human experiments were conducted to evaluate system performance, indicating the potential for improvement by focusing on knowledge selection subtask. The study suggests improving the retrieval system by focusing on the knowledge selection subtask. Human experiments compared the system's performance using Wiki F1 scores. The system sometimes provides factually inaccurate answers but also offers inviting responses for a more natural conversation flow. The generator with knowledge in the study has fewer issues with repetition and can act as a selfish conversationalist, providing accurate statements but sometimes producing statements using an. The generator with knowledge can act as a selfish conversationalist, providing accurate statements but sometimes using incorrect information. It may give formulaic responses but is able to generalize to new topics using Wikipedia knowledge. Selected conversations with this generator can be found in Figure 5."
