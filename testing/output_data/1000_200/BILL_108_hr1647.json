Congress finds that crane populations in many countries have declined significantly, endangering the long-term survival of species in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Five species of Asian cranes are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and the Convention. The Crane Action Plan of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature focuses on four crane species. The Crane Action Plan identifies seriously threatened crane species, including the hooded crane, wattled crane, blue crane, grey-crowned crane, black-crowned crane, sarus crane, whooping crane, and Mississippi sandhill crane. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 lists whooping cranes and Mississippi sandhill cranes as endangered species with populations at risk of extinction due to hunting and habitat loss. Cranes play a crucial role in conserving wetland and grassland ecosystems, and establishing conservation programs for cranes would benefit many other endangered species. Cranes face threats such as egg collection, poisoning, collisions with power lines, disturbance from human activities, and trapping for sale. International cooperation is needed to address these threats and protect cranes, which serve as ambassadors for promoting goodwill among countries. Conservationists highlight the importance of cranes as ambassadors for promoting goodwill among countries due to their migration across continents. Conservation efforts and successes in one region can be applied globally, as threats to cranes and their habitats are similar worldwide. Collaboration between government and private agencies in different countries, like the United States, is crucial for conserving threatened crane species. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes, support conservation programs in countries where endangered cranes occur, assist private organizations dedicated to crane conservation, and provide financial resources for these efforts. The term \"conservation\" in this Act refers to methods and procedures to ensure the population of crane species in the wild is sufficient to prevent extinction, including habitat protection, research, and management assistance. The curr_chunk discusses the provision of assistance in developing management plans for crane ranges, enforcement of the Convention, law enforcement and habitat protection through community participation, reintroduction of cranes to the wild, conflict resolution initiatives, and community outreach and education. The terms \"Convention,\" \"Fund,\" and \"Secretary\" are defined within the context of the Act. The curr_chunk discusses crane conservation assistance. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for crane conservation projects with approved proposals. Applicants must submit project proposals meeting specific requirements to be eligible for assistance. Eligible applicants include relevant wildlife management entities. Eligible applicants for financial assistance for crane conservation projects include wildlife management authorities in regions where cranes are found, the Secretariat of the Convention, and individuals or organizations with expertise in crane conservation. Project proposals must meet specific requirements to be considered for funding. Project proposals for crane conservation projects must include a concise statement of purpose, names and qualifications of project personnel, methods for implementation and assessment, staff and community management details, logistics, estimated funds, and project duration. Eligible applicants for funding include wildlife management authorities, the Convention Secretariat, and experts in crane conservation. Project proposals for crane conservation projects must include logistics, estimated funds, evidence of government support, matching funding details, and any other necessary information for project eligibility under this Act. The Secretary will review and approve projects based on these criteria. The Secretary will review project proposals for crane conservation projects to determine eligibility for assistance under this Act. Within 180 days of receiving a proposal, the Secretary will consult with relevant federal officials and the government of each country where the project will take place for approval or disapproval. The Secretary will consult with relevant federal officials and the government of each country where the project will take place for approval or disapproval of crane conservation project proposals. If approved, written notification will be provided to the applicant, federal officials, and countries involved. The project must enhance programs for conservation of cranes to be approved. The Secretary will approve crane conservation project proposals that enhance conservation programs, address conflicts between humans and cranes, ensure compliance with laws, and develop scientific information on crane habitat and population trends. The Secretary will approve crane conservation project proposals that focus on crane population numbers, trends, threats to habitat, promote cooperative projects among various entities, conduct scientific research, reintroduce cranes into the wild, and provide training for effective conservation efforts. The Secretary approves crane conservation projects focusing on population numbers, habitat threats, cooperative efforts, research, reintroduction, and training. Projects must enhance capacity for effective conservation, ensure long-term conservation, and have matching funds available. Recipients must submit periodic reports to the Secretary. The Secretary approves crane conservation projects focusing on population numbers, habitat threats, cooperative efforts, research, reintroduction, and training. Recipients must submit reports for evaluation and public access. A panel of experts is convened biennially to identify conservation needs. SEC. 6. CRANE CONSERVATION FUND. Establishment of the Crane Conservation Fund within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, consisting of transferred amounts, appropriations, and interest earned. Expenditures from the Fund can be made upon request by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Secretary. The Crane Conservation Fund allows the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer necessary amounts for assistance without further appropriation. Administrative expenses are limited to 3 percent or $80,000. Not more than 50 percent of the Fund can be used for North American crane species conservation projects. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for investing the remaining Fund amounts. The Secretary of the Treasury invests a portion of the Crane Conservation Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, either on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. The Fund's interest and proceeds from obligations can be sold at market price. The Crane Conservation Fund receives interest and proceeds from obligations, which are credited to the Fund. Amounts required to be transferred to the Fund are done monthly based on Treasury estimates. The Secretary can accept donations for providing assistance under section 5. The Secretary can accept donations to provide assistance under section 5, and the donations received will be transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the Fund. SEC. 7. ADVISORY GROUP. The Secretary may convene an advisory group of individuals involved in crane conservation. The group's meetings must be open to the public, provide opportunities for public input, and have meeting minutes available to the public. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Fund is set at $3,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2007, with funds remaining available until expended."
