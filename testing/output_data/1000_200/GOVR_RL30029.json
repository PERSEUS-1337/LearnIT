    "content": "Human history began in Africa, with human ancestors evolving into homosapiens around 200,000 years ago. Small bands of modern humans migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, becoming ancestors of all human populations. The Bantu people of West Africa expanded their settlement around 2,500-5,000 years ago, becoming predominant in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan language speakers are found in the Sahel grasslands and parts of eastern Africa. The Nilo-Saharan languages may have originated in the Nile valley, but the term \"Nilotic\" is no longer used due to intermingling with Bantu speakers. Iron use in Africa's origins are uncertain, but by 500 BC, the Bantu were skilled in smelting iron for successful agriculture. European explorers in Africa after 1450 AD found farmers growing a variety of crops. After Europeans explored the African coast post-1450 AD, they discovered farmers cultivating a wide range of crops, including unfamiliar foods like bananas. African farmers also raised cattle, although the tsetse fly limited cattle farming in the central region. With the discovery of America, African farmers adopted New World crops like maize and peanuts. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities across the continent, with some regions sustaining purely pastoral lifestyles. Large towns and cities had not yet developed, possibly due to the absence of large settlements. Large towns and cities had not developed in pre-colonial Africa due to the presence of parasites and diseases that evolved with homo sapiens in Africa. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were largely absent, and similar languages and cultural practices were widespread. Historians believe that Africans did not perceive common interests with members of large ethnic groups. African loyalties were embedded in extended families, clans, and patron-client relationships, with powerful individuals or chiefs consolidating authority through conquest and alliance. Kingdoms like the Kongo kingdom in the south of the Congo River estuary were ruled by powerful kings with royal relatives, showcasing great artistic achievements. The Kongo kingdom, ruled by a powerful king with royal relatives, showcased great artistic achievements. The Atlantic slave trade began in 1441, with millions of people taken from Africa over 400 years, mainly to Brazil and the Caribbean. The peak of the trade was in the eighteenth century due to plantation agriculture expansion in the Americas. The Atlantic slave trade peaked in the eighteenth century, with annual totals reaching 100,000 in some years. In 1807, the British parliament voted to end the trade, leading to the Royal Navy intercepting over 1,600 ships and freeing 160,000 captives. Despite efforts to stop the trade, slavery continued in the Americas until its abolition in the 1850s and 1860s. U.S. participation in the slave trade was banned in 1807 and reinforced in 1819, with limited success in halting the trade. The Atlantic slave trade conducted by European traders on the West African coast involved purchasing slaves with goods like guns, alcohol, and cloth. Slavery in Africa was practiced through capturing people during wars or as punishment, with some victims being kidnapped. Historians note that slaves in traditional African societies were often integrated into families or local armies, experiencing less harsh treatment compared to the New World plantations. The slave trade in Africa led to turmoil, war, and instability in West Africa. The exchange of slaves for guns fueled conflict, weakening Africa and making it vulnerable to European colonization. The slave trade in Africa caused political instability and weakened the continent, leaving it unprepared for European colonization. Indigenous political entities were expected to develop into nation-states, such as the kingdom of Ashanti in West Africa and Buganda in East Africa. These regions had strong central governments, advanced infrastructure, and growing trade, indicating potential for growth. In East Africa, the kingdom of Buganda was a powerful naval force on Lake Victoria under the rule of the Kabaka. Meanwhile, secondary empires relying on European military technology were emerging, promoting the spread of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa. Islamic influence had been growing in West and Northeast Africa through trade and immigration, leading to the rise of a West African Islamic empire centered on Sokoto in Nigeria. In East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar were expanding their influence. In West Africa, a series of holy wars led to the creation of a vast Islamic empire centered on Sokoto, Nigeria. In East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar were extending their power on the mainland, while Egypt was expanding its control in northeastern Africa. The Boers, descendants of Dutch, Huguenot, and German settlers, established a secondary empire in southern Africa by defeating the Zulu with modern rifles and cavalry tactics. The Boers defeated the powerful Zulu in key battles and established farms in grasslands areas recently depopulated by African wars. The European scramble for Africa halted the development of indigenous political entities, with all of sub-Saharan Africa under European control by 1920, except for Ethiopia and Liberia. Ethiopia thwarted Italian ambitions by defeating Italian troops at Adowa in 1896. Ethiopia thwarted Italian ambitions at Adowa in 1896, but was unable to oust Italians from Eritrea. Advances in medicine and military technology gave Europeans advantages in the scramble for Africa. Europe's military advantages allowed them to easily defeat African forces. Despite initial reluctance, many Africans did not resist colonial invasion. Some groups, such as the Ashanti and Zulu, did launch armed struggles. European leaders faced pressure from imperialists and nationalists to expand their territories in Africa. Anti-slavery activists and missionaries supported direct rule to end slavery and benefit from their efforts. Business interests, including the discovery of diamonds and gold in southern Africa, played a significant role in the colonization of Africa. Other colonial powers valued Africa's agricultural potential, with Germany seeking raw cotton in Tanganyika. King Leopold II of Belgium hid his profit motives behind humanitarian concerns. King Leopold II of Belgium successfully hid his profit motives behind humanitarian concerns, building a vast empire in the Congo through exploration and treaties. He gained recognition for his International Association of the Congo at the Berlin West Africa Conference, with support from Britain, Germany, and the U.S. President Chester Arthur. The Berlin conference established rules for acquiring colonies in Africa, limiting colonization to major powers like Britain, France, and Germany. Portugal also gained territories in Angola and Mozambique. By World War I, Britain emerged as the dominant power in Africa, with colonies stretching from southern Africa to Egypt. France held significant territories in West and Central Africa. The United States did not have colonies in Africa. The United States did not have colonies in Africa, but assisted the American Colonization Society in settling former slaves on the West African coast in 1820. The settlers established the Republic of Liberia in 1847 and used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples, leading to societal disintegration in the late twentieth century. The effects of European colonization in Africa, particularly in Liberia, led to societal disintegration in the late twentieth century. The consequences of Leopold's rule in Congo were notably negative, with widespread abuses including forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation as a policy tool. These atrocities were exposed by human rights activists and missionaries, shaping the narrative of exploitation in the region. The colonial era in Congo was marked by forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation as policy tools, leading to international scandal and reforms in 1908. Infrastructure improvements were seen in British and French-controlled territories, with public health standards rising and some education initiatives by Christian missions. Limited opportunities for higher education and employment in the modern sector empowered some Africans. During the colonial era in Africa, limited opportunities for higher education and employment in the modern sector empowered some Africans who later became leaders in independent Africa. European investment in Africa was limited, and colonial governments expected African colonies to pay for their own development. The colonial state heavily influenced the economy, regulating prices, crops, and investment, leading to the persistence of statist economic systems after independence. After independence, many African countries struggled with colonial economic policies that made them dependent on exporting primary products in exchange for manufactured goods. The prices of primary products performed poorly compared to manufactured goods, contributing to Africa's economic challenges. Colonial governments did not prioritize democracy, viewing the colonial state as a tool for control rather than a promoter of democratic values. Pressure for political rights and independence post-World War II often led to the imprisonment of critics by colonial regimes. During the colonial period, African countries faced authoritarian measures and limited political participation. Colonial authorities worked closely with local chiefs to maintain control and obtain labor and tax revenues. This cooperation with traditional authorities contributed to issues like corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism in independent Africa. The colonial authorities in Africa contributed to corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism by suppressing dissent and favoring tribal chiefs. They intensified ethnic divisions by grouping people into tribes and ruling indirectly through tribal leaders, which strengthened tribal loyalties. The colonial era in Africa saw the advancement of interests through tribal organizations and patronage of leaders, strengthening tribal loyalties. Today, ethnic divisions fuel violent politics, weaken institutions, and hinder economies. Colonial partition imposed artificial boundaries, hindering transport between countries. Europeans imposed bureaucratic states, suppressing indigenous political arrangements. The end of colonialism in Africa was hastened by World War II, weakening Britain and France. The war promoted democracy and resistance to aggression, resonating with Africa's nationalists. Basil Davidson referred to the denial of development opportunities for pre-colonial political entities as the \"black man's burden.\" During World War II, the United States and Britain agreed on war aims that affirmed the right of all peoples to choose their form of government. The United Nations Charter committed colonial powers to developing self-government in their territories. African nationalists, influenced by European and socialist ideas, organized opposition to colonial regimes after the war. They were inspired by movements in Asia and the struggle for social justice by black Americans. In the late 1940s, African nationalists, inspired by movements in Asia and the civil rights struggle in America, were influenced by W.E.B. DuBois. British policymakers foresaw African independence in the distant future, while France pursued assimilation policies in its colonies. Nationalist sentiments were growing across Africa by the early 1950s. In the 1950s, African nationalism was on the rise, leading to independence movements in British and French colonies. Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya gained independence in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Guinea's decision for independence in 1958 shocked France. In 1960, independence movements in Africa led to the emergence of 14 independent countries from French-held Africa. Belgium granted independence to the Belgian Congo in the same year. In southern Africa, independence was delayed due to substantial white populations opposing majority rule, leading to armed struggles for freedom. Rhodesia's white minority declared independence from Britain in 1965, resulting in UN sanctions. In Rhodesia, settlers issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain, leading to UN sanctions and a civil war. Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980 under a majority-elected government. Guerrilla wars occurred in Angola and Mozambique in the 1960s, with independence achieved in 1975. Namibia gained independence in 1990 after a U.N.-supervised election. In South Africa, white minority rule faced opposition for decades, culminating in the National Party taking power in 1948. In 1948, the National Party (NP) came to power in South Africa and implemented apartheid. Opposition to apartheid grew in the late 1960s, leading to a violent resistance campaign in the 1970s. In the 1980s, South Africa faced international isolation due to its apartheid policies, prompting some Afrikaner leaders to realize the unsustainable costs of defending apartheid. In the 1980s, South Africa faced international isolation due to apartheid. Afrikaner leaders realized the costs of defending apartheid were unsustainable. Secret discussions with the ANC led to a majority-based system with protections for minority interests. Nelson Mandela was freed in 1990, constitutional negotiations concluded in 1993, and universal-suffrage elections were held in 1994. Mandela became President in May of that year. In the early 1960s, African countries were experiencing economic growth with the construction of infrastructure projects. The Organization of African Unity was established in 1963 to promote solidarity among African nations. However, challenges such as civil wars and political instability were already emerging in the region. In the 1960s and 1970s, political instability and civil wars plagued many African countries, leading to economic decline. Authoritarian regimes and violent governments, such as Idi Amin's in Uganda, exacerbated the situation. Ethnic tensions in Nigeria resulted in a civil war, while coups and attempted coups were common in countries like Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. The annual economic growth rate in Sub-Saharan Africa fell significantly during this period. In the post-independence era, civil wars and political instability plagued many African countries, leading to economic decline. The impact of colonialism, ethnic divisions, and authoritarian rule were significant factors. Limited indigenous elites and a major population challenge added to the difficulties faced by independent Africa. Independent Africa faced challenges of civil wars, political instability, economic decline, and a major population increase from 1950 to 1990. The Cold War exacerbated conflicts by supplying arms to Marxist regimes in Ethiopia, Angola, and Mozambique, while the United States supported anti-Soviet authoritarian regimes in Zaire, Sudan, and Liberia. This competitive Cold War involvement strengthened anti-democratic governments on both sides. France's policy in Africa aimed to maintain great power status by cultivating special relationships with former colonies, seen as exclusive hunting grounds. These ties, often based on language, were criticized for supporting anti-democratic governments and inefficient economic policies marked by corruption. France's policy in Africa focused on close ties with \"francophone\" regimes in former Belgian colonies like Zaire and Rwanda, providing military and economic assistance. Critics argued that this support perpetuated corrupt and authoritarian regimes, while defenders believed it promoted stability and development. France began reducing its commitments in Africa after the Socialist Party's victory in 1997, but the future direction of French policy remains uncertain. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, scholars analyzed African states and societies to explain their difficulties. Some concluded that weak states, corrupted institutions, and personal ambitions of leaders hindered societal change and economic development. The concept of the \"failed state\" gained academic attention amidst media coverage of famine and conflict in countries like Somalia and Sudan. In the early 1990s, Africa faced economic difficulties with GDP growth lower than population growth. Positive developments included the end of the Cold War, changes in South Africa, and hopes for a stable future. In the mid-1990s, several African countries were experiencing GDP growth rates exceeding population growth rates due to free market economic reforms. Political reforms were also underway in authoritarian states in response to demands for democratization. National political conferences were held, representing various interests in civil society. In the 1990s, political reforms in Africa led to the emergence of civil society groups, multiple political parties, and free elections. Initially seen as a positive development, some analysts later criticized the rise of \"pseudo-democracies\" in countries like Kenya, Gabon, and Cameroon. In the 1990s, political reforms in Africa led to the emergence of civil society groups, multiple political parties, and free elections. However, some countries like Kenya, Gabon, and Cameroon have been criticized for creating \"pseudo-democracies\" by manipulating the electoral process and stifling opposition to hold on to power. This has led to a disappointing situation where governments maintain a facade of liberal democracy while repressing dissent behind a mask of legitimacy. Events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire have further discouraged advocates of democratization in Africa. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a 1999 military coup and exclusion of a qualified candidate from the Muslim north led to ethnic and religious divisions. In Zimbabwe, the opposition made gains in 2000 elections marred by violence and government takeover of white-owned farms. Sub-Saharan Africa's AIDS epidemic is worsening, with 25.3 million infected with HIV. The HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is severe, with 25.3 million infected individuals. The disease disproportionately affects the region, with about 10% of the world's population but over 70% of infected people. Uganda and Senegal have seen success in prevention campaigns, but overall infection rates in Africa are high, with some countries having over 20% of the adult population HIV-positive. The epidemic has already claimed an estimated 17 million lives, and mortality rates are increasing. The HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is severe, with high infection rates and increasing mortality. Armed conflicts in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries, have hindered development and created refugee crises. Economic performance in the region has been disappointing, with stagnant GDP growth. According to World Bank data, sub-Saharan Africa's GDP grew by 2.1% and 2.3% in 1998 and 1999, while the population increased by 2.6% and 2.4%, resulting in economic stagnation. South Africa's economy grew by only 0.6% in 1998 and 1.2% in 1999, delaying potential economic expansion in the region. Academic authors view sub-Saharan Africa as marginalized in the global economy due to its small share of global trade and investment. \"Afro-pessimists\" predict dim political and economic prospects for the continent in the coming years, with a study projecting increased international marginalization by 2015 due to demographics, disease, and poor governance. The interplay of demographics, disease, and poor governance will lead to Africa's increasing international marginalization in 2015. Most African states will miss out on global economic growth, with only a few countries faring better. Sub-Saharan Africa's problems will worsen, leading to ethnic tensions and conflicts that may spread across borders. Some observers reject this Afro-pessimistic view, attributing it to stereotypes and media sensationalism. In contrast to Afro-pessimistic views, some experts argue that Africa is experiencing positive changes, such as governments becoming more accountable, economic empowerment, and progress in addressing challenges. The International Monetary Fund acknowledges past economic stagnation but sees potential for an economic renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa also promotes the idea of an African Renaissance. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and other optimists believe in an African Renaissance, citing successful democratic transitions in countries like South Africa and Nigeria. Ambassador James Joseph also endorsed this concept, expressing confidence in Africa's future despite past setbacks. The optimistic school believes that the wave of elections in Africa has set precedents for further democratization. Despite economic disappointments, countries like Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda have shown strong GDP growth rates. With economic reforms and international support, optimists argue that many other African countries can follow suit. The Clinton Administration's policy towards Africa had an Afro-optimist tone, with President Clinton visiting six countries in 11 days in 1998. He spoke of an \"African Renaissance\" and highlighted the continent's natural resources and potential for a brighter future. In March-April 1998, President Clinton visited six countries in 11 days, emphasizing Africa's potential for growth and development. He praised the progress in democratization and economic growth in countries like Ghana, Mozambique, and Nigeria. Clinton highlighted the importance of democracy, peace, and prosperity in shaping a new Africa. President Clinton praised Nigeria for its progress in democratization and cooperation with the United States in combating international crime. He also emphasized the importance of combating the African HIV/AIDS epidemic and highlighted Africa's potential as a U.S. trading partner, particularly in oil imports. The Administration endorsed the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a congressional trade and investment initiative. The Administration supported the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a trade and investment initiative for Africa. They also launched various assistance initiatives in Africa, including the Leland Initiative for internet access and the Greater Horn of Africa Initiative to address food insecurity. Additionally, they initiated the LIFE Initiative to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and globally. The Administration launched the LIFE Initiative to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa and globally, involving various U.S. agencies. Challenges arose, such as the Somalia incident in 1993 affecting peacekeeping efforts during the Rwanda genocide in 1994. The United States and the United Nations hesitated in sending peacekeepers during the Rwanda genocide in 1994. President Clinton admitted to Rwandans that they did not act quickly enough. The Administration worked on strengthening Africa's peacekeeping capabilities through the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) and trained African armed forces for peacekeeping duties. They also helped Nigerian battalions prepare for peacekeeping in Sierra Leone. U.S. officials mediated in African conflicts, with the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea being a notable success. Africa's numerous other conflicts remained a source of frustration. The Clinton Administration's efforts in Africa included the signing of a peace agreement in Algiers in 2000, attended by Secretary of State Albright. However, other conflicts in Africa hindered economic growth and political reform. Trade with Africa during the Clinton years showed mixed results, with slower growth in imports and exports compared to overall U.S. trade. Most trade was with a few countries, particularly oil producers and South Africa, with petroleum accounting for over half of imports. U.S. investment in sub-Saharan Africa was also significant. Sub-Saharan Africa's significance in U.S. foreign policy dates back to 1958 when a Bureau of African Affairs was established. U.S. investments in the region, particularly in the petroleum sector, accounted for a small percentage of total foreign direct investment. Major U.S. firms have made significant investments in Africa, such as Southwestern Bell in telecommunications and Caterpillar Inc. in various countries. The Eisenhower Administration faced an African crisis in 1960 with the Congo rebellion, fearing Soviet exploitation. The Kennedy Administration was more supportive of African nationalists but was limited by Cold War pressures. President Kennedy approved funding for a controversial dam in Ghana. During the Johnson Administration, US policy in Africa focused on Congo (Zaire), where covert aid was provided to suppress communist-inspired rebellions. Mobutu Sese-Seko solidified his position as Zaire's president with US backing, while limited military assistance was given due to concerns over another Vietnam. During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, US Africa policy shifted to southern Africa, focusing on Angola, Mozambique, and Rhodesia. Political controversy arose over perceived sympathy towards white minority regimes, with Henry Kissinger attributing Soviet opportunism and adventurism in Africa. Congressional restrictions on involvement in Angola in 1975 were criticized by Kissinger as avoiding confrontation with Soviet expansionism. President Jimmy Carter's Administration continued the Africa policy shift from 1977-1981. President Jimmy Carter's Administration (1977-1981) emphasized human rights in U.S. foreign policy, advocating for majority rule in Zimbabwe, independence for Namibia, and criticizing apartheid in South Africa. The Administration also pushed for reforms in Zaire but was constrained by Cold War considerations. In response to Soviet and Cuban gains in sub-Saharan Africa, the Carter Administration faced pressure to act, particularly in Ethiopia where a pro-Soviet regime had emerged. The Carter Administration responded to Soviet and Cuban gains in sub-Saharan Africa by forging ties with Somalia, which led to the Ogaden War in 1977-1978. Cuba sent troops to assist Ethiopia, but their advance halted at the Somalia border, averting a crisis. The Administration also opposed mandatory sanctions against South Africa and expressed concerns about Cuban troops in Angola. During the Reagan Administration, there was a concern about Cuban troops assisting the Marxist regime in Angola. The Administration supported covert aid to UNITA and launched a covert aid program in 1986. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker favored a policy of \"linkage\" to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for Namibia's independence. Despite political opposition, a regional peace agreement was achieved in 1988 under U.S. leadership. Critics believed the U.S. was not pushing hard enough for political change in South Africa. During the George H.W. Bush Administration, Africa policymakers focused on the Horn of Africa. In 1991, they successfully facilitated a peaceful transition in Ethiopia, averting a potential upheaval. However, Somalia faced clan violence, drought, and famine, leading to a humanitarian crisis by 1992. As a result, Bush sent U.S. troops for a multi-national humanitarian intervention before leaving office. In 1992, Bush sent U.S. troops for a multi-national humanitarian intervention in Somalia, credited with saving thousands despite American losses in 1993. The Bush Administration also pushed for reforms in Africa to promote democracy and economic liberalization. Congress passed the African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000 to boost U.S. trade with Africa and authorized funds for global HIV/AIDS efforts. Under the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000, Congress authorized $300 million in FY2001 and FY2002 for a comprehensive HIV/AIDS effort worldwide. The FY2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations provided $300 million in Development Assistance for HIV/AIDS, with over half expected to go towards African programs. Additionally, previous acts such as the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act, African Conflict Resolution Act, and South African Democratic Transition Support Act have been enacted to promote African food security, peaceful resolution of conflicts, and democracy in South Africa. Congress also created the Development Fund for Africa in 1990. In 1990, Congress created the Development Fund for Africa to support democracy in South Africa. In 1992, the Horn of Africa Recovery and Food Security Act was passed to promote democracy in the region. In 1986, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act was enacted to set policy objectives for the United States in South Africa. In 1985, Congress passed an emergency appropriation for African famine relief. In 1985, Congress passed a large emergency supplemental appropriation for African famine relief (P.L. 99-10) following extensive media coverage of famine in Ethiopia and Sudan. The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 repealed the Clark Amendment, which prohibited aid for military operations in Angola. In 1971, the Clark Amendment prohibited aid for military operations in Angola, with a waiver option through a joint resolution. The Byrd Amendment partially exempted the US from UN sanctions on Rhodesia by prohibiting the enforcement of the trade embargo on critical materials. The curr_chunk provides a list of books on Africa and United States foreign policy towards Africa, including works by authors such as Basil Davidson, Adam Hochschild, and John Reader. The curr_chunk lists various CRS Issue Briefs on Africa, including topics such as U.S. foreign assistance, AIDS, Congo, Nigeria's political transition, Sudan's humanitarian crisis, peace talks, terrorism, and U.S. policy."
