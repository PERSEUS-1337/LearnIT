    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program, established within the Environmental Protection Agency, promotes water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations through voluntary labeling. The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for promoting WaterSense labeled products as preferred technologies in the market. The Agency promotes WaterSense labeled products for reducing water use and ensuring performance. They enhance public awareness of WaterSense through outreach and research. Performance standards are established for WaterSense products to outperform less efficient ones. Proper installation by certified professionals is emphasized. The WaterSense program requires certified professionals for installation and maintenance of plumbing and irrigation systems to ensure optimal performance. They also regularly review and update criteria for products, buildings, and services, and collect data on market shares of WaterSense labeled items. The WaterSense program regularly estimates and discloses water and energy savings from using WaterSense labeled products, buildings, and services. They also seek feedback from the public before establishing or revising criteria, and provide notice of any changes with explanations. The WaterSense program ensures transparency by estimating and disclosing water and energy savings from its labeled products, buildings, and services. They also seek public feedback before making any changes to criteria, providing explanations and responding to comments. Additionally, they give appropriate lead time before implementing new or revised criteria and consider voluntary approaches like labeling waterless devices. Authorization of appropriations for water efficiency initiatives is set at $7.5 million for 2016, $10 million for 2017, $20 million for 2018, and $50 million for 2019 and beyond, adjusted for inflation. Federal procurement of water efficient products is mandated. In this section, definitions include terms such as \"agency,\" \"WaterSense product or service,\" \"WaterSense program,\" \"FEMP designated product,\" and \"product and service.\" These terms relate to water efficiency and energy management programs. In procurement, agencies must acquire water-efficient products like WaterSense or FEMP designated products, excluding combat-related items and those covered by federal regulations. WaterSense plumbing products should ideally be installed by WaterSense-certified individuals. In procurement, agencies must acquire WaterSense or FEMP designated products, excluding combat-related items and those covered by federal regulations. WaterSense plumbing products should ideally be installed by certified individuals. Agencies are not required to procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products if not cost-effective over the product's life. The head of an agency must incorporate criteria for rating WaterSense products and FEMP designated products into procurement specifications and evaluation factors for offers received. The head of an agency must consider additional measures for reducing water consumption, including reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies, leak detection, and waterless products. WaterSense products and FEMP designated products must be clearly identified in federal catalogs by the General Services Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency. The Defense Logistics Agency and the General Services Administration are required to supply WaterSense or FEMP designated products, unless specified otherwise in writing. The Environmental Protection Agency must issue regulations within 180 days to implement this requirement. SEC. 4. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The section defines key terms like Administrator, eligible entity, incentive program, and residential water efficient products. Eligible entities include government bodies, utilities, and nonprofits. The incentive program aims to provide financial incentives for residential water efficient products and services. Residential water efficient products or services are defined as those rated for water efficiency and performance by the WaterSense program or an approved incentive program. Categories include faucets, irrigation technologies, water treatment devices, toilets, and showerheads. The WaterSense program certifies residential water efficient products like faucets, irrigation technologies, toilets, and showerheads through third-party testing and certification. The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States. The WaterSense program certifies residential water efficient products. Eligible entities can receive allocations by establishing incentive programs for consumers, submitting applications, and providing assurances to the Administrator. The Administrator determines allocations for eligible entities based on population served, targeted population for incentive programs, and program effectiveness. The entity must assure funds will supplement, not supplant, existing funds for the program. Entities allocated funds based on population served, targeted population, and program effectiveness. Funds can cover up to 50% of program costs. Fixture recycling is encouraged. Financial incentives may be provided to consumers meeting program requirements.

SEC. 139F. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. This section introduces incentive programs for water-efficient products. SEC. 139F. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. Gross income excludes amounts received under the Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015. No double benefit allowed for expenditures covered by the incentive program. Adjusted basis of property reduced by excluded amounts. Conforming amendment made to the tax code.
