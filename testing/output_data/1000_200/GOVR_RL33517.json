    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose rescinding funding from an appropriations act by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve within 45 days, the funding must be made available for agencies to use. President George W. Bush advocated for a line-item veto to address excessive earmark projects. The Administration proposed the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 to address excessive earmark projects. The bill introduced expedited rescission, requiring at least one house to vote on presidential rescission proposals. Enhanced rescission, previously available under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, favored the President by permanently canceling spending reductions unless Congress enacted a disapproval bill. Expedited rescission bills focus on procedural changes in Congress to ensure immediate approval of the President's rescission request. Congressional approval is still necessary, but fast-track procedures encourage an up-or-down vote on the proposal, transferring less power from Congress to the President compared to other approaches modifying the ICA framework. Expedited rescission bills aim to streamline the process of approving the President's rescission requests by implementing fast-track procedures in Congress. These bills transfer less power from Congress to the President compared to other approaches modifying the ICA framework. In the past, the House passed expedited rescission bills in 1992, 1993, and 1994, with specific provisions such as allowing the President to propose rescissions within three days of signing an appropriations act. H.R. 1578, passed by the House in 1993, allowed the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding. It included provisions for expedited judicial review and fast-track procedures for consideration of a rescission's substitute. In 1994, H.R. 4600 passed with a substitute amendment for strengthened expedited rescission, allowing submission of a special rescission message at any time. H.R. 4600, approved by the House, allowed submission of a special rescission message at any time and authorized special messages proposing the repeal of targeted tax benefits. A draft expedited rescission bill, titled the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, was introduced by the White House on March 7, 2006. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, introduced as H.R. 4890 and S. 2381, proposed to amend the Impoundment Control Act by allowing the President to propose rescissions of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, and targeted tax benefits in a special message to Congress. The President would have flexibility in submitting these messages with no time constraints and the ability to include multiple rescissions in a single message. The LLIVA allows the President to propose rescissions in special messages without time constraints. Rescissions can include budget authority from multiple laws and must be used for deficit reduction. Committee allocations and spending caps would need to be adjusted within five days of enactment. Rescission requests from the President would be considered under fast-track procedures. The President's proposed bill under LLIVA allows for expedited procedures in Congress, with a quick introduction and limited debate. Committees have five days to report the bill, and a vote must occur within 10 days of introduction. No amendments are allowed, and the President can withhold budget authority for up to 180 days. The LLIVA bill allows the President to withhold budget authority for up to 180 days and suspend the execution of direct spending for the same period. This provision is unique in expedited rescission bills and aims to give Congress time to consider the President's proposals before funds are released. Critics of the 180-day withholding mechanism in the LLIVA bill argue that it could lead to abuse and unnecessary delays in Congress, as expedited procedures usually ensure a final vote within a month. They believe a shorter period than 180 days would be sufficient for Congress to act on a President's proposal. Additionally, they are concerned that the provisions could potentially allow for multiple 180-day withholding periods, which they view as potentially sanctioning policy deferrals that were invalidated in previous court cases. The LLIVA bill includes a 180-day provision for withholding funds, with the option for early release if the President deems it necessary. The bill's language allows for severability, meaning that if any part is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains in effect. It would become effective upon signing and applies only to specific purposes. The LLIVA bill, H.R. 4890 / S. 2381, includes a provision for expedited rescission of spending or tax provisions in bills enacted after its passage. Other measures with similar provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress, such as H.R. 2290, which authorizes the President to propose rescissions of \"wasteful\" budget authority. The President could propose to reduce discretionary spending limits under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by an amount not exceeding the proposed rescission. H.R. 2290 limits the President to one message per appropriations act, unless accounts fall under multiple subcommittees. Representative Mark Udall introduced H.R. 4699 for expedited rescission in the 109th Congress. Mark Udall introduced H.R. 4699 in the 109th Congress, known as the \"Stimulating Leadership in Cutting Expenditures Act (or SLICE Act) of 2006,\" to allow the President to propose spending cuts for Congress to debate and vote on. The bill includes provisions for special messages and expedited procedures for rescinding budget authority provided in appropriations acts or the Omnibus Transportation Authorization Act. The President can submit multiple messages for different appropriations subcommittees. The Expedited Budget Item Veto Review Act of 2006, introduced by Senator John Kerry, allows the President to propose cancelling discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits. The President can submit a special message proposing cancellations within three days of enactment, with provisions for identifying limited tax benefits. Expedited procedures aim to ensure a vote on final passage of an approval bill within 10 legislative days. The omnibus reform bill introduced by Representative John Spratt, H.R. 5667, includes a legislative line item veto allowing the President to propose canceling discretionary spending and limited tax benefit provisions. Direct spending is not covered, and there is a limit of one special message per bill. H.R. 5667 proposes a line item veto for discretionary spending and limited tax benefits, with one special message allowed per bill. The bill allows for expedited congressional consideration of the President's proposals, with limited amendments permitted. The House Budget Committee and Rules Committee approved an amended version of the bill, which was later passed by the House. On June 22, the House approved H.R. 4890 by a vote of 247-172. Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act, including a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. The Senate Budget Committee voted 12-10 to report the bill favorably. Table 1 provides a comparison of major features in three expedited rescission bills. The House approved H.R. 4890 and the Senate Budget Committee reported Title I of S. 3521. There are differences among the versions, with modifications to lessen the President's flexibility. For example, the House-passed version of H.R. 4890 requires submission of special messages within 45 days of enactment, while S. 3521 allows submission up to one year. The House-passed version of the bill allows for more special messages compared to the Senate version. The House version also allows the President to withhold funds for up to 180 days, while the Senate version limits withholding to 45 days. The House-passed version of the bill allows the President to withhold funds for up to 180 days, while the Senate version limits withholding to 45 days. The House version includes a 45-day extension, totaling 90 days, with a sunset termination date after six years. The Senate version stipulates termination after four years. Both versions narrow the range of targeted tax benefits for cancellation compared to the Administration's proposal. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 allows the President to withhold funds for up to 180 days, while the Senate version limits withholding to 45 days. Both versions narrow the range of targeted tax benefits for cancellation compared to the Administration's proposal. The House version includes a 45-day extension, totaling 90 days, with a sunset termination date after six years, while the Senate version stipulates termination after four years. The Senate Budget Committee version and the 1996 act would require the Joint Committee on Taxation to identify the targeted tax benefits, while the House-passed version would require the chairmen of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees to identify such provisions. The President could only propose a rescission of such identified tax benefits. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 allows the President to propose targeted tax benefits for rescission. It also repeals the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, except for certain sections. The current bills aim to enhance the President's authority to propose rescissions, potentially replacing the authority under the ICA. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 enhances the President's authority to propose rescissions, potentially replacing the authority under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. A manager's amendment clarified that any cancelled funds from a trust or special fund would be returned to the original fund. Substantive changes to H.R. 4890 occurred during committee markups, with no further changes during floor consideration. The House-passed version of H.R. 4890/S. 2381 enhances the President's authority to propose rescissions, potentially replacing the authority under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Changes in H.R. 4890 occurred during committee markups, with a manager's amendment making adjustments to Title I regarding the legislative line item veto in S. 3521. The bill would prohibit the President from resubmitting rejected items of direct spending or targeted tax benefits by Congress, but allow resubmission of proposed cancellations if Congress fails to act due to adjournment. The provisions for expedited consideration of special messages proposing rescissions of funds have remained similar over the years. Various versions of expedited rescission bills in the 109th Congress seek to ensure a vote on final passage of the approval bill within 10 days. Expedited rescission bills have differed in scope, with some allowing consideration of substitute packages or motions to strike specific rescissions. None of the bills in the 109th Congress, except H.R. 5667, contain such provisions. In the 109th Congress, expedited rescission bills have varied in scope, with some focusing on discretionary budget authority while others include direct spending and targeted tax benefits. H.R. 4699 would allow the President to cancel certain transportation projects. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996, with its broad rescission powers, was considered by supporters to have an expansive coverage. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 had constitutional flaws and provisions for judicial review. The expedited rescission approach for discretionary spending is seen as constitutionally sound. The LLIVA includes a severability provision to protect the act if one part is found unconstitutional. This allows the President to submit special rescission messages for expedited consideration. The President seeks enactment of the Line Item Veto Act to target pork in spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline. The expedited rescission approach allows for special rescission messages for quick consideration. The President called on the Senate to pass the line item veto quickly for his signature."
