    "content": "The role of natural gas in the U.S. economy has been a major part of the energy policy debate in Congress. Both the House and the Senate have held hearings on natural gas, with numerous bills introduced. This report highlights global natural gas markets, supply and demand, and major U.S. developments. Natural gas is considered a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy due to its cleaner burning properties compared to coal and oil. Natural gas, whether intentional or unintentional, is released during industry operations. The United States leads in shale gas extraction, with potential for natural gas to play a larger role in the global economy. LNG exports started in 2016, and future market growth depends on various factors. In 2016, the United States began exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the lower 48 states. Factors like price, technical capability, environmental concerns, and political considerations will impact the market. Natural gas consumption is increasing globally, with the U.S. consuming the most at 23%. The country's unconventional natural gas reserves are significant. In 2015, global natural gas consumption grew by 1.7%, with the U.S. consumption increasing by 3%. Shale gas now makes up 51% of U.S. natural gas reserves and 56% of production, leading to a potential shift from net importer to net exporter. The world consumed 122,442 bcf of natural gas in 2015, with the U.S. being the largest consumer at 27,463 bcf. Global trade in natural gas is increasing, making the market more integrated. In 2015, the United States was the world's largest consumer of natural gas, accounting for 22.8% of global consumption. Russia followed as the second-largest consumer, with natural gas making up 53% of its total energy consumption. Despite a decline in Russia's natural gas consumption, global consumption grew by 1.7%, with the U.S. contributing the largest growth in absolute terms. Iran and China also experienced increased consumption rates. China, with its growing economy and large population, is one of the world's largest energy consumers. While coal remains the primary source, natural gas consumption has been increasing, accounting for about 5% of energy consumption. Iran, holding the world's second-largest natural gas reserves, has seen stagnation in its energy sector due to sanctions and lack of investment. Domestic demand in Iran has risen by 50% since 2004, with natural gas making up 60% of its total energy consumption. Iran's domestic energy demand has increased by 50% since 2004, with natural gas comprising 60% of its total energy consumption. The lifting of international sanctions in 2016 has raised discussions on Iran's natural gas production capacity and its role in the global energy market. In 2015, the United States consumed 27,463 bcf of natural gas, making up nearly 23% of global consumption. The U.S. is the largest consumer of natural gas and the second-largest consumer of energy worldwide, with electric power generation accounting for 35% of natural gas consumption. In 2015, 35% of U.S. natural gas consumption was for industrial use (27%), residential use (17%), and commercial use (12%). The rise in natural gas use for electric power generation is due to low prices and emission reduction policies. Demand for power generation has doubled since 2000 and is expected to grow by 40% by 2040. The U.S. industrial sector increased natural gas consumption by 10% between 2010 and 2015. Global proved natural gas reserves amount to 6,599,400 bcf. Global proved natural gas reserves amounted to 6,599,400 bcf in 2015, showing a 19% growth since 2005. The top 10 reserve holding companies are mostly government-owned, with Russia's Gazprom and Iran's National Iranian Oil Company being significant players. In 2015, U.S. natural gas reserves were 368,700 bcf, with shale gas driving the increase. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2%, below the 10-year average. U.S. production accounted for 22% of global production, increasing by 5.4% in 2015. The United States saw a 5.4% increase in natural gas production in 2015, reaching 27,086 bcf. This growth was mainly driven by unconventional resources like the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. Despite low prices, U.S. natural gas production has been steadily rising, with a 65% increase between 2005 and 2015. By 2040, shale gas production is projected to increase by 73%, leading to a 45% overall increase in total U.S. natural gas production. LNG, a liquid form of natural gas, is being used for global shipments. In 2015, LNG trade increased by 1.8%, with LNG making up 33% of the global gas trade. Countries like Australia and the United States launched their first LNG shipments in response to the growing demand. The United States had initially planned to increase LNG imports but shifted focus to domestic production due to rising prices. The rise in gas prices led to a decrease in the need for LNG import terminals as domestic gas production increased. There is a push to modify and expand existing LNG terminals in the U.S. to increase export capacity, requiring approval from the Department of Energy and FERC. Technologies like hydraulic fracturing have boosted domestic gas supply, making unconventional resources economically competitive. Production has shifted to regions with unconventional gas sources. The rise in gas prices led to a decrease in the need for LNG import terminals as domestic gas production increased. Production has shifted away from traditional sources to expansive shale resources like the Marcellus and Utica Basins in the East and Northeast. This shift has reduced the need for natural gas from other regions, leading to a decrease in imports. The United States is projected to become a net exporter of natural gas by 2017 due to increased production from shale plays. The United States has transitioned from a net importer to a projected net exporter of natural gas by 2017, with LNG shipments from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal to various countries. The Panama Canal reopening offers a potential shipping route for U.S. LNG to Asian markets, but only 10% of LNG carriers can fit through. This strategic position in the global natural gas market raises questions for policymakers. The United States' transition to a net exporter of natural gas has strategic advantages in the global market, prompting questions about the impact on domestic prices and the economy. Concerns persist about shale gas resources, development costs, and potential limitations. Water use in hydraulic fracturing is a key issue, with worries about water quality, competition, and wastewater disposal. The EPA initiated a study in 2010 to assess these concerns. The EPA initiated a study in 2010 to assess the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water, deep-well injection, and human-induced earthquakes. Concerns also include methane emissions from the natural gas sector, which contribute to smog and greenhouse gas effects. State and local authorities regulate natural gas systems. The EPA established national air standards in 2012 to reduce methane emissions in the natural gas sector. Updated in 2016, the standards cover natural gas well sites, processing plants, and compressor stations. However, federal regulations do not include all methane sources, posing a challenge as natural gas production expands in the US. The issue of methane as an air pollutant is significant for policymakers as natural gas production expands in the US. Global LNG trade is increasing, with LNG's share of the global gas trade at 33%. U.S. LNG exports have pressured other countries to delink their gas exports from oil-indexed prices. U.S. LNG exports have influenced other countries to move away from oil-indexed gas prices in their contracts. Most international natural gas trade operates under long-term agreements, typically lasting 20 years, due to the high cost of transportation. LNG producers can sell excess gas on the spot market, which is expanding. Russia is the largest natural gas exporter through pipelines to Europe, while Qatar leads in LNG exports. Europe relies heavily on natural gas imports, primarily from Russia, Norway, and Algeria via pipelines. Recent tensions between Russia and Ukraine have prompted the European Union to seek more secure gas sources. Asia, the largest importer of natural gas, mainly relies on LNG, with China increasingly importing gas via pipelines from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan. The United States and Canada have well-integrated pipeline systems. China is the primary importer of natural gas from Turkmenistan, receiving over 70% of its exports. The United States and Canada have an integrated pipeline system for natural gas exports. U.S. exports are expected to increase to Mexico and Canada by 2040. U.S. LNG prices are market-based, creating economic incentives for exports. The first U.S. LNG cargo was shipped to Brazil in 2016, sparking debates on global market impact and domestic prices. The U.S. natural gas market is a center of debate for policymakers, focusing on global market impact, geopolitics, and domestic prices. Currently, there are multiple LNG export terminal projects in operation and under construction in the lower-48 states, including Sabine Pass Liquefaction, Dominion-Cove Point LNG, Cameron LNG, Freeport LNG Expansion, and Cheniere Marketing-Corpus Christi LNG. Additionally, the Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska supplies LNG to Japan, and the U.S. began shipping LNG to Barbados in cryogenic containers from Miami, FL in February 2016. In 2014, LNG was shipped to Honolulu, HI in cryogenic containers, marking the first time to the state. Alaska has vast natural gas potential, with estimates exceeding 200,000 bcf on the North Slope. However, most gas is reinjected for oil production. Alaskan officials advocate for a pipeline to sell natural gas. Alaska has vast natural gas potential, but most of it is used for oil production. Officials push for a pipeline to sell gas internationally. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) may impact U.S. natural gas trade, granting free trade status to key LNG consumers. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to promote trade and economic growth between the U.S. and EU. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a proposed trade agreement between the United States and the EU, focusing on market access, regulation, and cooperation. It would also grant free trade status for natural gas. The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris led to the Paris Agreement, which the US signed in 2016. Concerns exist about US infrastructure keeping up with growing supplies. The United States signed the agreement on April 22, 2016, concerning infrastructure challenges in keeping up with growing supplies, particularly in gas pipelines built in the 1950s and 1960s. Investment in natural gas interstate pipelines is estimated to be between $2.6 billion to $3.5 billion annually from 2015 to 2030, posing difficulties due to other infrastructure demands. Factors affecting domestic and international markets include oil prices, new infrastructure, technological development, interdependence between gas and electric sectors, and climate and environmental policies. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), known as gas OPEC, is a cartel organization based in Qatar comprising 11 natural gas producing countries. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), also known as gas OPEC, is a cartel organization based in Qatar with 11 natural gas producing countries. Together, they hold a significant portion of global natural gas reserves and trade. The GECF is unlikely to impact U.S. natural gas consumption due to the U.S.'s resource base. Europe, heavily reliant on imports from GECF members like Russia and Algeria, may be more vulnerable to cartel control. Global natural gas production in 2015 grew by 2.2%, with the United States surpassing Russia as the world's largest producer in 2009. Most countries are evaluating their potential natural gas resources, but significant commercial production outside of the US and Canada is unlikely before the end of the decade. Most countries lack the data, technology, and equipment to exploit shale gas resources. Natural gas prices in the US, Canada, and UK are market-driven, with the Henry Hub in Louisiana being a key hub. Different consumer categories pay varying prices, with residential consumers paying the highest. EIA projects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price to reach $7.85 per million British thermal units by 2040. By 2040, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price is projected to rise to $7.85 per million British thermal units (MBtu) due to increased demand. Well completions will need to increase to meet production levels. Natural gas is commonly sold under long-term contracts linked to the price of crude oil. The natural gas industry is facing pressure to move away from contracts linked to oil prices. Some producers are starting to incorporate spot prices into their pricing formulas, reflecting regional disparities. Asia is willing to pay high prices for natural gas supplies. Take-or-pay clauses and destination clauses are also important contract concepts. The natural gas industry is evolving with the use of take-or-pay and destination clauses in contracts. Take-or-pay clauses require buyers to pay regardless of gas receipt, while destination clauses allow redirection of cargo. The industry is debating whether natural gas should become the primary energy source globally, with demand expected to increase by 60% by 2040 according to the International Energy Agency. The International Energy Agency predicts a 60% increase in natural gas demand by 2040, with most growth coming from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. As North America leads in unconventional gas production, China's shift to a services-focused economy may impact future energy consumption trends. China's shift to a services-focused economy will reduce energy consumption by 85%, leading to uncertainty in future energy predictions. India is expected to contribute significantly to global energy demand, requiring a substantial financial commitment of nearly $2.8 trillion. The U.S. electric power industry is driving growth in natural gas demand due to various factors, including government policies on carbon dioxide emissions. Global natural gas usage is influenced by government policies on carbon dioxide emissions. By 2040, it is projected to make up 28% of global electricity generation, with non-OECD countries accounting for 61%. Production needs to increase to meet demand and prevent price spikes, with growth expected in all regions except Europe. Unconventional gas resources like coal bed methane, shale gas, and tight gas are driving global supply growth, but development outside North America is slower. China faces challenges in fully utilizing its gas production capacity due to limited water availability, geology, and population density in resource-rich areas. Limited water availability, geology, and population density in resource-rich areas may hinder efforts to maximize global natural gas production capacity."
