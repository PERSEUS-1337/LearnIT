    "content": "REGULATION OF PAYROLL TAX DEPOSIT AGENTS: An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 adds a new section regarding payroll tax deposit agents. The Secretary will establish a system for the registration and renewal of payroll tax deposit agents, including fees, bonding or audit options, required disclosures, and ensuring direct deposits. The system for registering payroll tax deposit agents will include required disclosures, direct notification of employers by tax authorities, and penalties for unregistered agents. For the purposes of this section, a payroll tax deposit agent is defined as a person providing payroll processing or tax services to employers with authority to access funds for tax deposits. The term includes unemployment insurance contributions. If a payroll tax deposit agent chooses to submit a bond, the amount is specified. If a payroll tax deposit agent elects to submit a bond under subsection (a)(1)(B), the bond amount must be between $50,000 and $500,000. The bond must have the required surety as per regulations. An annual audit, conducted by an independent third party, is required if the agent opts for it under subsection (b)(1)(B), focusing on the escrow account. The Secretary may determine necessary audit principles for payroll tax deposit agents, including balancing escrow accounts yearly, ensuring funds are not mixed with operating funds, no misuse of funds, and providing evidence of tax payments. Agents must disclose these requirements to clients before or at the time of contracting for services. The Secretary requires payroll tax deposit agents to disclose clients' liability for all Federal and State employment taxes, provide mechanisms to verify tax deposits, and offer additional necessary information for selecting agents. The Secretary mandates payroll tax deposit agents to provide essential information for employers to select and use agents, including making tax deposits, filing tax returns, and accessing confidential tax information. Regulations will be prescribed to enforce this section. The amendment to Section 6672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code now includes payroll tax deposit agents. This does not affect the interpretation of the section as it was before. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in chapter 77. The amendments regarding payroll tax deposit agents under Section 7529 will take effect upon the enactment of the Act, with penalties applying to failures after the enactment date."
