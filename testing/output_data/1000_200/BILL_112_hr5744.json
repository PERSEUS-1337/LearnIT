The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, protect endangered species, and provide efficiency tools for project streamlining. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" as areas with a high risk of wildfire impact on key ecosystems, wildlife, and habitats on Federal lands. The technical report titled \"Development of Coarse-Scale Spatial Data for Wildland Fire and Fuel Management\" (RMRS-87) dated April 2000 or any subsequent revision is referenced. The term \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" is defined as measures developed for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed restoration, or habitat protection. It may include livestock grazing and timber harvest projects. The term \"Federal land\" includes land of the National Forest System and public lands, excluding areas where vegetation removal is prohibited by Federal law unless in an inventoried roadless area or wilderness study area. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. \"Threatened and endangered species habitat\" on Federal land is where natural fire regimes are crucial for endangered or threatened species. Endangered or threatened species can be identified in a species recovery plan or a notice published in the Federal Register. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. Authorized wildfire prevention projects will be implemented in at-risk forests and on threatened and endangered species habitat, focusing on reducing surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Projects on endangered species habitat aim to enhance protection from wildfires and comply with guidelines. In authorized wildfire prevention projects, domestic livestock grazing may be used to reduce surface fuel loads and recover burned areas. Utilization standards do not apply in these projects. Timber harvesting and thinning are also allowed in these projects. In authorized wildfire prevention projects, domestic livestock grazing and timber harvesting/thinning are used to reduce fuel loads and prevent catastrophic wildfires. The projects do not require revisions to land management plans, and public petitions for land designation must be reviewed within 60 days. When a petition is submitted for land designation as at-risk forest or habitat for threatened species, the Secretary must review and make a determination within 60 days. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. The Secretary must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register for public comment. Specific written comments related to the project can be submitted within 30 days. Within 60 days of the notice, the final project will be designated after considering received comments, and only those who commented on the proposed project can submit further comments. The Secretary must publish a notice of final designated wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register. Specific written comments related to the final project can be submitted within 30 days of the publication. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws and conduct authorized projects accordingly. Interagency cooperation is required as per the Endangered Species Act. Interagency cooperation is required for authorized wildfire prevention projects, following the Endangered Species Act. Special rules apply to projects involving timber harvesting or grazing, with a 30-day deadline for preparing an environmental assessment. Non-compliance with the deadline deems the project compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act. The wildfire prevention project is considered compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act if the deadline is not met. For livestock grazing projects, the environmental assessment is valid for 10 years, and for timber harvest projects, it is valid for 20 years. There is no requirement to consider alternatives in the environmental assessment. Compliance with this section fulfills the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. Compliance with this section satisfies requirements of various environmental acts, including the National Environmental Policy Act, National Forest Management Act, Endangered Species Act, and Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. Administrative review of authorized wildfire prevention projects follows a special process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Judicial review is conducted according to the same Act. SEC. 7. THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES DESIGNATIONS. Before listing species under the Endangered Species Act, research on the impact of listing on forest fuel loads is required. Endangered species recovery plans must include wildfire risk assessment analysis."
