To claim the HCTC, taxpayers must be in specific eligibility groups and not enrolled in certain types of health insurance. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) covers 72.5% of the premium for eligible taxpayers, who are responsible for the remaining 27.5%. Two groups eligible for HCTC are recipients of benefits under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program and individuals aged 55-64 receiving payments from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). TAA assists workers who lose jobs due to international trade, with eligibility determined by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).

TRA provides cash payments for workers in TAA-sponsored training, RTAA offers a wage supplement for older workers in qualified employment, and ATAA is a wage-insurance program. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) covers a percentage of the premium for eligible taxpayers who receive TRA, RTAA, or ATAA benefits. ATAA is a wage-insurance program similar to RTAA, and a small number of workers may still be receiving benefits under ATAA. Eligibility for the HCTC is limited to individuals who receive TRA, RTAA, or ATAA cash benefits. To receive a PBGC benefit, individuals must have worked for a firm with a defined-benefit pension plan insured and taken over by the PBGC. The PBGC pays pensions from terminated pension plans to protect participants' interests. Eligible individuals can receive the HCTC if they are at least 55 years old and not yet on Medicare. Certain limitations apply to eligibility, such as not being enrolled in a health plan provided by the individual's or spouse's employer.

State-qualified health plans offer various coverage options, including state-based continuation coverage, coverage through state high-risk pools, plans for state employees, and arrangements with health plans or employers. These plans must provide consumer protections to qualifying individuals. State-qualified health plans must provide guaranteed issue coverage, no denial based on preexisting conditions, equal premiums for qualifying individuals, and similar benefits to others.

DOL and PBGC help identify eligible individuals for the credit, with SWAs mailing information packets to TAA beneficiaries containing an HCTC eligibility certificate. The HCTC eligibility certificate identifies individuals potentially eligible for the tax credit. PBGC provides beneficiaries' information to IRS for mailing program kits. Taxpayers with qualified health insurance can claim the credit when filing tax returns or receive advance payments monthly.

The HCTC does not affect eligibility for other tax credits, except for the premium tax credit under the Affordable Care Act. In 2013, 13,693 tax returns claimed the HCTC, totaling $52.3 million. In 2016, 13,015 e-filed tax returns claimed the credit. Taxpayers must complete Form 8885 to claim the HCTC after the tax year ends.

The credit amount reduces taxes owed and is refundable if it exceeds the tax liability. To receive advance payments of the HCTC, individuals must register with the program and pay their share of the monthly premium. Individuals claiming the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) must pay their share of the monthly premium (27.5%) to Treasury, along with additional amounts for non-qualified family members if applicable. Treasury then sends payment for 100% of the premium to the individuals' health insurance plans."
