    "content": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in computer vision, where perturbations to images can cause the model to make mistakes. A new attack method reprograms the target model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without specifying the desired output for each input. This single perturbation can be added to all inputs to make the model perform the desired task, even if it was not trained for it. This method was demonstrated on six ImageNet classification models. Adversarial reprogramming demonstrated on six ImageNet models, repurposing them for counting and classification tasks. Adversarial examples pose a threat by causing model errors with small input changes, like a sticker on a stop sign for a self-driving car or doctored photos for an insurance claim. Various methods have been proposed to create and defend against these attacks. Various methods have been proposed to construct and defend against adversarial attacks, which aim to degrade the performance of a model with small perturbations. Adversarial attacks can be untargeted or targeted, with the goal of either degrading performance or inducing specific outputs. It is important to anticipate different adversarial goals to enhance the security of machine learning systems. In this work, a novel adversarial goal is considered: reprogramming a model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without needing to compute the specific desired output. Adversaries can achieve this by learning reprogramming functions that map between tasks, converting inputs and outputs accordingly. In this work, the concept of adversarial reprogramming is introduced, where a model is repurposed to perform a new task chosen by the attacker. Reprogramming functions are learned to map between tasks, converting inputs and outputs accordingly. The parameters of the adversarial program are adjusted to achieve the desired task outcome. Adversarial reprogramming involves repurposing a model to perform a new task chosen by the attacker. The attack does not need to be imperceptible to humans to succeed, and potential consequences include theft of computational resources and misuse of AI-driven services. This type of attack poses risks discussed in more detail in Section 5.2. Adversarial reprogramming involves repurposing a model by adding an offset to its input, allowing for flexibility in changing the network's behavior. Studies show that even small changes to a neural network's inputs can lead to significant alterations in its output patterns, demonstrating the expressive power of deep neural networks. This type of attack is discussed further in Section 5.2. In this paper, the authors introduce adversarial reprogramming, which involves updating a neural network's biases to create new parameters and achieve a different task. They demonstrate this by crafting adversarial programs that alter the function of convolutional neural networks from ImageNet classification to tasks like counting squares and classifying different types of images. The susceptibility of trained and untrained networks to adversarial reprogramming is also examined. Adversarial reprogramming involves updating a neural network's biases to achieve a different task, such as counting squares or classifying images. The susceptibility of trained and untrained networks to adversarial reprogramming is examined, along with the possibility of concealing adversarial programs and data. Adversarial examples are intentionally designed inputs to cause machine learning models to make mistakes. Adversarial attacks involve using a gradient-based optimizer to find images that cause a model to make mistakes, either untargeted or targeted. These attacks have been proposed in various domains like malware detection and generative models. Reprogramming methods aim to produce specific functionality rather than a hardcoded output. We develop reprogramming methods to create specific functionality rather than hardcoded outputs. Adversarial examples involve modifying inputs to deceive models, such as using an \"adversarial patch\" to change predictions. Parasitic computing forces systems to perform unintended tasks through network protocols. Weird machines exploit vulnerabilities with carefully crafted inputs. Transfer learning and adversarial reprogramming repurpose networks to perform new tasks. Adversarial reprogramming is a form of parasitic computing, exploiting neural networks like weird machines but within the neural network paradigm only. Neural networks have versatile properties useful for various tasks. Transfer learning methods utilize knowledge from one task to learn how to perform another, leveraging neural networks' versatile properties. It is possible to train a convolutional neural network for one task and then adapt it for other tasks by simply training a linear SVM classifier. This differs from adversarial reprogramming, where model parameters can be changed for the new task. Adversarial reprogramming involves changing model parameters for a new task, unlike transfer learning where knowledge is leveraged from one task to another. The adversary aims to alter a neural network's parameters to perform a different task by crafting an adversarial program in the network input. This method is more challenging than transfer learning and can be applied beyond ImageNet classification. The adversarial program discussed is a general additive contribution to network input, not specific to a single image. It is defined by parameters to be learned and a masking matrix. The mask is optional and used for visualization purposes. The perturbation is bounded to (-1, 1) to match the ImageNet image range. The adversarial perturbation is constrained to the range (-1, 1) to align with ImageNet images. The goal is to maximize the probability of mapping adversarial labels to ImageNet labels. The optimization problem for adversarial reprogramming involves maximizing the probability of mapping adversarial labels to ImageNet labels, with a weight norm penalty to reduce overfitting. The adversary's computation cost is minimal as it only requires computing X adv and mapping the resulting label. Adversarial reprogramming exploits nonlinear behavior of the target model. Adversarial reprogramming exploits the nonlinear behavior of the target network by reprogramming it to perform different tasks. Experiments on six architectures trained on ImageNet showed successful reprogramming for tasks like counting squares and image classification. The study also investigated if adversarial training could make networks resistant to reprogramming. The study explored adversarial reprogramming by testing resistance in trained networks and comparing them to random networks. They investigated reprogramming networks with adversarial data unrelated to the original data and demonstrated concealing the adversarial program and data. The process began with a simple task of counting squares in images. The study tested adversarial reprogramming by training networks with unrelated data and concealing the adversarial program. Images with squares were embedded in the program, and accuracy was evaluated by comparing network predictions to the number of squares in the image. Despite the mismatch between ImageNet labels and adversarial labels, the program was effective in the task. The study demonstrated the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial reprogramming on a simple counting task using additive contributions to the input. They then extended this to a more complex task of classifying MNIST digits, showing that the adversarial program could not have memorized all training examples. The adversarial program was trained for each ImageNet model, embedding MNIST digits inside a frame and assigning ImageNet labels to them. The study demonstrated the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial reprogramming by repurposing ImageNet models to classify CIFAR-10 images. The adversarial program successfully increased accuracy on CIFAR-10 from chance to a moderate level. The adversarial program increased CIFAR-10 accuracy to a moderate level with minimal computation cost. Adversarial programs show visual similarities despite differences in tasks. The susceptibility to adversarial reprogramming depends on the model being attacked, as shown in the Inception V3 model trained on ImageNet data. The Inception V3 model trained on ImageNet data using adversarial training is still vulnerable to reprogramming, showing little efficacy in defending against adversarial attacks. Adversarial reprogramming aims to repurpose the network rather than causing specific mistakes, with large magnitude adversarial programs compared to traditional attacks. Adversarial reprogramming attacks aim to repurpose neural networks rather than causing specific mistakes, with large magnitude adversarial programs compared to traditional attacks. Adversarial defense methods may not generalize to data from the adversarial task, as shown in experiments with models having random weights. Training on the MNIST classification task was challenging for random networks, with only ResNet V2 50 achieving similar accuracy as trained ImageNet models. The appearance of adversarial programs obtained with networks pretrained on ImageNet was qualitatively distinct from those obtained with randomly initialized networks. This suggests that the original task the neural networks perform is crucial for adversarial reprogramming. Randomly initialized networks may perform poorly due to reasons such as poor scaling of network weights at initialization, whereas trained weights are better conditioned. The study found that randomly initialized networks may perform poorly due to poor scaling of network weights at initialization, while trained weights are better conditioned. By randomizing the pixels on MNIST digits to remove any resemblance between original and adversarial data, the researchers were able to reprogram pretrained ImageNet networks to classify the shuffled MNIST digits with almost equal accuracy to standard MNIST. They also investigated reprogramming shuffled CIFAR-10 images. The study showed that reprogramming neural networks to classify shuffled CIFAR-10 images resulted in decreased accuracy compared to standard CIFAR-10 images. However, the accuracy was comparable to that of fully connected networks. This suggests the possibility of reprogramming across tasks with unrelated datasets and domains. In experiments with adversarial reprogramming, limitations on program size and scale were imposed to conceal perturbations. Using an Inception V3 model, reprogramming to classify MNIST digits with a small program size resulted in lower accuracy. Further, reducing the visibility of perturbations by limiting the L inf norm also led to successful reprogramming. Adversarial reprogramming success with nearly imperceptible programs by limiting perturbation scale. Concealing adversarial task by shuffling pixels and limiting scale of data and program. Extension of reprogramming method with specific parameters. In Section 3, P X is the adversarial data combined with the adversarial program, ix is the shuffling sequence, \u03b1 is a scalar used to limit the perturbation scale, and X ImageN et is an image chosen randomly from ImageNet. The adversarial program was optimized for the network to classify MNIST digits, resulting in images similar to normal ImageNet images but with lower accuracy. This demonstrates the possibility of hiding the adversarial task using more complex schemes and optimizing the choice of the ImageNet image. Our results show that trained neural networks are more vulnerable to adversarial reprogramming than random networks. Reprogramming remains successful even when the data structure differs significantly from the original task, highlighting the flexibility of repurposing trained weights. This suggests the practicality of dynamically reusing neural circuits in modern artificial neural networks, enabling easier repurposing, increased flexibility, and efficiency through shared compute. Recent machine learning efforts have focused on building large dynamically connected networks with reusable components. Recent work in machine learning has focused on building large dynamically connected networks with reusable components. The reduced performance when targeting random networks or reprogramming for CIFAR-10 classification raises questions about limitations in expressivity and trainability. Adversarial reprogramming has been demonstrated on image classification tasks, with potential for success in other domains like audio, video, and text. Reprogramming trained networks to classify shuffled images suggests the possibility of cross-domain reprogramming. Reprogramming across domains is possible, as shown by the ability to classify shuffled images. Adversarial reprogramming of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) could lead to various nefarious outcomes, such as theft of computational resources. Attacker could induce RNN to perform simple operations to reprogram it for any computational task. Adversarial attacks can reprogram neural networks to perform tasks like computational theft, violating ethical codes of ML service providers. This new class of attacks aims to repurpose computational resources for nefarious purposes, demonstrating the possibility of such attacks for the first time. Neural networks can be reprogrammed through adversarial attacks to perform novel tasks, showcasing their flexibility and vulnerability. Future research should focus on understanding and mitigating these attacks. The reprogramming image successfully alters the Inception V3 model to classify shuffled digits, despite the adversarial data being unrelated to the original data."
