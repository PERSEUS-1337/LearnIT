    "content": "The report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. The background of animal ID and traceability, along with unresolved issues and differing views on a national system, are discussed. Appendices detail the development of the U.S. National Animal Identification System and its successor program. On February 5, 2010, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced the revision of the U.S. National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to a new approach called Animal Disease Traceability. This new system allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability for livestock populations. Under the new Animal Disease Traceability framework, USDA requires all animals moving in interstate commerce to have traceable ID back to their originating state. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to regulate interstate movement of farm-raised livestock. USDA has collaborated with state and tribal officials to establish a Traceability Regulation Working Group. The USDA established a Traceability Regulation Working Group with state, tribal nation, and APHIS officials to develop a proposed rule for animal disease traceability. Feedback was gathered through forums and public meetings, leading to the release of two publications outlining USDA's recommendations for the proposed rule in August 2010. The USDA's traceability framework is still evolving, with states and tribal nations being responsible for managing traceability programs. States have the option to implement mandatory animal ID systems or rely on existing systems to combat diseases like brucellosis and tuberculosis. The within-state programs are intended to be implemented by the states. The federal rules for animal disease traceability will only apply to livestock moving in interstate commerce. Livestock will need official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) when moving interstate. Exemptions will be defined in the rules, such as cattle going directly to slaughter. Acceptable official identification types will be specified in federal regulations. State and tribal nation traceability capacity will be evaluated based on defined performance standards. The Traceability Regulation Working Group, along with state and tribal animal health officials, will define performance standards for animal disease traceability. Each state and tribal nation will have detailed traceability cooperative agreements with APHIS, with federal funding provided through annual agreements. No funding is designated for animal traceability in the agriculture appropriations bill for FY2011, but funding could be considered later. The Senate Committee on Appropriations report indicates that funding for animal disease traceability could be considered after needs are identified under USDA's new initiative. The program will be implemented through federal regulations and the federal rulemaking process, with a proposed rule expected to be published in April 2011. Once the proposed rule is released, it could take 12 to 15 months before the final rule is issued. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases have prompted the need for traceability measures. Major outbreaks of harmful animal diseases like avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, and mad cow disease have resulted in the slaughter of millions of animals and billions of dollars in economic damages. The economic impact extends beyond the farm to disrupt markets domestically and internationally, affecting consumers. The United States has been fortunate to avoid catastrophic disease outbreaks like FMD, but if a similar outbreak were to occur, the economic consequences could be staggering, potentially costing the U.S. cattle industry $30 billion to $100 billion. In the event of a Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak in the United States, the economic impact could range from $30 billion to $100 billion for the cattle industry alone. This has led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in various countries, with different approaches such as voluntary programs in the U.S. and mandatory programs in the EU, Japan, and South Korea. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production and ranking third in pork production. Japan and South Korea are considering requiring traceability on imported meat products, which could impact market access for U.S. livestock industries. Any developments in animal health, food safety, and import standards globally have economic significance for the United States. The United States is a top producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, ranking third in pork production globally. The country leads in beef and poultry production and is the world's leading exporter of pork. U.S. exports of animal products make up a significant portion of domestic production, with 17% for pork and poultry, and 6% for beef in 2007 and 2008. Animal identification (ID) involves keeping records on individual farm animals for tracking purposes, originally used for ownership and theft prevention, but now expanded to include information on origins and genetics. Animal identification has evolved to include details like birthplace, parentage, breed, and genetics, along with traceability to track products back to their source. A national database combined with traceability is seen as crucial for quick response to disease outbreaks or food contamination. Different countries have varying animal ID systems, collecting different levels of information for traceability. The differences in animal identification systems are based on the amount and type of information collected, including details like birthplace, owner information, movements, and slaughter details. More advanced systems also track sex, breed, parentage, feeds, pharmaceuticals, and product movement. The reasons for animal ID include rapid response to health and safety concerns, verification of premium production processes, and commercial labeling. In the United States, the focus is on animal ID. In the United States, animal ID focuses on animal health and traceability from birth to processing. Other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive systems that track products to the consumer. International buyers are increasingly demanding information on the history of animal products. A national animal ID and traceability system in the United States has evolved to meet demands for information on the history of animal products. Proponents argue that it enhances animal health surveillance and disease eradication by facilitating early detection of outbreaks and identifying sources of disease exposure. Critics have raised concerns about the system. A national animal ID and traceability system in the United States aims to identify the source of disease outbreaks and contain them through zoning or compartmentalization. This system can reduce disease testing costs for animal producers and minimize the economic impact of outbreaks by limiting the spread of diseases and preventing international trade restrictions. Compartmentalization helps limit the spread of diseases in animals, reducing the need to destroy or remove them from the market. It also aids in regaining access to international markets. Farmers can benefit from tracking individual animals for specific production characteristics like \"organic\" or \"grass-fed,\" which can fetch higher prices. Universal bar codes on processed meats help manage inventory and monitor consumer preferences. ID and traceability systems are used by processors and retailers to manage inventories, add value to products, and monitor consumer buying. These systems help verify production methods for meat, eggs, or milk from animals raised according to organic, humane treatment, or environmental standards. Government-coordinated programs, like the USDA's Process Verification program, allow livestock and meat producers to confirm their manufacturing processes through third-party audits. This program enables suppliers to make marketing claims such as breeds and feeding practices. Other traceability programs exist with varying levels and types of traceability. A traceability program, like the USDA's Process Verification program, allows livestock producers to confirm manufacturing processes through third-party audits. It provides valuable management tools for producers by tracking post-mortem information on cattle and performance history of animals. This system increases transparency in the supply chain and reduces the risk of unfounded liability claims against livestock. An animal ID and traceability program would increase transparency in the supply chain, help maintain records on animal movements and health, and address food safety and national security concerns. Federal and state agencies collaborate to protect the food supply from threats to human health, such as tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses like Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. This program helps trace products back to processors and slaughter facilities but can be challenging to determine specific animals, herds, or flocks involved in illnesses. Some believe that a more rigorous traceback and animal ID system would facilitate food recalls, contain the spread of foodborne illnesses, and enhance foreign marketing opportunities for animal products. Others, particularly in the food industry, disagree, citing concerns about the system's scientific basis, technical feasibility, and cost. The USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. This program certifies production processes for hormone- or antibiotic-free production, improving opportunities for niche markets. Establishing traceability is crucial for access to foreign markets. Establishing an internationally recognized system of traceability is essential for access to foreign markets and can enhance the competitiveness of U.S. exports of animals and animal products. Lack of a standardized national animal identification system hindered the U.S. from receiving \"negligible risk\" status for BSE from the OIE, which would improve international competitiveness and domestic price structures for all producers. Additionally, traceability can enhance animal welfare responses to natural disasters. Enhancing animal welfare during natural disasters through an animal ID system is crucial. Critics argue that such a system invades privacy and increases costs and complexity. Critics argue that implementing a national animal ID program could increase costs and technical complexity, with over 90% of the annual cost falling on the cattle sector. This could potentially lead to increased operational complexity and exceed operators' capabilities, ultimately favoring vertical integration over family farms. Critics argue that a national animal ID program would disproportionately burden the cattle industry with costs, disadvantaging family farms and shifting compliance costs to smaller operators. The national animal ID program may shift compliance costs to smaller farms and ranches, causing difficulties for independent producers. Some object on religious grounds, while others fear increased tax liabilities due to greater transparency in reporting livestock numbers. The program evolved from state and national disease eradication efforts. The national animal ID program, stemming from state and national disease eradication efforts, includes various programs directed by USDA's APHIS for animal disease control. Brucellosis ID tags were used successfully in eradicating the disease from U.S. commercial herds, leading to a decrease in animal ID requirements as the program concluded. Certain classes of livestock have had official identification requirements before entering. The national animal ID program, led by USDA's APHIS, includes various programs for disease control. Certain livestock classes have long had official ID requirements before interstate commerce. State laws and breed association rules also mandate animal identification for shows or races. However, these programs are not national in scope and vary in their approach. U.S. animal ID limitations were highlighted after the discovery of BSE in 2003. In December 2003, mad cow disease was found in a Canadian-born dairy cow in the United States. Trading partners hesitated to reopen borders due to difficulties in tracing infected cattle. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to improve tracking efforts through a state-federal-industry partnership, allowing producers to voluntarily participate in safeguarding animal health. Some states mandated components like premises registration, but federal involvement was limited. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was a voluntary program at the federal level, aimed at tracking major livestock and poultry species in the U.S. However, due to criticism from the cattle sector, NAIS was replaced with a more flexible, state-based program that mandates traceability only for livestock moving in interstate commerce. The burden of cost and implementation was a concern for cattle producers. Aspects of NAIS are still relevant to the potential implementation of the new system. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to track commercial livestock and poultry species in the U.S., excluding household pets. It was a new development in the country, focusing on animals entering commerce or interacting with others at events. USDA's role was to promote the program and provide information to participants. USDA's role in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was to popularize the program, ensure information availability, prioritize implementation by species/sectors, harmonize animal ID programs, standardize data elements, integrate technology, partner with states/industry, and advance ID technologies. USDA published reports for participant guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies. USDA published reports providing guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). Three key reports detailed participant guidance, technical details, and future program direction. The Business Plan outlined strategies to enhance animal disease traceability, while the NAIS User Guide offered guidance for participation in the program. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) provided guidance for producers and owners on participation benefits. The Program Standards established data standards for premises and animal identification numbers, ensuring system compatibility. The primary goal of NAIS was to protect commercial interests. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to protect U.S. agriculture from the harm of animal disease outbreaks. Its goals included increasing disease response capabilities, limiting disease spread, minimizing economic impact, and maintaining market access. USDA's long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease problem. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to trace animals of interest within 48 hours of a disease outbreak by providing rapid access to reliable data on animal ID and movement history. NAIS was designed to collect information on which animals are involved in the outbreak, their current location, and other animals potentially exposed to the disease through premises registration, animal identification, and tracking components. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to trace animals within 48 hours of a disease outbreak by collecting information through premises registration, animal identification, and tracking components. NAIS required states and tribes to maintain specific data for premises registration, including a premises identification number (PIN), entity name, contact information, operation type, and dates of activation and retirement. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number, remained constant even with changes in ownership. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number, is permanently assigned to a location and does not change with ownership. Producers or owners can have multiple PINs based on different operations. Premises registration is free and managed by state or tribal animal health authorities. USDA maintains premises information in a National Premises Information Repository to quickly notify producers of disease outbreaks. In late 2006, the goal was to have all premises registered by 2009, but by September 6, 2009, only about 37% of premises were registered under the NAIS out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. USDA stated that higher participation levels were needed for successful NAIS implementation. The second phase involved assigning unique numbers to individual animals or specific groups for tracking. Animal identification numbers (AIN) are unique 15-digit numbers used for tracking animals in the production chain. The first three digits represent the country code, with the United States using 840 as the initial numbers. AIN devices, such as tags and RFID devices, are essential for compliance with the 15-digit AIN numbering system. These devices are obtained from authorized manufacturers and can be traditional visual ear-tags, RFID tags, or injectable transponders for electronic reading. The USDA does not specify specific identification technologies beyond the minimum requirements for official identification. The use of RFID devices and injectable transponders is increasing as they allow for faster access to ID information and reduce stress on animals. Some animals are exempt from identification under NAIS if their movement poses a low disease risk. The USDA encourages animal owners to register their premises for disease control, even if animals don't leave their birthplace. Animals exempt from identification under NAIS include those that never leave their birth premises or are moved directly to custom slaughter for personal consumption. Owners can choose when to attach ID devices, but USDA recommends doing so before any movement occurs. The USDA recommends attaching ID devices to animals before any movement occurs, whether shortly after birth or later. Producers may choose to tag animals at auction markets if not done at current premises. Animals brought into operations should maintain their official identification without needing additional tags. The USDA recommends maintaining official identification on animals without needing additional tags. Group/lot identification numbers (GINs) can be used for animals moving through the production chain, with the GIN consisting of a 15-character number generated by the producer. The NAIS involves maintaining official identification on animals through self-generated Group/lot identification numbers (GINs) by producers. The ID remains with the animal for its lifetime, linking each producer's livestock to the animal's birthplace. The protocol is tailored to different species groups and their management. The third phase focuses on timely animal movement records to locate at-risk animals during disease outbreaks, using NAIS-compliant animal tracking databases maintained by states and private industry. Under NAIS, a producer would choose a NAIS-compliant animal tracking database to report animal movements. The minimum tracing information required includes the national premises identification number, animal ID number, date of the event, and the event itself. Additional animal-specific data is standardized but not necessary for participation. Traceback information is recorded for notable movements between locations, excluding movements within a production unit for management purposes. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS is a public/private partnership where industry and states maintain animal tracking databases (ATDs) containing location and movement records. The federal government does not maintain ATDs to ensure confidentiality. USDA operates a portal system for animal health officials to request information from ATD administrators during disease investigations. The USDA operates the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) to facilitate requests for information from ATD administrators during animal disease investigations. The ATDs provide timely reports on potentially exposed animals and their contacts, with optimal retrieval of traceback data within 48 hours for efficient disease containment. The system is used in situations such as a confirmed positive test for a foreign animal disease, an animal disease emergency, or the need for traceback/traceforward to determine the origin. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States had been registered, with varying participation across species and states. By September 6, 2009, 531,284 animal premises had been registered, representing 36.9% of estimated livestock and poultry farms in the country. The USDA estimated that 70% of animals in a specific species need to be identified and traceable to achieve a \"critical mass\" level for effective traceability in the event of an animal disease outbreak. Dr. John Clifford suggested a participation rate of 70-90% would be necessary for successful traceability measures. Dr. Clifford recommended a participation rate of 90% for effective traceability, but critics feel USDA is moving too slowly in implementing animal ID. The Government Accountability Office identified issues like prioritization of species, integration with existing requirements, and data provision as hindrances. USDA's NAIS Business Plan aimed to address these criticisms. The USDA's NAIS Business Plan aimed to address criticisms from the Government Accountability Office regarding the slow progress of implementing animal ID. Concerns were raised about low participation rates in the voluntary program, leading to calls for mandatory participation from USDA officials, state animal health officials, and the American Veterinary Medical Association. In October 2006, various groups including the National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials, the U.S. Animal Health Association, consumer advocacy groups, and industry organizations like NPPC, NMPF, and AMI, expressed support for mandatory participation in the USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS). Key members of Congress, Collin Peterson and Rosa DeLauro, also showed interest in making NAIS mandatory to prevent losses from diseases. Appropriations' Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rosa DeLauro, supports making NAIS mandatory to prevent losses from diseases. Opponents, mainly from the cattle industry, fear high costs and confidentiality issues with the system. Congressional members from cattle-heavy districts share these concerns. In August 2006, then-Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced that USDA would continue to implement NAIS as a voluntary program, despite concerns from the cattle industry. Proponents argue for a mandatory NAIS program, citing potential benefits in disease prevention. The system imposes costs for tags and data systems for animal traceability. The animal ID system imposes costs for tags, data systems, and tracking animals. Cost estimates for a national system vary, with questions on who should pay - industry, government, or both. Larger retailers may shift compliance costs to farms, impacting smaller, independent operations. The costs of implementing a national animal ID system can be burdensome for smaller farms and ranches, potentially driving them out of business. Larger, more integrated operations may have the resources to survive. However, slower fabrication speeds at smaller plants could make them better equipped to implement traceability to the retail level and find niche market opportunities. A study by APHIS and Kansas State University analyzed the economic benefits and costs of adopting the USDA's NAIS across multiple species and participation rates. The report by APHIS and Kansas State University analyzed the costs of implementing NAIS across multiple species and participation rates. The estimated annual costs for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation were approximately $228 million for livestock industries, expanding to $304.2 million when horses are included. Cost estimates are lower for lower participation levels and limited traceability features. The cost of implementing NAIS across multiple species and participation rates is estimated to be $304.2 million, with over 90% of the costs associated with the cattle sector. Cattle tagging accounts for 75% of the annual adoption costs, ranging from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal. Other livestock sectors have lower average costs per animal, such as $0.059 per swine, $1.39 per sheep, $0.0007 per broiler, $0.002 per turkey, and $0.0195 per layer. The study found that the economic benefits of NAIS with 100% participation exceeded the costs, including savings in government administration, re-establishing markets after disease outbreaks, expanded market access, avoidance of significant losses, and increased consumer demand. The cost per animal for other livestock sectors ranged from $0.059 per swine to $0.0195 per layer. The study found that NAIS would be more cost-effective with higher participation levels, but may not be economically viable at lower levels. Producers are concerned about liability for contamination and the public scrutiny of their records under the Freedom of Information Act. The federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows the public to access records held by federal agencies, with exemptions for certain business information like trade secrets. In the 110th Congress, a provision in the farm bill addressing protection of trade secrets in an animal ID system was removed. South Korea plans to require traceability for imported beef by December 2010. EU mandates individual identification for all suppliers. Japan does not currently require traceability for imported beef but has age limitations. The Democratic Party of Japan aims to pass laws for traceability on imported beef. The DPJ won 308 seats in the Japanese Diet and aims to forge a coalition for a two-thirds majority. The issue of traceability on imported meat may not be a priority. India is a top beef exporter without a traceability system. Beef traceability could become essential for global trade. The WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures applies rules to non-tariff trade. The WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures sets rules for non-tariff trade barriers like traceability requirements for market access. Traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified and equivalent to domestic standards. The USDA has invested $142 million in the NAIS since 2004, but participation remains low at 40% of livestock producers. Despite a large monetary investment, NAIS participation remained low at 40% of livestock producers by 2009. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held listening sessions to address concerns and gather feedback for the future of animal ID and traceability in the US. The USDA invested $142 million in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) from FY2004 to FY2009. Congress grew frustrated with the slow implementation of NAIS despite funding. In 2009, the Administration proposed increasing funding for NAIS, but Secretary Vilsack announced its abandonment in favor of a state-based system in 2010. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill. Subcommittee chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and Collin Peterson expressed frustration with the slow pace of national sign-up for NAIS despite receiving $142 million in funding since FY2004. The Senate version of H.R. 2997 reduced funding for the NAIS program to $7.3 million for FY2010, with restrictions on the use of funds for ongoing activities and rulemaking. The House and Senate resolved differences in NAIS funding for the year. The Senate version of H.R. 2997, as amended, was passed with reduced funding for the NAIS program for FY2010. House and Senate differences in funding were resolved, setting the final FY2010 funding level at $5.3 million. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed at clarifying USDA's authority for an animal ID program were proposed but not adopted. In the 111th Congress, legislation such as H.R. 2301, S. 1292, H.R. 3485, H.R. 814, and S. 425 aimed to establish comprehensive traceability systems for livestock and food products, including a national ID system and farm-to-consumer animal ID program. These bills required the USDA to trace animals and products from slaughter through distribution to the consumer, with provisions for record-keeping and oversight by the Secretary of Agriculture. The bills in the 111th Congress aimed to establish traceability systems for livestock and food products, including a national ID system. The Secretary of Agriculture would oversee record-keeping and access to traceability records. Hearings were held on the national animal ID system in the House committees. The House Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry and the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology held a joint public hearing to review the National Animal Identification System. Animal ID systems have a long history in the United States, dating back to the 1800s with hot iron brands used for identification. In the 1940s, the USDA initiated a program to identify cattle vaccinated for brucellosis. In the 1950s-1980s, the USDA implemented a successful brucellosis vaccination program for cattle. As brucellosis neared eradication in the US, the tagging and ID system was phased out. In response to the need for early disease outbreak detection, plans for a national animal identification system began to form. The discovery of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the UK in 1986-1988 raised concerns about disease transmission through cattle feed. In the 1990s and early 2000s, outbreaks of diseases like BSE, FMD, and Classical Swine Fever led to the slaughter of millions of cattle and pigs, resulting in significant economic losses. In the early 2000s, efforts were made to draft an animal ID plan to track the movement of animals in a central database. APHIS designed an ID numbering system and coordinated data collection, aiming for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004. In December 2003, the USAIP planned for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004, with major species identified by July 2006. Following the detection of BSE in the US, USDA accelerated the implementation of a national animal ID system. Secretary Ann Veneman transferred funds to APHIS for this purpose and announced the framework for the National Animal Identification System on April 27, 2004. The program has been periodically revised in response to changes. Ann Veneman announced the framework for implementing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in response to changing circumstances and input from industry participants. The program outlines were periodically revised, with a Draft Strategic Plan issued in May 2005 and Draft Program Standards in August 2005. By April 2006, a new plan called \"Implementation Strategies\" set a timeline for full implementation by 2009, initially as a voluntary program with the possibility of becoming mandatory. In response to concerns, the 2006 NAIS program was made entirely voluntary at the federal level by then-Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns. A draft \"user guide\" was distributed in November 2006 outlining a three-step approach to implementing a national animal ID program. The guide emphasized the voluntary nature of the program and the protection of individuals' private information. In December 2007, USDA's APHIS released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide and Additional Information Resource, followed by a Business Plan in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability. The plan aimed to clarify implementation strategies and set benchmarks for achieving a 48-hour traceback of affected animals during disease outbreaks. Livestock species were prioritized into Tier 1 for primary commercial food animals and Tier 2 for all other livestock and poultry. The USDA's APHIS released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide and Business Plan to advance animal disease traceability. Livestock species were prioritized into Tier 1 for primary commercial food animals and Tier 2 for all other livestock and poultry. The proposed rule would establish the seven-character PIN as the standard location identifier. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions to gather feedback on the future direction of animal identification and traceability in the United States. In April 2009, USDA released a cost-benefit analysis of the NAIS. In February 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced a new approach for animal disease traceability, allowing states to choose their own level of animal ID. By March 2010, USDA began public meetings on Animal Disease Traceability, requiring all animals in interstate commerce to have traceable ID. In March 2010, USDA initiated public meetings on Animal Disease Traceability for animals in interstate commerce to have traceable ID. In August 2010, APHIS released documents outlining a proposed rule on traceability. The United States participates in international organizations for animal health and trade. The United States participates in international organizations for animal health, food safety, and trade in livestock and animal products, including the CODEX alimentarius, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO). These organizations provide guidelines and standards for countries to follow, with the WTO also governing international trade rules and dispute settlement. The World Trade Organization (WTO) restricts traceability measures on imports to two requirements: scientifically justified based on risk assessment and equivalent to domestic standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission develops food standards and guidelines under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Program. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) work together under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Program to develop food standards and guidelines. The OIE focuses on improving animal health globally through standard-setting for animal identification and traceability systems. The OIE helps member countries implement animal identification and traceability systems to enhance disease prevention, control, food safety, and export certification. In 2006, the OIE established guidelines on identification and traceability, adopted as official standards in 2007. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes sections on general principles and guidance for system design and implementation. The Director General called for progressive implementation of these systems in 2008. The OIE Director General called for the global implementation of animal identification and traceability systems from \"farm to fork\" to facilitate trade during disease outbreaks. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes guidelines for compartmentalization and export certification, with the USDA's FSIS handling certification in the United States. In the United States, certification for beef imports is managed by USDA's FSIS, ensuring compliance with importing countries' standards. The OIE promotes international certification standards and transparency through its programs. Certification procedures are outlined in Chapter 5 of the OIE's Terrestrial Code. Foreign countries like Argentina, Australia, and Brazil also have Animal ID and Traceability Programs. Many international trading partners have adopted national animal identification systems with traceability capabilities, including Canada. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency manages Canada's national individual identification system for cattle and bison, working closely with the government's Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is a non-voting board member of the CCIA, working closely with Agri-Food and Agriculture Canada (AAFC) to ensure funding for cattle identification. Initially voluntary, cattle identification in Canada became mandatory on July 1, 2002, transitioning to RFID tags in 2003 for better tag retention and data integrity. The CCIA benefits of RFID tags include tag retention, data integrity, distance reading, and animal movement tracking. Compliance rate for Canadian cattle ID is nearly 100%. Personal information is securely stored in the national database for authorized access in health issues. The CLTS manages ID and traceback systems for various industry groups. Sheep and hog ID programs in Canada became mandatory in 2004 and 2008. Australia has the NLIS for livestock identification. The Canadian sheep and hog identification programs became mandatory in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) allows for electronic identification and traceability of livestock from birth to slaughter. Similar systems are being developed for pigs and alpacas. Australia initiated its animal identification system in the 1960s to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, with a mandatory cattle identification system starting in 1967. In 1967, Australia implemented a Property Identification Code (PIC) system for cattle, which evolved into an electronic individual cattle identification system using Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFIDs) in the mid-1990s. This transition was driven by the need for biosecurity, food safety, and market access. Individual identification became compulsory for producers supplying the European Union market in 1998. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) was introduced in 1999 to trace cattle from birth to slaughter. The NLIS was introduced in 1999 for cattle traceability in Australia. By 2005, it became mandatory for all cattle leaving their birth property to be identified. Each animal is assigned a unique ID number at slaughter, linked to live animals, carcasses, hides, and byproducts. The NLIS in Australia, introduced in 1999 for cattle traceability, assigns unique ID numbers to animals at slaughter, linked to carcasses, hides, and byproducts. The system is a joint commitment between the Australian Government and industry, with the Federal government providing funding and policy coordination, while state governments have legal jurisdiction over livestock movement and health. State governments work with industry to develop and implement legislation for the animal identification program. The animal identification program in Australia is coordinated by state committees, which provide education programs and assistance to producers. The state governments manage the registry of PICs, order identification devices, and monitor compliance with legislative requirements. Meat and Livestock Australia administers the database for NLIS, ensuring data protection. The European Union also emphasizes animal identification as part of its food safety programs. The European Union has mandatory programs for animal identification as part of its food safety initiatives. The objectives include localizing and tracing animals for veterinary purposes to control infectious diseases. Species-specific ID systems have evolved in response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease. The EU implemented a mandatory system for permanent identification of individual bovine in 1997 due to the BSE crisis. In April 1997, the Council of the European Union implemented a mandatory system for permanent identification of individual bovine animals in response to the BSE crisis. All bovine animals were required to be identified with double ear tags by January 1, 2000, along with maintaining a register at each animal location and using cattle passports for recording movements. An electronic national database was also established to include ID and tracking information. On July 17, 2000, additional regulations were passed to fully implement the bovine ID and traceability system in the EU, which includes labeling meat products with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin. EU regulations require meat products to be labeled with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin, the member state where the meat was harvested, and the approval number of the facility. Mandatory food traceability has been in place since January 1, 2005. Equidae in the EU must have a passport for movement since July 1, 2000. Mandatory identification systems for porcine, ovine, and caprine animals were implemented on specific dates. Japan also has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system since December 1, 2004. Japan implemented a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in December 2004, tracking domestic animals from birth to consumer purchase. Imported beef currently lacks the same traceability requirements, but pressure is growing for equal regulations. This system was established in response to food safety crises, including BSE in domestic cattle and labeling scandals, with the first phase starting in July 2002. Japan implemented bovine animal traceability and identification laws in response to food safety crises, including BSE in domestic cattle. The laws required traceability of domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by December 2003, and extended traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 2004. Retailers and restaurants now display animal identification numbers for consumer reference. Additionally, a Japan Agricultural Standard program was introduced to certify the traceability of imported beef. The Japan Agricultural Standard (JAS) program certifies traceability of imported beef, requiring exporters to provide detailed information. South Korea's Beef Traceability System (BTS) tracks individual animals from birth to consumer, with mandatory registration in a central database. The BTS is a traceability system in South Korea that tracks individual animals from birth to consumer, providing detailed information such as sex, breed, quality grade, location of birth, owner's information, feed, medications, slaughter date, and processing location. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand does not have a fully functioning national animal ID system but established the Animal Identification and Traceability Working Group in August 2004 to improve animal traceability. The Animal Identification and Traceability Governance Group (AITGG) was established in March 2006 to oversee the development of the NAIT system in New Zealand. As of early 2009, NAIT is still in development and focuses on traceability for cattle and deer populations. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has stated that other species may be added to the system once it is fully operational. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has mentioned that adding other species to the NAIT system should only be considered after it is fully operational for cattle and deer. New Zealand has existing animal ID systems like MINDA and NBTIP, with MINDA being a voluntary system for dairy herd management and NBTIP being mandatory for cattle and deer traceability. Several other traceability databases are also available for producers to use. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011 in New Zealand. Brazil implemented the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV) in 2001, which was later extended to include the entire beef chain in 2006. Initially intended as mandatory, the program faced resistance from Brazilian cattle producers due to low demand for origination information. Brazil implemented the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV) in 2001, initially as mandatory but later became voluntary due to resistance from cattle producers. The program focuses on providing origination information for animals destined for foreign markets, particularly the EU, which has strict identification and traceability requirements. Despite audits revealing shortcomings in Brazil's animal identification system, the EU has accepted individual tags for cattle sold to export slaughterhouses. The EU's audits of Brazil's SISBOV system since 2003 found severe shortcomings in animal identification and traceability. In 2008, the EU imposed a near-total ban on Brazilian beef imports, citing concerns about information robustness and foot-and-mouth disease transmission. Argentina established a limited mandatory animal identification system in 2003, similar to Brazil's efforts. Argentina's animal identification system, similar to Brazil's, focuses on cattle destined for export markets. Official ID tagging has been required for calves born after September 2007 to track them from birth to slaughter. Argentina's beef exports to the US are restricted to thermo-processed beef due to disease control issues, particularly foot and mouth disease. The entire Argentine beef herd is expected to be tagged by 2017. Uruguay heavily relies on foreign markets for selling a large portion of its beef production, with 68% being sold abroad from 2004-2008. To meet foreign buyer demands, Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006. Under SNIG, all individual animals must be tagged before six months of age. The Uruguayan government implemented the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006, requiring all individual animals to be tagged before six months of age. Two tags are needed for cattle, one visible and one electronic. By 2010, all herds will be registered and cattle tagged. SNIG extends traceability to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin, building on Uruguay's national premises identification system (DICOSE) established in 1973. The SNIG database in Uruguay, established in 2006, requires all individual animals to be tagged before six months of age. It includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. The government currently pays for ID tags but plans to shift the cost to producers in the future. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have ongoing animal ID programs due to large agrarian populations. Many countries lack animal ID programs due to large agrarian populations, lack of technological advancement, and reliance on local production and marketing. Lower-income consumers in poorer countries may not be willing to pay extra for traceable food."
