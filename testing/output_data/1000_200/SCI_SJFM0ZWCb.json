The proposed algorithm, Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC), integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering in an unsupervised learning framework. It utilizes an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. The algorithm optimizes both clustering and dimensionality reduction objectives and can be customized with various temporal similarity metrics. A visualization method is used to analyze learned features, and the algorithm is validated with timeseries data from different domains. The algorithm Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering in unsupervised learning. It outperforms traditional methods in various domains, showing improved performance due to integrated temporal dimensionality reduction and clustering criterion. Deep learning is dominant in supervised learning, but unsupervised techniques are crucial for learning complex structures in unlabeled data. The standard unsupervised techniques for learning complex structures in unlabeled data include clustering approaches, which organize similar objects into clusters. However, extending clustering techniques to time series data remains a challenge, leaving a gap in technology for accurate unsupervised learning of time series data in various fields such as financial trading and medical monitoring. Time series data from different domains exhibit variations in properties, temporal scales, and dimensionality, making unsupervised time series clustering particularly challenging. Time series data from various domains have unique properties and temporal scales, making clustering challenging. A new algorithm, deep temporal clustering (DTC), transforms data into a low-dimensional space using a deep autoencoder network. DTC addresses issues of temporal gaps and high-frequency noise in real-world data. The proposed DTC algorithm utilizes a three-level approach involving CNN and BI-LSTM to uncover latent dimensions in temporal or spatio-temporal data for clustering without losing time course information. The DTC algorithm uses a unique approach to untangle data manifolds without discarding time course information, achieving high performance on various datasets. It includes a visualization algorithm for cluster-assignment activations over time, providing explanations for class assignment based on informative data features. This is the first application of deep learning in temporal clustering, with the main contribution being an end-to-end deep learning algorithm for meaningful clustering. The study introduces an end-to-end deep learning algorithm for temporal clustering, focusing on effective latent representation and similarity metrics. The algorithm outperforms existing methods like k-Shape BID15 and hierarchical clustering on real-world time series datasets. The existing research in temporal clustering methods focuses on dimensionality reduction and similarity metrics. Solutions include application-dependent reduction to filter out noise, but may lose long-range correlations. Another approach is creating a suitable similarity measure between time series. The existing research in temporal clustering methods focuses on dimensionality reduction and similarity metrics. Solutions include application-dependent reduction to filter out noise, but may lose long-range correlations. Another approach is creating a suitable similarity measure between time series, incorporating features like complexity, correlation, and time warping. Studies have shown that a good similarity measure is crucial for optimal clustering results, but proper dimensionality reduction is also necessary due to the complexity and high dimensionality of time series data. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of casting time series data into a low dimensional latent space for temporal clustering. However, there is a lack of a general methodology for selecting an effective latent space. To achieve meaningful clustering results, it is crucial to ensure that the similarity metric is compatible with the temporal feature space. While clustering methods for static data have shown superior performance, they are not well suited for time series data clustering. The goal is to perform unsupervised clustering of temporal sequences into clusters based on their high-level features. The goal is to perform unsupervised clustering of temporal sequences into clusters based on their high-level features. A temporal autoencoder (TAE) is used to encode the input signal into a latent space, followed by a BI-LSTM for clustering. Effective latent representation is crucial for temporal clustering, achieved through the TAE. The network architecture includes a 1D convolution layer for extracting short-term features and a max pooling layer. The network architecture consists of a 1D convolution layer followed by max pooling to extract short-term features and reduce dimensionality. Leaky rectifying linear units are used for activation. The Bidirectional LSTM is then used to learn temporal changes in both directions and obtain a smaller latent space representation. Finally, the clustering layer assigns the latent representation to clusters. Learning in both 1D CNN and BI-LSTM is driven by interleaved minimization of two objectives. The clustering layer assigns the BI-LSTM latent representation of sequences to clusters. Learning in both 1D CNN and BI-LSTM is driven by minimization of two cost functions: mean square error for input sequence reconstruction and clustering metric for high-level features separation. The clustering metric optimization modifies the weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN. The clustering layer assigns BI-LSTM latent representations to clusters, optimizing separation of high-level features. End-to-end network optimization efficiently extracts spatio-temporal features for categorizing input sequences, disentangling complex dynamics. Traditional approaches focus on reconstruction or clustering separately, while our method combines both to achieve optimal separation in the latent space. The traditional approaches focus on reconstruction or clustering separately, while our method combines both to achieve optimal separation in the latent space through end-to-end optimization. This approach effectively extracts and encodes informative features on all time scales in the latent representation of the BI-LSTM, utilizing the temporal continuity of the spatio-temporal data. The temporal clustering layer in the BI-LSTM utilizes the latent signals to initialize cluster centroids through hierarchical clustering, followed by training with an unsupervised algorithm alternating between assignment probability computation and centroid estimation. The temporal clustering layer in the BI-LSTM utilizes latent signals to compute assignment probabilities and update centroids using a loss function to maximize high confidence assignments. The distances from centroids are normalized into probability assignments using a Student's t distribution kernel. The probability of input belonging to a cluster is determined by ij, with zi representing the latent signal obtained from a temporal autoencoder. The parameter \u03b1, representing the degrees of freedom of a Students t distribution, can be set to 1 in an unsupervised setting. The siml() metric calculates the distance between the encoded signal and centroid. Various similarity metrics are experimented with, including Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) which uses the euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation. Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) proposed by BID2 computes similarity based on the euclidean distance corrected by complexity estimation of two series x, y. The distance is calculated using a complexity factor defined as min(CE(x), CE(y)), where CE(x) and CE(y) are complexity estimates of time series x and y. The core idea is that as complexity differences between series increase, the distance also increases. If both sequences have the same complexity, the distance is simply the euclidean distance. The complexity of each sequence is defined based on the length of the sequence. The study computes similarities using pearson's correlation between latent representation z i and centroids w j. Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF) computes similarity using autocorrelation coefficients and weighted euclidean distance. The objective is to minimize KL divergence loss between q ij and target distribution p ij to train the temporal clustering layer. Choice of p is crucial to strengthen high confidence predictions and normalize losses. The target distribution p is important for strengthening high confidence predictions and normalizing losses. The KL divergence loss is computed using this distribution, with n and k representing the number of samples and clusters. Joint optimization of clustering and autoencoder involves minimizing KL divergence and mean squared error losses. Effective initialization of cluster centroids is crucial as they reflect the data's latent representation. Pretraining the autoencoder parameters ensures meaningful centroids for the clusters. The initial centroids are pre-trained to have a meaningful latent representation, and cluster centers are initialized using hierarchical clustering. Autoencoder weights and cluster centers are updated using backpropagation mini-batch SGD. Target distribution is also updated during each SGD update. This approach helps prevent problematic solutions and ensures convergence at a suitable representation to minimize clustering and MSE loss. The latent representation converges to minimize clustering and MSE loss. A heatmap-generating network is used to localize main data features for classification. Cluster labels from DTC network train a hierarchical convolutional network to classify inputs x, generating heatmaps. Implementation done in Python, TensorFlow, and Keras on Nvidia GTX 1080Ti.

Heatmaps were used to localize events, with higher values indicating higher likelihood of event localization. The algorithm's performance was evaluated on various real-world datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. The study combines training and test datasets from UCR datasets and NASA MMS Mission data for automated detection of spacecraft crossings of flux transfer events (FTEs) characterized by bipolar signature in the magnetic field. The DTC algorithm is compared against hierarchical clustering and k-Shape, a state-of-the-art temporal clustering algorithm. The study compares the DTC algorithm with hierarchical clustering and k-Shape, a state-of-the-art temporal clustering algorithm. k-Shape preserves time series shapes and computes centroids under scale and shift invariance. Four similarity metrics were used: Complexity Invariant Distance (CID), Correlation based Similarity (COR), Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF), and Euclidean Based Similarity (EUCL). The evaluation metrics used were Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC). Parameter optimization using cross-validation was not feasible in unsupervised clustering.
