    "content": "The \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996\" allows for a credit for employer expenses for child care assistance under the new section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 1996\" introduces a credit for employer-provided child care expenses under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. The credit covers 50% of qualified child care expenditures, not exceeding $150,000 per year. Qualified expenses include property acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, or expansion for a child care facility. The tax credit covers expenses for a qualified child care facility, including operating costs, employee training, scholarship programs, and increased compensation. It also includes costs under a contract to provide dependent care services to employees. The tax credit covers expenses for a qualified child care facility that provides dependent care assistance and meets all state and local regulations for child care facilities. The tax credit applies to a qualified child care facility that meets state and local regulations, excluding facilities that are the operator's principal residence. The facility must be open to the taxpayer's employees and not the taxpayer's primary business unless 30% of enrollees are employees' dependents. The tax credit applies to a qualified child care facility that meets state and local regulations, excluding facilities that are the operator's principal residence. The facility must be open to the taxpayer's employees, with at least 30% of enrollees being employees' dependents, and cannot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. If there is a recapture event with respect to the facility, the taxpayer's tax for the year will be increased by a certain percentage. The tax credit for a qualified child care facility may be subject to recapture if certain conditions are not met. The recapture amount is determined by multiplying the applicable recapture percentage by the aggregate decrease in credits allowed under section 38 for prior years. The applicable recapture percentage is determined from a specified table. The recapture percentage for a qualified child care facility varies depending on the year of the recapture event, starting at 100% in Years 1-3 and decreasing to 0% in Years 11 and thereafter. The recapture event in relation to a qualified child care facility includes the cessation of operation or a change in ownership. The credit described in subsection (a) may be allowable if the person acquiring an interest in a facility agrees to assume recapture liability from the previous owner. The new owner would then be responsible for any recapture liability as if there had been no change in ownership. Special rules apply in such cases. The tax liability for the taxable year may be increased if credits used to reduce tax liability are recaptured. Any increase in tax under this rule does not count towards determining the amount of any other tax credits. The increase in tax under this subsection does not apply to a qualified child care facility ceasing operation due to a casualty loss, if the loss is restored within a reasonable period. Special rules include treating all persons as a single taxpayer and pass-thru in the case of estates and trusts. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a single employer under subsections (a) and (b) of section 52 is treated as a single taxpayer. Rules similar to subsection (d) of section 52 apply for estates and trusts, and the credit is allocated among partners in partnerships. If a credit is determined for property due to certain expenditures, the basis of the property is reduced by that amount. The basis of property is reduced by the credit amount determined for certain expenditures. If a recapture amount is determined in a taxable year, the basis of the property is increased by that recapture amount. No deduction or credit is allowed for other deductions and credits. The section discusses the increase in tax or adjustment in carrybacks or carryovers under subsection (d). No other deductions or credits are allowed with respect to the credit amount determined in this section. The section terminates for taxable years starting after December 31, 1999. Additionally, there are conforming amendments to Section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 related to the employer-provided child care credit. The employer-provided child care credit under section 45D is added as a new paragraph. Amendments are made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The employer-provided child care credit under section 45D applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1996."
