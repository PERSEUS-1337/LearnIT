    "content": "In the 109th Congress, legislation has been approved to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. S. 667 and H.R. 240 were reported by the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, respectively. The CSE program, enacted in 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the Department of Health and Human Services. The CSE program is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the Department of Health and Human Services and funded by general revenues. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands operate CSE programs and are entitled to federal matching funds. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services. Child support collected on behalf of nonwelfare families goes directly to the family. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly from $1 billion to $21.2 billion. The number of children with established paternity also rose by 1,274%. However, the program only collects 18% of child support obligations it is responsible for and only collects payments for 50% of its caseload. Paternity was established for about 77% of children without legally identified fathers. The CSE program handles at least 50% of all child support cases. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program provides various services for children, including parent location, paternity establishment, support order establishment and modification, support payment collection and distribution, and medical support enforcement. Collection methods include income withholding, intercepting tax refunds, liens, and reporting to credit bureaus. The program also utilizes civil and criminal contempt procedures, as well as criminal nonsupport laws. Federal legislation has established new criminal offenses for nonpayment of child support. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-187) established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States were required to implement procedures to secure assets for child support payments, including intercepting payments and withholding licenses. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-187) established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States were required to implement procedures to withhold licenses and seize financial resources of debtor noncustodial parents. P.L. 104-193 authorized the denial, revocation, or restriction of passports for debtor parents and required states to enact the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) for child support enforcement. The federal government reimburses states for administering their child support enforcement program and also refunds states for paternity establishment costs. Incentive payments are given to states to encourage effective programs. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 established a new incentive payment system. The statutory limit for incentive payments in FY2005 is $446 million. The CSE program focuses on cost-recovery, service delivery, and promoting self-sufficiency and parental involvement. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program focuses on service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and securing financial support for children from noncustodial parents. Child support payments are a significant income source for single-parent families, with an average of 17% of family income coming from child support. The program aims to increase economic independence for former welfare families and provide a stable income source. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to improve the CSE program and raise collections to achieve these goals. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance the Child Support Enforcement program to increase economic independence for former welfare families and provide stable income for single-parent families with a noncustodial parent. The bills share objectives of simplifying CSE rules and strengthening \"family-first\" policies, but differ in their approaches and enforcement tools. The Senate Finance Committee bill includes a more extensive list of provisions compared to the House Subcommittee bill. For a detailed description of all CSE provisions in both bills, refer to Table 1 in the report. The CSE provisions in S.667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance the Child Support Enforcement program by requiring families receiving TANF benefits to assign their child support rights to the state. This assignment covers both current and past child support payments. The collected child support is kept by states and the federal government as reimbursement for welfare benefits, while nonwelfare families who apply for CSE services retain all collected child support. The assignment process for child support rights under CSE services determines whether arrearages are permanently or temporarily assigned to the state. Pre-assistance arrearages are permanently assigned if the assignment was made before September 30, 1997. If the assignment was after October 1, 1997, only arrearages accumulated during assistance are permanently assigned. Nonwelfare families keep all collected child support, while welfare families reimburse welfare benefits with the collected child support. The child support assignment rules differ between S. 667 and H.R. 240. S. 667 only assigns child support that accrues during TANF benefits, allowing pre-assistance arrearages to go to the family. H.R. 240 does not change assignment rules. Distribution rules determine the order of child support payment. The distribution rules determine the order of child support payment, with states having discretion over their share of child support collections for TANF families. The 1996 welfare law repealed the $50 required pass-through and allowed states to decide how much, if any, of the state share of child support payments to send to the family. States also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family. Both bills aim to incentivize states to prioritize directing child support payments collected for TANF families to the families themselves, rather than using the funds to reimburse welfare benefits. This would shift towards a \"family-first\" policy and reduce the financial burden on states. The bills aim to promote a \"family-first\" policy by encouraging states to prioritize directing child support payments to TANF families. S. 667 proposes federal cost-sharing for pass-through and disregard policies, allowing states to pay up to $400 per month per child to the family without reimbursing the federal government. The House bill, H.R. 240, incentivizes states to increase pass-through and disregard policies for child support payments to TANF families. It allows states to pay more child support to families without reimbursing the federal government, with the subsidized payments being above the amount paid before December 31, 2001. The House bill incentivizes states to increase pass-through and disregard policies for child support payments to TANF families. The federal government's cost-sharing of new pass-through payments is limited to $100 per month or $50 more than the state's previous sharing with the family. States must distribute child support collections to former TANF families before reimbursement, prioritizing current child support and any arrearages accrued after leaving TANF. The federal government reimburses child support payments to TANF families, prioritizing current support and arrearages accrued after leaving TANF. Child support accrued while on TANF goes to the state. This aims to reduce dependence on public assistance. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose giving states the option to distribute full child support amounts collected on behalf of former TANF families, including arrearages. This aims to simplify the distribution process and reduce dependence on public assistance. The proposed bills, S. 667 and H.R. 240, offer states the choice to distribute full child support payments to former TANF families, including arrearages. They also include provisions for passport denial, collecting child support from Social Security and veterans' benefits, and using the federal income tax refund offset program for past-due child support. The proposed bills, S. 667 and H.R. 240, offer states options for distributing full child support payments to former TANF families, including arrearages. They also include provisions for passport denial, collecting child support from Social Security and veterans' benefits, and using the federal income tax refund offset program for past-due child support. Additional provisions in S. 667 aim to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments. The Senate Finance Committee's bill, S. 667, includes provisions to improve states' ability to collect child support payments. These provisions authorize the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents, require medical support from parents, and mandate notification to health care plan administrators. Additionally, the bill requires states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years, submit reports on locating custodial parents, and establish minimum funding levels for technical assistance. H.R. 240 and S. 667 bills aim to improve the collection of child support payments. H.R. 240 proposes a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services, while S. 667 includes provisions to increase funding for access and visitation programs, adopt a later version of UIFSA, and allow Texas to continue its CSE program for monitoring court orders. The comparison of child support provisions in H.R. 240 and S. 667 shows differences in fee structures and program funding. Texas is allowed to continue its CSE program under both bills without needing a federal waiver."
