    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge Study Act\" and includes findings. The Cherry Valley area in northeastern Pennsylvania is home to over 80 special-concern animal and plant species, including 6 endangered or threatened species such as the bog turtle, dwarf wedge mussel, and bald eagle. Efforts are being made to reestablish favorable conditions for the Indiana bat. Cherry Valley provides habitat for numerous special-concern species, including neotropical migratory birds like the Cerulean Warbler and globally rare plants. The area also encompasses a large segment of the Kittatinny Ridge, an important migration route. The Cherry Valley watershed includes the Kittatinny Ridge, a crucial migration route for birds of prey in the northeastern United States. Various raptor species, including bald eagles and golden eagles, are regularly seen during autumnal migration. The Kittatinny Ridge also features a significant portion of the Appalachian Trail and rare calcareous wetlands that have disappeared from other areas. Ongoing studies have shown high water quality in Cherry Creek. The Cherry Valley watershed, including the Kittatinny Ridge, is vital for bird migration. Studies show high water quality in Cherry Creek. Two federally-owned parcels of land could be part of a potential Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Public support for the refuge is strong and growing. Area landowners, business, community leaders, media, and elected officials support the creation of a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Local communities and conservation entities are actively working to protect Cherry Valley's wildlife habitat and farmland. These entities, along with State land management agencies and the National Park Service, could be strong partners for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in establishing the refuge. Several local landowners have placed their land into conservation easements or other arrangements. Voter-approved funds in Monroe County and Stroud Township have supported various conservation projects in the area. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Map.--Refers to the map titled \"Proposed Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge-Authorization Boundary\" dated February 24, 2005.\n            (2) Secretary.--Refers to the Secretary of the Interior.\n            (3) Study area.--Refers to the fish and wildlife habitat in Cherry Valley, located in northeastern Pennsylvania as identified on the map.\n\nSEC. 4. STUDY OF REFUGE POTENTIAL AND FUTURE REFUGE LAND ACQUISITION. The Secretary will conduct a study to evaluate the Study Area for potential acquisition by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for inclusion in a potential Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Consultation with State and local officials, conservation organizations, landowners, and interested persons will be done to identify eligible land and determine boundaries for acquisition. The Secretary will conduct a study to evaluate the Study Area for potential acquisition for a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, including determining boundaries and assessing conservation benefits. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for the preservation and maintenance of diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, protection of aquatic and wetland habitats, provision of wildlife-dependent recreation, research, and education opportunities, and fulfillment of international obligations. It also emphasizes public participation and consideration of local views. The Secretary is limited to acquiring 30,000 total acres of land, water, and interests in the Study Area. A report must be completed within 1 year of enactment, detailing the study results and submitted to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The House of Representatives report includes a map prioritizing land, water, and interests for acquisition by the Secretary, a cost estimate for acquiring these areas for refuge status, and an estimate of non-Federal funds available for acquisition. Authorization of Appropriations: $200,000 is authorized to the Secretary for acquiring and managing land, water, and interests in the Study Area."
