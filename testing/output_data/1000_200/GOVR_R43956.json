    "content": "The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), enacted in 1990, provides one-time cash benefits to individuals exposed to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing or working in the uranium industry between 1942 and 1971. Administered by the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, over 30,000 claims have been approved for nearly $2 billion in benefits. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) has approved over 30,000 claims for almost $2 billion in benefits related to atomic weapons testing. The program will end on July 10, 2022, and benefits are paid from general revenue. The first atomic bomb was detonated in 1945, leading to extensive atomic weapons testing until 1992. The United States conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests between 1945 and 1992, with the majority of tests (928) taking place at the Nevada Test Site. Of these, 828 were underground tests and 100 were atmospheric tests, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. The United States conducted atomic weapons tests in the continental United States and Alaska. The largest atmospheric test at the Nevada Test Site had an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. Benefits under the RECA program include payments for onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers. Benefits under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) program include one-time lump sum payments for onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers. These payments are not adjusted for changes in wages or cost of living and are not subject to federal income tax. However, they may be reduced by other payments received for related illnesses or injuries. RECA does not provide medical benefits, but eligible uranium workers can also receive $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. Under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), eligible individuals such as onsite participants, downwinders, and uranium workers are entitled to one benefit payment. If the claimant is deceased, the benefit is paid to specific survivors in a particular order. Only those survivors listed are eligible for RECA benefits, and if there are no such survivors, no benefit is paid. To qualify for RECA benefits, an onsite participant must meet exposure and disease requirements. To be eligible for RECA benefits, an onsite participant must have been present during atmospheric atomic weapons testing in specific geographic areas, including NTS, Pacific Test Sites, and designated exclusion zones for non-test affiliated ships. The curr_chunk discusses specific sites and zones related to atmospheric atomic weapons testing, including exclusion zones for non-test affiliated ships, decontamination locations, and monitoring fallout sites. Eligibility for RECA benefits requires being present during testing and holding certain occupations. During atmospheric atomic weapons testing, individuals eligible for RECA benefits must have held specific occupations and performed duties within designated operational areas around nuclear detonations. Participants in atmospheric atomic weapons testing must have specific occupations and duties within operational areas around nuclear detonations to be eligible for RECA benefits. Onsite participants must have contracted specified cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation. Downwinders must meet exposure and disease requirements based on physical presence. To be eligible for RECA benefits as a downwinder, a person must have been physically present near NTS for a specified period between 1951 and 1962 and have contracted one of the listed cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation from an atmospheric atomic weapons test. Uranium miners must have worked in a uranium mine for at least one year between 1942 and a specific date to qualify for benefits. A uranium miner must meet specific exposure and disease requirements to qualify for benefits under RECA. This includes working in a uranium mine for at least one year between 1942 and 1971 or being exposed to at least 40 working-level months of radiation. The miner must have developed lung cancer or certain respiratory diseases after radiation exposure. Respiratory diseases related to radiation exposure for uranium millers and ore transporters may qualify for RECA benefits if specific exposure and disease requirements are met. This includes conditions such as fibrosis of the lung, pulmonary fibrosis, corpulmonale, silicosis, or pneumoconiosis. Uranium millers and ore transporters must have worked in designated states between 1941 and 1971 and developed specific health conditions after radiation exposure. The RECA program provides benefits for individuals who develop specific health conditions after radiation exposure, including primary lung cancer, primary renal cancer, chronic renal disease, non-malignant respiratory diseases like fibrosis of the lung, pulmonary fibrosis, corpulmonale, silicosis, or pneumoconiosis. Claimants must submit written documentation of their illnesses to qualify for benefits, with special considerations for Native Americans. The Department of Justice (DOJ) considers Native American law, tradition, and custom in the application and payment procedures for RECA benefits. Application decisions are made within 12 months, and if not, benefits are automatically approved. The 2000 RECA amendments allow the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance. The Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program (RESEP) provides assistance with securing medical documentation for RECA claims. There are six RESEP clinics in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah, with one clinic dedicated to Native Americans. Applicants for RECA benefits do not need to be screened for cancer at RESEP clinics. Denied applicants can appeal to the DOJ within 60 days, and a decision will be made by an appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general of the Civil Division of DOJ. Applicants for RECA benefits and appeals of benefit denials can be represented by licensed attorneys or non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations. Non-attorney representatives may not charge fees for their representation. Licensed attorneys are limited to collecting 2% of benefits awarded for claims made after July 10, 2000. Attorneys representing RECA claimants can collect fees based on the date of their contract: 2% for claims after July 10, 2000, and 10% for claims before that date. They can also recover costs for unsuccessful claims and expenses for successful ones. Legislation may expand eligibility for downwinders in the RECA program's 25th year. Some Members of Congress are proposing legislation to expand eligibility for downwinders and provide benefits to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971 under the RECA program. Current law limits benefits to those present in designated counties in Arizona, Nevada, or Utah during atmospheric testing at NTS, excluding residents of other affected areas. These unresolved issues are likely to keep RECA on the congressional agenda. Residents of Guam and New Mexico affected by atomic weapons testing fallout are not eligible for benefits under the RECA program. Concerns about health effects led to unsuccessful attempts to gain compensation through civil courts before RECA was established in 1990. Legislation to compensate downwinders was first introduced in 1979, with ongoing efforts to expand eligibility for benefits. Legislation introduced during the 96th Congress in 1979 aimed to provide compensation to civilian downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS. H.R. 4766 would have made the United States liable for damages caused by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS to downwinders with cancer, onsite participants, and sheep herds damaged by atmospheric tests in 1953. Eligibility for compensation under this bill included downwinders with specific types of cancer determined by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. The affected area for downwinder eligibility in H.R. 4766 was specified as a rectangular area around NTS. The proposed legislation aimed to compensate civilian downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS. The bill would have made the US liable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, and affected sheep herds in specific areas in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. The affected area for downwinder eligibility was defined by counties and geographic features. The proposed legislation aimed to compensate civilian downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS in specific areas in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. The bill would have expanded the downwinder eligibility area to include additional counties in these states, with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare having the authority to add more areas. The current downwinder eligibility area includes specific counties in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, established with the 2000 RECA amendments. There have been efforts to expand eligibility to include more states and territories affected by atmospheric atomic weapons testing. The 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act mandated a study by the National Research Council on the health effects of radiation exposure from atomic weapons testing. The NRC recommended against expanding downwinder eligibility based solely on geographic area. The NRC recommended a science-based approach to determine downwinder eligibility for RECA benefits, considering factors like where individuals lived, time spent outdoors, and milk consumption for exposure to radiation. The ingestion of Iodine 131 through contaminated milk was a significant pathway of exposure. The NRC report advised the RECA program to use a probability model for equity. The NRC report recommended using a probability model to evaluate individual claims for RECA benefits based on absorbed dose of radionuclides, geographic, demographic, and behavioral factors. This model would calculate the probability that a specific type of cancer was caused by exposure to ionizing radiation, with Congress setting the threshold for awarding benefits. The NRC report recommended a probability model for evaluating RECA benefits based on absorbed dose of radionuclides, demographics, and behaviors. Congress would set the threshold for benefits, potentially using a sliding scale of probabilities. This model has not been part of RECA, EEOICPA, or VA programs, which currently use a presumption of eligibility model. Advocates may prefer the current model as a probability of causation model could result in fewer successful claims. The NRC recommended a probability model for evaluating RECA benefits based on absorbed dose of radionuclides, demographics, and behaviors. This model could result in fewer successful claims, as ionizing radiation is not a potent cancer-causing agent. The NRC stated that exposure to radiation from fallout is unlikely to be a substantial contributing cause to developing cancer. Scientifically based changes in eligibility criteria for compensation are expected to lead to few successful claims. Under current law, RECA benefits for uranium workers are only available if they were exposed to radiation before 1972 due to the federal government's procurement of uranium for atomic weapons ending in 1971. Private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants has been legal since 1964, creating a market for mined uranium post-1971. Legislation has been introduced to expand RECA since the 2000 amendments. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to expand RECA eligibility to include uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971. Advocates argue that despite safety regulations enacted since 1971, uranium workers, especially miners, remain at elevated risk for radon-induced diseases. The current Mine Safety and Health Administration annual exposure limit for radiation is higher than the limit recommended by NIOSH. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) annual exposure limit for radiation is higher than the limit recommended by NIOSH. The intent of the RECA program is to provide restitution to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners. Expansion of RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities is being considered. Expanding the RECA program to cover post-1971 uranium activities would extend coverage to workers in the commercial uranium sector, potentially beyond the program's original purpose. Illnesses from uranium mining for commercial clients may already be covered by state workers' compensation systems."
