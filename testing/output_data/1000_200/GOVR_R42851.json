    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. Three retailers challenged the Act, citing violations of the Due Process Clause. Previous court cases have established the need for a connection between a state and the taxed entity. In two separate cases, preliminary injunctions were granted against the Act. The PACT Act requires remote retailers to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. Court cases have resulted in preliminary injunctions against the Act, citing violations of the Due Process Clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld one injunction, while another case is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The PACT Act requires remote retailers to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the due process argument, stating that the Act is a federal statute that does not implicate due process. The court also noted that the plaintiff had minimum contacts with the jurisdictions due to its online transactions. Congress may not have the power to require remote retailers to pay taxes to jurisdictions without minimum contacts. The constitutionality of the PACT Act depends on minimum contacts for remote retailers, as stated in Quill. The Supreme Court requires minimum contacts for jurisdiction and that the tax paid must be related to the taxing state's values. The PACT Act requires remote sellers to comply with state laws and increase tax collection on sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. It deems interstate sales as intrastate sales to enforce tax collection and discourage smuggling, aiming to reduce youth access to cheap tobacco products. The delivery seller must comply with state and local laws regarding sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, including excise taxes, licensing requirements, and restrictions on sales to minors. The PACT Act also requires remote sellers to pay all applicable taxes and apply required stamps before delivery. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is regulated by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. The Commerce Clause prohibits state taxes that burden or discriminate against interstate commerce, while the Due Process Clause requires a sufficient connection between the business and the state for taxes to be imposed. The PACT Act has been challenged under the Due Process Clause by remote retailers. The Supreme Court's decision in Quill is relevant to this issue. The Supreme Court's opinion in Quill addressed the Due Process Clause in relation to state taxation of out-of-state businesses. The Court considered the case of a mail order retailer in North Dakota and the requirement to collect a use tax. The retailer argued that physical presence was necessary to establish minimum contacts, but the Court cited previous cases to support jurisdiction over out-of-state businesses without physical presence. The Supreme Court's opinion in Quill addressed the Due Process Clause in relation to state taxation of out-of-state businesses. Jurisdiction may not be avoided solely based on lack of physical presence in the forum State. Modern commercial transactions often occur through mail and wire communications across state lines, eliminating the need for physical presence. Purposeful direction of business activities towards residents of another State establishes personal jurisdiction, as seen in the case of a retailer sending catalogues to North Dakota residents. The Court in Quill found that a retailer sending catalogues to North Dakota residents established minimum contacts for taxation. In Red Earth, Seneca Nation members challenged the PACT Act's tax requirements on their tobacco sales, claiming a violation of the Due Process Clause. The plaintiffs challenged the PACT Act's tax requirements on their tobacco sales, arguing it violated the Due Process Clause. The United States claimed there was no issue with minimum contacts due to the plaintiffs' websites and shipping into taxing jurisdictions. The district court disagreed, noting not all plaintiffs had websites and that they were passive. The court determined that passive websites do not satisfy the minimum contacts requirement for imposing a duty to collect taxes, rejecting the argument that shipments into a state create sufficient contacts. The court rejected the argument that each sale creates minimum contacts for imposing tax collection duties on out-of-state sellers. A single, isolated sale may not be enough to establish jurisdiction, as existing cases suggest. The court noted that the Supreme Court in Quill focused on continuous solicitation of business rather than individual sales to determine jurisdiction. The Supreme Court in Quill would likely base its decision on the defendant's sale into the state rather than continuous solicitation of business. The court found that the PACT Act violates the Due Process Clause by broadening jurisdictional reach without minimum contacts. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, which the government appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court's preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, stating that requiring a vendor to collect taxes based on a single sale may violate due process. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale is sufficient for due process. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale is sufficient for due process. In Musser's case, the plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction on the ground that the PACT Act requires retailers to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts with the jurisdictions, violating the Due Process Clause. The district court's decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The PACT Act requires retailers to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts with the jurisdictions, violating the Due Process Clause. The district court denied the injunction, stating that Congress, not the states, imposes the tax-payment requirement on interstate businesses. Pharmacies, farmers, and distributors of explosives must comply with state and local laws when selling products. Congress can require interstate businesses to follow state and local laws as a condition of engaging in commerce. The court found that a plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to its interactive website. The court found that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states because of the interactive nature of its website, using the sliding scale approach. Personal jurisdiction is proper when a defendant does business over the Internet or enters into contracts involving the transmission of computer files. A passive website that only provides information is not grounds for personal jurisdiction, while interactive websites where users can exchange information fall in the middle ground. The court found that personal jurisdiction is proper when a defendant conducts business over the Internet or enters contracts involving computer file transmission. Interactive websites where users can exchange information determine jurisdiction based on interactivity and commercial nature. In Musser's case, selling products online and conducting business through the Internet in a state satisfies minimum contacts for due process concerns. The court found that conducting business through the Internet in a state is sufficient to satisfy due process concerns. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and a telephone order business selling tobacco products. He sought a preliminary injunction against the PACT Act's tax requirements, arguing it violates due process by not requiring minimum contacts. Initially denied by the district court, Gordon appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, stating that it was timely. They highlighted that Due Process and Commerce Clause violations are distinct, even if Congress authorizes state levies based on minimum contacts. The Court emphasized that national legislation must still adhere to Due Process principles of \"fair play and substantial justice.\" The case raises questions about the impact of excise taxes in light of the Quill decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, emphasizing that national legislation on interstate commerce must adhere to Due Process principles. The government argued that Gordon only needs minimum contacts with the U.S., not individual states, and each tobacco sale satisfies minimum contacts with a state. The court cited Supreme Court cases where interstate businesses were not subject to specific state jurisdictions when complying with laws of the destination state. The PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid, different from existing state laws. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the argument that Congress can authorize violations of Due Process in regulating interstate commerce. The court discussed the opinion in Musser's regarding the PACT Act challenge, stating that while Congress can regulate commerce among states, it cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The court reviewed the personal jurisdiction law based on the International Shoe Co. v. Washington case before addressing the government's argument on minimum contacts for sales by Gordon. The court discussed personal jurisdiction law based on International Shoe Co. v. Washington, emphasizing the need for minimum contacts with the jurisdiction to ensure fair play and substantial justice. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz was cited to support the idea that purposeful direction of commercial activities towards residents of another State can establish jurisdiction. The court highlighted that engaging in significant activities or creating continuing obligations in a State indicates availing oneself of the privilege of jurisdiction. The court emphasized the need for minimum contacts with a jurisdiction for fair play and substantial justice, citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz to support the idea that purposeful direction of commercial activities towards residents of another State can establish jurisdiction. Engaging in significant activities or creating continuing obligations in a State indicates availing oneself of the privilege of jurisdiction. The district court noted that a single act can support jurisdiction if it creates a substantial connection with the forum, but acts creating only an attenuated affiliation are not sufficient for foreseeable litigation in the forum. The Supreme Court in Corp. v. Woodson emphasized the importance of foreseeability in due process analysis, stating that defendants should reasonably anticipate being sued in a specific jurisdiction. This focus on foreseeability provides predictability to the legal system. In Quill, the Court reiterated the requirement of a definite link between a state and the person or transaction it seeks to tax for due process to be satisfied. In Quill, the Court found that the mail order business had minimum contacts with North Dakota sufficient to meet the requirement of due process. The district court found that the Quill standard was not met in Gordon, as the business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the economic market of the states it sold products to. The district court in Gordon found that the PACT Act may violate due process as the business did not purposefully avail itself of the economic market of the states it sold products to. The court in Gordon found that the PACT Act may violate due process by subjecting out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts. This could potentially conflict with the requirements of the Due Process Clause. The courts in Red Earth and Gordon analyzed the constitutionality of the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, specifically regarding state taxation of retailers without minimum contacts. The opinion in Musser's may have conflated the Commerce Clause and due process analyses. It remains uncertain if a single sale into a jurisdiction satisfies the minimum contacts requirement for due process, as noted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit."
