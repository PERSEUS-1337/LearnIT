    "content": "This report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East, including historical aid levels, specific country programs, and current issues. Congress authorizes and appropriates foreign aid, overseeing executive agencies' management of aid programs. The Middle East is a major recipient of U.S. economic and security assistance, making it a focus of congressional interest. Data in the report is sourced from various resources, such as the U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants Database, appropriations data from the Department of State and USAID, and information published annually by State Department and USAID. U.S. foreign aid to the Middle East aims to advance core interests such as supporting Israel, promoting peaceful relations, protecting energy supplies, and fighting terrorism. Assistance includes backing the peace treaties between Israel and Egypt, as well as Jordan, and advocating for a two-state solution between Palestinians and Israel. Legislative conditions prevent aid diversion to terrorist groups in the region. The United States provides aid to the Middle East to support core interests like Israel, peaceful relations, energy security, and counterterrorism. Aid includes promoting peace treaties and a two-state solution between Palestinians and Israel. Current challenges in the region include civil wars, terrorism, and political instability in countries like Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen. The Middle East is facing challenges with eroding central governance, local affiliates of Al Qaeda and ISIS fighting security forces, and debates in Congress over U.S. resources for the region. Tunisia is making progress towards a stable democratic system, but its gains are fragile due to a weak economy and ongoing terrorist violence. The U.S. has maintained relatively unchanged bilateral assistance to the region since before 2011, with leading recipients being Israel, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinians, and Iraq. The U.S. has maintained consistent bilateral aid to leading recipients in the Middle East, such as Israel, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinians, and Iraq. However, new sources of funding have been used to address challenges in the region, including the Syrian refugee crisis and the threat posed by the Islamic State. Congress has allocated over $4 billion for humanitarian aid and authorized new funding through Defense to combat these challenges. The U.S. has allocated over $4 billion for humanitarian aid and authorized new funding through Defense to combat challenges in the Middle East, including the Syrian refugee crisis and the threat posed by the Islamic State. Congress provided the Defense Department with new train and equip authorities to counter the Islamic State, with funding coming from new appropriations or authorized reprogramming. The conflicts in Syria and Iraq account for a greater share of regional foreign assistance due to increases in humanitarian spending, military assistance, and aid to neighboring states. The U.S. has allocated $3.45 billion for assistance to Iraq, aid to the Syrian opposition, and aid to neighboring states like Lebanon and Jordan to address conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Future appropriations may be influenced by domestic budgetary constraints, with a relatively stable budget for State Department and Foreign Operations funding since FY2009. Since FY2009, officials have relied on foreign aid funds from Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) accounts to respond to regional crises within a static budgetary environment. New bilateral aid to Iraq, the Syrian opposition, and Jordan, as well as funding for multilateral accounts used in humanitarian crises, have been designated as OCO. The House version of the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill (H.R. 2772) would provide $47.8 billion in total funding for FY2016. The House version of the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill (H.R. 2772) would provide $47.8 billion in total funding for FY2016, including grant assistance and loan guarantees to non-oil producers in the region. The IMF has provided significant loans to countries like Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, and Yemen, totaling over $9 billion, with conditions for economic reforms. The Arab Gulf states have increased aid to the Middle East region to counter Islamist influence and ensure regime continuity. Gulf countries have given $30 billion to Egypt since 2013. Iran also provides assistance to allies in the region. The Administration has requested $7.14 billion in non-humanitarian aid for Near East and North Africa countries for FY2016, representing a 5.4% increase over FY2014. The State Department's International Affairs request for East and North Africa countries is $7.14 billion for FY2016, a 5.4% increase over FY2014. More than 80% of this funding would support Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank and Gaza. Budget accounts providing non-humanitarian U.S. aid to the region include Development Assistance, Global Health Programs, Economic Support Fund, and others. 95% of non-humanitarian bilateral aid to Middle Eastern countries is within the ESF. The FY2016 foreign affairs request includes OCO funds for Middle Eastern bilateral aid and humanitarian aid for Syria and Iraq, totaling one-third of all OCO funds sought. Congress did not provide specific OCO funds for countering the Islamic State in FY2015. The FY2016 foreign affairs request includes OCO funds for Middle Eastern bilateral aid and humanitarian aid for Syria and Iraq. Congress did not provide specific OCO funds for countering the Islamic State, but increased OCO funds in many accounts for other assistance in the region. Additionally, the United States provides aid to Middle Eastern countries through regional programs like Middle East Regional (MER) and Near East Regional Democracy (NERD). The USAID allocates $15-20 million annually for MER and NERD programs promoting democracy and human rights in Iran. NERD activities for Iranian activists occur outside the country due to resistance from the clerical regime. The Administration is requesting $30 million for NERD in FY2016. MERC, managed by USAID, supports research cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors, with an annual funding of $30-40 million. MERC, established in 1979, encourages cooperation between Egyptian and Israeli scientists. It funds joint Arab-Israeli research in water, agriculture, environment, and health sectors. The Administration is requesting $5 million for MERC in FY2016. MEM, a State Department program, promotes technical cooperation between Arab and Israeli parties in areas like water scarcity and renewable energy. The Administration is requesting $1.4 million for MEM in FY2016. TSCTP is a State Department-led initiative focused on counter-terrorism in the Middle East and North Africa. The Administration is requesting $1.4 million for MEM in FY2016. TSCTP supports programs in North and West Africa to counter terrorism. For FY2016, $69.8 million is requested for TSCTP, with $13.4 million specifically for North African countries. The Administration is requesting $1.4 million for MEM in FY2016. TSCTP supports programs in North and West Africa to counter terrorism. In FY2016, $69.8 million is requested for TSCTP, with $13.4 million specifically for North African countries. Additionally, an extra $19.1 million is requested in PKO for sub-Saharan and North African participant countries. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) selects countries for assistance based on performance in ruling justly, investing in people, and economic freedom. Morocco and Jordan have received MCC grants in the past. In 2007, Morocco signed a $697.5 million MCC compact focusing on private agricultural and tourism sectors. Morocco's second compact, expected to be $480 million, will address secondary education and industrial land reform. Jordan received a $275.1 million MCC compact in 2010 to improve water supply and efficiency in Amman and Zarqa. Critics argue that countries with poor democratic indicators should not receive MCC aid. Some critics argue that countries with low democratic indicators should be ineligible for MCC aid. Freedom House suggested bypassing countries with low scores on political rights and civil liberties, like Jordan. Despite doing well on other indicators, analysts believe Jordan should not be eligible due to already receiving significant U.S. aid, access to private sector capital, and lack of democracy. The debate on this issue has been ongoing for nearly fifteen years. The debate over funding democracy promotion in the Arab world has been ongoing since the 9/11 attacks, with increased attention and funding from successive Administrations and Congress. During the Arab Spring, U.S. funding for democracy promotion sparked controversy in countries like Egypt. As authoritarianism resurges in the Arab world, the U.S. foreign policy community is once again discussing the issue. The U.S. foreign policy community is debating funding for democracy promotion in the Arab world amidst authoritarian rule. The White House lacks a single agency for coordinating democracy promotion in the Middle East. The Administration is requesting $442 million for democracy and governance activities in the region for FY2016. MEPI, funded by various U.S. agencies, supports political reform, women's empowerment, and economic opportunity in the Arab world. Congress has allocated around $913.4 to $960.6 million in Economic Support Funds for MEPI since 2002. MEPI directly funds indigenous NGOs in the Middle East and North Africa through its Local Grants Program. MEPI's promotion in the Arab world involves funding indigenous NGOs in the Middle East and North Africa. However, in countries with legal restrictions on foreign funding, U.S. officials and grant recipients must consider potential risks. The State Department requested $70 million in ESF funding for MEPI in FY2016, with annual allocations averaging $76-80 million. In 2015, MEPI received $40.8 million. In FY2016, the State Department requested $70 million in ESF funding for MEPI, with annual allocations averaging $76-80 million. MEPI aims to continue spending $8.5 million in direct support to local civil society organizations through its Local Grants Program. Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance, receiving $124.3 billion in bilateral aid, mostly in military assistance. For FY2016, the President's request for Israel would encompass approximately 53% of the total requested FMF funding worldwide. Israel receives significant military financing from the U.S., with strong congressional support resulting in benefits not available to other countries. This includes the ability to use some assistance for research and development in the U.S. and purchases from Israeli manufacturers. Israel also receives aid quickly and can use cash flow financing for arms purchases. Additionally, Israel receives funds for rocket and missile defense programs from annual defense appropriations bills. Israel receives military aid from the U.S. for rocket and missile defense programs, with a 10-year, $30 billion aid package agreed upon in 2007. Discussions are ongoing for a future aid deal beyond 2018. Egypt has received $76 billion in bilateral foreign aid from the U.S., with $1.3 billion annually in military aid since 1987. Egypt receives the bulk of its foreign aid funds from three primary accounts: FMF, ESF, and IMET. For FY2016, the President requested $1.3 billion in military assistance and $150 million in economic aid for Egypt. Since the Egyptian military's ouster of former President Mohammed Morsi in 2013, aid to Egypt has been a focus for the Administration and some lawmakers. P.L. 113-235, the FY2015 Consolidated Appropriations Act, includes provisions and conditions on U.S. assistance to Egypt, with one significant exception. The FY2015 Act allows the Secretary of State to provide assistance to Egypt without certification requirements if it is in the national security interest of the U.S. Total U.S. aid to Jordan from FY1951 to FY2015 was $15.83 billion. An MOU was signed in 2015 for $1 billion in annual foreign assistance to Jordan from FY2015 to FY2017. The Administration is requesting nearly $1 billion in total aid for Jordan for FY2016. The United States provides economic aid to Jordan through cash transfers and USAID programs, supporting the government's foreign debt and costs related to Syrian refugees. Military assistance focuses on enabling Jordan to procure and maintain conventional weapons systems, including F-16 fighters and AMRAAM missiles. Additionally, FMF grants finance the acquisition of Blackhawk helicopters for border monitoring and counterterrorism efforts. FMF grants provide financing for Jordan to acquire U.S. Blackhawk helicopters for border monitoring and counterterrorism. The U.S. has committed over $5 billion in bilateral assistance to Palestinians since the mid-1990s, subject to various conditions and restrictions. Limited bilateral assistance has been provided since FY2014 due to political concerns. ESF funds were used for budgetary assistance in the West Bank and Gaza from FY2007 to FY2013. The U.S. has provided over $5 billion in bilateral assistance to Palestinians since the mid-1990s, with ESF funds used for budgetary assistance in the West Bank and Gaza. Currently, most bilateral funds for Gaza are dedicated to humanitarian assistance and economic recovery. U.S. assistance for Palestinian refugees is provided through UNRWA. The Administration is seeking $442.0 million for West Bank and Gaza in FY2016. In FY2016, the Administration is seeking $442.0 million for West Bank and Gaza, with $370.0 million for economic and development programs and $72.0 million for security assistance. Additionally, $3.45 billion is requested for responding to the crisis in Syria and fighting the Islamic State, including funds for Department of Defense train & equip programs, non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition, FMF for the Iraqi army, and multilateral humanitarian aid. The Department of Defense is also requesting $715 million for train and equip programs in FY2016. For FY2016, the Department of Defense is requesting $715 million and $600 million for train and equip programs for Iraqis and Syrians, respectively. These requests would fund programs initiated under authorities and funds provided in FY2015 defense authorization and appropriations bills, drawn from FY2016 Department of the Army Operations and Maintenance Overseas Contingency Operations (O&M-OCO) funding. The Administration is providing about $1.6 billion in DOD/OCO funding for an \"Iraq Train and Equip Fund\" to support training missions for Iraqi Security Forces, Kurdish peshmerga, and Sunni tribal fighters. The Administration is requesting $1.82 billion for security assistance related to Syria in FY2016. This includes $255 million for assistance to opposition groups within Syria, with $65 million for non-lethal assistance to armed Syrian opposition members. Additionally, $160 million is allocated for non-lethal aid to Syrian national and local-level opposition groups. Another $10 million is designated for justice sector support in opposition-held areas. The FY2016 request includes $10 million in INCLE-OCO funding for justice sector support in opposition-held areas. Additionally, $20 million from the NADR account would support law enforcement training, border security training, and weapons abatement initiatives. The request also includes $250 million in FMF-OCO to build up the capabilities of the ISF against the Islamic State. The Administration's FY2016 budget request seeks $5.64 billion in global humanitarian assistance, including $1.63 billion in OCO funds for the crisis in Syria and Iraq. Since 2011, the US has allocated over $4 billion for humanitarian needs. Adjustments to foreign aid policy in the Middle East have been discussed since the \"Arab Spring\" in 2011. The State Department and USAID have repurposed foreign aid for countries in transition or civil war in the Middle East. The Administration sought more legal latitude and funding from Congress in FY2013 and FY2014 but was unsuccessful. They proposed creating the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA-IF) for this purpose. The Administration sought increased transition support funding for the MENA Initiative in FY2015, using ESF funds at a lower level than previously requested for MENA-IF. Congress did not authorize MENA-IF funding, with some lawmakers expressing concerns about the broad spending authorities proposed. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying P.L. 113-235 supported \"Middle East Response\" funding flexibility for the Department of State to address contingencies. Proposals to restructure U.S. aid to Egypt have raised concerns about military aid not aligning with current threats and potentially destabilizing political stability. The White House announced the release of selected weapons systems to Egypt, but will stop providing cash flow financing starting in FY2018. This decision has raised concerns about the alignment of military aid with current threats and its impact on political stability. The White House will stop providing cash flow financing (CFF) to Egypt starting in FY2018. This decision follows increased scrutiny of U.S. military aid to Egypt, with critics questioning the funding of expensive weapons systems. Supporters argue that aid is necessary for Egypt's fight against terrorism. The policy change comes after a review of U.S. foreign assistance policy towards Egypt following the 2013 ouster of President Mohammed Morsi. The White House will phase out cash flow financing (CFF) to Egypt starting in FY2018. This decision is part of a broader policy approach to balance national security interests and democratic principles in dealing with the post-Morsi, military-backed Egyptian government. The relationship will shift towards maintaining security cooperation while moving away from traditional military-to-military foundations. Public discussion on the proposed policy changes has been relatively muted. The FY2016 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill (H.R. 2772) requires consultation with Appropriations Committees for restructuring military assistance to Egypt. Aid to Palestinians is subject to conditions, restrictions, and reporting requirements, with no aid allowed for Hamas, PLO, or PA employees in Gaza. Aid for a future Palestinian state or government including Hamas would require commitments to peaceful coexistence with Israel. Since 2011, Palestinian officials have pursued international initiatives to gain recognition of statehood and pressure Israel, leading to delays in aid disbursement. Congress has enacted conditions that could reduce aid based on Palestinian actions, such as supporting ICC investigations against Israeli nationals. The FY2016 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill requires consultation for restructuring military assistance to Egypt and imposes restrictions on aid to Palestinians, including no aid for Hamas, PLO, or PA employees in Gaza. Aid for a future Palestinian government would require commitments to peaceful coexistence with Israel. The ICC opened a preliminary examination of the \"situation in Palestine\" in response to alleged crimes against Palestinians. Some lawmakers have called for the suspension of ESF aid to the Palestinians, but the State Department stated that relevant restrictions on assistance have not been triggered. U.S. support for Tunisia's transition to democracy is seen as crucial for regional stability, with a focus on combating terrorism and promoting economic growth. The Administration is requesting $134 million for Tunisia in FY2016, with a focus on security assistance. Previous aid totaled $580 million between FY2011 and FY2014. Congressional committees have reported bills for FY2016 appropriations. The FY2016 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill (S. 1725) and its accompanying committee reports (H.Rept. 114-154 and S.Rept. 114-79) include Middle East-related provisions. See Table 6 for a comparison of select provisions."
