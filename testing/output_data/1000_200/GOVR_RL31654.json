    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Species can be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on extinction risk assessments. Legal tools under the ESA include prohibiting unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species and ensuring actions do not harm listed species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires agencies to ensure their actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. As of August 24, 2016, there were 2,266 endangered or threatened species, with 1,593 in the US. The ESA was passed in 1973 and has been amended multiple times. Funding authorization expired in 1992, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) funding authorization expired in 1992, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds. The ESA aims to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species. It can be a battleground for debates over scarce resources, with economic interests at play. Declining species often signal resource scarcities. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) funding authorization expired in 1992, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds. The ESA aims to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species. It can be a battleground for debates over scarce resources, with economic interests at play. Declining species often signal resource scarcities, as seen in controversies like the Tellico Dam and Northwest timber harvest. The polar bear has become a symbol in the global climate change debate, adding tension to the ESA as more species are added to the protected list. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has faced increasing tensions due to the addition of species to the protected list and the impact of economic growth and human population on habitats. Efforts have been made by Congress and the executive branch to tailor the ESA for specific circumstances. Debate on the ESA largely divides along demographic lines, with urban and suburban populations showing stronger support for species conservation compared to rural areas. Critics argue that the ESA does not do enough to accommodate needs other than species conservation, while defenders believe it balances biases towards development in other laws and policies. The debate on the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is divided along demographic lines, with urban and suburban populations showing stronger support for species conservation. Sport hunters, anglers, and Native Americans are frequently involved in ESA issues. Groups opposing strong protections for listed species argue about potential job losses, while those seeking strong protections claim the same. Ethical and religious considerations also play a role in the debate, with industries like logging and land development viewing the ESA as a problem. Some industries view the ESA as a problem, while others see it as supporting their interests. The ESA contains statutory authority for certain activities and a provision for appropriations. Questions arise about the act's prohibitions and authorities, House and Senate rules for appropriations without current authorization, and the impact of failing to appropriate funds for agencies like FWS and NMFS. The ESA's authorization for appropriations expired in FY1992, leading some to believe it is not authorized. However, agencies still have authority to act under certain sections of the act, and prohibitions remain enforceable even without appropriated funds. The expiration of authorization does not negate statutory obligations. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that lack of funding does not negate statutory obligations created by law. Citizen suits can still be filed under Section 11(g) of the ESA, allowing enforcement even without agency funding. This could deter parties from violating the ESA, despite temporary funding issues for enforcement agencies. The House and Senate have rules distinguishing between authorizations and appropriations, but these rules are for Congress's convenience and do not affect a law's validity. The House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. These rules aim to prevent parties from carrying out prohibited acts despite funding issues for enforcement agencies. The House and Senate have rules distinguishing between authorizations and appropriations, with the House Rules Committee able to report special rules for appropriations measures. Special rules can waive points of order and rules prohibiting unauthorized appropriations. Senate rules also prohibit unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments, except in specified circumstances. The House and Senate have rules distinguishing between authorizations and appropriations, with the House Rules Committee able to report special rules for appropriations measures. Special rules can waive points of order and rules prohibiting unauthorized appropriations. Senate rules also prohibit unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments, except in specified circumstances. The prohibition does not apply to conference reports and can be waived by unanimous consent. The practical effects of a lapse in funding would have mixed consequences for supporters and critics of existing law. Some affected areas during a funding lapse include interagency consultations, approval of agency actions, issuance of incidental take statements, and species listing or delisting. No species listed or delisted, potentially increasing lawsuits when Services fail to meet listing deadlines in Section 4; No critical habitat designated, revised, or removed from designation, potentially increasing lawsuits when Services fail to meet deadlines; No issuance of incidental take permits for nonfederal actions; No federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat. The last major effort to end all funding for the ESA occurred in the 104th Congress, but was abandoned due to various effects, including no federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat. Funding for listing new species was temporarily halted. The effort to end funding for the ESA was abandoned due to various effects, including no federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat. The ESA's goal is species recovery to the point where protection is no longer necessary, but only 34 species have been delisted due to recovery. Some species have become extinct, been delisted due to reclassification, or improved data. It can be challenging to determine if rare species are truly extinct. The difficulty in proving the extinction of rare species is highlighted, with examples of endangered bird species like the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew. The effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is questioned, as only a few species have been delisted due to recovery. The challenge lies in determining if rare species are truly extinct, as confirmed sightings are rare or in the distant past. The Endangered Species Act's effectiveness is measured by the number of species that have stabilized or increased populations, with 41% showing improvement. Species like red wolves and California condors may not exist without ESA protection, indicating success. Some species, such as certain salmon populations and Florida panthers, could have faced further decline towards extinction without the ESA. Scientific information and analysis are crucial pillars of the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been crucial in preventing the extinction of species like red wolves and California condors. Scientific analysis plays a key role in ESA actions, focusing on causes of extinction and comparing current extinction rates to historical levels. Habitat loss has become a significant threat to a majority of species, highlighting the shift in the extinction debate from over-exploitation to habitat destruction. Habitat loss, exacerbated by factors like global climate change and the introduction of nonnative invasive species, is a significant threat to many species. This loss includes tall-grass prairies, wetlands, old growth forests, rivers, coral reefs, and sandy beaches. The homogenization of flora and fauna is a growing concern. The gradual homogenization of the world's flora and fauna has led to a demise of many species. Many species are threatened by multiple factors, and some decline for no obvious reason. Extinction is a normal process, but the current rate exceeds background rates. Calculating current rates of extinction is difficult due to the wide range of total species estimates. Estimates of total species range from 3.5 million to 100 million, with 10-30 million commonly accepted. Scientists struggle to estimate extinction rates due to uncertainty in species numbers. Current extinction rates (e.g., 17,000 species per year) exceed background rates, with various methods confirming this trend. Public awareness of the vast number of species is lacking, contributing to the astonishment at high extinction rates. The current extinction rates exceed background rates, with estimates ranging from 100 to 10,000 times higher. Critics question these calculations due to uncertainties, but biologists argue that similar numbers are found in studies of different groups using various methods. Some biologists argue that high rates of extinction could lead to a recovery of species through evolution, with new species better adapted to new conditions. Past extinction events have taken up to 25 million years for recovery to similar numbers of different species. The current extinction rate and recovery rate are comparable to past rates, indicating that it would take several million years to return to pre-historic species numbers. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA does not use a numerical standard due to the wide variety of species biology. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects all species and subspecies of animals, with additional protection for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species, but not for organisms like Eubacteria, Archaea, and viruses. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect. Controversy exists over whether habitat modification is included in the prohibition on taking.

Limited protection is available for plant species. The term \"take\" includes actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect. Controversy exists over whether habitat modification is included in the prohibition on taking. The law assigns the major role to the Secretary of the Interior and provides for the relationship of the two Secretaries and their respective powers. Species may be listed on the initiative of the appropriate Secretary or by petition from an individual or group. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects all species and subspecies of animals, with additional protection for distinct population segments within a species. The law assigns the major role to the Secretary of the Interior and provides for the relationship of the two Secretaries and their respective powers. Species may be listed on the initiative of the appropriate Secretary or by petition from an individual, group, or state agency. The Secretary must decide whether to list the species based only on the best available scientific and commercial information, after an extensive series of procedural steps to ensure public participation and the collection of relevant information. Economic considerations are expressly forbidden in this decision-making process, as Congress directed that listing be fundamentally a scientific question: is the continued existence of the species threatened or endangered? The Endangered Species Act (ESA) directs that listing be a scientific question to determine if a species is endangered or threatened based on its decline and threats to survival. Endangered species are at risk of extinction, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA allows for different levels of protection for species, subspecies, or distinct population segments. The interpretation of \"all or a significant portion of its range\" varies, with the Department of the Interior having different views in the past. The Department of the Interior's interpretation of the phrase \"all or a significant portion of its range\" under the Endangered Species Act has evolved over time. Courts have found that a species at risk of extinction in a significant portion of its range should be considered endangered. In 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service defined a significant portion of a species' range as crucial for its viability, even if the species is not currently endangered throughout its entire range. The interpretation of the Endangered Species Act emphasizes the importance of a species' viability in a specific portion of its range to determine its endangered status. Listing decisions are based on scientific factors without considering economic impacts. The determination of endangered or threatened status under the Endangered Species Act is meant to be based solely on biological criteria, without considering economic impacts. The addition of the word \"solely\" in the legislation aims to ensure that listing decisions are made strictly on scientific and commercial data. The Endangered Species Act emphasizes that listing decisions should be based solely on scientific and commercial data, without considering economic factors. Economic considerations are deemed irrelevant to determining the status of species, and the legislation rejects the application of economic criteria in the listing process. The Endangered Species Act emphasizes that listing decisions should be based solely on scientific and commercial data, without considering economic factors. The ESA allows for conservation methods that lower costs to society, industry, or landowners while still achieving conservation goals. Species listings can be initiated by petition, with FWS and NMFS required to make an initial determination within 90 days. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to make timely determinations on petitions for listing species. Lawsuits have been filed for missed deadlines, leading to settlements in 2011. FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions by August 2016. The Endangered Species Act requires timely determinations on petitions for listing species, with lawsuits settled in 2011. By August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, including requests for listing and other actions. The federal government's responsibilities towards proposed species are questioned, especially during the time between proposal and actual listing. Agencies must confer with the Secretary on actions that could harm proposed species or their critical habitat. The conference process under the Endangered Species Act assists in identifying and resolving conflicts early in the planning process for species proposed for listing. It is less formal than the consultation process for listed species and aims to advise agencies on minimizing adverse effects. Agencies may choose a more formal process to avoid duplication of effort later. The conference stage does not limit irreversible commitment of resources by agency action. The conference stage under the Endangered Species Act does not restrict irreversible commitment of resources by agency action. Agencies may consider prudent measures to avoid harm to species and potential liability. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent significant risks to their well-being. As of August 24, 2016, there were 58 candidate species being considered for listing as endangered or threatened. Federal agencies and landowners can enter into conservation agreements to improve the species' status and potentially avoid a listing proposal in the future. If a species is proposed for listing under the ESA, the relevant Secretary must monitor to prevent significant risks to their well-being. If a species is proposed for listing under the ESA, the Secretary must publish the proposed regulation in the Federal Register, notify relevant agencies and hold a public hearing. Federal agencies must confer with the Secretary on actions that may harm candidate species, with no required resource limitations. The Secretary must monitor candidate species for any emergencies that could endanger them and promptly list them if necessary. Special regulations can be implemented for threatened species to tailor protections and recovery measures. A distinct population segment (DPS) under the ESA allows for specific conservation actions. The Endangered Species Act clarifies that threatened species without special rules have the same protections as endangered species. A DPS refers to a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species, with criteria for designation including discreteness and significance. Once a DPS is designated, its protection status is determined using the same criteria as other listings, with the possibility of special rules under Section 4(d) of the ESA for threatened DPSs like the gray wolf. The Endangered Species Act specifies that threatened species have the same protections as endangered species. Designation of Distinct Population Segments (DPS) under special rules can be prompted by threats. The gray wolf DPS designations have faced legal challenges, with courts vacating each one since 2003. The concept of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) was developed by NMFS to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA. ESUs aim to identify important groups of salmon populations, with 28 ESUs of salmon and steelhead trout listed as endangered or threatened along the Pacific coast as of July 25, 2016. Some critics find the ESU concept problematic as it lacks a specific scientific basis. The ESU concept, developed by NMFS, aims to identify important groups of salmon populations listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA. It was created due to the impracticality of using stock level or full species level classifications. Congress added the concept of experimental populations in 1982 to reintroduce species without severe land use restrictions, requiring authorization from the service for release. The inclusion of hatchery fish in ESUs has been a controversial issue. Experimental populations must meet two criteria for reintroduction: authorization from the service and geographical separation from other animals of the same species. Their protected status is determined based on their risk of extinction, with special regulations under the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) includes rules for taking species, with no Section 7 consultation required for actions on experimental populations in certain areas. Critical habitat is not designated for nonessential experimental populations. The processes for delisting, uplisting, or downlisting a species are the same, with the Secretary of the Interior having the authority to initiate changes in status. Substantive petitions can also trigger a review of a species' status for potential delisting, uplisting, or downlisting. The Endangered Species Act mandates periodic reviews of listed species to determine changes in status based on scientific data. Critical habitat includes areas essential for species conservation. The Secretary must designate critical habitat when a species is listed. Critical habitat is essential for species conservation and must be designated when a species is listed. The Secretary may choose not to designate critical habitat if it would harm the species, or postpone designation if information is not determinable. As of July 25, 2016, critical habitat had been designated for 758 listed species, affecting both federally owned and private land only if federal action is involved. Federal agencies must avoid adverse impacts on critical habitat. Private land is affected by critical habitat designation only if federal action is involved. Federal agencies must avoid adverse impacts on critical habitat. The Secretary must base critical habitat designation on the best scientific data available and consider economic and other relevant impacts. Areas may be excluded if benefits outweigh inclusion, unless extinction is a risk. Economic factors are considered in critical habitat designation. The failure to designate critical habitat may lead to species extinction, and economic factors must be considered in the process. Adverse modification of critical habitat is primarily a concern for federal agencies, not private landowners. Restrictions on private land use are mainly due to the Endangered Species Act's prohibition on harming listed species. The Endangered Species Act's restrictions on land use primarily stem from the prohibition on harming listed species. Amendments have limited critical habitat designation on Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans under the Sikes Act. National security and land benefits are now considered in critical habitat designations. The Endangered Species Act restricts land use by prohibiting harm to listed species. Amendments limit critical habitat designation on Defense Department lands to consider national security. Designating critical habitat is crucial for conservation, especially in unoccupied areas that serve as connecting corridors or potential reintroduction sites. FWS has faced challenges in complying with all ESA demands and has deprioritized critical habitat designation. The FWS has deprioritized critical habitat designation due to budget constraints, leading to frequent lawsuits for failure to designate. The agency believes critical habitat offers minimal additional protection for species beyond listing, making the expense unjustified. Funding restrictions on critical habitat designation have been maintained in appropriations bills despite conservation groups' concerns. The expense of designating critical habitat under the ESA is seen as a poor use of budgetary resources, as it may not provide significant additional protection for listed species. Federal agencies must consider the impact on critical habitat in their actions, but the FWS has previously argued that this extra protection is rare. The FWS previously argued that designated critical habitat does not offer extra protection as federal actions must already consider species jeopardy. However, this view was challenged in court for shifting focus from species recovery to survival. The definition was eventually changed in February 2016. The definition of \"conservation\" in the ESA was changed in February 2016 to focus on species recovery goals. The new definition emphasizes that destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat diminishes its value for species conservation. The Endangered Species Act requires the development of recovery plans for listed species, covering birds and mammals but not favoring specific taxonomic groups. These plans lack detail and are not binding on federal agencies. As of August 24, 2016, there were 1,156 recovery plans for U.S. species, with land acquisition for conservation funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) may provide money for acquiring land to conserve threatened species. The fund is primarily derived from offshore oil and gas leases. Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the appropriate Secretary must cooperate with states in conserving protected species and may enter into cooperative agreements to assist states in their endangered species programs. States may receive federal funds for their programs, with a minimum 25% matching amount required. The 1988 ESA amendments created a fund for state grants, including land acquisition and planning assistance, with the fund size determined by a formula. Annual appropriation is still needed for money from the fund. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) provides money for acquiring land to conserve threatened species. Congress appropriated $53.5 million for cooperative activities with states and territories in FY2016. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment (BA) if actions may adversely affect a listed species. Through consultation with FWS or NMFS, agencies ensure actions do not jeopardize endangered species or critical habitat, known as a Section 7 consultation. A Section 7 consultation is required for federal actions that may impact endangered species or critical habitat. If the action is found not to jeopardize species or habitat, a biological opinion is issued along with terms to avoid harm. The Endangered Species Act requires a biological opinion to be issued if a federal action may impact endangered species or critical habitat. The opinion must suggest alternatives to avoid harm if the action is deemed to jeopardize species or habitat. The BiOp is based on the best available scientific and commercial data. Most consultations result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions. The BiOp is required under the Endangered Species Act for federal actions that may impact endangered species or critical habitat. Consultations mostly result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives for the project to proceed. The consultation timeline varies depending on the nature of the action and parties involved. If no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or seek an exemption. If a proposed agency action may result in jeopardy to a species, the agency can choose to forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or apply for an exemption from the penalties. Exemptions are decided by a high-level Endangered Species Committee, requiring at least five votes to pass. The committee includes federal officials such as the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and the Army. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) requires at least five votes to pass an exemption for agency actions that may harm a species. The committee includes six federal officials and follows extensive rules and deadlines for applying for exemptions. The ESC must grant an exemption if the Secretary of Defense deems it necessary for national security. Additionally, the President may exempt projects for repairing or replacing facilities in disaster areas. To be eligible for an exemption from the Endangered Species Committee, federal agencies must have conducted required consultations under the ESA, made efforts to consider alternatives that would not harm species, and refrained from irreversible commitments of resources. The Endangered Species Committee requires federal agencies to conduct consultations under the ESA, consider alternatives to avoid harm to species, and refrain from irreversible commitments of resources when seeking an exemption. The ESC will grant an exemption if no reasonable alternatives exist, and the benefits of the action outweigh those of alternative courses consistent with species conservation. The Endangered Species Committee requires federal agencies to consider alternatives and avoid irreversible commitments when seeking an exemption under the ESA. The exemption process is complex and involves specific provisions for international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The Endangered Species Committee mandates federal agencies to explore alternatives and avoid irreversible commitments when seeking an exemption under the ESA. The exemption process is intricate and includes provisions for international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The process for granting an exemption in emergency conditions is not straightforward and could take up to 280 days. The applicant must fund any required mitigation measures, with the funding obligation lasting potentially forever depending on the nature of the action. The burden of conservation and recovery may fall heavily elsewhere as the exemption applies to the action, not the species. The burden of conservation and recovery may fall heavily elsewhere, making it difficult for a governor to balance state interests. An exemption from the ESA may not be enough to proceed with an action if other statutory obligations are still required. Parties in a dispute may be hesitant to support the extinction of a species publicly. The consultation process allows federal agencies to adjust their actions to avoid harming species or habitats while still moving forward. The ESA consultation process allows federal agencies to modify their actions to avoid harming species or habitats while still proceeding with their actions. Private parties can obtain permits for incidental take of listed species through habitat conservation plans. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) expanded in the 1990s with streamlined procedures for activities with minimal impacts. It includes provisions for exemptions for raptors, regulations for subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, and rules for controlling trade in endangered species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits taking, possessing, selling, or transporting unlawfully taken endangered species. Threatened species are also protected under similar regulations. Violating any ESA regulation is considered a violation, with exceptions such as incidental take permits. Good-faith belief can exempt individuals from civil penalties for ESA violations. Section 11 of the ESA states that individuals who violate the Act may face civil penalties, with higher fines for knowing violators and business entities involved in importing or exporting wildlife. Criminal violations may also apply. The ESA allows for enforcement through lawsuits in federal court to stop violations or compel the Secretary to fulfill duties. The citizen suit provisions of the ESA allow individuals to sue to enforce the Act, compel the Secretary to act, and seek litigation costs and attorneys' fees. These provisions have been instrumental in driving conservation efforts and influencing species listings. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows citizen suits to enforce the Act and challenge listing decisions, leading to numerous lawsuits against FWS and NMFS. The ESA also implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the US, focusing on protecting species at risk of extinction. CITES categorizes listed species based on extinction risk and trade regulations. The ESA implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention, focusing on protecting species at risk of extinction. CITES categorizes listed species based on extinction risk and trade regulations. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority specified under CITES. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) specified under CITES. The Secretary must ensure that international trade of organisms or their products does not harm the species. The Secretary is also the Management Authority for the United States under CITES, responsible for legal exports and imports of specimens. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) specified under CITES. The Secretary is responsible for ensuring that international trade of organisms or their products does not harm the species. The ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species without permission, except for scientific purposes or species survival. Importers and exporters of fish or wildlife must obtain permission, keep records, allow inspections, and use designated ports. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) specified under CITES. Importers and exporters must obtain permission, keep records, allow inspections, and use designated ports. An exemption was granted for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir, with mitigation measures to protect whooping crane habitat. The Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition from various sectors, including local landowners and Indian tribes, after the endangered snail darter was listed. This led to the landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill, clarifying the reach of the ESA and its impact on public works projects. Congress then passed P.L. 95-632, establishing an ESC process and mitigation measures for critical whooping crane habitat on the Platte River. The ESC process was established by P.L. 95-632 after the Tellico Dam controversy. Despite the ESC denying an exemption for the dam, Congress directed its completion in P.L. 96-69. The Bureau of Land Management sought exemptions for timber sales in northern spotted owl habitat, with the ESC granting exemptions for some sales in 1992. In 1992, the ESC granted exemptions for 13 timber sales in northern spotted owl habitat. Controversy arose, leading to the withdrawal of these sales during the Clinton Administration. Additionally, there were other instances of exemption applications, such as the Pittston Company's refinery in Eastport, ME, and the Consolidated Grain and Barge Company's docking area in Mound City, IL, both facing challenges due to potential impacts on endangered species. In Mound City, IL, a company applied for an exemption to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, a habitat for endangered manatees. The Army Corps of Engineers denied the permit, and the application was later withdrawn in 1986. The consulting engineer lacked the authority to apply on behalf of the Suwanee River Authority, which refused to ratify his actions and withdrew the application. Despite attempts to continue, the withdrawal remained effective."
