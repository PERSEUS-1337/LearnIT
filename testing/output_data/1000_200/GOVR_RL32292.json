    "content": "Offshoring, or offshore outsourcing, involves U.S. businesses contracting with firms outside the country for services previously done in-house. This practice has expanded from manufacturing to service providers, raising concerns about job loss among U.S. workers, especially in light of high unemployment rates post-recession. The high unemployment rate persists years after the 2007-2009 recession. The impact of offshore outsourcing on the labor market is uncertain, with some attributing job loss to this practice. However, historical trends suggest that the labor market can recover from downturns. Offshoring may have accounted for a small percentage of job loss in the early 2000s, and some believe it is hindering the labor market's recovery from the recent recession. Some believe offshoring is contributing to slow labor market rebound from the 2007-2009 recession. Economists argue that globalization benefits the nation by offering a variety of products at lower prices and expanding markets. However, there are concerns about services offshoring, with companies potentially benefiting the most by increasing profits through lower costs. Some argue that offshoring activities benefit shareholders through increased dividends and stock prices, rather than promoting growth in the U.S. economy. The movement of service jobs overseas may have different implications for the labor market compared to production jobs. Data shows that factory workers have lower educational levels compared to administrative and professional workers. There are concerns about whether offshoring service activities will result in college graduates losing job opportunities. The offshoring of service jobs raises concerns about the impact on college graduates and the availability of entry-level positions. Questions arise about the adequacy of trade adjustment assistance programs for well-educated workers affected by offshoring. Policymakers are considering measures to address job growth and support workers impacted by shifts in job composition. The offshoring of service jobs raises concerns about job growth in the United States, leading policymakers to consider measures to support workers affected by offshoring. Some advocate for government intervention to promote economic growth, while others focus on leveling the playing field for U.S. companies in the international marketplace. This report provides context on outsourcing by U.S. companies and synthesizes information on the latest business practices. The report provides context on offshore outsourcing by U.S. companies, focusing on the impact on U.S. employment. Major companies began relocating manufacturing work overseas in the 1970s and 1980s in response to competition. This has led to a need for policymakers to evaluate retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. The 2001 recession prompted U.S. employers to achieve further efficiencies by outsourcing jobs to employees of temporary help agencies, professional and business services establishments, and independent contractors located in the United States. This shift towards domestic outsourcing of formerly in-house functions is a permanent reorganization of how work is performed in the United States, facilitated by technological innovations that minimize the importance of physical distance between companies. The widespread dissemination of technologies has allowed U.S. firms to extend offshoring to services beyond goods production, including IT and IT-enabled jobs. Other countries also enhanced their ability to export services, particularly IT services, to the United States. The offshoring of services, especially IT services, to the United States and other developed countries has been facilitated by events like the Y2K crisis and the abundance of well-educated individuals in low-wage foreign nations. This has allowed for the provision of IT services from non-English-speaking, low-wage countries. The offshoring of IT services to developed countries like the United States has been facilitated by events like the Y2K crisis and the availability of well-educated individuals in low-wage foreign nations. This has led to the fragmentation of tasks across borders in manufacturing and information services, allowing companies to distribute production tasks like research, design, and IT support across multiple countries. This trend has contributed to increased wage inequality in the United States in recent decades. The offshoring of IT services to the United States has contributed to increased wage inequality. Technological change and deunionization played a role in wage polarization during the 1980s and 1990s. Data on job losses to offshoring is limited, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics underestimating the impact, especially on service providers. The BLS series underestimates job losses to offshoring, focusing more on large layoffs at manufacturers than service providers. In the third quarter of 2012, only a small percentage of workers affected by extended mass layoffs had their jobs moved overseas. Forrester Research provided early statistics on offshoring of service sector jobs. Forrester Research forecasted that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015, with 1.7 million projected to relocate outside the United States in the first 7 years. Despite the large number, this loss represents a small share of jobs typically created and destroyed annually in the U.S. Researchers focus on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring and estimating U.S. employment in these areas. Researchers have focused on identifying jobs vulnerable to offshoring in the United States. Bardhan and Kroll estimated that over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, could be sent overseas due to certain attributes. Vulnerable occupational groups include office support and auditors. The vulnerable occupational groups to offshoring in the United States include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, paralegals, and technical writers. A study by the Brookings Institution projected that only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas may be offshored between 2004 and 2015, with minimal impact on employment in most areas. The analysis projected that only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas may be offshored between 2004 and 2015. Five metro areas might lose somewhat more jobs by 2015: Boulder, CO; Lowell, MA; San Francisco, CA; San Jose, CA; and Stamford, CT. Other vulnerable areas tend to be populous, located in the Northeast and West, and have high concentrations of IT jobs or IT-enabled back-office jobs. In Boulder, CO; Huntsville, AL; and Lowell, MA, IT-enabled back-office jobs like data-entry keyers and telemarketers are prevalent. Jensen and Kletzer's geographically based approach estimated that about 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was in offshorable industries. Manufacturing and professional services industries were found to be particularly vulnerable to offshoring, with over 12% and almost 14% of employment at risk, respectively. Jensen and Kletzer also ranked the vulnerability of 457 service occupations based on task content. Jensen and Kletzer examined the task content of 457 service occupations to rank their vulnerability to offshoring. They found that computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, and other occupations were highly offshorable. Their most offshorable category accounted for 27.4% of all service employment in 2005. They also noted a positive correlation between a job's offshorability and its level of educational attainment. In 2005, BLS found that service occupations with higher educational attainment were more vulnerable to offshoring. Out of 515 service occupations, 160 were estimated to be susceptible to offshoring, with over one-fifth of total employment in these occupations in 2007. The majority of offshorable occupations were in professional and technical categories, including computer and mathematical science occupations. Despite vulnerability, employment in these occupations continued to grow. In 2005, BLS identified 160 offshorable service-providing occupations, accounting for over one-fifth of total employment in 2007. Despite vulnerability, these occupations saw slightly faster employment and wage growth from 2001 to 2007. The 33 most susceptible occupations experienced below-average growth, with a wide range of skills and education levels. Blinder categorized occupations into offshorable and non-offshorable based on personal interaction requirements. Majority of U.S. occupations (533) are non offshorable, while about 200 fall in highly offshorable categories. This estimate was considered conservative due to technological advancements. Blinder categorized U.S. jobs into offshorable and non-offshorable categories based on personal interaction requirements. He believed the estimate of potentially offshorable jobs in 2004 was too conservative and expanded it to include more occupations. Blinder's aggressive estimate encompassed almost 40 million workers, contradicting the belief that offshorable occupations are low-end jobs. This challenges previous research on offshoring and skill levels. Blinder and Krueger's research on offshoring of services occupations found that about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, especially in factory and administrative support occupations, and industries like manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services. Some believe fears about services offshoring have been exaggerated. Some experts believe that only a small fraction of the potential market for offshoring global IT and business processes work has been realized. Executives need to learn how to effectively utilize offshore talent to increase productivity. As global salaries rise, the cost benefits of offshore outsourcing diminish. Deloitte Consulting predicts that outsourcing will no longer be seen as a \"holy grail\" and companies will focus on retaining core functions in-house for better control and confidentiality. Some organizations are shifting towards retaining core functions in-house to maintain control and confidentiality. This trend includes re-insourcing and reshoring activities, with companies like Dell bringing back services to the United States due to customer dissatisfaction. Other firms are also relocating IT service providers and call center operations to rural low-cost areas in the U.S. Manufacturing sector has also seen a rebound in employment partly due to reshoring efforts. Some U.S. manufacturers have brought production back from overseas in 2011 due to China's shrinking manufacturing wage and cost advantages, long delivery times, rising shipping costs, quality control issues, and intellectual property concerns. Examples include Caterpillar, National Cash Register, Wham-O, Otis Elevator, and Buck Knives. Despite some factors that could have slowed offshoring, the trend of reshoring has been on the rise. Offshore providers of IT services were able to address U.S. firms' security concerns post-9/11. U.S. airline carriers continued outsourcing maintenance jobs overseas despite concerns over regional unrest. Global software service providers expanded work placement to various countries, including Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers also moved work to nearby locations. Offshore outsourcing of IT services expanded to countries like Canada and Mexico, with some U.S. employers moving work to nearby locations to reduce cultural differences. Despite rising labor costs in some Asian nations, low wages in countries like Vietnam continue to attract U.S. jobs. Data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing is limited, with analyses focusing on job characteristics susceptible to movement abroad. The approach of analyzing job losses due to offshoring beyond U.S. borders may overstate the actual number of jobs affected, as it does not consider other factors influencing employers' decisions on work location."
