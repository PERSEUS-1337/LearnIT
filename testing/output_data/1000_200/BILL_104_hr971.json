    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Homeowners Empowerment and Protection Act of 1995\". The Congress recognizes the strong interest of 65,000,000 homeowners in the US in preserving and enhancing their property value. The value of a home is closely tied to the quality of the neighborhood and environment, including water quality, air clarity, flood risk, and scenic beauty. The value of homes in the United States can be affected by various factors such as air quality, flooding risk, scenic beauty, offensive odors, noise levels, wildlife abundance, and other environmental factors. Protecting homeowners from irresponsible actions that can harm property values is crucial for both homeowners and their communities. Current public information and participation procedures are often insufficient to provide homeowners with notice and the opportunity to participate in decision-making that can significantly affect their home values. Homeowners have the right to access information about activities that could reduce the value of their homes. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must establish uniform Federal procedures for agencies to require notice for property impacting activities within 90 days of this Act. Agencies must designate a lead agency for applications involving multiple agencies. The term \"application to conduct property impacting activity\" includes permits, licenses, approvals, contracts, and leases. The term \"conduct property impacting activity\" refers to an application for a permit or approval from an agency to carry out activities that generate pollutants or adverse impacts near private homes. Homeowners within a 1/4 mile radius must receive individual written notice, and public notice must be published in local newspapers at least 3 times. The agency must provide notice to the affected community through newspapers and mail for property impacting activities. The notice should include details about the proposed activity, potential impacts on home values, contact information for the applicant, and opportunities for public comment. Each agency must establish a toll-free number for homeowners to register concerns about potential property value impacts of proposed activities. Agencies must thoroughly investigate potential impacts on property values if requested by an applicant or affected homeowner. When authorized by an application, agencies must investigate the potential impact of proposed activities on private home values and look for alternatives to minimize adverse effects. SEC. 4. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACTION. (a) Right of Action.--A person can take legal action if their property value is reduced by $10,000 or more due to activities authorized by a permit, license, or other approval issued by an agency or pursuant to Federal law. Before filing a lawsuit, the homeowner must provide a 30-day notice of intent to sue to the defendant and the agency head. In any legal action under this section, the homeowner must prove that the defendant's activity caused a decrease in the home's value. The homeowner can request the agency to resolve the claim before pursuing litigation. The homeowner must demonstrate that the defendant's activity caused a decrease in the home's value. Similarly affected homeowners can file class actions in federal court. Homeowners can recover the reduction in home value caused by the activity, capped at the median value of nearby homes. Attorneys' fees are awarded to homeowners who receive compensation. Any homeowner receiving compensation under this section is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees. The court may also issue an injunction against activities violating federal laws. The United States district court has jurisdiction over actions brought under this section. Frivolous or improper lawsuits may result in dismissal and penalties. The court may order the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorney's fees and expenses if the plaintiff's case is frivolous or brought to harass. There is a statute of limitations of 5 years after a $10,000 reduction in home value for actions under this section. No limitation on other claims is imposed by this Act. The Act allows individuals to pursue claims under the Constitution or other laws without it being a condition for receiving compensation under the Act. The Act applies to permits, licenses, approvals issued by agencies and contracts, leases, arrangements entered into after 180 days from the enactment. The Act defines key terms such as \"agency,\" \"potential to reduce the value,\" and \"private home,\" with a focus on activities that may impact the value or enjoyment of a private residence. The term \"reduction in value\" is defined as the difference in fair market value of a home before and after certain activities. The term \"person\" includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, or other entities, excluding government agencies."
