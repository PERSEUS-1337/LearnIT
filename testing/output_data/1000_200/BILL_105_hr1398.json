It also seeks to enhance care and assistance for individuals with Parkinson's and their family caregivers. The Director of NIH will establish a program for Parkinson's disease research and training, subject to available funds. Coordination among national research institutes conducting Parkinson's research will be ensured, including holding research planning conferences every two years. The Director of NIH will award Core Center Grants to establish Morris K. Udall Research Centers for Parkinson's disease research and training. Each center funded will focus on innovative multidisciplinary research and training related to Parkinson's disease. Each center funded under this subsection must use the facilities of a single institution or consortium, meet qualifications set by the NIH Director, and conduct basic and clinical research. For Parkinson's, centers may also offer training programs for scientists and health professionals, provide information and education to health professionals, and run programs for the community. The center funded under this subsection conducts programs for the dissemination of information to the public, establishes a nationwide data system for Parkinson's patients, and sets up a Parkinson's Disease Information Clearinghouse to enhance understanding of the disease.
