    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act\". Congress finds that approximately 500 bird species in the United States migrate among countries, with many wintering in Latin America and the Caribbean. These neotropical migratory birds provide valuable benefits to the environment and economy. However, their populations are declining due to habitat loss and degradation. The conservation of neotropical migratory birds is crucial due to habitat loss and degradation across their range. International cooperation is necessary for their conservation efforts to be effective and initiatives can be improved through better coordination. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory birds, assist in their conservation through initiatives in the US, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and provide financial resources for international cooperation.
