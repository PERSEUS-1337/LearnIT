    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires preconstruction review and permits for major modifications or new sources. States with EPA-approved SIPs must approve construction or modifications to ensure compliance with NAAQS. Applicants must demonstrate no violation of NAAQS or exceedances of air pollution limits under PSD regulations. The New Source Review (NSR) process ensures compliance with air pollution regulations by requiring permits for new sources or major modifications that could increase emissions. Sources subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) to meet federally determined standards. The New Source Review (NSR) process requires permits for new sources or major modifications to ensure compliance with air pollution regulations. Sources subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) and Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) if covered by non-attainment provisions. Despite the broad coverage of NSR, few preconstruction permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants. Emissions trends for coal-fired electric utilities have been relatively steady over the last ten years. While NOx emissions have remained constant, there was a significant drop in SO2 emissions in 1995 due to the acid rain control program under the 1990 CAA Amendments. This program required power plants to reduce emissions by about 30% from baseline levels and install Low-NOx burners to reduce NOx emissions. The acid rain control program under the 1990 CAA Amendments required power plants to reduce emissions by about 30% from baseline levels and install Low-NOx burners to reduce NOx emissions. Emissions of SO2 were reduced from 10 million tons in 1990 to 5.3 million tons in 1995, and NOx emissions were reduced by 0.4 million tons in 1996. However, some of the reductions achieved were offset by increases in emissions from other plants, leading to a slippage in overall emissions reductions. While title IV resulted in a 0.4 million ton reduction in NOx by 1996, overall emissions only decreased by about 0.1 million tons. This discrepancy is due to phase 1 not covering all coal-fired facilities, indicating some sources of increasing emissions within the industry. Despite a lack of new plant construction, coal-fired electricity generation and coal consumption have continued to rise over the past decade, driven by efforts to optimize performance of existing facilities. Aging plants are being derated and shifted from baseload to cycling duties to maintain efficiency. The efficiency of aging coal-fired plants has not decreased over the past decade, leading utilities to invest more in maintenance. The question raised by EPA lawsuits is whether this maintenance constitutes a \"major modification\" under the CAA, requiring pollution control equipment installation. The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires pollution control equipment installation for \"major modifications\" to aging coal-fired plants. Utilities are hesitant to use the term \"life extension\" for spending on old plants due to CAA regulations exempting pre-1971 plants from emissions restrictions. This issue is expected to intensify with the restructuring of the electric utility industry. The Clean Air Act requires pollution control equipment installation for major modifications to aging coal-fired plants. Plants built before 1971 are exempt from emissions restrictions, but can lose their exemption if modified in a major way. Regulatory activities related to electricity generation and air quality include the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 Petitions, Regional Haze Rule, new NAAQS for Fine Particulates, NSPS for NOx for electric utilities, and NSR enforcement as a primary permitting and enforcement tool. The Department of Justice/EPA lawsuits under NSR are aimed at enforcing existing laws and regulations for stationary sources. NSR enforcement is a separate activity from regulatory development within EPA, focusing on coal-fired utilities and seeking remedial actions through court-imposed penalties and installation of the most recent BACT. The EPA can seek court-imposed penalties and installation of control devices on affected utilities that violate NSR regulations, such as installing flue-gas desulfurization units for SO2 reduction and selective catalytic reduction units for NOx reduction. These measures could lead to significant emissions reductions of SO2 and NOx from powerplants named in the lawsuits. Administrator Browner stated that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from powerplants could result in an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants, equivalent to removing 26 million cars from the road and reducing acid rain by 15 percent. The focus on NSR reflects a belief that aging coal-fired plants will continue operating under electric utility restructuring, which is a cost-effective alternative to building new capacity in a competitive generating market. According to CRS analysis, extending the life of existing coal-fired capacity is a cost-effective alternative to building new capacity. The trend towards renovating existing coal-fired capacity has been increasing for almost two decades, with potential emissions impacts recognized early on. Despite difficulties in enforcing NSR on existing facilities, the EPA is taking legal action against utilities for maintenance activities approved implicitly for nearly three decades. The EPA faced challenges in enforcing NSR on existing coal-fired facilities, primarily due to budget constraints and the definition of a major modification. The term \"modification\" was first used in the 1970 CAA Amendments, defining it as any physical or operational change leading to increased emissions. EPA's struggle with defining modification has hindered enforcement efforts. In subsequent regulations, EPA defined modification as any physical or operational change resulting in an increase in maximum hourly emission rate of controlled air pollutants. Replacement of components exceeding 50% of building costs placed plants under NSPS. NSR in 1977 shifted focus to compliance with NAAQS and PSD, defining \"significant\" emission increase in tons per year for major sources. Thresholds for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are 40 tons, subjecting facilities exceeding this to NSR. Enforcement of these thresholds has proven challenging despite apparent clarity. Enforcing thresholds for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides at 40 tons under NSR has proven challenging. EPA's NSPS program lacks practical constraints on utilities' life extension efforts, which mainly focus on improving availability and reliability rather than capacity. Life extension activities are likely to increase emissions, triggering NSR review due to a tonnage increase in pollutant output. The measurement of this change and establishing baselines have been contentious issues since the late 1980s when EPA decided to enforce NSR. In the late 1980s, EPA faced challenges in measuring changes and establishing baselines for life extension activities. The enforcement of NSR against facilities undergoing life extension efforts led to debates and litigation. EPA modified the emissions trigger for electric utilities in 1992, comparing actual emissions before and after modifications to determine NSR applicability. The EPA modified emissions triggers for electric utilities in the 1990s to determine NSR applicability based on actual and future actual emissions after modifications. Utilities responded by integrating life extension efforts into routine maintenance to avoid NSR regulations. The term \"life extension\" in utilities has been replaced with terms like capital improvement and rehabilitation program. Efforts are now integrated into routine maintenance schedules, blurring the distinction between modification and routine maintenance. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce Clean Air Act requirements for new construction of coal-fired capacity by investor-owned utilities. The EPA, on behalf of the Justice Department, is enforcing New Source Review requirements of the Clean Air Act for coal-fired capacity construction and modifications by investor-owned utilities. A Compliance Order has been issued for modifications by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The Justice Department/EPA has identified facilities violating NSR requirements and types of rehabilitations triggering the \"modification\" criterion. The Justice Department/EPA is enforcing NSR requirements for coal-fired capacity construction and modifications by investor-owned utilities. Complaints may be modified to add new allegations, seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties. TVA's compliance order requires developing a schedule for meeting requirements, auditing coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance, and installing BACT as appropriate. The industry's response to EPA's enforcement action focuses on an exemption for \"routine maintenance\" under NSR regulations. Industry argues that EPA has not objected to utilities engaging in activities now cited as NSR triggers, accusing EPA of changing the rules. Industry is accusing the EPA of changing the rules by enforcing NSR regulations on activities necessary for plant maintenance. They argue that these activities are essential for plant operation and should not trigger NSR. Emissions must not exceed the cap, but if NSR is applied to sources under the cap, pollution will be produced elsewhere. The EPA Administrator announced that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants. This would result in a reduction of 1.87 million tons of SO2 emissions and 0.63 million tons of NOx emissions. These reductions would more than compensate for any erosion in original reductions, with SO2 being reduced by 50% more than the slippage and NOx by about double the slippage. At first glance, substantial emission reductions could be achieved by EPA's NSR action. However, the CAA is complex, with reduction requirements under title IV interacting with NSR reductions. Title IV limits total SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons, enforced through tonnage limitations and emission offset requirements. The 1990 CAA Amendments program established emission caps for SO2 emissions at existing utility plants based on historical data. It created an emissions allowance system where facilities are allocated allowances to emit SO2, which can be used, traded, or banked. The program has achieved 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program. The 1990 CAA Amendments program established emission caps for SO2 at existing utility plants, achieving 100% compliance. However, it does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program. The NSR focuses on modifications and BACT installation at existing facilities, while Title IV is more concerned with reducing aggregate SO2 emissions through flexible compliance strategies. The current SO2 NSPS sets a percentage reduction requirement for emissions, varying based on the type of coal burned. The SO2 reduction requirement under Title IV can be met with low-sulfur coal, leading to excess allowances that can be sold. NSR enforcement may not result in actual reductions if allowances are sold to non-NSR covered facilities. Title IV does not adjust allowance allocations based on NSR enforcement. The law does not adjust allowance allocations based on NSR enforcement, leading to excess allowances that can be sold. Congress would need to change the law or utilities would have to voluntarily surrender excess allowances. The interaction between NSR and NOx NSPS is complex, with the NOx NSPS historically lagging in technology development. The 1979 NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities could be met with simple combustion modifications and did not require pollution control devices. In 1998, EPA introduced a new NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities, setting a standard of 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu. However, this standard was challenged in court, leading to the D.C. Court of Appeals vacating the new standard for modified utility boilers in 1999. As a result, the NSPS for modified sources reverts to the 1979 standard until a revised NSPS is proposed, creating uncertainty in determining BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources. The revised NSPS for coal-fired sources is unclear, leading to uncertainty in determining BACT or LAER for modified sources. The interaction of NSR and title IV exacerbates the confusion, with differences in NOx reduction programs. The title IV NOx program is based on emission rates, with more stringent limitations compared to the 1979 standard. The EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions from coal-fired facilities, with some already having more stringent controls than the existing NSPS. However, uncertainty remains in determining BACT or LAER for modified sources due to unclear NSPS regulations. EPA believes that some sources have been evading emissions regulations. EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions from coal-fired facilities, believing that some sources have been evading statutory requirements. The effectiveness of NSR in controlling emissions from existing sources is questioned, with more efficient methods developed since its addition to the Clean Air Act in 1977. Title IV of the CAA, enacted in 1990, has been more successful in reducing SO2 and NOx emissions from existing utility plants. Title IV of the CAA, enacted in 1990, significantly reduced SO2 and NOx emissions from existing utility plants. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV had 100% compliance and was more successful in its first year than NSR has been in 20 years. One alternative suggested is to lower the cap on SO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants to further reduce emissions. Lowering the existing cap on SO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants could achieve similar emission reductions as meeting the 1978 NSPS standards. This would require new legislation and could offer administrative and cost advantages through an allowance system. Implementing a regional cap and trade program for NOx emissions could streamline EPA initiatives and enforcement efforts, but would require new legislation or extraordinary state cooperation. EPA is pushing for this approach in various regulatory processes, including the Ozone Transport Rule and Section 126 petitions. The EPA is considering alternatives to the NSR program, such as focusing on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives. These initiatives include the OTR and Section 126 petitions, as well as the fine particulate NAAQS and regional haze rule. Unlike tightening caps on SO2 and creating an NOx cap, these initiatives do not require further legislative authority. The EPA is exploring alternatives to the NSR program by focusing on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives. This includes controlling pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants. Currently, CO2 is not considered an air pollutant under the CAA, and regulating mercury emissions has been slow. The EPA claims authority to regulate CO2, but this is controversial. Any CO2 reductions would need to come from voluntary initiatives or legislative action. Reforms to the NSR program are being considered by the EPA, including defining \"modification\" based on plant age and proposing \"off-ramps\" like the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" to simplify applicability rules. EPA's focus is on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions through regulatory initiatives, with controversy surrounding the regulation of CO2 emissions. Any near-term CO2 reductions would require voluntary efforts or legislative action. The EPA is considering reforms to the NSR program, including off-ramps like the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" to simplify applicability rules for units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology. However, the effectiveness of these alternatives is debatable as they may require legislation or finalization of regulations, which could be time-consuming and problematic. EPA is considering reforms to the NSR program, including off-ramps like the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" to simplify applicability rules for units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology. EPA is embracing cap and trade programs for many pollutants. Replacing NSR with a cap provides the same environmental protection with lower cost and greater environmental benefit. The popular debate on NSR has focused on \"grandfathered\" power plants emitting excessive pollution due to loopholes in the Clean Air Act. The term \"grandfathered powerplant\" is used in debates on emissions from existing powerplants under the Clean Air Act. Industry lobbyists argued against costly retrofits for older plants, but many are still operating without environmental controls. \"Grandfathered\" indicates if a powerplant is covered under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, which sets regulations for new sources like power plants. The 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments require the EPA to establish New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for power plants, covering pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. \"Grandfathered\" power plants are those built before NSPS regulations and are not subject to them. NSPS regulations for power plants were first issued in 1971 and revised in 1979, with further revisions in 1998 for NOx emissions. The NSPS regulations for power plants were first promulgated in 1971 and revised in 1979, with further revisions in 1998 for NOx emissions. \"Grandfathered\" sources must meet emission rate limits established by a State Implementation Plan instead of NSPS requirements. The term \"grandfathered\" is ambiguous due to the inclusion of non-criteria air pollutants like CO2 and Hg, which are not covered by the NSPS. EPA is required to review the NSPS every eight years, leading to increased stringency for covered pollutants. The ambiguity of what power plants are \"grandfathered\" arises from the lack of a set baseline. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed the regulation of existing powerplants with respect to SO2 and NOx emissions. The term \"grandfathered\" is ambiguous as there is no set baseline, making it unclear which power plants fall under this category. For example, some existing \"grandfathered\" coal-fired powerplants were required to meet more stringent NOx standards than new powerplants in 1995. Similarly, under phase 2 of Title IV, existing coal-fired powerplants had to meet stricter SO2 standards in 2000. Under phase 2 of Title IV, existing \"grandfathered\" coal-fired powerplants are required to meet SO2 standards equivalent to or more stringent than the 1971 NSPS for SO2. Age of plant is not relevant for NOx emissions, fuel source is. Coal-fired facilities, regardless of age, are the focus for increasing NOx controls. Age was considered in allocating emission credits for SO2, but compliance was based on operational status, not NSPS compliance. The NSPS for SO2 for new powerplants is effectively nil as they must offset emissions under the cap. Shrinking the current cap on SO2 is suggested for reducing emissions. A cap on NOx emissions is also proposed for electric generating facilities. EPA favors state-by-state emissions caps to address transported pollution programs in the Northeast. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional oversight, similar to the potential impact of DOJ/EPA actions on NSR. The WEPCO decision led to public debate and congressional oversight. The DOJ/EPA actions on NSR may have a similar impact. The lawsuits focus on interpreting CAA provisions regarding modifications of existing sources. Addressing NSR issues may require new legislation to update the Clean Air Act's regulation of the electric utility industry."
