    "content": "The Act titled \"Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2002\" amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section on Lifespan Respite Care. This section includes findings and purposes related to respite care services. Congress finds that millions of individuals in the United States provide care for family members with chronic illnesses or disabilities, including children living with relatives due to parental inability. Additionally, many children with disabilities are in foster care. Approximately 165,000 children with disabilities live with foster care parents in the United States. Nearly 4,000,000 individuals of all ages with mental retardation or developmental disabilities live with their families. Around 25% of the nation's elders have multiple chronic disabling conditions, requiring assistance with daily needs. Approximately 600,000 Americans die at home each year, often relying on extensive family caregiving. 42% of individuals in the U.S. needing daily living assistance are under 65, and there are insufficient resources to replace family caregivers with paid workers. Approximately 75 percent of family caregivers are women, facing emotional, physical, and financial hardships. They often struggle to find information on available respite care programs, which are insufficient to meet the growing need. Respite care services primarily target lower-income populations and elderly caregivers, leaving a significant gap in support for others in need of assistance. The purposes of this title are to encourage States to establish State and local lifespan respite care programs, improve dissemination of respite care information to family caregivers, provide respite care services, and promote innovative approaches to respite care delivery. The purpose of this section is to promote innovative approaches to respite care delivery, support research on effective respite care services, and disseminate information on respite care programs and training for family caregivers. The curr_chunk focuses on respite care delivery, family caregiver strain, worker and volunteer recruitment, and training programs for family caregivers. The curr_chunk focuses on defining key terms related to respite care delivery, family caregiver strain, worker and volunteer recruitment, and training programs for family caregivers. The curr_chunk defines the term 'condition' to include various health and developmental issues such as Alzheimer's disease, physical disabilities, chronic illness, and traumatic brain injury. The curr_chunk outlines the eligible recipients for a program, including State agencies, public entities operating statewide, nonprofit organizations operating statewide, populous political subdivisions, and recognized State respite coordinating agencies with demonstrated collaboration abilities. The curr_chunk defines a family caregiver as an unpaid individual providing in-home care for a child or adult with special needs. Lifespan respite care refers to a system of community-based services for family caregivers. The curr_chunk defines respite care as temporary relief provided to individuals with special needs when family caregivers are unable to provide care. The term 'special need' refers to the particular needs of individuals requiring care or supervision due to a condition. Respite care is temporary relief for individuals with special needs when family caregivers cannot provide care, addressing the individual's basic needs or preventing harm. Lifespan respite care grants and cooperative agreements are addressed in SEC. 2803. The section aims to expand respite care services for family caregivers, improve dissemination and coordination statewide, and enhance access and quality of services to reduce caregiver strain. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible recipients for this purpose. The Federal Lifespan Approach involves collaboration with various agencies to support family caregivers. The National Family Caregiver Support Program, in collaboration with multiple agencies, ensures coordination of respite care services for family caregivers of individuals with special needs. Eligible recipients must submit an application describing their understanding of respite care and family caregiver issues. The applicant must describe their understanding of respite care, capacity for involving family members, and collaboration with other agencies. They also need to detail the population of family caregivers targeted for respite care services. The curr_chunk focuses on assessing the population's respite care needs, existing services, coordination methods, and information dissemination. It also mentions recruitment and training programs for respite care workers and volunteers. The curr_chunk outlines the provision of respite care services, recruitment and training programs for caregivers, collaboration with other services, and coordination with public or private entities. The curr_chunk discusses the involvement of the population in planning respite care activities, maximizing the use of funds and resources, and addressing unmet needs for family caregivers in the applicant's State or locality. The curr_chunk focuses on improving the coordination and distribution of respite care services for family caregivers of individuals with special needs. It includes criteria for identifying eligible caregivers, monitoring the quality and safety of services, and ensuring respite care workers have necessary skills. The curr_chunk outlines the establishment of a review panel to evaluate applications for respite care services. The panel will meet as needed to expedite the review process. The panel will meet as necessary to review and evaluate applications for respite care services, making recommendations to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary will prioritize applicants with the greatest potential for implementing or enhancing lifespan respite care statewide when awarding grants or cooperative agreements. The Secretary will prioritize applicants with the greatest potential for implementing or enhancing lifespan respite care statewide when awarding grants or cooperative agreements. Recipients must agree to use funds for developing respite care at state and local levels, providing services to meet unmet needs, and evaluating effectiveness. The Secretary prioritizes applicants for grants to develop respite care services at state and local levels, evaluate effectiveness, and may subcontract with public or nonprofit agencies. Grants are awarded for up to 5 years and can be renewed. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other Federal resources. Funds under this section must supplement, not supplant, other Federal, State, and local funds for respite care services. The Secretary will award a grant to establish a National Resource Center on Lifespan Respite Care. The Center will maintain a national database, provide training and assistance to respite care programs, and offer information and educational programs to the public. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose."
