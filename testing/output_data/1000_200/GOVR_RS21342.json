    "content": "The diversity visa lottery encourages legal immigration from countries other than major sending countries to the US. It allocates 55,000 visas annually to countries with lower immigrant admissions in the past five years. The program was added to the Immigration Act of 1990 to promote new and varied migration. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Bureau (USCIS) allocates visas based on a formula dividing them among six geographic regions, favoring under-represented countries. Each country is limited to 7% of the visa limit, with Northern Ireland treated separately. Recipients become legal permanent residents. The diversity lottery, established in 1990, has a 55,000 annual ceiling, which can be temporarily reduced by NACARA. In 1990, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) temporarily reduces the annual diversity visa ceiling to 50,000 to accommodate certain unsuccessful asylum seekers. In FY2002, 42,829 persons were admitted or adjusted as LPRs with diversity visas, representing 4% of all LPRs. Top countries in FY2002 were Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine. In FY2002, immigrants from Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine comprised 3.9% of all LPRs. These countries consistently ranked among the top diversity visa sending countries along with Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Morocco, Romania, and Russia. Albania and Nigeria were the top sending countries, with Russia and Ukraine possibly understated due to reporting issues. Visa Sending Countries, FY1997-FY2002: European immigrants comprised 39.4% of diversity visa recipients, while African immigrants received 38.1%. Family-based and employment-based immigration was dominated by Caribbean, Latin American, and Asian immigrants, making up smaller percentages of diversity visa recipients. To be eligible for a diversity visa, an alien must have a high school education or two years of relevant work experience. The Diversity Visa program requires applicants to have a high school education or two years of relevant work experience. Winners undergo reviews by Department of State consular officers and DHS inspectors to ensure they meet eligibility criteria for entry into the U.S. Exclusion criteria include health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, illegal entry, and immigration law violations. The FY2005 Diversity Visa lottery required electronic applications from eligible individuals to encourage immigration from regions with lower rates. Ineligible countries included Canada, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Russia. For FY2005 Diversity Visa lottery, ineligible countries included Canada, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Petitioners had to follow State Department instructions precisely to avoid disqualification. Over 2 million applications were disqualified in FY2003 for not complying with instructions. Husbands and wives could submit separate entries, with spouses and unmarried children under 21 qualifying as derivative beneficiaries. Children under 21 qualify as derivative beneficiaries of successful applicants in the FY2005 Diversity Visa lottery. Derivative beneficiaries must be listed on the initial petition and their visas count against the 50,000 cap. If a winner dies before obtaining LPR status, the visa is revoked and derivative beneficiaries lose their entitlement. Winners were selected randomly by computer, with notifications expected between May and July 2004. Winning the lottery does not guarantee a visa due to more applications than available visas. Winners of the FY2005 Diversity Visa lottery must act quickly to file necessary documentation by September 30, 2005. In-person interviews are set to begin in October 2004. Some question the continuation of the lottery, suggesting the visas be used for backlog reduction. Supporters argue the diversity visa brings in new immigrants from various countries. Supporters of the diversity visa argue that it brings in new immigrants from various countries, providing a balance to the immigration system dominated by a few nations. Critics suggest amending the INA to exclude nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries from the lottery due to background check challenges and terrorism concerns. The debate also includes discussions on the costs of operating the lottery and the uniform application of visa policies. The diversity visa lottery has sparked debates on costs and uniform application. Some suggest charging a fee to enter the lottery to address fraud concerns. The State Department is working to address criticisms of fraud and misuse."
