    "content": "CloudLSTM is a new type of recurrent neural model designed for forecasting data streams from geospatial point-cloud sources. It utilizes a Dynamic Point-cloud Convolution (D-Conv) operator to extract local spatial features from neighboring points, maintaining permutation invariance and capturing neighboring correlations. This operator can be integrated into traditional LSTM architectures with sequence-to-sequence learning and attention mechanisms. CloudLSTM is applied to point-cloud stream forecasting for mobile service traffic and air quality indicator prediction. Results show accurate long-term predictions, outperforming other neural network models. Data sources include mobile network antennas and sensors monitoring air quality. Unlike traditional spatiotemporal forecasting, this method focuses on predicting future values and locations of data streams. Point-cloud stream forecasting requires models that can handle geometrically scattered sets of points with complex spatial correlations. Vanilla LSTMs have limited spatial feature abilities, while ConvLSTM and PredRNN++ are not suitable for scattered point-cloud data. Different approaches are needed for geospatial data stream forecasting, such as predicting over grid-structured data or mapping point clouds. Different approaches to geospatial data stream forecasting involve predicting over grid-structured data or mapping point clouds. The proposed PointCNN leverages spatial-local correlations of point clouds, regardless of input order, to enable forecasting directly over point-cloud data streams. These architectures can learn spatial features but have limited ability to discover temporal dependencies. The proposed CloudLSTM architecture aims to enable precise forecasting over point-cloud streams by introducing the DConv operator. Each point in the point-cloud contains value features and coordinates, allowing for the creation of different channels for measurements at each time step. An ideal point-cloud stream forecasting model should have five key properties: order invariance, information intactness, interaction among points, U different channels of S, and L-dimensional coordinates. The Dynamic Point Cloud Convolution (DConv) operator is introduced as the core module of the CloudLSTM model, satisfying key properties such as interaction among points, robustness to transformations, and location variance. DConv generalizes convolution on grids by computing weighted summations over point-clouds instead of small receptive fields for each anchor point. The DConv operator generalizes convolution on grids by computing weighted summations over point-clouds instead of small receptive fields for each anchor point. It takes U in channels of a point-cloud S as input and outputs U out channels of a point-cloud with the same number of elements to preserve information intactness. The DConv operator extends convolution to point-clouds by computing weighted summations over points instead of receptive fields for each anchor point. Q K n is a subset of points in S i, including the K nearest points to p n. Each point p n in S contains H value features and L coordinate features. DConv sums element-wise products over features and points in Q K n to obtain values and coordinates of a point in S j. Learnable weights W are shared across anchor points. The learnable weights W are shared across anchor points in the input map, with scalar weights for input and output channels. Bias terms are defined for each output map. The sigmoid function limits predicted coordinates to (0, 1) to avoid outliers. Raw point-cloud coordinates are normalized to (0, 1) before feeding them to the model. The spatial correlations in point-cloud datasets vary between different measurements due to human mobility. For example, mobile traffic channels represent traffic consumption of different apps, while air quality channels represent different air quality indicators. This variation is reflected in data consumption patterns and is affected by factors such as vehicle movement and factory working times. The CloudLSTM model allows each channel to find the best neighbor set for spatial correlations in point-cloud datasets. The DConv operator weights its K nearest neighbors across all features to produce values and coordinates in the next layer, regardless of input order. This helps improve forecasting performance and is performed on every point in the dataset. The DConv operator in the CloudLSTM model ensures that the output is independent of input order, maintains the same number of features and points, captures local dependencies, and improves robustness to global transformations. Normalization over coordinate features further enhances robustness. DConv also learns the layout and topology of the point cloud for dynamic positioning in the next layer. The DConv operator in the CloudLSTM model enables dynamic positioning tailored to each channel and time step by changing the neighboring set for each point. It is essential for spatiotemporal forecasting neural models as spatial correlations evolve over time. DConv can be efficiently implemented using 2D convolution and builds upon PointCNN and Deformable Convolution, introducing variations for pointcloud structural data. The DConv operator in the CloudLSTM model allows dynamic positioning for each channel and time step by adjusting the neighboring set for each point. It builds upon PointCNN and Deformable Convolution, introducing variations for pointcloud structural data. The DConv operator ensures order invariance without extra complexity or information loss by aligning the weight of distance rankings between points. The DConv operator in CloudLSTM enables dynamic positioning by adjusting neighboring sets for each point, ensuring order invariance without added complexity. It can be integrated into LSTMs for spatial and temporal correlation learning over point-clouds.

It combines Seq2seq learning and soft attention mechanism for forecasting, proven effective in spatiotemporal modeling. The architecture includes an encoder and decoder for the overall Seq2seq CloudLSTM. The Seq2seq CloudLSTM architecture incorporates an encoder and decoder with CloudLSTMs, utilizing a soft attention mechanism for forecasting. Point Cloud Convolutional layers process the data before feeding it to the model, similar to word embedding in NLP tasks. The model employs a two-stack encoder-decoder architecture with 36 channels for each CloudLSTM cell. In this study, a two-stack encoder-decoder architecture with 36 channels for each CloudLSTM cell is employed. Additionally, new architectures like Convolutional Point-cloud RNN (CloudRNN) and Convolutional Point-cloud GRU (CloudGRU) are explored. These architectures are compared in terms of performance using measurement datasets of traffic and air quality indicators.

The models are implemented using TensorFlow and TensorLayer, trained on a computing cluster with NVIDIA GPUs, and optimized using the Adam optimizer. Experimental results are reported after discussing the datasets and baseline models used.

DConv is combined with RNN models and attention mechanisms efficiently. The DConv operation involves finding nearest neighbors and performing weighting computations. The complexity of DConv is analyzed by breaking it down into two steps: finding neighboring sets for each point and performing weighting computations. The complexity of each step is discussed separately, assuming input and output channels are both 1. The overall complexity is similar to that of a vanilla convolution operator. The DConv introduces extra complexity by searching for the K nearest neighbors for each point, but this complexity does not increase much even with higher dimensional point clouds. Normalizing the coordinates features enables transformation invariance with shifting and scaling, making the model invariant to these transformations.

Our CloudLSTM outperforms MLPs and LSTMs in forecasting accuracy on the air quality dataset, showing superior performance by extracting local spatial dependencies through DConv kernels and merging global spatial dependency via stacks of time steps and layers. The number of neighbors K affects the model's receptive field, with small K relying on limited local spatial dependencies and large K looking around larger location spaces. The results suggest that K does not significantly affect baseline performance, while our CloudLSTM excels in capturing both local and global spatial correlations. The text discusses how global spatial dependency is crucial for forecasting accuracy in mobile traffic series. It highlights the challenge of handling long sequences in RNN-based models and proposes a method to efficiently capture seasonal information by concatenating different time intervals. This approach aims to reduce the input size and make forecasting models more practical for real-world deployment. Incorporating seasonal information boosts forecasting performance in mobile traffic dataset. Periodic information is learned by the model, reducing prediction errors. However, concatenation increases input length and model complexity. Future work aims to fuse seasonal information more efficiently with minimal complexity increase."
