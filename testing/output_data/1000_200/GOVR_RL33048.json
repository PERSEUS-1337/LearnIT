    "content": "The federal government has a strong interest in regulating hazardous chemicals security to prevent terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001. Congress focuses on the security of hazardous chemicals in commercial facilities, transportation by rail, tanker trucks, and near populated areas. Congressional attention is now shifting towards federal policies related to marine transportation. Congress is reviewing federal policies related to marine transportation of hazardous chemical cargo, with a focus on increasing penalties for criminal or terrorist activities around ports and marine vessels. Efforts are being made to enhance general port security, including ports in foreign countries, in response to the overall security environment. The report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, discussing the risks and efforts to secure them in the homeland security context. The report focuses on hazardous chemical marine shipments in U.S. waters, including shipment volumes and port locations. It discusses security policy issues associated with these shipments, such as risk uncertainties and security resources. The report addresses marine shipments of acutely hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose a catastrophic hazard to the public. The report focuses on hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose a catastrophic hazard to the general public during marine transport. It does not cover other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. The report does not provide detailed statistics due to legal limitations on proprietary shipping data. Hazardous chemical cargoes are potential terrorist targets due to their toxicity and combustibility. Hazardous chemical marine vessels are potential terrorist targets due to their toxicity and combustibility, posing a serious threat to human life and infrastructure if intentionally released near populated areas. Protecting these shipments is crucial for U.S. homeland security, although no marine vessel carrying hazardous chemicals has been used in a terrorist attack on civilians. Marine accidents involving such shipments have shown their potential to impact nearby communities. Major accidents involving hazardous chemical shipping are rare but have resulted in some of the deadliest industrial accidents in history. For example, the explosion of the Mont-Blanc in 1917 killed over 1,900 people in Halifax, and the 1947 explosion in Texas City killed nearly 600 people. Foreign terrorists have attacked marine vessels overseas, and intelligence suggests they may target hazardous chemical shipments in the U.S. Marine accidents involving these shipments have the potential to impact nearby communities. The 1947 explosion of two cargo ships in Texas City killed nearly 600 people and injured 3,500. Since then, there have been serious incidents involving chemical marine shipments, but none as destructive as Texas City. These incidents include fires and accidents in Somalia, Spain, and Scotland, which did not result in serious casualties among neighboring communities. In the late 1990s, there were attempts by international combatants and domestic terrorists to release chemicals from land-based manufacturing and storage facilities. These incidents occurred in foreign war zones like Croatia and involved attacks on various plants producing hazardous chemicals. In the United States, there were also instances where criminals tried to release chemicals from similar facilities. In the late 1990s, there were attempts to release chemicals from land-based facilities in the US and other countries. Terrorists targeted marine vessels, including a foiled Al-Qaeda plot in 2002 and an oil tanker attack off the Yemeni coast. Concerns have been raised about terrorist groups commandeering hazardous chemical vessels. The Department of Homeland Security is concerned about the security of chemicals infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security in the United States is concerned about the security of chemical tanker ships, including the risks associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments. LNG tankers have been identified as potential terrorist targets, with the DHS acknowledging that the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. The DHS has identified LNG tankers as potential terrorist targets due to the risks associated with LNG shipments. The Sandia report highlighted various vulnerabilities of LNG tankers to terrorist attacks, including ramming, explosives, hijacking, and external actions like missile or airplane attacks. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 focuses on preventing terrorist attacks that could result in catastrophic health effects or mass casualties. Hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels poses catastrophic hazards to the public, including poisoning, asphyxiation, chemical burns, and thermal burns. Federal standards from DOT, Coast Guard, and EPA regulate transportation of hazardous materials to prevent unreasonable risks to health and safety. The DOT has the authority to designate hazardous materials that may pose risks during transportation. Hazardous materials are classified in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, including toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable materials. The DOT ranks materials by type of hazard but not by relative degree of hazard. Shippers of highly hazardous cargo must develop security plans as per 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.8. The DOT requires shippers of \"highly hazardous\" cargo to develop security plans for specific types of materials, including radioactive material, explosives, poisonous inhalation materials, bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, packaged hazardous material, CDC regulated agents, and materials requiring placarding. The Coast Guard enforces safety and security regulations for marine vessels. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels carrying certain dangerous cargoes, as defined in various sections of the federal code. Special requirements are prescribed for vessels carrying bulk solid, liquid, liquefied gas, or compressed gas hazardous materials. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels carrying dangerous cargoes, including bulk liquid hazardous materials, liquified gas, and compressed gas. Regulations also cover incompatible chemicals on parcel tankers or container ships. Hazardous marine cargoes are identified through regulation of waterfront facilities. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to require facilities with specified quantities of hazardous substances to file risk management plans (RMPs). These plans detail the potential threat from large releases, include off-site consequence analysis, and outline prevention and mitigation measures. The EPA designates hazardous substances based on criteria like potential health effects and likelihood of accidental releases. The EPA promulgated a list of hazardous substances based on potential health effects, likelihood of accidental releases, and human exposure. The list includes acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile flammable liquids. High explosive substances were removed from the list in 1998, and flammable substances used as fuel were excluded in 2000. The majority of hazardous materials on DOT lists do not pose a catastrophic health hazard to the general public due to limited quantities or physical properties. The EPA list of hazardous substances focuses on chemicals with the greatest potential consequences to the general public, including those considered most hazardous on land. These chemicals are used as the basis for marine cargo hazard analysis, with many of them also found on DOT and Coast Guard hazardous materials lists. The findings in this report should be applicable to the DOT or Coast Guard lists as well. The EPA/RMP chemicals are cross-referenced to the DOT categories in Appendix 2. Two notable classes of hazardous material identified by DOT not on the EPA/RMP list are radioactive materials and explosives. Army Corps of Engineers marine commerce statistics for 2003 show that explosives and radioactive materials would account for less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo if added to the EPA/RMP list. Excluding these two classes is unlikely to affect the policy conclusions in this report. The EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable. The degree of toxicity or flammability of specific chemicals within the EPA/RMP list varies with their chemical properties. Ammonia is a toxic, potentially explosive gas used in various industries, including fertilizer manufacturing. It can quickly reach harmful concentrations in the air, causing skin and respiratory irritation. Methane, on the other hand, is not inherently toxic but can cause asphyxiation in high vapor concentrations. Methane is highly flammable and may cause asphyxiation in high vapor concentrations. Cryogenic methane can freeze body parts upon contact. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in manufacturing various industrial products, with human exposure leading to irritation of eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. It is also a fire hazard and reacts explosively with certain substances. An uncontrolled release of these chemicals could have varying effects on exposed individuals. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals hazardous to the public when above threshold quantities, warranting special regulatory treatment. The list was developed for land facilities, but all hazardous cargoes are seen as potential terrorist targets. Chemical properties determine health hazards associated with chlorine, ammonia, oxidants, and acids. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous chemicals was developed for facilities on land, but their health hazards may differ if released over water. Chemicals can dissolve, sink, or evaporate in water, affecting the hazard they pose in a marine incident. Further research is needed to understand the differences in land and water release characteristics of EPA/RMP chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) maintains statistics of marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate the marine shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. Over 48 million tons of these chemicals passed through U.S. waters in 2003, accounting for 2% of total U.S. waterborne cargo tonnage. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific EPA/RMP chemicals. In 2003, hazardous chemicals accounted for 2% of total U.S. waterborne cargo tonnage. The EPA/RMP list includes materials hazardous to human health, with the overall volume of a hazardous material in a marine shipment being an important consideration for potential public impacts of a terrorist attack. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways. The total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment are summarized in Figure 1. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations, leading to varying tonnages aboard a vessel at any time. The data in Figure 1 are plotted on a logarithmic scale for clarity. The EPA regulations specify minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds for hazardous chemicals. The average waterborne shipment volume generally exceeds the 20,000 pound threshold, requiring an off-site risk management plan. Each category of chemicals was typically shipped in significant volumes. In 2003, hazardous marine cargo was mainly shipped in tankers or self-propelled liquid chemical barges, with distinct construction and operating characteristics. The vessels transporting hazardous cargo determine the vulnerability to accidents or attacks. The EPA's rules specify minimum threshold quantities for risk planning for hazardous chemicals. Figure 2 illustrates that in 2003, the majority of EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo was transported in tankers or self-propelled liquid chemical barges, with liquefied gas tankers carrying various types of liquefied gas cargoes. These cargoes include butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, propylene, ethylene, vinyl chloride, methyl chloride, ammonia, and propylene oxide. Liquefied gas tankers carry various chemicals listed on the EPA/RMP list, with tanks designed to withstand high pressures and low temperatures. These vessels have double hulls for added structural integrity, making them highly resistant to grounding and impact damage. LNG tankers have high structural integrity, making them resistant to damage. They carry only LNG, unlike other liquefied gas tankers that may carry multiple cargoes. Liquefied gas carriers vary in capacity, with LNG tankers ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They can carry 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks and have a total cargo capacity ranging from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. Most chemical parcel tankers are well under 50,000 tons in capacity. Chemical parcel tankers, like gas carriers, adhere to international construction standards with cargo tanks lined with specialized coatings for compatibility with various chemicals. They have double bottoms to prevent contact between incompatible cargoes and can carry multiple hazardous chemicals simultaneously. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed for bulk liquid transport. Liquid chemical barges are vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals in coastal regions and inland waterways. They have multiple separate cargo tanks lined with special coatings and range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones may rely on tugboats for movement. Unpowered chemical barges on inland waterways are approximately 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long, traveling in groups of two to eight barges per towboat. Inland barges can be up to 300 feet long and travel in groups of two to eight per towboat. They may carry refrigerated chemical products in insulated cargo tanks. Hazardous chemicals can also be transported on conventional container ships using various cargo consignments. Hazardous chemicals are transported on container ships in various ways, including tankcontainers and drums. Large quantities of these chemicals can be present on modern container ships. The Jolly Rubino, for example, carried multiple hazardous chemicals when it caught fire in 2002. These chemicals must be shipped in designated cargo areas on vessels like container ships, general cargo ships, and ferries. The public hazards associated with these chemicals are proportional to the volume being transported. The hazards of transporting hazardous chemicals on marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks are proportional to the volume of chemicals being transported. Rail tank cars can carry up to 50 to 90 tons, while containerized tanks on flatbed railcars can carry up to 70 tons per tank. Highway tanker trucks also transport hazardous cargoes simultaneously. Rail tank cars can carry up to 70 tons per tank, while highway tanker trucks have a cargo capacity ranging from 15 to 30 tons. Marine cargo tank capacity exceeds that of rail or highway tankers by one or more orders of magnitude. Multiple tanks are usually found on liquefied gas tankers, chemical parcel tankers, and liquid cargo barges. Marine tankers often carry larger volumes of hazardous materials compared to rail or highway tankers. The EPA maintains a database of chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans. Section 112(r) of the act requires facilities to report chemical quantities on hand and in processes. These filings help estimate maximum and average quantities of EPA/RMP chemicals. CRS compared marine shipping volumes to land storage volumes for nine chemicals, showing high, medium, and low volume shipments. The comparison of marine shipping volumes to land storage volumes for nine EPA/RMP chemicals showed that higher volume chemicals were generally shipped in larger vessels. Marine shipments of hazardous chemicals either originate or terminate in U.S. ports. Port facilities in the U.S. serve as transportation hubs for hazardous cargo, with some facilities also producing hazardous chemicals. Total marine shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals vary significantly from port to port, as do shipments of specific chemicals. Security hazards at ports may be related to both the volume and type of cargo being transported. The concentration of EPA/RMP hazardous marine shipments varies across U.S. ports, with the top 30 ports handling 95% of the hazardous cargo tonnage in 2003. Additional hazardous cargoes not listed may also be shipped in large volumes through a given port. In 2003, the top 30 ports in the US handled 95% of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo tonnage, with additional hazardous cargoes also being shipped in large volumes through each port. The distribution of hazardous chemicals varies across ports, with over half of the top 30 ports located in the Gulf of Mexico states. An attack on a single hazardous cargo vessel could have serious public consequences, regardless of other shipments through a port. In 2003, the top 30 ports in the US handled 95% of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo tonnage, with hazardous chemicals varying across ports. The Gulf of Mexico states have over half of these ports, with LPG and ammonia being the most frequently shipped hazardous cargoes. The list of top 30 ports is derived from estimates of EPA/RMP. The top 30 ports in the US handled EPA/RMP hazardous cargo in 2003, with key factors affecting terrorism risk in ports including DOT hazardous cargo shipments, marine passenger traffic, and proximity to populations. The Department of Homeland Security considers these factors in its Port Security Grant Program. The DHS Port Security Grant Program provides security enhancement grants to U.S. ports, with the Coast Guard overseeing maritime security and tracking commercial ships. The program identifies 66 ports eligible for grants, with 24 of the top 30 hazardous material ports included. The Coast Guard has a special focus on ships carrying hazardous cargo to protect life, property, and the marine environment. The Coast Guard has a history of special concern for ships and barges carrying hazardous cargo, with safety regulations in place to mitigate damage from accidents or terrorist attacks. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded its maritime security regulations to address terrorism more specifically. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has enhanced its maritime security regulations to differentiate between safety measures and security measures to prevent sabotage or subversive acts. Area maritime security committees, led by local captains of the port, assess port vulnerabilities and create plans to address them, evaluating the susceptibility of marine targets to terrorist activities. Plans also detail the deployment of federal, state, and local resources to prevent terrorist attacks on vessels and facilities under Coast Guard jurisdiction. The Coast Guard conducts vulnerability assessments on key marine assets and port infrastructure to enhance security measures. They have developed maritime security standards under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and played a leading role in creating the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) to ensure safe operations of ships and ports worldwide. The ISPS Code requires ships and port facilities worldwide to have approved security plans with operational and physical security measures for different threat levels. Security officers must ensure implementation, deploy necessary equipment, monitor access, and maintain security communications. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels by July 1, 2004, conducting on-site inspections six months later to verify implementation. The Coast Guard has completed security assessments of strategic ports and evaluated vulnerabilities of hazardous chemicals vessels to prevent terrorist attacks. Special assessments are being conducted on marine tankers and inland barges carrying dangerous cargoes to analyze potential blast consequences. The Coast Guard assesses inland barges carrying hazardous chemicals to evaluate vulnerabilities and potential blast consequences. Vessels must report information four days before arrival, and the Coast Guard determines security risks and may board vessels to ensure secure transit. Coast Guard patrol boats may escort ships carrying hazardous cargo in harbor transit and while moored at terminals. Coast Guard patrol boats enforce security zones around vessels in harbors and at terminals. Vessels carrying hazardous cargo may need to provide their own patrols. Non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat areas. The Coast Guard aims to distinguish suspicious activity through \"maritime domain awareness.\" Vessels calling at U.S. ports must have AIS transponders for tracking. The Coast Guard requires vessels at U.S. ports to have AIS transponders for tracking. They are also developing Joint Harbor Operations Centers (JHOCs) to monitor vessel traffic using various equipment and coordinate responses to threats. The Coast Guard is enhancing security measures by working with other agencies, enlisting the public for reporting suspicious activity, and developing secure credentials for workers. NOAA also provides emergency response capabilities for the Coast Guard. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides hazardous material emergency response capabilities for the Coast Guard and other agencies. This includes the CAMEO program with chemical dispersion software models and air dispersion models to support emergency planners and first responders. NOAA partnered with the Coast Guard and the Office of Naval Intelligence in conducting risk assessments on hazardous chemicals. NOAA, along with the Coast Guard and Office of Naval Intelligence, conducted risk assessments on 50 hazardous chemicals stored or shipped through U.S. ports. Additionally, NOAA and DHS coordinate federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. Industry groups and the Coast Guard receive input from the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee to promote the security of hazardous marine cargo. CTAC is an advisory group composed of members from various sectors related to marine transportation of hazardous materials. In 2002, CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. The American Waterways Operators developed a model vessel security plan in collaboration with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The plan includes a list of high consequence cargoes. The Chemical Distribution Institute, funded by the chemical industry, serves as an industry organization. The Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. The American Chemistry Council has also issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy, with maritime security of chemical cargo being included in this priority. Several policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo may warrant attention despite new maritime security measures put in place since 9/11. Several policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo may warrant further Congressional attention, including risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness. Terrorism risk is defined as the product of threat, vulnerability, and consequence, with significant uncertainties existing across all three factors. The potential threat posed by terrorists targeting ships in U.S. waters has been debated since 9/11, with some experts believing public concern about specific threats to hazardous chemical shipping is overstated. Some believe public concern about terrorist threats to hazardous chemicals shipping is overstated, while others assert terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipping. The uncertainty of threat intelligence and shifting goals of attackers make conclusions questionable. Vulnerability and consequence analysis of marine chemical hazards also face uncertainties. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels under MTSA and ISPS codes. NOAA has established security plans for thousands of vessels. Some analysts suggest that the potential vulnerabilities and consequences of a terrorist attack on hazardous marine cargo vessels are not well understood. Recent public controversy surrounding terrorist risks to LNG shipping has been driven by conflicting studies from various government and private sector groups. The security sensitivity of these assessments and plans complicates evaluation efforts, as little public information is available on the physical vulnerabilities of marine vessels to terrorist attacks. The physical vulnerabilities of different types of marine vessels to terrorist attacks with weapons or improvised explosives are not well understood. Little public information is available on intentional release of hazardous chemicals, which may have different characteristics. Vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans are crucial for U.S. maritime security strategy, but their effectiveness for hazardous chemicals carriers may be limited without a full understanding of vulnerability and consequence. Federal officials may struggle to determine the precise risk of terror attacks on hazardous marine cargoes. Federal officials may struggle to determine the risk of terror attacks on hazardous marine cargoes, but reducing uncertainty can help prioritize maritime security activities. The Coast Guard can focus on port security by receiving timely intelligence from federal agencies. Security experts can analyze vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences using standard models and methodologies. A federal role is important for methodological consistency across chemicals, vessel types, and locations. The federal role in hazardous marine cargo security analysis is crucial for methodological consistency across chemicals, vessel types, and locations. Concerns about costs and potential diversion of resources from other Coast Guard activities have been raised by policymakers. Coast Guard officials acknowledge that resources dedicated to securing marine shipments of hazardous cargo could be used for other missions such as boating safety, search and rescue, and drug interdiction. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security. Hazardous marine cargo security is funded from the general maritime security budget, with an additional $11 million sought for FY2006. This funding will be used for new response boats, crew, security zones enforcement, and vessel escort. The budget for the Coast Guard in FY2006 includes funding for increased operational presence, security enforcement, and vessel monitoring. State and local agencies are seeking more funding to offset hazardous marine cargo security costs, particularly for LNG tankers. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover additional maritime security costs. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators pay for additional maritime security costs, but some government officials are concerned about the ambiguity of security cost accounting and funding sources. Some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, arguing that their taxes should cover it, while others are willing to pay for \"excess\" security beyond what is typically covered by taxes. The security costs associated with LNG shipments may not be indicative of the costs to secure other hazardous marine cargo. New security technology and threat intelligence may help lower costs in the future. Public agencies may need to review cost-sharing mechanisms for securing hazardous marine cargo from terrorist attacks. The effectiveness of Coast Guard security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping is still an open issue, with questions about resource deployment and adequacy of measures. Some question the efficiency of Coast Guard security resources and measures in evaluating maritime security activities. The lack of performance measures hinders progress in making seaports more secure, especially in addressing terrorism risks associated with hazardous cargo. Coast Guard security activities address terrorism risks within ports based on quantitative risk analysis. Some question if security for hazardous chemical vessels reflects their relative risk due to uncertainties and resource demands. Port captains have discretion in deploying security resources, leading to varying levels of protection for similar chemical shipments. Some observers question the varying levels of protection for chemical shipments in different ports, which could lead to inadequate security in some areas. Congress may assess the effectiveness of Coast Guard's hazardous marine cargo activities in the context of maritime security responsibilities. Concerns also exist about emergency response to marine chemical attacks, with potential casualties outlined in national planning scenarios. Cargo ships face the risk of terrorist attacks with potential for high casualties and overwhelming emergency response agencies. Specialized medical treatment and salvage operations may be required due to the hazardous chemicals involved. Emergency and medical authorities near affected waterways should develop specific measures to address chemical releases. Emergency and medical authorities near potentially affected waterways should develop specific measures to deal with chemical cargo releases. Funding and expertise from federal or private sectors can support communities with insufficient capabilities. The DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program are potential sources of funding for emergency response plans. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 may serve as a legislative model for planning coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous materials pose a significant risk. The report highlights the risks associated with marine shipments of hazardous chemicals, emphasizing their attractiveness as terrorist targets due to their proximity to populated areas. Government and industry efforts to enhance maritime security, including the Coast Guard's authority under the MTSA, have been implemented to mitigate these risks. The Coast Guard has authority over maritime security of hazardous chemical cargo under the MTSA. Congress may question terrorism risk uncertainty and evaluate resources for security measures. Evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards is important. Bulk quantities of hazardous chemicals are present in marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities on land. Balancing resources for chemicals security across these sectors is a policy challenge due to different homeland security authorities and regulations. Limited vulnerability and consequence information, especially for marine transportation, adds to the complexity. Limited vulnerability and consequence information for marine transportation complicates comparing terrorism risks across sectors. This lack of comprehensive perspective on hazardous chemical risks makes it challenging for security analysts to prioritize assets for protection and allocate security resources effectively. Balancing safety and security measures in marine transportation could potentially reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs are compromised. Congress may face oversight challenges in aligning security priorities and activities to achieve common goals. The Army Corps of Engineers collects detailed marine commerce statistics through its Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center for planning and managing projects. Separate databases track domestic and foreign vessel trips and tonnages, including various vessel types. The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics including vessel types, tonnage, and trips. Vessel operators report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE. The ACE databases may be used for chemical-specific analysis with limitations. ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics for CRS analysis. The ACE databases provide estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics for CRS analysis, using two sets of standardized commodity codes. However, inconsistencies may arise in identifying hazardous chemicals due to differences in code definitions. The ACE databases provide EPA/RMP cargo statistics for analysis, but inconsistencies in code definitions may lead to errors in identifying hazardous chemicals. CRS attempts to correct these inconsistencies by comparing WCSC and UN codes and consulting with classification experts. For example, LNG and LPG are classified under the same code in the WCSC system, but CRS was able to separate their volumes using trade data from the Department of Energy. However, shipment estimates for other chemicals may include volumes of chemicals not on the EPA/RMP list, or shipments of certain chemicals may be included in totals for similar chemicals. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations during a single shipment, and while ACE data report movements at each point, they cannot provide total tonnage. The ACE waterborne commerce databases contain millions of records with potential data quality errors, despite rigorous internal review processes. CRS identified inconsistencies in ACE estimates, which were corrected, but additional errors may exist. The databases provide detailed commercial information about private companies. The ACE waterborne commerce databases contain detailed commercial information about private companies, with data quality errors that have escaped notice. The report provides summary estimates of chemicals shipping data without associating it with specific vessels or operating companies. ACE data on individual shipments, vessels, or operators is considered privileged information not for public release."
