Congress finds the United States needs a robust scientific and technical enterprise, more scientists and engineers, improved education in science and mathematics, and a renewed commitment to research and development. The United States needs to recommit to leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, with a focus on advancements like nanotechnology. A loan forgiveness program can attract students to careers in these fields, helping to maintain technological leadership. Establishment of program for loan forgiveness to attract students to careers in science, mathematics, and engineering fields. The Secretary will implement a program to cover interest on loans for undergraduate students who apply and meet certain criteria under the Higher Education Act of 1965.
