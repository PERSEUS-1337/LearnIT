The Congress acknowledges the increasing accessibility of the Arctic Ocean to shipping due to technological advancements and growing demand for Arctic tourism and resources. It is important for the United States to collaborate with Alaska and Arctic neighbors to ensure safe and environmentally protective shipping practices in the region. The United States aims to protect the Arctic environment and ensure secure shipping in the region, respecting sovereign rights and promoting international cooperation for reliable shipping practices. The United States aims to protect the Arctic environment and ensure secure shipping in the region through international cooperation and coordinated shipping regulations to address risks posed by expanded shipping. The United States has proven models for international cooperation in managing regional waterways, such as joint administration of the St. Lawrence Seaway with Canada and cooperation with Russia for fisheries enforcement in the Bering Sea. The country has research, security, environmental, and commercial interests in the Arctic that rely on icebreaker platforms, which need replacement. Sovereign interests in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea regions may increase with a United States claim for an extended continental shelf. The United States may need to expand its maritime presence in the Arctic and Bering Sea regions by submitting a claim for an extended continental shelf. This would involve building new icebreakers, coordinating international plans for navigation aids, and establishing shipping regulations and oil spill prevention measures through international cooperation. Initiating these efforts now, following the completion of an Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment by the Arctic Council, is crucial to safeguard U.S. interests in the region. The Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation is outlined in Section 3. The purpose of this section is to ensure safe and secure maritime shipping in the Arctic, including aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and maritime search and rescue. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates is encouraged to enter into agreements through the International Maritime Organization to promote coordinated action among Arctic nations for placement and maintenance of aids to navigation, marine safety, oil spill prevention, and maritime domain awareness. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System coordinates domestic transportation policies in the Arctic for safe maritime shipping. The Secretary of the department may enter agreements to carry out the purpose of this section. The Secretary of Transportation may enter agreements to promote safe maritime navigation through icebreaking and conduct demonstration projects to reduce emissions and train mariners for Arctic operations. Authorization of Appropriations for Arctic operations and ice navigation, including prevention of discharges. $5,000,000 for seasonal operations in the Arctic and $10,000,000 for agreements under subsection (d) for fiscal years 2011-2015. $5,000,000 for demonstration projects under subsection (f) for fiscal years 2011-2015. Analyses on icebreakers to be completed within 90 days of enactment of the Act. The Commandant of the Coast Guard is required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of extending the service life of existing icebreakers, building new icebreakers, or a combination of both within 90 days of the completion of the High Latitude Study. The Coast Guard must analyze the impact on mission capacity and presence in the Arctic if icebreaker fleet recapitalization is not fully funded by constructing new icebreakers or extending the service life of existing ones. This analysis must be reported to Congress within 90 days of the completion of the High Latitude Study. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit a report with study results and recommendations to Congress within one year of the enactment of the Act or the completion of the High Latitude Study. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit reports with analysis results and recommendations to Congress, as required by law, within a specified timeframe. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL COAST GUARD PRESENCE IN HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS. Within 270 days of enactment, the Secretary of the department overseeing the Coast Guard must submit a report to relevant committees assessing the need for increased Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions. This includes evaluating current assets, projected needs for forward operating bases, and addressing all mission areas such as search and rescue, marine pollution response, fisheries enforcement, and maritime commerce. The report to relevant committees will assess the need for increased Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions, including assets acquired under the Deepwater program, projected needs for forward operating bases, and icebreaking capability assessment. The report will include an assessment of the Coast Guard's ability to meet mission goals, the condition of icebreaking assets in high latitude regions, acquisition and maintenance costs for additional assets, and cost estimates for high latitude icebreaking capability over a 10-year period. The report will assess the Coast Guard's ability to meet mission goals and the condition of high latitude icebreaking assets. It will also provide cost estimates for renovating and modernizing the existing fleet, as well as replacing it. In this Act, the term \"Arctic\" is defined the same way as in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984."
