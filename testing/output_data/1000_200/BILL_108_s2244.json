    "content": "The bill is titled the \"Freedom to Fish Act\" and includes findings related to fishing rights. Congress finds that recreational fishing is a popular outdoor sport with over 50 million participants nationwide, contributing $116 billion annually to the economy and supporting over 1.2 million jobs. Recreational anglers also play a vital role in conservation efforts. Recreational anglers contribute over $500 million annually to State fisheries conservation programs. Federal policy supports public access to public lands for recreational purposes while maintaining fishery resources. The Recreation Act of 1978 emphasizes the importance of managing recreational fishery resources through various measures like take limits, size requirements, and closed seasons. A clear policy is needed to show anglers that recreational fishing can be managed without unnecessary restrictions. Additionally, a comprehensive policy on marine protected areas is necessary to balance recreational fishing with resource sustainability. The United States policy aims to conserve fishery resources by ensuring access for recreational anglers and involving them in regulatory procedures. Limitations on access are only imposed if scientifically necessary for conservation. Amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act are proposed. Amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act aim to limit closures of geographic areas for recreational fishing unless it is proven to be the cause of a specific conservation issue in the fishery. Alternative conservation measures must be considered before imposing closures, and specific criteria for assessing conservation benefits must be included in the management plan. Amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act require specific measurable criteria to assess the need for closures in recreational fishing areas. The best available scientific information must support the closure, and periodic reviews are mandated to evaluate the continued necessity of the prohibition. The closure is to be lifted once the conservation issue that prompted it no longer exists. Technical amendments are also made to ensure clarity in the legislation. SEC. 5. Amendment to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. Amendment to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act includes changes to fishing regulations within the exclusive economic zone, allowing Regional Fishery Management Councils to draft and revise regulations as needed, in accordance with the Magnuson Act. Regulations may also apply to fisheries within state boundaries. The Magnuson Act allows for regulations to be implemented within a state's boundaries if approved by the Governor or determined by the Secretary after a hearing. The Magnuson Act allows for regulations within a state's boundaries if approved by the Governor or determined by the Secretary after a hearing. If the Secretary decides to regulate a fishery within a state (excluding internal waters), the state and appropriate Council must be notified, a hearing can be requested, and a hearing must be conducted before any action is taken. The Magnuson Act allows for regulations within a state's boundaries if approved by the Governor or determined by the Secretary after a hearing. If the Secretary assumes responsibility for regulating a fishery within a state, the state can request reinstatement of its authority if the reasons for federal regulation no longer apply."
