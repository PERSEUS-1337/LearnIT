Prior reports and determinations are required before such rules can be promulgated. Before finalizing any energy-related rule costing over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details including the rule, costs, benefits, and uncertainties. Before finalizing any energy-related rule costing over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details including the rule, costs, benefits, and uncertainties. The report must also include calculations, assumptions, limitations, and a certification that all data and documents used in developing the estimates are available for public review on the Agency's website. Additionally, an estimate of potential energy price increases, including gasoline, must be provided. Before finalizing any energy-related rule costing over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details including the rule, costs, benefits, uncertainties, calculations, assumptions, limitations, and certification that all data and documents used in developing the estimates are available for public review on the Agency's website. The report must also include an estimate of potential energy price increases, including gasoline. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with relevant agencies, will prepare an independent analysis to determine any increase in energy prices for consumers resulting from the rule's implementation or enforcement, along with a detailed description of potential employment effects such as job losses and shifts. The Energy Administration will analyze the rule's impact on energy prices for consumers, fuel diversity, electric reliability, and energy supply. They will also assess any adverse effects on energy distribution and use, including potential supply shortfalls and increased reliance on foreign sources. The Energy Administration will analyze the rule's impact on energy prices, fuel diversity, electric reliability, and supply. If adverse effects are determined, the Secretary of Energy will assess significant impacts on the economy with input from various agencies. The Energy Administration will analyze the rule's impact on energy prices, fuel diversity, electric reliability, and supply. The costs and benefits of the rule, limitations in calculating them, and the positive and negative impacts on economic indicators will be considered and published in the Federal Register. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"direct costs\" and \"indirect costs\" are defined as per the Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines. An \"energy-related rule that is estimated to cost more than $1 billion\" refers to a rule regulating energy production, supply, distribution, or use, with estimated direct and indirect costs exceeding $1 billion. The Office of Management and Budget can impose direct and indirect costs exceeding $1 billion. The term \"rule\" is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON USE OF SOCIAL COST OF CARBON IN ANALYSIS. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is prohibited from using the social cost of carbon in cost-benefit analysis for energy-related rules costing over $1 billion, unless authorized by Federal law. The term \"social cost of carbon\" refers to a specific technical document or any related estimate. The House of Representatives passed a bill on August 1, 2013, related to monetized damages from increased carbon dioxide emissions. Karen L. Haas attested to the bill."
