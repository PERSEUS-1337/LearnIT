    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly population by 2019. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, H.R. 3962, would insure 96% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population. The total 10-year cost of coverage provisions is estimated at $891 billion, offset by savings and increased federal revenues. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, H.R. 3962, aims to reduce the number of uninsured individuals and restructure the private health insurance market. It includes provisions for individuals to maintain health insurance and for employers to provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment. Market reforms such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal are also included. The bill would increase federal revenues by $574 billion over a period of time. Market reforms in the Affordable Health Care for America Act would include modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal. The bill would link individual and employer mandates to acceptable health insurance coverage meeting minimum standards. Acceptable coverage would be offered through a qualified health benefits plan (QHBP) in the Exchange or through employer plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. Subsidies would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level. The Affordable Health Care for America Act includes market reforms such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal. Subsidies would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level. The bill also establishes a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to encourage the creation of not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives. Premium costs and cost-sharing subsidies would only be available through the Exchange. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered indefinitely if no changes are made. The bill would not affect plans covering specific services like dental or vision care. The report provides background information on the private insurance market and summarizes key provisions of H.R. 3962, which includes reforms effective from 2013. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The table in the Appendix outlines the timeline for implementing provisions effective before 2013. H.R. 3962 aims to reform private health insurance markets by prohibiting insurers from excluding individuals or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions, addressing issues like adverse selection. Insurers often use policies like excluding preexisting conditions to guard against adverse selection. Insurers guard against adverse selection by excluding preexisting conditions, leading to higher premiums and more uninsured individuals. AHIP suggests requiring everyone to purchase coverage to prevent only sick individuals from enrolling. Premium subsidies may be necessary for those who cannot afford insurance, along with cost-sharing subsidies to make market reforms feasible. The private health insurance provisions in Division A of H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, immediate reforms, Health Insurance Exchange with public option, subsidies, CO-OP Program, revenue provisions, and other provisions. Removing any of these provisions could hinder the implementation of the others. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, while approximately 46 million Americans were uninsured. Individuals may obtain health coverage through private sector or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. There is no federal law mandating individuals to have health insurance or requiring employers to offer it. Approximately 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured in 2008. Individuals and employers purchasing health insurance fit into three market segments: large group, small group, and nongroup. Large employers offer coverage to over 95% of employees, enjoying lower premiums due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. Employers provide substantial subsidies for health insurance, attracting both healthier and sicker workers to join the pool. States have experimented with creating single sites for individuals and small employers to compare insurance plans and pool risk. Some past experiments failed, but others like Massachusetts' Connector have shown potential. Private-sector companies like eHealthInsurance also help individuals and small groups compare plans. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to cost concerns. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to cost concerns and limited ability to spread risk across a small pool. Small firms face disadvantages compared to larger counterparts, such as being more likely to be medically underwritten and having little market power to negotiate benefits and rates with insurance carriers. Small firms, being medically underwritten and lacking market power, may benefit from purchasing insurance through a larger pool like an Association or Exchange. State laws can impact premiums based on health status, leading to lower premiums for the healthy but higher for the sick. Reforms in premium ratings could result in increased premiums for some and decreased premiums for others based on age, health, and behaviors. States primarily regulate the private health insurance market, with federal regulations mostly affecting employer-sponsored health insurance. States primarily regulate the private health insurance market, with federal regulations mostly affecting employer-sponsored health insurance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires guaranteed issue coverage for small groups and self-employed individuals in some states. Premium rating rules are imposed by most states on insurance carriers. States regulate private health insurance markets, with federal regulations impacting employer-sponsored health insurance. HIPAA mandates guaranteed issue coverage for small groups and self-employed individuals in some states. Most states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers, ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating and rate bands. Pure community rating charges all enrollees the same premium regardless of health, age, or other factors. Adjusted community rating allows pricing based on age or gender but not health. Rate bands limit premium variation based on health within a specified range set by the state. Federal law requires group health plans and health insurance issuers to limit the period of time when coverage for preexisting health conditions may be excluded. In the small group market, 21 states had preexisting condition exclusion rules above the federal standard as of January 2009. In the individual market, 42 states limit the period of time when coverage for preexisting health conditions may be excluded for certain enrollees as of December 2008. In 42 states, coverage for preexisting health conditions may be excluded for certain enrollees in the individual market. There is a debate on whether a publicly sponsored health insurance plan should be offered as part of insurance market reform, with proponents arguing it could be less expensive and provide more choice and competition. Opponents question if it would be a fair competitor. Some opponents question the fairness of a public health insurance plan competing with private plans, fearing it may drive them out of the market. Studies suggest non-profit health insurance organizations perform better in quality measures compared to for-profit ones. A 1999 study in JAMA found that non-profit HMOs scored higher on quality measures compared to for-profit plans. A 2006 study of 272 health plans also showed similar results. Health insurance co-operatives, a subset of non-profit plans, have performed well in recent case studies. As of 2008, 47% of private health plan enrollment was in non-profit organizations. Congressional attention has focused on incentivizing the creation of new health insurance co-operatives. Some congressional attention has been focused on options to incentivize the creation of new health insurance co-operatives in the United States. Advocates argue that co-operatives reinvest earnings into lower premiums, cost-sharing, benefits, and wellness programs. Opponents claim co-operatives are not successful nationwide and may not make insurance more affordable. Several provisions of the bill would take effect before full implementation on January 1, 2013. Prior to full implementation on January 1, 2013, some provisions of the bill include prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits, allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Health Insurance Exchange is operational, establishing a temporary national high-risk pool program, requiring health insurance issuers to provide rebates for low medical loss ratios, and applying these provisions to both the small and large group markets as well as the individual market. The bill includes provisions such as setting a loss ratio threshold, allowing individuals up to age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance, and reducing the look-back period for pre-existing conditions. Insurers must justify premium increases to the Secretary and states before implementing them. Domestic violence cannot be considered a pre-existing condition. The bill, H.R. 3962, aims to reduce the look-back period for pre-existing conditions to 30 days and prohibits domestic violence from being considered a pre-existing condition. It also mandates coverage for dependent children's congenital or developmental issues, prohibits lifetime benefit limits, and establishes guidance to limit insurance policy rescissions. Additionally, a temporary reinsurance program is set up to assist employment-based plans with providing health benefits to retirees and their eligible family members. H.R. 3962 mandates most individuals to have health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance. Acceptable coverage includes qualified health benefits plans, employment-based plans, Medicare, Medicaid, military coverage, veteran's health care, Indian tribe services, and coverage determined by the Secretary. Noncompliance could result in additional taxes. Individuals without health insurance may face an additional tax, based on their income, if they do not have coverage for themselves and their children. Some may receive subsidies to help with premium costs. Exemptions from the mandate include nonresident aliens, those with religious exemptions, and dependents for tax purposes. (H.R. 3962) H.R. 3962 mandates employers to provide health insurance to employees or contribute to an Exchange. Employers can offer coverage through a QHBP or current plan, with exceptions for small businesses. Grandfathered plans have five years to meet essential requirements. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost QHBP or current employment-based plan for individual coverage (65% for family coverage) and automatically enroll employees in the plan with the lowest premium unless they opt out. Written notice of employee rights and obligations regarding auto enrollment must be provided. Compliance with health participation requirements must be demonstrated by providing certain information. Employers must provide information to show compliance with health participation requirements for auto enrollment. The Secretary of HHS could terminate an employer's health insurance election for noncompliance. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 not offering coverage would face an 8% excise tax. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 not offering coverage would be subject to an 8% excise tax. Employees can choose to enroll in a plan through the Exchange instead of the employer's coverage. Beginning in 2014, employers with aggregate wages above $750,000 would be assessed 8% of average wages for employees who decline qualifying coverage. This payroll assessment does not apply to employees covered as spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan. Employees who opt for Exchange coverage instead of their employer's qualifying coverage would be responsible for 100% of the premium. Small businesses may be eligible for a 50% credit towards the cost of qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years, with the credit phasing out as average employee compensation and the number of employees increase. The small business credit for employee health coverage would be phased out as average employee compensation increased from $20,000 to $40,000 and as the number of employees increased from 10 to 25. Adjustments for inflation would be applied, and the credit would not apply to highly compensated employees. It would be part of the general business credit and only available to businesses with a tax liability. Non-profit organizations would be ineligible for the credit. H.R. 3962 would establish new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans. The bill specifies insurance standards for new health plans, including prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing conditions and requiring coverage to be offered on a guaranteed basis. The bill specifies insurance standards for new health plans, including prohibiting coverage exclusions based on pre-existing conditions and requiring coverage to be offered on a guaranteed basis. It also requires premiums to be determined using adjusted community rating rules. Guaranteed issue and renewal must be offered for all individual and group health plans, both inside and outside the Exchange. Premiums under H.R. 3962 would vary based on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment. New non-discrimination and adequacy standards for insurers' networks of providers would be imposed, along with existing mental health parity rules. Coverage must provide the option of keeping qualified dependent children. H.R. 3962 would require insurers to follow new non-discrimination and adequacy standards for provider networks, including existing mental health parity rules. It mandates coverage to offer the option of keeping qualified dependent children on the family policy, limits out-of-pocket spending, prohibits cost-sharing on preventive services, and prohibits annual and lifetime benefit limits. New individual policies issued after 2013 could only be offered as an Exchange plan. H.R. 3962 would allow states to form Health Care Choice Compacts for the sale of individual health insurance plans across state lines. Existing group plans would need to transition to QHBP standards by 2018, while existing nongroup insurance policies would be grandfathered as long as there are no changes to the coverage terms or conditions. Premiums could only increase according to statute. The NAIC would develop model guidelines for Health Care Choice Compacts, allowing coverage sold in multiple states to be subject to one primary state's laws. The Secretary would provide grants to states for regulating health insurance in secondary states. QHBPs must cover essential benefits, with additional benefits optional. The essential benefits package includes specified items and services, limits on out-of-pocket spending, network adequacy standards, and equivalence to employer health plans in 2013. The essential benefits package for Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) must cover a range of health care items and services, comply with network adequacy standards, and be equivalent to employer health plans in 2013. It includes hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health services, preventive services, maternity care, and more. The essential benefits package for Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) includes coverage for a variety of health care services such as hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health services, preventive services, maternity care, and more. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family, adjusted annually for inflation. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments and the package would cover an average of 70% of covered health care claims. The essential benefits package for Qualified Health Benefit Plans covers a variety of health care services with an annual out-of-pocket limit. Plans offered through the Exchange could have richer benefit packages as Enhanced, Premium, and/or Premium-Plus plans. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee makes recommendations to the Secretary regarding coverage and cost-sharing levels. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee would develop cost-sharing structures consistent with actuarial values for different plan tiers in the Health Insurance Exchange. Recommendations would incorporate innovation in healthcare, reduce health disparities, and allow for public input. The Secretary must adopt or provide reasons for not adopting benefit standards within 45 days, with an initial set required within 18 days. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses. The Exchange would provide access to insurers' plans in a similar way to online travel booking platforms like Travelocity or Expedia. The Exchange under H.R. 3962 would be established as a federal agency, responsible for negotiating with plans, enforcing requirements, and determining eligibility for premium and cost-sharing credits. Funding would come from taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. The Exchange under H.R. 3962 would be funded through taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. State-based Exchanges would receive federal matching grants and must meet specified criteria for approval by the Commissioner. The Commissioner would presume state-based Exchanges meet required standards, but could determine non-compliance. New nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange starting in 2013. Public health insurance option and income-based credits available through the Exchange. CBO estimated 30 million people would have Exchange coverage by 2019. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage unless they have employer-sponsored insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. Once enrolled in an Exchange plan, they can continue until they are no longer eligible. An annual open-enrollment period would be held from September to November, with special enrollment periods available. An annual open-enrollment period would be offered from September to November, lasting at least 30 days, with special enrollment periods for certain circumstances. Exchange-eligible employers could meet the employer mandate by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment through the Exchange. Employers with 25 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible in 2013, 50 or fewer in 2014, and 100 or fewer in 2015. Once enrolled through the Exchange, employers would continue to be Exchange-eligible unless they offer their own QHBPs. In 2014, employers with 50 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. In 2015, employers with 100 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. The Commissioner could permit larger employers to participate in the Exchange starting in 2015. Exchange plans must meet federal requirements and have standardized cost-sharing options. An Exchange-participating entity must offer one Basic plan equivalent to the essential benefits package. The entity offering plans in a service area must adhere to minimum requirements for the essential benefits package, with varying levels of cost-sharing based on plan type. Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and Premium-Plus plans are available, each with different actuarial values and additional benefits like adult oral health and vision care. Plans in the Exchange must adhere to cost-sharing levels set by the Secretary for different benefit categories. States can require additional benefits beyond the essential package, with reimbursement arrangements needed. H.R. 3962 establishes a public health insurance option through the Exchange, offering income-based credits for eligible individuals. The public option in the Exchange would offer Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans, with the possibility of Premium-Plus plans. Geographically adjusted premiums would be set to cover costs, with limited start-up funding to be repaid within 10 years. The public option must meet Exchange plan requirements and negotiate payment rates for health services. The public option in the Exchange would offer Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans, with the possibility of Premium-Plus plans. Payment rates for health care providers and services would be negotiated by the Secretary, with rates not allowed to be lower than Medicare or higher than average rates paid by other qualified health benefit offering entities. Physicians could participate as preferred or non-preferred providers, with preferred physicians prohibited from balance-billing. Non-preferred physicians could balance-bill up to 115%. The Secretary would have the authority to use innovative payment methods under the public option, including bundling of services and performance-based payments. Non-physician providers would be prohibited from balance-billing, while non-preferred physicians could balance-bill up to 115% of a reduced payment rate. The Secretary could enter into no-risk contracts for the administration of the public option, similar to the Medicare program. Administrative functions would include determining payment amounts and beneficiary education. The Secretary could enter into no-risk contracts for the administration of the public option, similar to the Medicare program. Administrative functions would include determination of payment amounts, making payments, beneficiary education, provider consultative services, communication with providers, and provider education and technical assistance. Enrollment in the public option would be voluntary, allowing individuals, including Members of Congress, to choose to enroll in health insurance through any Exchange plan. The bill proposes a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to establish non-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with an appropriation of $5 billion for fiscal years 2010-2014. Grants and loans would be provided for start-up and solvency requirements, with conditions for eligibility. The bill proposes a CO-OP program to establish non-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with $5 billion in funding for fiscal years 2010-2014. Grants and loans would be provided with conditions for eligibility, including not-for-profit status, ethical standards, and focus on offering QHBPs through the Health Insurance Exchange. The cooperative issues QHBPs through the Health Insurance Exchange or state-based exchanges, operates with a consumer focus, and uses profits to lower premiums or improve benefits. The governance is subject to member majority vote, and grants/loans prioritize statewide operations, integrated delivery systems, and financial support from nongovernmental sources. Cooperatives under the CO-OP program must adhere to terms set by the Commissioner, with potential repayment of loans or grants if violations occur. Premium and cost-sharing subsidies are available for individuals purchasing health insurance through the program. Under H.R. 3962, eligible individuals can receive cost-sharing credits for Basic plans in 2013 and 2014, and Enhanced or Premium plans starting in 2015. Credits are available for those lawfully present in the U.S. with income below 400% of the federal poverty level, excluding certain individuals. The premium credit under H.R. 3962 is available for eligible individuals with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) below 400% of the federal poverty level, who are not eligible for certain types of coverage. The credit is based on an affordable premium amount calculated as a percentage of individuals' income relative to the poverty level. The Commissioner would adjust the percentages in the table starting in 2014. For more details, refer to CRS Report R40878. Beginning in 2014, the Commissioner would adjust the percentages in the table so that the government's contribution towards premiums remains consistent across income tiers. The \"affordability premium credit\" would be calculated based on the difference between the enrollee's premium and the affordable premium amount. Premium percentage limits would be established for individuals with family incomes between specified tiers, increasing on a linear sliding scale. The Commissioner would adjust premium percentage limits on a sliding scale based on family income tiers. Eligible individuals would receive assistance for cost-sharing on health services. The annual out-of-pocket maximum for cost-sharing would be determined based on income tiers. The annual out-of-pocket maximum for cost-sharing would be adjusted based on income tiers, with flexibility for the Commissioner to alter amounts to meet actuarial values. Family coverage would have double the out-of-pocket limits, and future increases would be tied to premium growth. Additional payments to insurers would cover reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage, including limits on employer deductions and modifications to tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. The House bill includes provisions to limit employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modify tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. Employer subsidies for retiree prescription drug coverage are currently excludable from gross income and eligible for business deductions. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage, reducing the deduction by the amount of federal subsidy received. This provision is estimated to raise $2.2 billion over 10 years. Tax-advantaged accounts and deductions for health care spending will be affected by the revenue provisions in the bill. Health FSAs, HSAs, HRAs, and MSAs allow workers to exclude qualified medical expenses from income taxes. FSAs reimburse employees for health care expenses pre-tax. About one-third of workers had access to an FSA in 2007, with an average contribution of $1,350. H.R. 3962 would limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, raising $13.3 billion over 10 years. H.R. 3962 would limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, raising $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs allow individuals to fund unreimbursed medical expenses on a pre-tax basis and distributions used for qualified medical expenses are not taxable. H.R. 3962 increases the penalty on non-qualified distributions to 20% and modifies the definition of qualified medical expenses for tax-advantaged accounts. It prohibits coverage of over-the-counter medications unless prescribed by a physician, raising revenues by $5.0 billion over 10 years. The bill also addresses state laws regarding abortion coverage and funding. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. State laws on abortion coverage and funding would not be preempted by the bill. Federal conscience protection and antidiscrimination laws would not be affected. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. The bill restricts the recommendation and adoption of standards related to abortion as part of the essential benefits package. The Stupak Amendment adds additional restrictions on the use of funds authorized or appropriated by H.R. 3962. The Stupak Amendment, passed by a vote of 240-194, imposes restrictions on the use of funds in H.R. 3962 for abortion coverage. Funds cannot be used for abortion unless in cases of physical danger, rape, or incest. Nonfederal entities can purchase separate coverage for elective abortions, but it must be paid for with funds not from H.R. 3962. The Stupak Amendment prohibits the use of funds from H.R. 3962 for abortion coverage, except in cases of physical danger, rape, or incest. Nonfederal entities can buy separate coverage for elective abortions, but it must be paid for with funds not authorized by H.R. 3962. H.R. 3962 prohibits the use of funds for abortion coverage, except in specific cases. Nonfederal entities can purchase separate coverage for elective abortions with funds not authorized by the bill. Exchange plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers unwilling to provide abortion services. States can receive incentive payments for enacting alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. The Secretary evaluates the effectiveness of a law based on its impact on the medical liability system, disclosure of errors, and access to liability insurance. State laws must include an \"early offer\" system or a \"certificate of merit\" program, without limiting attorneys' fees or imposing damage caps. The early offer system allows defendants to offer periodic payments for economic losses within 180 days of a claim being filed. The bill proposes an early offer system for economic losses in medical malpractice cases, covering medical expenses and lost wages not already covered by insurance. If the offer is declined and litigation pursued, the standards of misconduct and proof are raised. A certificate of merit program is required for filing a malpractice suit, and states receiving incentive payments must use them to improve healthcare. The bill authorizes appropriation for incentive payments but does not provide funds for them. The bill clarifies that incentive payments for medical malpractice cases would not be funded by the government. Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) must provide information on end-of-life planning and offer options for advance directives and physician's orders for life-sustaining treatment. However, promoting suicide, assisted suicide, or hastening death is prohibited."
