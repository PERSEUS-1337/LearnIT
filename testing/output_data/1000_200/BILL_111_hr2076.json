The \"Border Security and Responsibility Act 2009\" defines key terms such as \"Indian tribe\" and \"Secretary\" and outlines the responsibilities of different Secretaries in relation to land jurisdiction. It also includes a provision for a Border Protection Strategy. The Border Protection Strategy, to be developed by multiple Secretaries in consultation with various officials, must be submitted to Congress by September 30, 2009. It will include a comparative analysis of operational control levels achievable through different security measures. The Border Protection Strategy, to be developed by multiple Secretaries in consultation with various officials, must be submitted to Congress by September 30, 2009. It will include a comparative analysis of operational control levels achievable through different security measures, such as pedestrian fencing, vehicle barriers, additional Border Patrol agents, natural barriers, open space, and advanced technology like unmanned aerial vehicles. The Border Protection Strategy will involve advanced technologies and systems for surveillance, information integration, and response analysis in difficult terrain. It will also focus on regional variations in border security methodologies and cooperation with intelligence, security, and law enforcement agencies in Mexico and Canada. The Border Protection Strategy includes cooperation with Mexico and Canada for detecting and responding to unauthorized border crossings, as well as removal of obstructive vegetation. A cost analysis of security measures is also included, covering land acquisition, construction, maintenance, and contractor costs over 25 years. The cost analysis for security measures includes labor, material, maintenance, contractor, management, and overhead costs over 25 years. It also considers the impacts on wildlife, habitat, natural communities, and water resources along the border. The cost analysis for security measures includes labor, material, maintenance, contractor, management, and overhead costs over 25 years. It also considers the impacts on private lands, waters (including water quality, quantity, and hydrological flows), wildlife, and wildlife habitats, including the replacement or restoration of wildlife migration corridors with protected corridors of equivalent biological functionality. Additionally, it evaluates the impacts on culture, safety, and quality of life on residents in the vicinity of the border. The curr_chunk discusses the fiscal investments in acquiring or managing lands and waters near the US borders for conservation purposes. This includes National Park System units, National Forest System land, and Bureau of Land Management jurisdiction. The curr_chunk lists various types of land under different jurisdictions, including National Forest System land, Bureau of Land Management jurisdiction, United States Fish and Wildlife Service jurisdiction, Department of the Interior or Agriculture jurisdiction, Department of Defense or individual military department jurisdiction, Department of Commerce jurisdiction, tribal lands, State and private lands, and lands within Mexico and Canada. The curr_chunk discusses recommendations for strategic border security management based on comparative security, cost-benefit analysis, and protection of investments in public lands. Additionally, it mentions required natural resource protection training for Customs and Border Protection agents or other Federal personnel. The curr_chunk focuses on providing training for Customs and Border Protection agents and other Federal personnel involved in border security infrastructure and patrolling. The Secretary is required to coordinate training with other relevant departments. The Secretary must coordinate training for Customs and Border Protection agents and Federal personnel involved in border security to align with agency missions and border security objectives while minimizing adverse impacts on natural and cultural resources. SEC. 5. ACTIONS TO GAIN OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAND BORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES. Amendment to improve operational control of the border. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to gain operational control of the international land borders of the United States, following the border protection strategy developed under the Border Security and Responsibility Act of 2009. Priority should be given to using remote cameras, sensors, natural barriers, manpower, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other low impact border enforcement techniques. Consultation with the Secretaries of Interior, Agriculture, and other relevant parties is necessary. The Secretary of Homeland Security must consult with various government agencies, states, local governments, tribal governments, and private property owners to minimize the impact on the environment, culture, commerce, safety, and quality of life near proposed action sites. This consultation does not create or negate any legal rights or affect eminent domain laws. The Secretary of Homeland Security is not required to install specific resources along the international border if deemed ineffective or costly. This does not affect eminent domain laws or waive other applicable laws. The Secretary of Homeland Security must consider the costs and impacts on the environment, culture, safety, and quality of life before placing resources along the border. Construction of infrastructure along the international land border cannot begin until 90 days after submission of the required documentation. Prior to 90 days after the border protection strategy is submitted to Congress, states cannot award or spend funds on related contracts or agreements. SEC. 6. BORDERLANDS MONITORING AND MITIGATION. The Secretary, in consultation with various agencies, will develop a monitoring and mitigation plan to address ecological impacts of border security infrastructure along US international land borders. The plan will include measures to preserve wildlife migration corridors and habitats. The plan for addressing ecological impacts of border security infrastructure includes preserving wildlife migration corridors, key habitats, functional connectivity, controlling invasive species, maintaining hydrological functionality, incorporating adaptive management, and protecting cultural and historical resources. The Secretary may carry out a mitigation plan on various lands near the international border of the United States, regardless of ownership, to protect cultural and historical resources. Activities must be done in consultation and with concurrence. The Secretary of Homeland Security can transfer funds to other agencies for conservation programs on non-Federal lands and mitigation activities on Federal lands. The Secretary of Homeland Security can transfer funds to other agencies for conservation programs on non-Federal lands and mitigation activities on Federal lands. The transferred funds are exempt from reprogramming requirements and donations can be accepted for developing and implementing the required mitigation plan. The Secretary of Homeland Security can transfer funds to other agencies for conservation programs and mitigation activities. Funds appropriated for border security infrastructure can be used to develop and implement the required mitigation plan."
