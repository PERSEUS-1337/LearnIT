    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Military forces are crucial for initial security, but civilian police (CivPol) are increasingly seen as more suitable for maintaining law and order in post-conflict environments. Over the past decade, international civilian police (CivPol) have gained recognition as more suitable than military forces for law and order tasks. Policymakers are addressing issues with CivPol use and considering improvements to the existing system and building new capabilities. Advocates propose facilitating recruitment and rapid deployment of CivPol forces. Advocates propose reforms to improve existing CivPol systems and ensure appropriate training for law enforcement personnel in post-conflict missions. Key documents like the Clinton Administration's PDD-71 recommend mechanisms for enhancing CivPol capabilities. The February 2000 Presidential Decision Directive 71 (PDD-71) and the United Nations' August 2000 \"Brahimi Panel\" report contain recommendations for improving law enforcement aspects of peacekeeping operations, including the creation of a reserve CivPol force. The Bush Administration has started implementing some measures, while the UN is working on implementing the Brahimi Panel recommendations. Advocates recommend creating a reserve CivPol force, diversifying international police forces, and establishing robust civilian response mechanisms to improve law enforcement in post-conflict operations and potentially reduce reliance on U.S. military forces. This report discusses the evolution of international police in peacekeeping operations, current mechanisms for providing CivPols, recommendations for improvement, and options for resolving ongoing issues to potentially reduce reliance on U.S. military forces in post-conflict operations. The international community has increasingly relied on CivPols for various functions in peace operations, with a significant increase in international civilian police participation in U.N. operations between 1994 and 2000. As of February 29, 2004, there were 4,655 international civilian police, including 476 Americans, assisting with law enforcement tasks in eight U.N. peacekeeping missions. As of February 29, 2004, 476 Americans were assisting with law enforcement tasks in U.N. peacekeeping missions. Some analysts suggest deploying international civilian police to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended in 1975, prohibits aid for police, prisons, or law enforcement forces of foreign governments, except in post-conflict situations. International civilian police forces have been used for various purposes since the late 19th century. Since the late 19th century, international civilian police forces have been utilized for various purposes. These forces, comprised of recruits from multiple nations, have been involved in monitoring and supervising local police, conducting joint patrols, providing training and advice, and assisting with restructuring efforts. They have also been armed and given arrest powers in some cases. Policing in peacekeeping operations has evolved through five phases focused on establishing security, with functions summarized as Support for human rights, Monitoring, Advising, Reporting, and Training. The evolution of international civilian police forces in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases aimed at establishing security. The phases involved expanding U.N. activities, adding training components, developing mandates for police reform, and incorporating specially constituted constabulary units. The evolution of international civilian police forces in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, including the addition of specially constituted constabulary units and the expansion of mandates to provide international police with \"executive authority\" to bear arms and make arrests. This evolution reflects the international community's growing awareness of security needs and types of assistance required by indigenous police forces in peace operations. The evolution of international civilian police forces in peacekeeping operations has led to an increased awareness of security needs and types of assistance required by indigenous police forces. Policymakers and analysts are focusing on ensuring public security as a joint responsibility with indigenous personnel, while also addressing gaps in mandates and implementation standards. The evolution of international civilian police forces in peacekeeping operations has highlighted gaps in recruitment and training mechanisms, particularly for the United Nations. These gaps have led to difficulties in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen who can work effectively together. Some early recruits, both American and foreign, lacked basic skills and engaged in corruption. The United Nations has tried to address recruitment issues, but challenges persist in finding personnel with necessary skills. Analysts suggest additional training to improve policing skills and professionalism. Security gaps hinder the international community's ability to establish law and order in post-conflict situations. Deficiencies in recruitment and training systems contribute to these gaps. The deployment gap in establishing law and order in post-conflict situations is a significant security challenge. Delays in deploying police forces quickly and in adequate numbers have been observed in various international missions, impacting their effectiveness. The deployment gap in international missions hinders the ability to establish law and order in post-conflict situations. Delays in deploying police forces and a lack of specialized skills impact mission effectiveness. In post-conflict situations, the lack of specialized skills among deployed police forces hinders their ability to handle hostile situations and organized crime effectively. Additionally, an institution gap exists where indigenous law enforcement systems lack sufficient personnel and institutions for prosecution and punishment, compromising sustainable security. The international community has provided police assistance in post-conflict situations where judiciaries and penal systems lack resources to handle increased workload. The United Nations, European countries, regional organizations, and the United States have all played important roles in international police operations. The United Nations international civilian police system is the main mechanism for providing civilian police assistance in multilateral operations. The international civilian police system is the main mechanism for providing civilian police assistance in multilateral operations. As of February 29, 2004, 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations were serving in eight U.N. missions. Jordan is the largest contributor with 553 officers, followed by the United States with 476 officers. Other countries with over 100 officers include India, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, Nepal, Malaysia, Romania, Pakistan, Argentina, Poland, and the United Kingdom. The majority of UNCIVPOL officers were serving in Kosovo, with other missions in Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, and Afghanistan. Many nations have also provided training and reform efforts. Many nations, including the United States, European Union member states, and others, have provided police assistance and training in various countries such as Somalia, Haiti, Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, and Afghanistan. The United States has been involved in developing police training programs in Somalia through the Justice Department's International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP). Several countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, and Italy, have provided police assistance on an individual basis. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union (EU) have taken the lead in specific missions, often in conjunction with U.N. missions. For example, the OSCE has provided training assistance in Kosovo and other countries, while the EU has taken over police missions in Bosnia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The EU launched its second police mission, the 200-strong PROXIMA mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on December 15, 2003. U.N. Member States contribute police personnel on a voluntary basis for peacekeeping operations, following a United Nations Security Council resolution. The U.N. philosophy of CivPol is based on international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UNDPKO) provides political and executive direction within the U.N. Headquarters. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UNDPKO) at the U.N. Headquarters oversees all components of peacekeeping operations, including the police mission. The Civilian Police Division (CPD) within UNDPKO is responsible for policy, planning, and management of civilian policing activities. UNCIVPOL personnel in the field are under the command of the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner, who reports to the U.N. Secretary-General's Special. The Brahimi Panel report is the authoritative analysis of problems in U.N. peacekeeping, focusing on recruitment, training, and deployment of police personnel. It recommends actions to strengthen the U.N.'s capacity for rapid deployment of CivPols. The Brahimi Panel report recommends actions to strengthen the U.N.'s capacity for rapid deployment of CivPols, including the development of a \"ready roster\" of qualified CivPols, an on-call list of experts, regional partnerships for joint police training, and the identification of national points of contact on CivPol matters. Additionally, conferences were held with police-contributing nations to address recruitment, training, deployment, and related issues. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations aimed to improve the recruitment, training, and deployment of CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system. While some reforms have been implemented, analysts still see significant problems with the UNCIVPOL system. Recommendations included pre-positioning of equipment for rapid deployment and addressing procedural and organizational impediments to efficient operations. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations focused on improving recruitment, training, and deployment of CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system. Despite some progress in other areas, significant problems remain with the UNCIVPOL system. The recommendations emphasized the need for a new approach to address the complex operations and restructuring of local police, requiring better-trained law enforcement personnel working alongside other rule of law professionals. The Brahimi Panel report called for a new approach in law enforcement, emphasizing reform and restructuring instead of traditional activities like monitoring and training. This shift required better-trained police personnel to work with rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. However, implementing this approach has faced challenges within the UN CivPol system. The UN is facing challenges in implementing a new approach to law enforcement, which emphasizes reform and restructuring to strengthen institutions. Despite efforts to integrate rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations, progress is seen as \"lagging\" according to a recent report. The UNDPKO is facing challenges in recruiting civilian police for rule of law operations, with only two out of six requested posts filled. This hinders the deployment of missions with a substantial criminal justice component. The UN still struggles to recruit police who meet minimum standards and lack experience in community policing. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting police officers who meet minimum standards and lack experience in community policing and international human rights standards. Efforts to improve overall quality have had some success, but recruiting officers with specialized skills remains difficult. The absence of a comprehensive U.N. civilian police strategy complicates determining mission needs and recruiting suitable personnel for mission requirements. The United Nations struggles to recruit civilian police officers with the necessary skills for missions. Requirements include a minimum age of 25, 5 years of police experience, language proficiency, a driver's license, and medical fitness. Firearms experience is needed for executive authority missions. Pre-selection testing and training in contributing countries are recommended but not mandatory. The United Nations has faced challenges in recruiting civilian police officers with required skills. Despite efforts to improve selection criteria, some personnel lack language, driving, and firearms skills. Selection Assistance Teams have been sent since 1996 to guide Member States in selecting candidates. Retraining and retesting of basic requirements are conducted in missions, with deficiencies leading to high repatriation costs and delays. Retraining and retesting accounted for a significant portion of the induction period, resulting in high repatriation costs and deployment delays. Recruitment for specialized skills, such as training and investigations, has been challenging. Recommendations have been made for advance recruitment of personnel to improve quality and speed up deployment. The Brahimi Panel Report and UNDPKO seminar recommendations suggest establishing national and international ready rosters of trained CivPol personnel for quick deployment, aiming to improve quality and speed up the process. The creation of an effective ready roster of international police personnel is being pursued through increased participation of countries, job descriptions, and personnel specialization. Progress has been noted in strengthening UNSAS, but a lack of individual candidates for international operations remains a major weakness. Recommendations include replacing 'bidding for slots' with experienced candidates familiar with UN rules and procedures. The United Nations has established on-call lists of police officers and experts for advance mission planning. Training exercises have been conducted to improve the efficiency of this system. Some Member States have nominated individuals for these lists, but not all have been screened or trained for UN operations. The UN is making efforts to enhance recruitment for international police personnel. The United Nations has improved its on-call system through training exercises and efforts to recruit specialists with substantive skills related to management, planning, training, and operations. Analysts have identified shortcomings in U.N. procedures, including the lack of standardized criteria for determining the number of civilian police needed for missions. The United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Hercegovina (UNMIBH) and Kosovo (UNMIK) had criteria for civilian police presence based on local factors like crime statistics and police strength. UNDPKO was criticized for not consistently matching skills to missions, leading to civilian police performing non-policing functions. A significant percentage of civilian police were assigned to administrative roles, reducing the number available for policing duties. Administrative functions accounted for eight percent of the total number of police officers in UN missions in East Timor, Bosnia, Hercegovina, and Kosovo. Mission-preparedness training varies among police-contributing Member States and can be inadequate, leading to challenges in assembling a coherent force. The lack of uniformity in experience and standardized training can undermine the effectiveness of UNCIVPOL missions. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training to civilian police personnel for UN missions, but there are challenges due to inadequate training resources and varying national training programs. This can undermine the effectiveness of UNCIVPOL missions. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO recommendations emphasize the need for joint police training exercises and utilizing U.N. educational materials for pre-deployment training. However, there is limited progress in establishing regional training partnerships among member states. The UNDPKO Training Unit has made efforts to improve pre-deployment training by providing training publications to assist Member States. UNDPKO is enhancing pre-deployment training by distributing training publications to Member States and developing common training standards, including generic modules for peacekeepers. PDD-71 recognizes the importance of training in increasing capabilities for CivPol operations. PDD-71 emphasizes the national responsibility for training individuals and units for coalition peace operations but allows for international organizations to supplement training when needed. The State Department's INL office is tasked with providing tailored training packages to U.S. and international CIVPOL when requested and funded appropriately. Additionally, a new State Department CivPol program aims to invite foreign police officers to train with the U.S. contingent, with specific arrangements still under discussion. The deployment of UNCIVPOL is a complex process involving defining mission needs, recruiting personnel, and coordinating contributions from multiple nations. Historically, deployment times have ranged from six to eighteen months due to resource limitations. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for deployment delays and recommendations to address them. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations aimed to address the lack of a reserve corps of mission leadership, unreliable standby arrangements, and insufficient ready equipment for peacekeeping missions. They defined a rapid deployment period of 4 to 12 weeks for mission deployment, with full deployment recommended within 30 days for traditional missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies. Mission headquarters should be operational within 15 days for complex emergencies. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations highlighted constraints on rapid deployment, including the current UN system's inability to handle concurrent missions, limited civilian standby capacity, and the need for contributing states to deploy personnel quickly. Reforms to the United Nations System for Standby Arrangements are underway to enable faster deployment in the future. The United Nations is reforming its standby arrangements to deploy personnel and equipment more rapidly in the future. This includes developing a 100-person on-call roster of civilian police personnel and improving procurement and management of strategic deployment stocks at the U.N. Logistics Base in Italy. However, there is currently no program in place to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. Many U.N. Member States have generic rapid deployment programs, but few have the capability to deploy rapidly. The U.S. CivPol program is managed by the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. The Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs manages the U.S. CivPol program, recruiting civilian police personnel from local agencies through contractors. DynCorp International has been the sole supplier of personnel, but a new arrangement will start in April 2004. The State Department initiated a new arrangement in April 2004 with multiple companies contracted to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for deploying CivPol officers. Funding for the U.S. CivPol program comes from various State Department regional bureaus and the Peacekeeping account. Officers receive a base salary from the program. The U.S. CivPol program is funded through State Department bureaus and officers receive a base salary ranging from $50,000-100,000. Those in U.N. missions get a daily subsistence allowance of $75-95, and may also receive danger pay. Costs per officer vary by mission, with annual expenses ranging from $100,000 in Kosovo to $150,000-$175,000 in Iraq, covering salary, equipment, transportation, and support services. The cost of providing support for U.S. CivPol and support personnel in international missions varies, with expenses ranging from $100,000 in Kosovo to $150,000-$175,000 in Iraq. The United Nations covers expenses such as security, food, and housing in Kosovo, while the Congressional Budget Office estimates the incremental cost per troop in Iraq to be between $179,000 and $206,000. As of March 27, 2004, 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel were involved in international missions, including U.N. missions in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, and Sierra Leone. Additionally, officers were seconded to OSCE missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The U.S. also provided police officers to monitor high-profile prisoners in Israel. Policymakers have acknowledged recruitment and deployment issues in the U.S. and other nations. The U.S. policymakers have recognized recruitment and deployment issues in the U.S. and other nations regarding CivPol personnel. PDD-71 aims to enhance response capacities by improving operational activities and providing guidance for recruitment, training, management, and deployment of U.S. CivPol personnel. Perceived problems include inefficiency in matching skills with mission requirements, inconsistencies in training levels, professionalism, and deployment lag. Analysts stress the need for ongoing improvements in the current system. The Department of State has issued contracts for a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel to improve deployment efficiency in the U.S. CivPol system. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and procurement services for rapid deployment of qualified CivPols. The State Department awarded contracts for a new cadre of U.S. civilian police to improve deployment efficiency. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and procurement services, as well as identifying technical advisors for institutional capabilities in police, judicial, and corrections systems. Awarding contracts to multiple companies has raised concerns about the expeditiousness of the process. Some analysts question the expeditiousness of the recruitment process for U.S. civilian police deployments. Concerns arise from the increased competition for CivPol positions and the unclear application of original RFP provisions in new contracts. DynCorp and other companies recruit police officers for these missions, but experts debate the effectiveness of this method. Experts have debated the effectiveness of recruiting police officers for international missions, with concerns about the quality of recruits due to overextended municipal and state forces. The repeated call-ups of U.S. military reserve forces have exacerbated police staffing issues, as many officers are reservists. Municipal and state police departments are generally reluctant to allow officers to participate in international police service. The United States faces challenges in recruiting high-quality police officers for international missions due to reluctance from municipal and state police departments to allow their best officers to take extended leaves. Suggestions include providing compensation to governments for detailing officers to missions and recruiting formed police units instead of individual officers to improve cohesion within the U.S. police contingent. The U.S. faces challenges in recruiting quality police officers for international missions due to reluctance from local departments. Some analysts argue that U.S. selection criteria do not accurately reflect mission requirements, leading to a varied mix within UNCIVPOL forces. Criteria include U.S. citizenship, work experience, unblemished record, valid driver's license, physical and psychological tests, and English proficiency. The Department of State aims to address these issues. The Department of State is improving recruitment for specialized skills in international police missions. The new CivPol cadre program aims to address the problem of recruiting high-quality personnel by including specialists and requiring specific qualifications such as interpersonal skills, leadership, and knowledge of international police standards. The CivPol cadre program bid solicitation emphasizes the need for individuals with specialized skills in areas such as interpersonal, leadership, training, and negotiation skills. Training on policing skills recognized in the United States is offered to incentivize high-quality officers to join the program. However, the availability of funding for training all members of the program is uncertain. The new CivPol program's cadre lists are unclear, with training for U.S. CivPols facing challenges due to varying levels of skills among recruited officers. The current pre-deployment training includes topics like UN operations and civil-military relations. The new CivPol program's training includes topics such as mission overview, U.S. military in peace operations, team building, human rights, and personal safety. The training curriculum aims to meet Police Officer Standards and Training certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing. The new CivPol program includes training on policing skills, human rights, and certification from U.S. and foreign law enforcement organizations. There are concerns about potential higher training costs due to increased trainees and facilities. The U.S. CivPol contingent can deploy to a U.N. operation within 30-45 days, meeting deployment requirements but falling short of proposed legislation expectations. The United States meets deployment requirements for the CivPol program but may struggle to maintain current capabilities under the new system. A contractor will maintain a database of equipment sources and provide logistical support to potentially decrease deployment time and enhance operational capabilities. The United States may face challenges in maintaining current capabilities under the new CivPol program. European countries typically deploy police from their national forces for international missions, with the exception of the United Kingdom. European governments have been working on reforming their deployment systems for years. European governments, as major contributors to U.N. and European-sponsored police missions, have recognized the importance of reforming their deployment systems to improve international CivPol capabilities. The EU has set goals to enhance the quality and timeliness of European contributions to police missions, including developing a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for international peace operations by 2003. This effort is part of the European Security and Defense Policy adopted in 1999. The European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) adopted in 1999 aims to enhance police capabilities for international peace operations. The G\u00c3\u00b6teborg European Council established a Police Action Plan in 2001, setting guidelines for selection, training, and command of police forces. The EU's Rapid Reaction Mechanism provides funding for civilian crisis management operations, with Member States committing up to 5,000 police officers, including 1,400 for rapid deployment within 30 days. The EU's ESDP aims to enhance police capabilities for international peace operations. Member States commit up to 5,000 police officers for crisis management, with 1,400 available for rapid deployment within 30 days. Additionally, there are commitments for rapidly deployable police units and headquarters units. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2003 to establish sustainable policing arrangements. The EU launched its second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 200 police and civilian personnel. The mission has an annual budget of US $18.6 million and all EU Member States, except Portugal, are participating. Analysts are skeptical about the reformed EU crisis management capabilities. The EU launched a police mission in Macedonia with 200 personnel and an $18.6 million budget. Analysts are skeptical about the EU's crisis management capabilities. The OSCE has 160 CivPols in eight countries and created REACT teams in 1999. The OSCE established the Rapid Expert Assistance and Cooperation Teams (REACT) program at the Istanbul Summit in 1999. The program aims to deploy experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions within two to eight weeks. Participating States can create their own database of qualified civilian experts, including CivPols, to promote security in various areas such as human rights, rule of law, and economic stabilization. The OSCE's REACT program aims to deploy experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions within two to eight weeks. Participating States have taken steps to implement and improve the program, including creating national websites to recruit personnel and providing mechanisms to receive applications. Some States have provided numerical commitments in specific fields of expertise, while others prefer not to nominate individuals until specific field requirements are known. The OSCE has developed a framework of standards for the program. The OSCE has developed a staffing matrix to assist participating States in recruiting qualified candidates for its activities, including CivPols with specific requirements such as police training, experience, English communication, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. These requirements are similar but not identical to U.N. and U.S. standards. The OSCE recruits CivPols with specific requirements such as police training, English communication, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. They also seek law enforcement administrators with relevant experience and expertise. Legislation has been introduced to strengthen U.S. and international CivPol capabilities. H.R. 2616 and S. 2127 aim to enhance U.S. and NATO capabilities for post-conflict stabilization. Analysts suggest options to improve training and constabulary functions. H.R. 1414 proposes reforms for UNCIVPOL to be more effective and rapidly deployable. The bill introduced in 2003 aims to reform UNCIVPOL by proposing the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps for rapid deployment to peace operations within 15 days of authorization. It does not define specific arrangements but emphasizes the need for law enforcement professionals in the corps. The bill introduced in 2003 proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps for rapid deployment to peace operations with appropriate resources and staffing, including law enforcement professionals. The bill introduced in 2003 proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps for rapid deployment to peace operations with appropriate resources and staffing, including law enforcement professionals. The bill aims to address issues such as the deployment gap and enforcement gap by establishing standards and training programs for international civilian police within the United Nations. This initiative is seen as a way to allow the United Nations to take responsibility more quickly and effectively for maintaining a secure environment. The bill introduced in 2003 proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps for rapid deployment to peace operations. It aims to reduce the need for combat soldiers in civilian police tasks, raise standards of personnel, and make them more accountable. Opponents fear the establishment of a costly standing corps, while funding concerns exist regarding assessed contributions or voluntary funding. Many analysts express concerns about the sustainability of funding for a permanent United Nations civilian police corps, as it is currently funded through voluntary contributions. There are also worries about the United Nations' limited management capacity in administering such a corps and potential infringement on national sovereignty. H.R. 2616, the Winning the Peace Act of 2003, aims to enhance U.S. and NATO capabilities for reconstruction assistance in post-conflict situations. H.R. 2616, the Winning the Peace Act of 2003, introduced by Representatives Farr, Wolf, Hoeffel, Leach, and Wexler on June 26, 2003, proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations and upgrade the current U.S. CivPol system. The reserve would serve as an interim police force overseas and train indigenous civilian police forces. Congress would call upon the President to establish a task force comprised of federal, state, and local law enforcement through Section 8 of the bill. The Winning the Peace Act of 2003 proposes the establishment of a civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations. It calls for a new NATO mechanism to provide military and policing services, with selected NATO units trained and equipped for security in reconstruction situations. The bill authorizes the President to commit personnel capable of serving as a police force in support component. The Winning the Peace Act of 2003 proposes a civilian police reserve to support post-conflict security. The bill specifies tasks for selected units, including constabulary skills and policing tasks. Proponents argue it would enhance international capabilities for post-conflict reconstruction. The Winning the Peace Act of 2003 proposes a civilian police reserve to expedite the deployment of U.S. civilian police. There is debate over whether to establish a civilian police reserve in line with the State Department's private sector model or a new U.S. government reserve force. Proponents of the private contractor model argue for quicker response times and avoiding new government bureaucracies, while opponents raise concerns about dedication and limitations similar to those in military operations. Commercial contractors in military operations may also apply to policing operations. Some opponents of a government-sponsored reserve might concede that a federal agency could deploy a reserve CivPol force as efficiently as a private contractor, but only if civilian law enforcement personnel were maintained as paid reservists. Proponents argue that a government reserve is a more potent symbol of U.S. commitment, more responsive to U.S. policy, and might prove a more cohesive force than a privately-contracted force. Additionally, its members would be more accountable. Some argue that a government agency could better guarantee the quality of recruits for a government-sponsored reserve force. It might be easier to draw qualified CivPol personnel from local and state police departments under a federal reserve model. The desirability of pre-deployment training could influence judgments regarding the relative merits of a government-sponsored vs. a government-contracted reserve force. The debate surrounds the effectiveness of a government-sponsored reserve force compared to a government-contracted one, with a focus on training and coordination with military forces. There are questions about NATO's role in providing policing functions in post-conflict situations, with concerns about using military forces for such tasks. Many analysts argue that using military forces for policing functions may send inappropriate signals to civil authorities and the local population. Critics also suggest that creating a reserve within NATO could duplicate current EU structures and strain US-European relations. Some argue for additional provisions on equipment, training, and coordination with the military to avoid delays in deployment and perpetuate policing style conformity. Critics argue that creating police reserves without standardized training could perpetuate lack of conformity in policing styles, leading to problems in future operations. Some are skeptical of the need for such forces and the commitment of U.S. police officers to them. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 (S. 2127) was introduced to strengthen civilian rule of law and capabilities. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 (S. 2127) aims to reorganize government structures to enhance the capacity of civilian foreign affairs agencies in responding to overseas crises. It proposes to allocate $80 million to hire personnel for a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve, consisting of State Department and USAID employees, as well as non-government personnel, trained specifically for missions. Within three years, 10% of State Department and USAID personnel would be designated for this purpose. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 proposes to allocate $80 million to hire personnel for a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve, trained specifically for missions. Within three years, 10% of State Department and USAID personnel would be designated for this purpose. The bill aims to improve the training and professionalization of CivPol personnel. Increased and improved training, especially in basic functions, and professionalization of existing CivPol personnel could help bridge the deployment gap. Pre-deployment training has not kept pace with the increasing scope and mandate of police missions. Training adjustments were made in the field on a case-by-case basis in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor. PDD-71 proposed maintaining the capacity to provide tailored training packages to CivPol when requested, with appropriate funding. Some analysts argue for increased police training as desirable. Increased police training is recommended to bridge the deployment gap, with a proposal for U.S. training of foreign police personnel pending decision. Funding availability will determine the program's content and scope. Another option is to enhance international constabulary capabilities in nations with existing forces and establish new capabilities in others. The strengthening of international constabulary capabilities involves creating new units in nations without them and enhancing existing forces. Constabulary police handle tasks requiring more force than routine law enforcement but less than combat, such as regulating movements for safety, intervening in civil violence, and dispersing public disturbances. Constabulary forces, less heavily armed than combat soldiers, are trained in military and policing skills. They are essential for handling hostile situations in post-conflict areas. When deployed on peacekeeping missions, they have their own communication and logistical support and can deploy rapidly as formed units. Analysts suggest establishing specialized paramilitary units for constabulary tasks in peacekeeping operations. Several countries have specialized paramilitary police units trained as constabulary forces for peacekeeping operations, such as the Italian carabinieri, French gendarmerie, and Spanish Guardia Civil. Analysts suggest that the U.S. army should develop its own active duty constabulary force to augment military police in high deployment rates during peacekeeping missions. The U.S. army faces shortages in peacekeeping deployments due to much of its capability residing in the reserve. Army leaders have resisted structuring the service for peacekeeping, but analysts question the effectiveness of military forces that do not establish conditions for durable peace. Proponents argue for adaptable forces capable of security tasks in various conflict environments. Constabulary forces can serve as an intermediary security force for peace operations, reducing the need for combat soldiers in policing activities. Despite potential advantages, it is uncertain if other countries would enhance their constabulary capabilities for deployment abroad. Some analysts suggest developing a \"U.S. Force for Stability\" to address the gap in peace operations by creating rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel for sustainable security. This includes deploying a range of rule of law professionals such as judges, prosecutors, and prison personnel. The United States currently deploys personnel with justice and corrections experience through Department of Justice contracts. The United States deploys personnel with experience in justice and corrections systems through Department of Justice contracts, funded by the State Department's INL CivPol program. Analysts suggest creating a \"U.S. force for stability\" by integrating military and civilian personnel. Robert S. Perito proposes a comprehensive plan for this in a book published by the United States Institute for Peace. Proposal for integrating military and civilian personnel to form a \"U.S. force for stability\" that would be part of U.S. intervention forces. The force would consist of robust military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals, deploying concurrently to provide security from the outset and bridge deployment gaps. The proposal suggests integrating military and civilian personnel to form a \"U.S. force for stability\" that would provide security from the outset. Civilian personnel would take over law enforcement functions once security conditions permit, with military shifting to perimeter security after major combat operations. Constabulary units would handle internal security, while civilian police and justice experts would maintain public safety and restore the rule of law. The proposal suggests integrating military and civilian personnel to form a \"U.S. force for stability\" that would provide security from the outset. Justice experts ensure the restoration of the rule of law as personnel shifts from military to civilian control. Recommendations include the concurrent deployment of civilian personnel with combat forces to expedite nation-building responsibilities transfer. The proposal recommends creating a standing interagency stabilization and reconstruction team within the government, along with an \"on-call\" civilian crisis management corps. A report suggests establishing an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State, responsible for preparing and managing a Civilian Stability Operations Corps and Reserve for rapid deployment. Proponents argue that a \"stability force\" model has many advantages. Proponents of a \"stability force\" model advocate for the early deployment of rule of law personnel to enhance security and promote long-term stability and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries. This model could allow for the earlier withdrawal of military personnel, but would require significant changes in current U.S. practices, including the development of constabulary capabilities and the recruitment of police personnel by a new federal agency. The proposed stability force model suggests early deployment of rule of law personnel for security and stability in post-conflict countries. A new federal agency would recruit police personnel instead of using contractors. This approach may be controversial due to restructuring military forces and deployment methods. The proposed stability force model suggests early deployment of rule of law personnel for security and stability in post-conflict countries. Perito favors federalizing the CivPol component of the stability force instead of hiring through private contractors. Personnel hired through a federal employment process may be less quickly deployable than those under a reserve system. Rapid deployment availability depends on recruitment arrangements. Enforcement and rule of law personnel are required to deploy immediately when called, with benefits similar to U.S. military reserve members. Sources include Peacekeeping Fact Sheets from the U.N.

The dispatch of international police units to advise and train local forces dates back to the late 1800s. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping occurred in 1960. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping occurred in 1960 with the U.N. Operation in the Congo, followed by deployments in West New Guinea and Cyprus. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping occurred in 1960 with the U.N. Operation in the Congo. UNFICYP CivPols assisted Cypriot police in maintaining order and providing security in sensitive areas to diffuse tensions. Post-cold war operations focused on monitoring local police performance from 1989 to 1992 in Namibia and Western Sahara. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia and the U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Southwest Sahara (MINURSO) were established to monitor electoral processes and carry out referendums for independence. UN civilian police missions focused on accompanying local police, investigating complaints, and supervising investigations. The United Nations established MINURSO in Southwest Sahara to conduct a referendum on the former Spanish colony's future status, which has been delayed due to opposition from Morocco. Other UN missions in Angola and Cambodia had monitoring mandates in challenging situations post-peace accords. Additional functions were occasionally deemed necessary in these missions. In the Balkans, UN Protection Force peacekeeping operations deployed police monitors to new states formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia. The UN deployed CivPols to Yugoslavia in 1992 for monitoring functions, but their missions were overwhelmed by armed conflict due to inadequate mandate and insufficient forces. UNTAC in Cambodia had a monitoring mandate but little impact on police operations, leading to a shift towards investigating violations of political liberties and human rights. The UN deployed CivPols to Cambodia in 1993 to investigate violations of political liberties and human rights. The UNTAC operation faced challenges due to slow deployment and inadequate police numbers, hindering its effectiveness. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia initially focused on ensuring law and order but had to adjust to monitoring elections due to inadequate police numbers. Limited training was provided for Cambodian police and judiciary, with some civil police conducting makeshift training using their own manuals. The lack of resources led to the concept of an \"institution gap\" as UNTAC police were unable to promote justice effectively. The UNTAC operation in Cambodia faced challenges due to the lack of an independent judicial system, leading to the concept of an \"institution gap.\" Analysts proposed deploying integrated \"justice packages\" to address this issue. Police reform became crucial during the U.N. Observer Mission in El Salvador, with efforts to put internal security forces under civilian control. The international community provided extensive support for police reform in El Salvador following the peace accords of January 1992, which ended the civil war. This included assistance in creating a new National Civilian Police force and reforming the judicial system. The international community supported police reform in El Salvador after the peace accords of January 1992, assisting in creating a new National Civilian Police force. ONUSAL oversaw the formation of the new police academy and force, with UNDP managing international contributions for training. The establishment of a new police force in El Salvador after the peace accords of January 1992 was supported by contributions from Spain, Norway, Sweden, the United States, and Chile. Despite encountering significant problems, the success of the new police force was seen as crucial for the country's reconciliation and democratization processes. Analysts noted that while the success convinced contributing governments of the importance of civilian police deployment in peacekeeping operations, it was overshadowed by high crime rates and military interference. Subsequent missions in other countries also focused on training and reform mandates. Subsequent missions in the next few years had training and reform mandates. The Mozambique civilian police operation, authorized in February 1994, had a monitoring mission with a small training assistance component. ONUMOZ was a precursor to later training and police reform missions, focusing on reorganization and retraining of the Quick Reaction Police. International support for Mozambique's police continued after the formal UN operations with follow-up police reform programs conducted for several years. International support for police reform in Mozambique continued after the formal UN operations, with bilateral training programs, particularly by the Spanish Guardia Civil. Similar efforts were seen in Somalia and Haiti, initiated as U.S. operations, to establish security forces and restore order in the aftermath of political turmoil. In Somalia, UNITAF established an interim Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) to enforce local laws and be controlled by the community, aiming to reduce friction with the local population and minimize casualties. The ASF operated in 17 cities and towns, freeing UNITAF troops for other duties and enabling Somalis to address ordinary criminal activity. UNITAF supported the Somali police to act independently, with allied military forces as backup. The UNDP funded salaries, equipment, and experts from Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany to assist in establishing the new police force. The UNDP, UNITAF, and other international organizations provided support to establish and equip the new Somali police force. Italian, Dutch, and German police experts collaborated with the force, while UNITAF military forces from various countries offered training, weapons, and conducted joint patrols. The World Food Program supplied food rations for ASF members and their families. UNOSOM II took over from UNITAF in May 1993 when the ASF was operating in Mogadishu and 17 other cities and towns, establishing itself as a credible and popular police force. In December 1993, the U.N. announced plans to re-establish a 10,000 member Somali police force by the end of 1994. However, despite ambitious efforts to reconstruct the police, courts, and prisons, the U.N. faced challenges due to inadequate staffing and funding. It took nearly a year for the UNCIVPOL to arrive after UNITAF departed, and cultural differences among them hindered the development of a coherent program. The UNOSOM II military forces collaborated with the U.S. Justice Department's ICITAP during this period. The UNOSOMII military forces collaborated with the U.S. Justice Department's ICITAP to develop basic police courses for Somali police officers. However, the programs collapsed amid escalating violence and insecurity, leading to ICITAP's withdrawal in June 1994. The UNCIVPOLs left in March 1995 with the forced U.N. withdrawal. The UNITAF ASF achieved some success in providing police forces that offered protection to citizens, but by the end of the 1990s, there was a need for further development and reform of existing police forces. The need for development and reform of police institutions was recognized by the end of the 1990s. The Brahimi Panel Report in August 2000 recommended a shift in the use of civilian personnel in peace operations, focusing on building local police capacity. UNOSOM II's lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs led to the concept of an \"enforcement gap\" in Somalia and Haiti, where a sufficient police force may not be able to control outbreaks of violence. In post-conflict situations, military force may be necessary to maintain law and order when police forces are insufficient. The Somalia operation highlighted issues with international civilian police forces, lack of effective cease-fires, and the need for political settlements to support peace efforts. In post-conflict situations, military force may be necessary to maintain law and order when police forces are insufficient. The Somalia operation highlighted issues with international civilian police forces, lack of effective cease-fires, and the need for political settlements to support peace efforts. Particularly well-suited for training local police, an \"institutional\" gap and lack of a political settlement can undermine police reform efforts in the long run. Similar gaps were seen in Haiti, where U.S. and U.N. police reform efforts faced challenges due to institutional gaps. The U.S.-led Multilateral Force (MFN) initiated police reform in Haiti, forming the International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) to develop and train a new Haitian national police force. The IPM vetted former members of Haiti's armed forces to select those fit for an interim public security force. IPM supervised the force, allowing members to carry arms, use force, and make arrests. The subsequent UNCIVPOL under UNMIH took over monitoring and training functions. Three U.N. follow-on missions continued professionalizing the Haitian police over the next five years. Analysts noted coordination between military, MNF, and UNMIH civilian police to establish public security while HNP was trained and deployed. The U.S. adjusted MFN rules of engagement when IPMs were slow to deploy with sufficient strength and organization. The United States adjusted MFN rules of engagement to allow military forces to detain and shoot criminals in Haiti. MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training to IPMs on basic policing tasks. The transition from the U.S.-led MNF to the UN operation in Haiti was smooth, with UNMIH military forces helping bridge the law enforcement gap. The transition from the U.S.-led MNF to the UN operation in Haiti was smooth, with UNMIH military forces bridging the law enforcement gap by providing rapid backup to UNCIVPOL and monitoring HNP performance. Despite efforts to compensate for deployment gaps, the overcrowded prisons and corrupt judicial system hindered public security establishment. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002 under the mandate of the December 1995 Dayton Accords. This assistance included monitoring and training through the International Police Task Force (IPTF) to support the joint government established to end the conflict among Bosnia's three competing populations. The United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance in Bosnia from 1995-2002 under the mandate of the December 1995 Dayton Accords. This included monitoring, advising, training, and facilitating law enforcement activities through the International Police Task Force (IPTF). In January 2003, the European Union took over responsibility for monitoring and training police in Bosnia through the EU Police Mission. The European Union took over monitoring and training police in Bosnia through the EU Police Mission (EUPM) after the United Nations' International Police Task Force (IPTF) proved inadequate in ensuring public order among hostile groups. Concerns about the IPTF's effectiveness were raised during the Dayton negotiations, with calls for a stronger mandate and a policing function for the NATO peacekeeping Implementation Force (IFOR). Several analysts point to the early 1996 transfer of control of certain areas of Sarajevo, with the relocation of many residents when only a few hundred IPTF personnel had been deployed. IFOR provided assistance to the IPTF, helping to plan the operation and compensate for the slow deployment of personnel. Despite only one death during the relocation, the gutting, burning, and booby-trapping of dwellings highlighted an \"enforcement gap\" as IPTF lacked authority and resources to act. IFOR also refused to act in a law enforcement capacity. The IPTF faced challenges in maintaining public order in Bosnia due to a lack of resources and law enforcement powers. IFOR's refusal to act in a law enforcement capacity led to a flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs, resulting in a perception of U.N. failure. The IPTF struggled to recover from this setback, leading to a loss of credibility and difficulty in gaining popular confidence. SFOR eventually replaced IFOR in late 1996, providing backup support to the IPTF when needed. Specialized units within the IPTF, including paramilitary forces, were developed to address the enforcement gap in Bosnia. The development of specialized units within the IPTF, known as paramilitary forces, aimed to address the \"enforcement gap\" in Bosnia. Foreign paramilitary-like police units from France, Italy, and Spain were integrated into international CivPols in the late 1990s to bridge the gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors. The Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia in 1998 to protect elected officials. The Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia in 1998 to protect elected officials and those returning to hostile areas. This successful experience led to the formation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor. In 1999, the mandates and powers of international civilian police were expanded in Kosovo and East Timor, granting them executive authority powers. After the coalition air war against Serbia, NATO and the United Nations took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo and providing security through KFOR and UNMIK. The OSCE oversaw and trained the Kosovo Police Service. In East Timor, UNTAET provided civil administration from October 1999. In East Timor, the U.N. Transitional Administration provided civil administration from October 1999 as the region transitioned to self-government. A security vacuum was avoided with the mandate for U.N. forces and the Australian-led peacekeeping force. The exercise of executive authority is seen as problematic in future situations by many analysts and practitioners. The exercise of executive authority in future situations is seen as highly problematic and unlikely to be a wise choice by many analysts and practitioners. The availability of international civilian police personnel capable of responsibly exercising such authority is limited, making recruitment and deployment difficult. Sovereignty considerations will also play a significant role in decision-making regarding executive policing."
