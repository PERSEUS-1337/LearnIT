Recent works focus on studying the semantics of the latent space to improve control over the generative process. A new method is proposed in this paper to enhance interpretability by finding meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control over properties of generated images. The method is weakly supervised and suitable for encoding simple transformations in the generated image. Our method enhances control over properties of generated images by finding meaningful directions in the latent space, particularly for simple transformations like translation, zoom, or color variations. It is well-suited for generative models like GANs and variational auto-encoders, allowing for both qualitative and quantitative demonstration of effectiveness. The increasing use of generative models for tasks like image in-painting and deep-fakes highlights the need for more control over generated images. Generative models aim to improve by allowing users to specify properties of generated images. Modifying attributes can be done by adding a learned vector to the latent code or combining latent codes of two images. Understanding the latent space structure provides insights into generative models, which are valuable for learning unsupervised data representations. Images are influenced by underlying factors like object presence and relative positions. Images are influenced by underlying factors like object presence and relative positions, which can be categorized as modal or continuous factors of variation. Modal factors are discrete values while continuous factors are expressed in a range of values. Describing images using factors of variation is an efficient representation of natural images, as seen in studies by Berg et al. (2012) and Krishna et al. (2016). In this paper, a method is proposed to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over specific continuous factors of variations in image generation. Previous works mainly focused on semantic labeled attributes, while this method aims to tackle continuous factors of variation. Our method allows for precise control over specific continuous factors of variation in image generation, such as vertical position, horizontal position, and scale. It does not require a labeled dataset or encoder model and can be adapted to other variations like rotations, brightness, and color changes. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of controlling generative processes quantitatively and qualitatively, revealing insights about the latent space structure. Our method proposes a novel approach to finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, allowing for precise control over generated images. We introduce a reconstruction loss for inverting generative models and discuss the challenges of optimization in this process. Additionally, we explore the impact of disentanglement on controlling generative models, highlighting the ease of modifying image properties compared to obtaining descriptive labels. It is easier to modify image properties than to obtain descriptive labels. By determining the latent code of a transformed image, we can find the direction in the latent space corresponding to the transformation. This method allows for precise control over generated images in generative models. Given an image I \u2208 I, we aim to find its latent code \u1e91 that minimizes a reconstruction error L between I and \u00ce = G(\u1e91). The choice of the reconstruction error L is crucial in this optimization problem, with the pixel-wise Mean Squared Error being commonly used in the literature. However, optimizing this problem can lead to solutions in regions of low likelihood, causing the reconstructed image \u00ce = G(\u1e91) to appear unrealistic. The choice of the reconstruction error L is crucial in optimizing the problem of finding the latent code for an image. Commonly used pixel-wise Mean Squared Error can lead to blurry images, prompting the exploration of alternative reconstruction errors. These alternatives, however, are computationally expensive. The poor performance of MSE is attributed to favoring the expected value solution, which can be further studied by analyzing its effect on images in the frequency domain. The text discusses the limitations of using Mean Squared Error (MSE) for image reconstruction, particularly in the frequency domain. It explains how the MSE's focus on pixel-wise errors leads to blurry textures in generated images. By reducing the weight of high frequencies in the loss function, sharper results can be achieved. Reducing the weight of high frequencies in the loss function can lead to sharper results in image reconstruction. This approach allows for a larger range of possibilities for generated images with more details and realistic textures. The proposed loss function is compared qualitatively and quantitatively to other methods, such as the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) by Zhang et al. (2018). The optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) can be solved using this approach. The optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) can be solved through an optimization problem involving a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to a transformation T in the pixel space. The transformation is parametrized by a parameter \u03b4t controlling the degree of transformation. The optimization problem involves finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) using a dataset of trajectories in the latent space for a transformation T in pixel space. Zhu et al. (2016) proposed using an auxiliary network to estimate z T for initialization due to the difficulty of the problem. Training a specific network for initialization is costly, and the highly curved nature of the manifold of natural images in pixel space complicates the problem. The optimization problem involves finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) using trajectories in the latent space for a transformation T in pixel space. To address the highly curved nature of the manifold of natural images, the transformation T T is decomposed into smaller transformations and solved sequentially. This approach does not require extra training and can be used directly without training a new model. To address challenges in generating images with transformations, we discard outliers by removing latent codes with high reconstruction errors. This process is outlined in Algorithm 1 for generating trajectories in the latent space. After discarding outliers with high reconstruction errors, Algorithm 1 is used to generate trajectories in the latent space. A model is then defined to encode factors of variations in the latent space, where the parameter t of a factor can be predicted from the latent code coordinate along an axis u. The distribution of parameter t in a model is represented by a function g( z, u ) where z follows a normal distribution and u is a trainable parameter. The model uses piece-wise linear functions for g \u03b8 and solves the issue of training without direct access to t. The method involves modeling \u03b4t instead of t to estimate u and \u03b8 by minimizing the MSE between \u03b4t and f(\u03b8,u) on a dataset produced by Algorithm 1. This allows control over the distribution of images generated by G and the ability to sample images based on a chosen distribution. The experiments were conducted on two datasets: dSprites, consisting of binary images with varying shapes, and ILSVRC, containing natural images from different categories. The implementation was done using TensorFlow 2.0 and a BigGAN model. The results show control over the distribution of generative model outputs and potential bias detection in training datasets. The study implemented a BigGAN model using TensorFlow 2.0 for image generation. The model takes a latent vector and a one-hot vector as inputs, with the latent vector split into six parts for different scale levels. Conditional Batch Normalization layers were used to modify the style of generated images. Additionally, \u03b2-VAEs were trained to study disentanglement importance in generation control. Training was done on dSprites dataset with an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps and a batch size of 128 images. The study focused on evaluating the effectiveness of their method on complex datasets, specifically analyzing position and scale variations. Saliency detection was used to estimate position in natural images generated by BigGAN, while scale was evaluated based on the proportion of salient features. The study evaluated saliency detection using a model by Hou et al. (2016) in PyTorch. Evaluation involved generating images with varying factors of variation and estimating their real values. Jahanian et al. (2019) proposed an alternative method using an object detector for quantitative evaluation. The proposed approach is more generic and allows for precise control of object position and scale in selected ILSVRC categories. A common direction was learned from merged datasets, showing shared factors of variations across all categories. The proposed approach allows for precise control of object position and scale in selected ILSVRC categories. Shared factors of variations across all categories are shown in Figure 2. Qualitative results are presented in Figure 3. BigGAN uses hierarchical latent code split into six parts, with spatial factors mainly encoded in the first part. Level 5 contributes more to y position than x position and scale, as shown in Figure 4. The latent code controls object position and scale in ILSVRC categories. Level 5 has a higher contribution to y position than x position and scale. Results show the impact of geometric transformations on object detection. The study tested the effect of disentanglement on method performance by training \u03b2-VAE on dSprites with different \u03b2 values. Results showed that higher \u03b2 values led to better control of object position in generated images.\u03b2-VAE with more disentangled latent spaces produced more precise results. The study focused on the impact of disentanglement on method performance by training \u03b2-VAE on dSprites with varying \u03b2 values. Results indicated that higher \u03b2 values resulted in improved control over object position in generated images. This highlights the importance of disentangled representations for controlling the generative process in models like GANs and auto-encoders. Our method does not require labeled datasets or explicit model design for controlling image generation. Unlike VAE and InfoGan, we show that it is possible to find meaningful directions in generative models without changing the learning process. Our approach focuses on finding meaningful directions in generative models without altering the learning process, specifically in the latent space. We introduce a procedure to determine the latent representation of an image without the need for an encoder, different from previous works that invert the generator of a GAN to find the latent code of an image. Inverting the generator of a GAN to find the latent code of an image involves optimizing the latent code to minimize reconstruction error. Previous methods have shown success on simple datasets like MNIST and Omniglot, but struggle with more complex datasets like CelebA and ILSVRC. A new reconstruction loss introduced in Section 2.1.1 improves reconstruction quality significantly. The difficulty of inverting a generative model is theoretically justified, and the importance of vector space arithmetic in a latent space is highlighted by White (2016). In the context of generative models, White (2016) suggests using spherical interpolation to reduce blurriness in latent space arithmetic. A recent trend in research focuses on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, with similarities and differences to existing methods.

A recent trend in research focuses on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models. Brock et al. (2018) compare their method with another, highlighting differences in training procedures, evaluation methods, and the model of the latent space used. They also discuss the impact of disentangled representations on control and the structure of the latent space of BigGAN. In the context of generative models, a method is proposed to extract meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control over generative processes. This approach aims to interpret intuitive factors of variation, such as translation and scale, in the latent space of BigGAN. This advancement contributes to a better understanding of the representations learned by generative models. The Fourier transform of images is used to analyze the loss in generative models. By modeling the uncertainty of high frequency patterns as a phase variation, the contribution to the total loss depends on the magnitude of the frequencies. The \u03b2-VAE framework aims to discover interpretable latent representations in images without supervision. A simple convolutional VAE architecture was designed for experiments, generating 64x64 images with a decoder network using transposed convolutions. The optimization process of the total loss in generative models favors smoother images with fewer high frequencies. The architecture includes Convolution + ReLU and Dense + ReLU layers, with a final Transposed Convolution + Sigmoid layer. Results show good reconstruction with certain values of \u03c3, penalizing low frequencies for accuracy. Results show good reconstruction with certain values of \u03c3, penalizing low frequencies for accuracy. A comparison with classical Mean Square Error (MSE) and Structural dissimilarity (DSSIM) is illustrated, highlighting the accuracy of the reconstruction obtained with the proposed approach. Additionally, a quantitative evaluation of the performance was conducted on images from the ILSVRC dataset, showing promising results with a budget of 3000 iterations. The study selected one image per category from the ILSVRC dataset and reconstructed it using their method with 3000 iterations. Results showed that their reconstruction error produced images closer to the target image compared to MSE or DSSIM. The optimization problem of the natural image manifold was challenging due to curved walks in pixel-space for factors like translation or rotation. The trajectory of images undergoing common transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling is curved in pixel space. The PCA of resulting trajectories shows that for large translations, the shortest path between images is near orthogonal to the manifold. Rotation and scaling also pose similar challenges, unlike brightness changes which are linear in pixel-space. This presents optimization challenges during image transformation. During optimization of latent code, near orthogonality between the gradient of the reconstruction loss and the generated image can slow down or halt the process. This occurs when the direction of descent in pixel space is orthogonal to the manifold described by the generative model. For example, in an ideal GAN scenario, generating a small white circle may be affected by this issue. The text discusses how the optimization process can be slowed down or stopped if the gradient of the loss is orthogonal to the manifold. An example is given with an ideal GAN generating a small white circle, where moving the circle to the right may result in the gradient being zero. Additionally, qualitative examples are shown for different transformations and brightness levels using the BigGAN model. Qualitative examples of images generated with the BigGAN model for position, scale, and brightness are shown. The images' latent codes are sampled in a specific way, and categories are chosen to produce interesting results. Some categories may have issues controlling brightness due to the absence of dark images in the training data. The direction is learned for position and scale on ten categories, while only the top five categories are used for brightness."
