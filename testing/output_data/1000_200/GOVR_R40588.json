    "content": "In April 2009, a novel influenza virus emerged, initially called \"swine flu\" due to its genetic makeup. The World Health Organization later named it influenza A (H1N1) and explained how it can emerge through reassortment of swine, avian, and human flu viruses. This reassortment had not been seen in humans before. The currently circulating Influenza A (H1N1) virus is a reassortment of genes from swine, avian, and human origin, not previously seen in humans or swine. Its origin and when/where it happened are unknown. The virus, also known as H1N1, is now transmitted from human to human. It is slightly more lethal than seasonal flu but not as lethal as H5N1 avian influenza. Researchers are uncertain about its future virulence. The H1N1 virus, a unique influenza strain with gene segments from swine flu viruses, has spread enough to be classified as a pandemic. Cases were reported in California, Texas, and Mexico, prompting school closures and public event cancellations. WHO confirmed human cases in Canada and Spain with no deaths. On April 27, 2009, WHO reported human cases in Canada and Spain with no deaths. Two days later, the pandemic alert level was raised to Phase 5, indicating human-to-human spread in at least two countries. By June 11, 2009, the alert level was raised to Phase 6, the highest level. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the pandemic alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, due to the spread of the H1N1 virus. More than 50,000 human cases had been confirmed in over 80 countries with 231 deaths reported. The number of cases may be higher as it only reflects confirmed cases reported to WHO. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and WHO agree that there is no risk of contracting the H1N1 virus from well-cooked pork. WHO advises against travel restrictions as they would have little effect on stopping the virus. Most people with H1N1 experience flu-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment, which can help reduce symptoms and prevent severe illness. The WHO has found that antiviral drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective against the new strain of H1N1 virus. They have a global stockpile of oseltamivir to distribute to developing countries in need. The WHO is distributing 3 million adult treatment courses of antiviral drugs to developing countries affected by bird flu outbreaks. There is no available vaccine for the current strain of H1N1, but efforts are underway to develop one. Once developed, at least 1 to 2 billion vaccine doses could be produced annually, with donations from companies like Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline to help distribute to poor countries in need. GlaxoSmithKline plans to donate 50 million vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to poor countries. China quarantined Mexican nationals, leading to Mexico barring flights to China. Some countries have warned against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The European Union Health Commissioner urged Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. In 2009, the European Union Health Commissioner advised postponing nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The CDC recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico, later downgrading it to a \"travel health precaution.\" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano defended not closing U.S. borders with Mexico, citing minimal benefits and high costs. The focus shifted to mitigating the virus as it was already present throughout the United States. Closing U.S. borders could involve legal and logistical issues. Some countries have installed thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers for high body temperatures. Egypt ordered the slaughter of pigs to prevent H1N1 spread, and some countries banned pork imports from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. USAID established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team on May 1, 2009. USAID established the Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team on May 1, 2009, to coordinate the U.S. humanitarian response to H1N1 outbreaks in Latin America and the Caribbean. The United States has provided over $16 million for this effort, focusing on H1N1 specifically and building on previous pandemic preparedness efforts. Assistance includes commodity delivery and disease detection and surveillance, with support from CDC, USAID, and the Department of Defense. USAID announced on May 27, 2009, that it had donated 4,000 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits to Vietnam and 100 boxes of biodegradable powder to help animal health workers respond quickly to potential new outbreaks of avian or H1N1 influenza. The kits, valued at over $57,000, can be used in response to H5N1 bird flu or H1N1 outbreaks. CDC has been engaged in efforts to respond to H1N1 outbreaks since the virus was identified, creating reagents used to detect subtypes of influenza worldwide. CDC plays a crucial role in detecting and controlling influenza outbreaks globally. They provide testing kits to public health laboratories worldwide at no cost and send experts to strengthen laboratory capacity in affected countries. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced the distribution of 400,000 treatment courses to Mexico, with a total aim of 2 million courses in Latin America and the Caribbean. CDC has also deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala, including experts in influenza epidemiology, laboratory, health communications, and emergency operations. CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala, including experts in influenza epidemiology, laboratory, health communications, and emergency operations. They work under the WHO/Pan American Health Organization Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network to understand H1N1 transmission patterns and improve laboratory capacity. CDC also collaborates with other organizations globally for pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness efforts in over 50 countries by sending experts to work with WHO country offices or forming cooperative agreements with groups. USAID has provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, with a focus on advanced disease surveillance and control measures in Latin America and the Caribbean. This includes funding for animal surveillance efforts in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. USAID provided $6.1 million for international H1N1 assistance, including support for animal surveillance efforts in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. In May 2009, it distributed over 100,000 PPE kits valued at more than $1 million to protect first responders in the region. USAID also pre-positioned 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries in preparation for a possible influenza pandemic. Additionally, USAID conducted a pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia with stakeholders and national authorities from nine East African countries. Participants from nine East African countries met to establish coordination principles, develop a pandemic response action plan, and test existing ones through a simulation exercise. The exercises aimed to prepare for potential influenza pandemics and address cross-border population movements. USAID conducts pandemic preparedness exercises with national leaders to address potential issues with influenza outbreaks. They work with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in Africa and Asia, ensuring readiness for cooperation with civilian authorities during a pandemic. Joint exercises involve multiple countries and military representatives to enhance preparedness. In FY2005, Congress funded U.S. efforts for global pandemic influenza preparedness and response, totaling $949 million since then. The United States is the largest donor, supporting over 100 nations and jurisdictions in training health workers and preparing for potential pandemics. The United States is the largest single donor to global avian and pandemic preparedness efforts, providing $949 million for various activities including bilateral support, assistance to international organizations like WHO and UNICEF, regional programs, and a global contingency fund. The United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic preparedness efforts, including funding for disease detection sites, international assistance, research, stockpiles of supplies, and global communications. The United States has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic preparedness efforts, with contributions from various agencies. President Obama has also requested $1.5 billion in supplemental funding for domestic and international pandemic response activities. The bill allocated $50 million for USAID pandemic preparedness and $200 million to CDC for H1N1 activities. Infectious diseases cause over 25% of global deaths, with recent outbreaks like H5N1 and SARS raising concerns. The emergence of H1N1 highlights the threat of infectious diseases, with 75% originating from animals. Effective responses require a multidisciplinary approach. Effective responses to the threat of infectious diseases, including H1N1, require a multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholders from various sectors. Investments made by the United States and other international players have been applied to the global response to H1N1, with gains made in developing tests, treatments, and surveillance systems. Concerns remain about the capacity of poorer countries to monitor and respond to H1N1. Some health experts are concerned about poorer countries lacking capacity to monitor and respond to H1N1. Transmission of influenza viruses tends to accelerate in winter months, with countries in the Southern hemisphere beginning to report cases. Questions remain about potential gene changes and simultaneous outbreaks with H5N1 bird flu. Debate in May 2009 focused on whether WHO should maintain its pandemic phase system. WHO should maintain its pandemic influenza phase system, reflecting virus spread and transmission patterns, not severity. Some suggest developing an alert system based on severity, as public may not understand death risk at highest phase level. Critics warn of panic and disruptions if threat level raised to Phase 6. Despite concerns, WHO raised pandemic phase level to 6 on June 11, 2009, emphasizing no change in severity. Director General Margaret Chan emphasized that the shift in pandemic influenza phase by WHO did not indicate a change in severity. WHO also updated its pandemic preparedness guide, maintaining the six-phase structure but redefining them to better reflect pandemic risk. The guide outlines steps for governments to plan and prepare for epidemics. USAID announced a new five-year program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to develop a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that can infect humans. USAID announced a new five-year program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to develop a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin that can infect humans, such as SARS, H5N1, and HIV/AIDS. The program aims to establish a network of laboratories in Africa to improve diagnosis of new emergent pathogens. Concerns have been raised about the poor condition of laboratory and surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa, with South Africa being the only country to have confirmed cases of H1N1. Laboratory and surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa are in poor condition, reflecting limited public health capacity. CDC, USAID, and other international experts are working to improve these systems by providing H1N1 testing kits to laboratories in African countries. Access to treatments and vaccines in poor countries has been a debated issue, especially during the peak of HIV/AIDS transmission. Access to treatments and vaccines in poor countries has been a long-standing issue, highlighted during peak HIV/AIDS transmission and global outbreaks like H5N1 avian flu and H1N1. Concerns have been raised about affordability and hoarding of vaccines by wealthier countries, with USAID estimating that 30% of the world's population lacks regular access to medicines. WHO reports that over 90% of global influenza vaccine development capacity is in Europe and North America, leaving poorer regions at a disadvantage. The capacity to develop influenza vaccines is concentrated in Europe and North America, with richer countries holding most of the resources. Poorer countries rely on donor countries for access to treatments and vaccines. Concerns arise about hoarding of vaccines during a pandemic, as well as the ability of poorer countries to effectively administer mass vaccination campaigns. WHO expects national authorities to handle mass vaccination efforts, but some doubt the capability of countries with existing vaccination challenges. According to 2002 estimates, 1.4 million child deaths under five could have been prevented by routine vaccines, representing 14% of global child mortality. Health experts are concerned about the potential reassortment of H5N1 and H1N1 flu strains, leading to a new strain with human illness potential. Worries about H5N1 causing a pandemic arose in 2004 with the first human cases reported in Thailand and Viet Nam. In January 2004, Thailand and Viet Nam reported their first human cases of avian influenza H5N1, sparking concerns about a potential pandemic. By 2006, H5N1 outbreaks had affected eight Asian nations and spread to about 50 countries worldwide. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with Indonesia and Cambodia not reporting H1N1 cases. The disease has become endemic in Asia, and experts are monitoring for potential H1N1 outbreaks in countries with ongoing H5N1 cases. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with only Indonesia and Cambodia not reporting H1N1 cases. H5N1 bird flu is more deadly but less easily transmissible than H1N1. Most human deaths from H5N1 occur after direct contact with sick birds, while animals have not been identified as a source of transmission for H1N1."
