    "content": "The President's gravest decision is directing the use of nuclear weapons through Nuclear Command and Control (NC2). NC2 involves the President's authority over nuclear weapon operations, government activities, and multinational actions. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) supports the President and Unified Command Commanders in exercising this authority. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) includes facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel, and structure essential for nuclear weapon operations. It supports the President's authority over nuclear weapons operations and is part of Continuity of Government activities. Congress reviews Department of Defense's plans for sustaining and modernizing the NCCS. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is undergoing potential changes due to evolving threats, such as from China, North Korea, or Iran. Analysts suggest the need for robust NC2 but with a structure different from the Cold War era. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review advocates for non-nuclear responses and active defenses, which could lead to complex requirements. The current NCCS architecture, shaped by Cold War origins, may need to adapt to new challenges. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) faces potential changes due to evolving threats, with the 2001 NPR advocating for non-nuclear responses and active defenses. The NCCS, often misunderstood and receiving little attention, serves in secondary roles with equities in legacy systems. This report will discuss NCCS platforms, functions, current role in light of the 2001 NPR and 2006 QDR, issues, and proposed modernization initiatives. The NMCS, a priority component of the Global Command and Control System, forms the lead elements of the NCCS. The NMCS is the priority component of the Global Command and Control System, providing command and control of the armed forces to the National Command Authorities and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The NMCS includes the National Military Command Center (NMCC) as the primary location for national command and control on a day-to-day basis. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) is the primary location for national command and control on a day-to-day basis. It is staffed around-the-clock and led by a General or Admiral. The NMCC is responsible for monitoring nuclear forces and ongoing military operations. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) serves as a survivable airborne backup to the NMCC in case ground-based command centers are destroyed. The NAOC aircraft is always on alert and based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) is a backup to the NMCC, based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska. It includes modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft with hardened communications against EMP. USSTRATCOM provides personnel and administration, while the Air Force's Air Combat Command manages resources. Site-R in Maryland can serve as an alternate NMCC location, and the USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center at Offutt AFB can act as a backup for emergency actions. The USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) serves as a survivable airborne backup for the USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center. The ABNCPs are modified Boeing 707 aircraft with a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff personnel. Each battle staff is led by a General or Admiral. The USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) consists of a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff personnel led by a General or Admiral. The aircraft serves as the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) and Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) relay for Navy ballistic missile submarines, communicating directives through various systems. The USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) is supported by the Navy's Strategic Communications Wing One from Tinker AFB, Oklahoma. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is designed to provide advice and decision-making support to the President for strategic nuclear forces, including situation monitoring of military and political environments. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) includes Situation Monitoring and Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA) functions. Situation monitoring involves tracking strategic intelligence from classified and open sources, including weather conditions. TW/AA focuses on quickly detecting and analyzing potential attacks to verify missile launches and distinguish between false alarms and actual threats. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) relies on dual phenomenology to quickly verify missile launches and potential attacks. Decision making regarding the use of nuclear weapons involves consultation with senior commanders and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Connectivity between the President, advisors, and military personnel is crucial in shaping responses to potential threats. The President consults with advisors and nuclear commanders for decision-making. Force management involves data on nuclear deterrent readiness and alerting forces during a crisis. Force direction includes nuclear surety and positive control to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons. The National Military Command System ensures nuclear surety and positive control to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons. It must be survivable in extreme environments to fulfill its key attributes. The National Military Command System (NCCS) must be survivable, reliable, and secure. It needs to operate in extreme conditions, support rapid connectivity, and have security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access or interception of communications. The National Military Command System (NCCS) requires protection against jamming, interference, and hostile listening to maintain secure communication links between leadership and forces. Asymmetric capabilities like computer attacks pose additional security challenges. Nuclear command and control is central to the deterrence construct, as outlined in the DOD's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review mandated by Congress. This review includes assessing the role of nuclear forces in US military strategy, policy requirements for a credible nuclear deterrence posture, the relationship between deterrence policy, targeting strategy, and arms control objectives, and determining nuclear force levels and composition. On January 9, 2002, J.D. Crouch, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, briefed the public on the unclassified aspects of the NPR report, proposing changes in the multinational environment related to the United States nuclear deterrence posture, targeting strategy, arms control objectives, nuclear delivery systems, weapons complex, and stockpile. Assistant Secretary Crouch briefed on the need for changes in the U.S. nuclear deterrence posture due to evolving international relationships post-Cold War. The NPR highlighted the shift towards reduced dependence on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence and the emergence of new threats from WMD proliferation and ballistic missiles. DOD emphasized the need for a \"capabilities based approach\" to address these unpredictable threats. The NPR emphasized the need for a \"capabilities based approach\" to address new threats, focusing on a \"new triad\" of capabilities including offensive and defensive forces, and a responsive weapons infrastructure. Command, control, intelligence, and planning were central to this approach. The Administration emphasizes command and control in the new triad construct of the NPR, aiming to enhance precision, adaptability, and integration of nuclear and non-nuclear forces for improved deterrence and operational effectiveness. This focus on NC2 capabilities could lead to new systems initiatives. The NPR emphasizes command and control in the new triad construct, aiming to enhance precision, adaptability, and integration of nuclear and non-nuclear forces for improved deterrence and operational effectiveness. The Bush Administration and the Department of Defense have begun implementing the framework embodied in the 2001 NPR, with USSTRATCOM assuming responsibility for additional missions such as global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and C4ISR. Organizational changes continued in January 2005, with USSTRATCOM designated as the focal point for combating weapons of mass destruction. In January 2005, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld designated USSTRATCOM as the focal point for combating weapons of mass destruction. General James Cartwright established a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in September 2005, institutionalizing the post-Cold War environment view from the 2001 NPR. The Joint Staff was updating its \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" in 2005, with a focus on deterring and responding to the use of weapons of mass destruction. The new joint doctrine emphasizes deterring and responding to weapons of mass destruction, with a focus on crisis action planning and integration of nuclear and non-nuclear forces. Rapid crisis action planning is highlighted to address unanticipated WMD threats, reflecting a shift towards time-sensitive joint operations planning. The nuclear plan development process in combatant commands has traditionally been deliberate and time-consuming. To expedite this process during a crisis, there may be a need for enhanced computer workstation capabilities and communication networks at nuclear command centers. Networked collaborative planning systems, similar to those used in conventional military operations, are gradually being integrated into nuclear planning. Senior leaders are increasingly relying on bandwidth-intensive video-teleconferencing links for long-distance communication. Senior leaders are increasingly relying on bandwidth-intensive video-teleconferencing links for long-distance communication. Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to appoint a commission to review the implementation of the 2001 NPR, including the examination of NC2 requirements. The commission is required to submit its report to Congress by June 30, 2007. The commission appointed by the Secretary of Defense to review the implementation of the 2001 NPR is expected to submit its report to Congress by June 30, 2007. The NPR suggests using precision non-nuclear weapons to potentially reduce the need for nuclear weapons, but the presence of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal is likely to continue. The policy on nuclear weapons will influence the required command and control architecture. The nuclear command and control systems, established during the Cold War, may need to be reevaluated for their relevance in today's post-Cold War environment. Key installations like the NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex and USSTRATCOM underground command post were built to manage nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. As the Defense Department considers resource tradeoffs, the question arises whether this infrastructure is still suitable for current needs. The post-Cold War environment may require reevaluation of the nuclear command and control systems established during the Cold War. The threat of a \"decapitation attack\" targeting national and military leadership was a significant concern during the 1980s, as it could disrupt the lines of authority needed for a retaliation attack and potentially lead to a loss of political control over conflict escalation or termination. The nuclear command and control architecture needed upgrades in the 1980s to ensure government control of weapons. The threat of a strike from Russia has diminished since the Cold War, with arms reduction treaties between the US and Russia. The 2002 Treaty between Presidents Bush and Putin aimed to reduce deployed nuclear weapons. Despite the Cold War arms reduction, the question arises if the current command and control architecture is still justified in a changing global landscape, including potential nuclear threats from countries like China. The Chinese military is rapidly expanding, with a potential $90 billion budget in 2005 that could triple by 2025. They are acquiring more advanced systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM, capable of targeting the United States. General Zhu Chenghu threatened nuclear attacks on U.S. cities if they aid Taiwan. Analysts debate whether China poses a significant threat or if it is overstated. Kurt Campbell suggests that the relationship with China is not a clear confrontation like the Cold War. Cooperation characterizes the U.S. and European relationships with China, and the idea of a \"China threat\" may be exaggerated to justify military spending. An increasing Chinese nuclear capability could pose a survivability threat in the event of hostile relations or a diplomatic crisis. An increasing Chinese nuclear capability could pose a survivability threat to the nuclear command and control system, especially in the event of hostile relations or a diplomatic crisis. Rogue states like Iran and North Korea, pursuing nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology, also reinforce the need for a viable NC2 architecture. North Korea has actively sought a nuclear weapons capability since the 1960s, with potential assistance from A.Q. Khan. In 2005, North Korea claimed to possess nuclear weapons, but verification is challenging. North Korea's nuclear capabilities are difficult to verify, with estimates suggesting they may have up to ten bombs. They have various missile types, but it is unclear if they can attach nuclear warheads to them. Reliable information from inside the country is scarce, and post-Iraq criticisms have made experts hesitant to publicly estimate North Korea's nuclear programs. Some analysts believe North Korea's claims of possessing nuclear weapons may be deception efforts. The Iranian nuclear program presents challenges for threat analysts, with varying estimates on their timeline to acquire nuclear weapons. Some predict Iran could have a bomb within two years, while others suggest they may achieve capability by 2009. However, some analysts argue that Iran's nuclear fuel cycle research falls within their Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations. Iran's fuel cycle research and development, permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, has raised suspicions due to secrecy at nuclear sites like Natanz. Iran's testing of long-range missiles and alleged plans for nuclear weapon components have heightened concerns. Reports suggest a link between Iran's military explosives study and its civilian nuclear program. Iran's aggressive rhetoric towards Israel and the US adds to worries about its intentions. Iran's aggressive rhetoric towards Israel and the United States raises concerns about hostile Iranian intentions. Small nuclear arsenals could pose a threat to US infrastructure through an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generated by a high-altitude nuclear explosion. This could lead to widespread damage to electronic components, causing failures in critical infrastructure elements. The EMP Commission was chartered by Congress to assess the threat of an electromagnetic pulse attack on the United States. Some analysts suggest that China, North Korea, and Iran could use high altitude nuclear bursts to target critical infrastructure, potentially leading to catastrophic consequences. Experts suggest that North Korea and Iran may be developing nuclear and ballistic missile programs for an EMP attack. Recent missile tests indicate preparation for such a strategy, including launching missiles from freighters off the U.S. coast. There is also emerging technology for localized EMP bursts without nuclear detonation. However, some analysts are skeptical about the extent of the EMP threat, stating that military and commercial systems may withstand it with minimal effects. Some key military systems have EMP protection, and commercial systems can easily add it. The threat of a single EMP attack from a freighter off the U.S. coast may not cause catastrophic failures. The motivation for China to use EMP against the U.S. is unclear, but using it against U.S. forces aiding Taiwan is more conceivable. Some analysts believe North Korea's missile program has stalled due to lack of advanced technology sharing. It would be challenging for rogue states or terrorist groups to develop a nuclear EMP. The EMP Commission found a decline in EMP hardening and practice in the military since the 1990s. Congress directed the reestablishment of the EMP Commission to assess the vulnerability of military systems to EMP and progress in protecting them. This supports the need for capabilities to operate in an EMP environment, as seen in the nuclear command and control infrastructure during the Cold War. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review introduced new missions for the nuclear command and control system, including non-nuclear responses and active defenses. This poses challenges that require improvements in the command and control system to integrate nuclear offensive forces, non-nuclear offensive forces, and defensive forces. The system may need to expand to include additional participants in decision-making processes and may require additional capacity and speed to accommodate simultaneous participation in key conferences. The need for additional capacity and speed in the command and control system may arise due to new missions introduced in the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review. This includes non-nuclear responses and active defenses, which may require integrating nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, as well as defensive forces. The process for directing non-nuclear strikes, including conventional attacks and non-kinetic options, poses challenges such as determining \"release authority\" for these actions. The determination of \"release authority\" for non-nuclear or non-kinetic options poses challenges, as only the President can direct the release of nuclear weapons. While the President has the freedom to decide his level of involvement in military operations, they typically do not get involved in planning specific conventional missions, except for historic exceptions like Lyndon Johnson's personal selection of targets during the Vietnam War. The targets USSTRATCOM might respond to could be of strategic importance warranting Presidential attention. The targets that USSTRATCOM might respond to could have strategic importance or criticality that would warrant Presidential involvement. Requiring Presidential authorization for these strikes could pose operational challenges, especially when conventional weapons are mixed with nuclear weapons on the same platform. This complexity is highlighted by the DOD's proposal to include conventional Trident missiles on nuclear armed ballistic missile submarines. The DOD's recent proposal includes conventional Trident missiles on nuclear armed ballistic missile submarines, raising concerns about ensuring only conventional weapons are launched when ordered. Non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks are also worrisome, with some equating them to WMD strikes. There are calls for increased Presidential involvement and control, but technical solutions for enforcing this control have not been discussed. The need for detailed involvement and control in non-nuclear and non-kinetic responses is highlighted, with concerns about adding new participants to the command and control process. The merging of active defenses, like missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will require further adaptation and agreement on offensive and defensive responses. The merging of active defenses, particularly missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will require further adaptation and agreement on release authority. In some scenarios, a decision may be needed on what locations to defend, potentially requiring Presidential involvement. Analysts recommend delegating missile defense release authority to the unified combatant commander to prevent missing opportunities to stop incoming missiles. Choosing between defensive launches and offensive strikes will form the national response. The national response may involve choosing between defensive launches and offensive strikes, with Presidential consideration needed. Choreographing conversations for decision-making in limited time frames is vital. Including defensive responses in the decision-making process after detecting a potential attack will add participants with inputs to consider. Regional combatant commanders are currently envisioned to be involved in the process. The detection of a potential attack will add participants with inputs to consider in the short time frame before impact. Regional combatant commanders will have responsibility for defense in their area, involving multiple command centers. USSTRATCOM is tasked with leading missile defense, which must be linked to systems in regional combatant commands like USCENTCOM or USNORTHCOM. General Cartwright has directed personnel to ensure interoperable missile defense command and control systems with common technical standards. Bandwidth demands will increase as more participants are added to decision conferences for missile defense or non-nuclear offensive responses. The command and control system for missile defense and non-nuclear offensive responses must be able to present choices to the President in an easily understandable manner. It should facilitate the Commander-in-Chief's interactions with advisers and aid in decision-making within tight timelines without overwhelming him. The command and control system for nuclear operations must support the President's decision-making within tight timelines without overwhelming him. It should maintain tight Presidential control of nuclear weapons and ensure clear and actionable orders reach weapons operators. These systems can also be useful for non-nuclear military forces direction and status monitoring. Command and control systems are versatile national assets that support non-nuclear military forces direction and status monitoring. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) provides 24-hour monitoring of worldwide military operations, aids in crises and conflicts, and manages peacetime contingencies like natural disasters. Response cells or crisis action teams (CAT) are formed to prepare orders, monitor forces, and deliver briefings during developing situations. Command and control assets also supported mitigation and recovery activities after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, with organizations like NORAD and the NMCC coordinating the restoration of normal air traffic. The NORAD command center and NMCC played a crucial role in coordinating the restoration of air traffic after the 9/11 attacks. These assets are important for continuity of operations during domestic contingencies or natural disasters. President Bush utilized secure facilities like USSTRATCOM in Omaha and U.S. Northern Command to monitor and communicate during crises like Hurricane Rita in 2005. Nuclear command and control assets have various functions beyond military operations. Nuclear command and control assets, such as the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC), are utilized for supporting civil authorities during disasters. These systems offer versatile monitoring and communication capabilities valued by senior government leadership for day-to-day operations. The NMCC is conveniently located in the Pentagon for easy access by the Secretary of Defense. The NAOC and NMCC provide versatile monitoring and communication capabilities for senior government leadership. Using NC2 assets for missions beyond nuclear forces requires balancing tradeoffs and potential competition for access during crises. Tying these systems to other agency functions adds complexity to their continued viability. The viability of military systems may be challenged when they are no longer needed or when used for secondary roles, impacting readiness for primary missions. The changing threat landscape and recommendations from the Nuclear Posture Review raise questions about the requirements for today's systems. In 2001, a committee led by Brent Scowcroft conducted an \"End-to-End Review of the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System.\" The \"End-to-End Review of the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System\" was chaired by former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft. The commission examined the architecture from national command authority to individual weapons, focusing on authorized use, preventing unauthorized use, new technology, and potential threats. Findings included concerns about the degradation of system hardness due to lack of maintenance and procedural discipline since the Cold War. The DOD report recommended shifting NC2 system life cycle management to operators from the acquisition community. Operator requirements for new capabilities are often not supported in the new systems purchased by the acquisition community, leading to issues with multiple agencies involved in NC2 systems. The DOD report recommended transferring NC2 system life cycle management to operators from the acquisition community due to issues with unrealistic operator-generated requirements exceeding program budgets. Another concern is the decline in NC2 expertise since the end of the Cold War. The decline in nuclear forces has led to a decrease in expertise and prestige in the nuclear mission. This has resulted in a \"brain drain\" of skilled personnel, leading to a lack of depth in key NC2 positions. The legacy NC2 architecture may face challenges from the Defense Department's push for military transformation towards more network-oriented operations. US Strategic Command is also moving towards this direction. US Strategic Command is transitioning towards more network-oriented, distributed operations by establishing subordinate functional component commands dedicated to specific mission aspects. These multi-service organizations are geographically separated, promoting decentralization of activities away from headquarters. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review proposes changes in NC2 programs to facilitate USSTRATCOM's move to distributed command and control capabilities. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends retiring legacy mobile platforms like the E-4B NAOC aircraft and replacing them with C-32 aircraft. The USSTRATCOM MCCC would be retired in FY2007 as part of the transition to a distributed command and control architecture emphasizing survivability in the face of WMD, electronic, or cyber-warfare attacks. The new systems are also tailored for WMD elimination missions. The Department of Defense proposes tailored systems for WMD elimination missions, emphasizing survivability in the face of attacks. USSTRATCOM is exploring an IP-based communications architecture for linking distributed locations, but the high assurance of rapid message transmission needed for nuclear command and control is not yet proven with this technology. The communications bandwidth required for this infrastructure is already limited in the military. The military's communications bandwidth is already limited, with a significant increase in requirements over the past decade. The need for satellite communications has grown substantially since 9/11 and is expected to continue rising. The nuclear community will compete for command and control links, especially with a dispersed operations concept. Integration of new systems like missile defense into the network raises questions about certification and configuration management levels. The military faces challenges in managing communications bandwidth, especially with the increasing demand for satellite communications post-9/11. The nuclear command and control system requires upgrades and enhancements, with a focus on the Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN). Coordination and compatibility in a distributed architecture are crucial to avoid chaos and ensure clear chain of command. The procurement programs for NC2 systems in DOD's budget requests mainly involve upgrades rather than new systems. The MEECN, part of the nuclear command and control system, is being upgraded with $20.5 million for procurement and $57.3 million for R&D in FY2006. Congress authorized these funds in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act. Modernization efforts include high data rate terminals for command and control aircraft and upgrades to secure computer terminals. For FY2007, DOD is seeking $3.4 million for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D. The MEECN, part of the nuclear command and control system, is being upgraded with modernization efforts including high data rate terminals for command and control aircraft, upgrades to secure computer terminals, and improvements to satellite communications systems. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is personally involved in directing upgrades to the National Military Command System. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is overseeing upgrades to the National Military Command Center (NMCC) and its alternate at Site-R. He has directed the consolidation of separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon: a Unified Command Center and a Resources and Situation Awareness Center. These new facilities will focus on tracking global crises, providing military advice to the President, and will be more secure against various threats. The effort will coincide with Pentagon renovation work to free up space in the facility. The Defense Department is consolidating functions to create efficiencies and reduce manpower, requesting funding for planning and system engineering. They are also seeking funds for missile warning and attack assessment systems to upgrade capabilities at NORAD and USSTRATCOM. The Defense Department is requesting funds for missile warning and attack assessment systems to upgrade capabilities at NORAD and USSTRATCOM, as well as for enhancing airborne nuclear command and control platforms. Congress funded the full DOD request in FY2006 and DOD is asking for $50.9 million for further research and development in FY2007. The FY2006 appropriations bill funded the full amount of the DOD request for NAOC modifications. DOD's FY2007 budget request includes $5.6 million for E-4B modifications procurement and $283 thousand for R&D, covering improvements to aircraft structures, propulsion, fuel systems, and more. Specific upgrades include digital audio equipment, an \"office in the sky\" for senior leaders, LAN improvements, and transitioning from analog to digital UHF radio links. The proposed upgrades for the E-6B aircraft, operated by the Navy for USSTRATCOM, include improvements to cockpit displays, navigation systems, and air traffic control integration. These modifications, requested for FY2006, would cost $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. The upgrades also involve replacing legacy computers, communication switches, and UHF communications equipment for mission system improvements. The Navy argues that these changes are necessary due to the aircraft exceeding its service life based on weight and usage. The Navy is seeking upgrades for the E-6B aircraft due to exceeding its service life based on weight and usage. Congress supported the Navy's request for procurement and R&D funding in FY2006. The Defense Department is requesting funds for E-6 modifications and research in FY2007. The acquisition of the Advanced EHF communications satellite is a controversial aspect of nuclear command and control modernization programs. The AEHF satellite system will replace the aging MILSTAR constellation, providing secure communications with higher data rates. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are contractors for the program. Congress fully funded the Air Force budget request for AEHF in FY2006. The DOD is not requesting any procurement in its FY2007 budget proposal. The FY2006 Defense appropriations legislation matched the DOD budget request for AEHF. In FY2007, DOD is not seeking procurement funds for AEHF but the Air Force is requesting $633 million for R&D. The AEHF program has faced schedule delays and cost overruns, mainly due to technical issues with communications encryption equipment. The first AEHF launch is now planned for 2008, with the program estimated to cost over $7 billion, resulting in a Nunn-McCurdy notification. The AEHF program has experienced substantial delays and cost overruns, with an estimated cost of over $7 billion. It is intended to bridge between MILSTAR and the TSAT program, which incorporates advanced technologies. There are proposals to test some of these technologies on AEHF satellites first to reduce risks on the TSAT program. Congress considered but did not direct the purchase of an additional AEHF satellite in FY2006. The Air Force did not receive direction to buy an extra AEHF satellite to mitigate TSAT program delays. Congress instructed the Air Force to assess acquiring more AEHF satellites and modifying Wideband Gapfiller satellites for potential TSAT delays. Congress reduced TSAT funding by $400 million in the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act, allocating $436 million with $120 million reserved for either a fourth AEHF satellite purchase or continued TSAT systems development. The nuclear command and control system faces challenges due to increased demands from the 2001 NPR and DOD policy changes, with its Cold War architecture posing future obstacles. The nuclear command and control system will face challenges in the future due to increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and DOD policy changes. The system's legacy Cold War architecture may compete for budgetary priority against more immediately relevant conventional systems. Despite differing opinions on its value, the key functions of the NCCS will likely remain necessary as long as the US maintains a nuclear deterrent. The DOD is pursuing modernization initiatives across the system, but budget constraints will impact these activities. The Defense Department is focusing on modernizing the nuclear command and control system, facing challenges in a budget-constrained environment. Questions arise about the nature of threats from countries like China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations, including the potential for nuclear or EMP attacks. The role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy and the appropriate architecture for the NCCS are subjects of debate. There is competition between reducing the role of nuclear weapons for non-proliferation efforts and increasing their utility to confront proliferators. Revisions to the NCCS architecture may be needed to ensure Presidential control and minimize confusion. Revisions to the NCCS architecture may need to incorporate additional command and control requirements for non-nuclear offensive responses and missile defense. A debate on release authorities may precede architectural decisions. A more dispersed approach, like the one proposed by USSTRATCOM, could be more suitable for the current threat environment, potentially leading to manpower and budget savings in the long term. However, the effectiveness of a distributed, network style approach to nuclear command and control remains untested. The level of investment needed for modernization or new procurement is a key consideration, with ongoing initiatives projected to continue for years. The NCCS modernization and procurement initiatives are projected to continue for years. The retirement of certain platforms may offer short term savings. Questions arise about the adequacy and necessity of existing NCCS platforms, as well as their value for secondary uses. The taxpayer may benefit from employing these capabilities for ancillary functions, especially in homeland security and disaster response missions. Some platforms supporting homeland security and disaster response may have potential for greater utility. Questions arise about the justification for continued investment in these systems and whether their procurement and operation should be transferred to civilian agencies."
