    "content": "The 107th Congress approved reauthorization legislation for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants, while the Senate recommended $492.5 million. The Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program, including $310 million for state grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million, also including $310 million for state grants. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the program in FY2006, with $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The program is currently operating at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The No Child Left Behind Act amended and reauthorized the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program, providing funds to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. State grants are awarded to SEAs, LEAs, and Chief Executive Officers for creating programs to deter youth from drug use and violence. National programs receive discretionary funds for projects aimed at preventing drug abuse and violence across all educational levels. In FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants. The No Child Left Behind Act amended the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program, allocating $650 million for state grants in FY2002. Funds are distributed among educational levels, with specific reservations for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, Indian youth programs, and native Hawaiians. States, DC, and Puerto Rico receive funds based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. No state receives less than 0.5% of the total allotted or the amount received in FY2001. No state receives less than 0.5% of the total allotted or the amount received in FY2001 for state grants. State grant funds may be redistributed if not used within two years. A limitation states that national program funds cannot increase unless state grant funding is at least 10% more than the previous year. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act removed the limitation provision for FY2006, but it did not apply due to lower national program appropriations. For FY2006, the limitation provision was negated due to lower national program appropriations. In FY2007, state grants were not funded by the Administration. 20% of the state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants, with 3% for administrative costs. 93% of the allotment must be distributed to LEAs for drug and violence prevention programs. LEAs receive funds based on ESEA Title I, Part A allocations and school enrollments. LEAs can use up to 2% of state funds. In FY2002, SEAs could use up to 3% of their allotments for program administration and an additional 1% for a management information system. The system aimed to collect data on truancy, violence, drug-related crimes, curricula, and drug use in schools. LEAs could use up to 2% of state funds for administrative costs. The Governor, SEAs, LEAs, and other fund recipients provide curricula, programs, and services for schools. SEAs can use up to 5% of funds for capacity building, technical assistance, and program improvement. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated \"ineffective\" in 2002 and 2006 by the PART instrument. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated \"ineffective\" in 2006 due to the inability to demonstrate program effectiveness and funds being distributed too thinly. Approximately 64% of LEAs received less than $10,000 per year, which was deemed insufficient for effective drug prevention and school safety programs. The program lacked measurable positive outcomes, leading to its proposed termination to fund higher-priority national programs. The state grants program of the SDFSC was rated ineffective in 2006 due to lack of program effectiveness and insufficient funding. It was proposed to be terminated to prioritize national programs that could make a difference in drug and violence prevention. The Department of Education believed that national programs could provide direct support to select LEAs and measure the effectiveness of interventions. The Department of Education is using national survey data to evaluate the impact of the state grants program on teen drug use and violence. They are also conducting evaluations to measure the effectiveness of interventions and provide grants and technical assistance to improve program outcomes. The authorization for national programs is in place until FY2007. The ED Secretary can use funds from national programs to prevent violence and drug use among students. Up to $2 million can be reserved for evaluating the impact of the SDFSC program. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative will also receive necessary funding. The National Coordinator Initiative was created in FY1999 to recruit and train SDFSC program coordinators in middle schools. This initiative targets middle school students who are at risk of drug use and violence. The National Coordinator Initiative, created in FY1999, aimed to prevent drug use and violence among middle school students. Funding for this initiative was terminated in FY2004, but national program funds may still be available as formula grants to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Competitive grants may also be awarded to LEAs for developing programs to reduce alcohol abuse. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) allows school districts to develop programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools. Grants can be awarded to LEAs, non-profit groups, or partnerships for mentoring programs in middle schools. Other initiatives include grants for hate crime affected areas and a School Security Technology and Resource Center partnership. The Technology and Resource Center at Sandia National Laboratories, in partnership with other organizations, will be administered by the Attorney General as a resource for LEAs to assess and improve school security. A National Center for School and Youth Safety will be jointly created by the ED Secretary and the Attorney General to provide emergency assistance, establish a student hotline, offer consultation on school safety, compile best practices, and reach out to rural communities. The President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the SDFSC program, with $310 million for state grants. The Senate Committee recommended $276.5 million for the SDFSC program, including $310 million for state grants and $182.5 million for national programs. The President did not request state grant funding for FY2007 due to fiscal constraints and a review finding the state grants component ineffective. For FY2008, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs. For FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs, $6.3 million less than FY2006. No funding was requested for the mentoring program in FY2008. In FY2007, $19 million was requested for mentoring as part of a phase-out, with Congress appropriating $49.3 million in FY2006. Alcohol Abuse Reduction program funding was not requested from FY2005 to FY2008. The Administration slightly lowered mentoring funding to $48.8 million and did not request funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction (AAR) program from FY2005 through FY2008. Congress appropriated $32.7 million for AAR for FY2005 and FY2006, with funding slightly reduced to $32.4 million in FY2006. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funding for AAR in FY2007, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $32.4 million. The SDFSC program operates at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution through February 15, 2007. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) was incorporated into the SDFSCA program, requiring states to have laws expelling students who bring weapons to school. LEAs can modify the expulsion requirement on a case-by-case basis, and expelled students can receive educational services in an alternative setting. LEAs must comply with expulsion requirements and provide details on expulsions when requesting SEA assistance through GFSA funds. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) mandates the expulsion of students who bring firearms to school. LEAs must report expulsion details to the ED Secretary annually. GFSA funds are contingent on LEAs having policies for reporting students with weapons. Exceptions include lawfully stored firearms in locked vehicles and those used for approved activities. Bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced in the 109th Congress, with most dying except for H.R. 3010. In the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, with most dying except for H.R. 3010. This bill, the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006, included amendments for evaluating violence prevention programs but did not become law. Other measures introduced included the Bullying and Gang Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005. In the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, with most dying except for H.R. 3010. Other measures introduced were H.R. 283, H.R. 284, H.R. 3655, H.R. 5295, S. 1974, and S. 4028, focusing on bullying, gang prevention, drug-free sports, and empowering youth. H.R. 283 aimed to amend SDFSCA for bullying and gang prevention, introduced by Representative Sanchez on January 6, 2005. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 would have been amended to enhance school safety with accountability-based programs including bullying and gang prevention. H.R. 284 introduced by Representative Shimkus aimed to include bullying and harassment prevention programs under SDFSCA. The School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) directed the ED Secretary to review and revise the SDFSCA. H.R. 3655, the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006, introduced by Representative Baca, aimed to improve state and local prevention programs by revising SDFSCA guidelines. The bill required LEAs to have policies allowing searches of students under reasonable suspicion on school property. The Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 aimed to improve state and local prevention programs by allowing searches of students under reasonable suspicion on school property to prevent threats of weapons, drugs, or dangerous materials. Additionally, the bill stated that non-compliant LEAs would lose SDFSCA funds after FY2008. Other related acts introduced included the Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 and the Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) introduced by Senator Menendez aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA, increase state grants to $700 million for FY2007, authorize $400 million for national programs, allocate $40 million for the National Coordinator Initiative annually, require LEAs to hire gang prevention coordinators, and reserve $50 million for mentoring program grants. Priority would be given to entities serving elementary and middle school children for mentoring program grants. The ED Secretary would prioritize mentoring programs for elementary and middle school children in high-need areas, troubled homes, and schools with violence issues. An Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant would reserve $50 million for innovative programs targeting teens in high-crime communities. H.R. 354 is the only bill introduced in the 110th Congress related to SDFSCA. One bill introduced in the 110th Congress related to SDFSCA is H.R. 354, the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act). It aims to allow students in unsafe school environments or victims of violent crimes on school property to transfer to a safer school within the same district, including private charter schools. Counseling or removal of offenders is also an option under this bill. H.R. 354, the Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act, allows students in unsafe school environments or victims of violent crimes on school property to transfer to a safer school within the same district, including private charter schools. The bill does not use the term \"persistently dangerous\" and extends the option to students victimized while riding a school bus or attending a school function, with the provision of counseling or removal of the offender. In the 110th Congress, the Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program to focus on creating safe, drug-free school environments. This includes consolidating national programs into a flexible grant program with priorities such as emergency planning, violence prevention, school culture, and improving the learning environment for academic success. Congress may also consider additional reauthorization proposals. Policy makers may consider requiring K-12 schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies, potentially shifting responsibility from the Department of Education to the Department of Justice for school safety and crime data collection. The Department of Justice (DOJ) could take over school safety and crime data collection from the Department of Education (ED) due to its expertise in analyzing crime. Restructuring state grant programs may be necessary as ED has been ineffective in demonstrating their effectiveness. Responsibilities for drug and alcohol prevention, suicide prevention, and related education could remain at ED, while school safety and emergency preparedness programs could be under DOJ's direction. Legislation may also be considered as an option. Emergency preparedness programs and funding could be placed under the Department of Justice (DOJ) for its public safety expertise. Another option is allowing K-12 schools to apply for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding for increased security against terrorist attacks. Consideration should be given to making K-12 schools eligible for national Critical Infrastructure programs. The Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA, as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act, may have unintended consequences. State education officials may face pressure to define persistently dangerous schools in a way that local schools never meet the criteria. This could lead to underreporting of school crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous, impacting funding opportunities for violence prevention grants. The lack of a funding component for persistently dangerous schools under the No Child Left Behind Act further complicates the issue. The lack of funding for persistently dangerous schools under the No Child Left Behind Act hinders their ability to improve school safety programs, as federal and state budgets continue to cut school safety funds."
