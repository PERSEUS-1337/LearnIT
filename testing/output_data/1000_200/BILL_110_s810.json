Congress finds the need to increase the number of high school students prepared for STEM education, emphasize the importance of hands-on laboratory experiences in science learning, and address the current poor quality of lab experiences for most students. The National Research Council and Government Accountability Office found that schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate science lab facilities. 40 percent of college students who left the science fields reported problems related to high school science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience. The Federal Government should invest in research projects to improve the teaching of laboratory science in high schools to address problems with science preparation reported by college students. The Federal Government should invest in research projects to improve the teaching of laboratory science in high schools to address problems with science preparation reported by college students. This includes a grant program. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to improve science education in high schools. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to award grants for improving laboratories and providing instrumentation to enhance math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants can be used for equipment, maintenance, renovation, and improvement of laboratory facilities. The pilot program 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' awards grants for improving laboratory facilities, providing equipment, professional development for teachers, integrating laboratory experiences with classroom instruction, training in laboratory safety, and implementing hands-on experiences. The pilot program 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' awards grants for improving laboratory facilities, providing equipment, professional development for teachers, integrating laboratory experiences with classroom instruction, training in laboratory safety, and implementing hands-on experiences to encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology among individuals identified in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act. The pilot program 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' awards grants to partnerships that include higher education institutions, high-need local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations for activities assessment. The pilot program 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' awards grants to partnerships that include various entities such as State educational agencies, public agencies, National Laboratories, and community-based organizations. The Federal share of the cost for activities under the grant should not exceed 50 percent. The Director of the National Science Foundation will evaluate the effectiveness of pilot projects funded by the grant program in improving student performance in STEM fields. A report on the evaluation results, including best practices and materials developed by grant awardees, will be submitted to relevant Senate and House committees within 5 years. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation under this Act and its amendments includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for the following 3 years."
