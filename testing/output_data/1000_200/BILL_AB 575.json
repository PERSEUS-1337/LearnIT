    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Section 60200 of the Education Code, amending it to require the state board to adopt basic instructional materials for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8 in subject areas like language arts. At least five materials must be adopted for each grade level, with restrictions on adopting materials in consecutive years for the same subject area. The state board must adopt basic instructional materials for various subject areas, including Mathematics, Science, Social Science, Bilingual or bicultural subjects, and other disciplines as deemed necessary. Procedures for submission of instructional materials must be established to comply with these requirements. The state board must adopt procedures for submitting instructional materials in different subject areas every eight years, with restrictions on resubmission of rejected materials without substantive changes. If revisions to instructional material are submitted after the specified timeframe, a fee will be assessed by the department on the publisher or manufacturer. The submitted materials must be adopted or rejected within six months, with a possible extension of up to three months if needed. The process for reviewing instructional materials involves committees with volunteer experts and teachers from various grade levels and subjects. Rules for adopting materials must be transparent and consistent, regardless of format. State board criteria for adopting materials must be met. The state board reviews instructional materials to ensure they meet quality standards, comply with guidelines, are factually accurate, and aligned with content standards. Instructional materials must align with state content standards and should not include unnecessary exposure to commercial brands unless deemed necessary for educational purposes by the state board. The appearance of commercial brand names, products, or logos in instructional materials is allowed if it is incidental to the illustration. Additional criteria may be established by the state board to align with constitutional and statutory requirements. The state board may provide a written explanation for rejecting instructional materials based on specific criteria. They can adopt fewer than five materials if less than five are submitted. The state board may reject instructional materials based on specific criteria and adopt fewer than five materials if they do not meet the criteria or the state board's curriculum framework. This does not limit the board's authority to adopt non-basic instructional materials. The state board has the authority to adopt materials that are not basic instructional materials and must ensure that the adopted materials cater to the diverse educational needs of students. The state board adopts instructional materials and makes them available to publishers and school interests. The materials remain on the list for procurement until a new curriculum framework is adopted. Lists of adopted materials are provided by subject and grade level to school districts and posted on the department's website. The state board adopts instructional materials and makes them available to publishers and school interests. The materials remain on the list for procurement until a new curriculum framework is adopted. Lists of adopted materials are provided by subject and grade level to school districts and posted on the department\u2019s Internet Web site, including information from review committees' reports. This information may include publisher details and logos necessary for copyright protection or content identification. The state board adopts instructional materials and provides exceptions as determined by the board. The Superintendent develops guidelines for implementation. Section 60227 of the Education Code defines followup adoptions and requires notice before conducting them in a subject area. The notice for followup adoptions specifies fees based on the number of programs and grade levels proposed. The fees offset the cost of the process, with efforts to limit costs and keep fees modest. The department requires publishers or manufacturers to declare intent and specify programs and grade levels for followup adoption, with a fee assessed before review for adoption. The Legislature intends for the fee for followup adoption to not be a barrier for small publishers or manufacturers. Small publishers or manufacturers can request a fee reduction. Small publishers and manufacturers are defined as independently owned businesses with 100 or fewer employees and average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less. Revenue from fees will be used for adoption and review of instructional materials. The department may recommend to the state board not to conduct a followup adoption if there is little interest from publishers and manufacturers. General fund revenue cannot be used for followup adoption costs. This section is in effect until January 1, 2024, unless extended or deleted by a later statute."
