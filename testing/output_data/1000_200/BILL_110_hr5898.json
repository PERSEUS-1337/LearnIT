The Act aims to create a grant program to improve State-administered notification systems for finding missing seniors with Alzheimer's and dementia, promote best practices for Silver Alert systems, and raise awareness for coordinated efforts in locating missing individuals quickly. SEC. 3. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. The Congress finds that Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people in the United States, with a higher risk for those over 60 years old. Data shows that 1 in 8 individuals over 65 have Alzheimer's, and the number of cases is expected to increase due to the aging population. The Alzheimer's Association predicts that over 60% of Alzheimer's patients will wander away from their care facilities. Some states have implemented notification systems to help locate missing seniors with dementia-related illnesses. Silver Alert systems help disseminate information about missing seniors with dementia-related illnesses to authorities in a timely manner, increasing the chances of locating them. Some states have faced challenges in implementing these systems due to budget constraints. Congress believes that Silver Alert systems should have clear criteria to avoid frequent notifications. Silver Alerts should not be issued solely based on age, but for individuals unable to make personal care decisions. Alerts should be initiated by someone who recently had contact with the missing individual and is a legal guardian or close family member. Silver Alerts should be issued for individuals unable to make personal care decisions, initiated by someone who recently had contact with the missing individual and is a legal guardian, close family member, resident of the same household, or caregiver. The alerts should prioritize privacy, dignity, independence, and autonomy. Training for law enforcement officers and first responders on locating missing individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia-related illnesses, determining their condition, and communicating effectively is encouraged. The Federal Government can help prevent injuries and loss of life among individuals with Alzheimer's disease and dementia by assisting states with the costs of implementing and improving Silver Alert systems. Coordination between State and local entities is encouraged to effectively communicate with individuals suffering from dementia-related illnesses. The Silver Alert System Grant Program is established to assist states in implementing and improving systems to help individuals with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Coordination between State and local entities is encouraged for effective communication with those suffering from dementia-related illnesses. The Attorney General can award grants to States to establish or improve Silver Alert systems. Grants are for one-year periods and can be renewed, with a minimum award of $100,000. Regulations will be prescribed for eligibility and application criteria within a year of the Act's enactment. The Attorney General can award grants to States for Silver Alert systems, with regulations for eligibility and selection criteria. $5,600,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2013. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT ON SILVER ALERT SYSTEMS. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to Congress on Silver Alert systems, including a list of states with such systems, the number of alerts issued and individuals located, the average time to locate individuals, the issuing agency, dissemination process, and operational costs. The annual report to Congress on Silver Alert systems includes information on the criteria for issuing alerts, actions taken by states to protect privacy and dignity, communication improvements between families and authorities, and any other relevant details determined by the Attorney General. The Silver Alert system is a State-administered notification system to locate missing individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses. The term \"State\" includes various regions within the United States."
