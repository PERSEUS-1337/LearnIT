    "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in increasing financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs for individuals beyond high school age. These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certifications. Demand exists for workers in jobs that do not require a college degree but do require training or postsecondary education. The federal government provides over $100 billion in financial aid for postsecondary education, but most of it is not accessible to individuals pursuing non-degree programs. Some colleges are exploring new ways to increase enrollment, including offering short programs for quick reentry into the workforce. Several proposals have emerged to increase federal support for students pursuing non-degree programs, including allowing Pell Grants for short-term education. The College Affordability Act aims to expand Pell Grant eligibility for non-degree programs. The Higher Education Act reauthorization would expand Pell Grant eligibility to non-degree programs, aiming to retrain displaced workers and boost economic growth. Stakeholders support extending Pell Grants to shorter programs, but some express concerns about promotion. Some stakeholders have concerns about extending Pell Grants to non-degree programs, questioning the quality, costs, and potential perpetuation of income inequalities. Some stakeholders have concerns about extending Pell Grants to non-degree programs, questioning the quality, costs, and potential perpetuation of income inequalities. There are questions about the diminishing labor market returns for technical non-degree programs and the preference of employers for degree holders. Non-degree credential holders may face difficulties in securing employment long term, as employers increasingly rely on degrees for hiring. Adults with degrees in positions not requiring one may be displacing non-degree holders in some occupations. In 2018, 28% of employment was in occupations requiring a degree, while 42% of adults had a degree. The report discusses federal programs supporting non-degree training and education, employer demand for non-degree program graduates, and key characteristics of non-degree programs. It also details six federal programs and three tax benefits available. The report discusses federal programs and tax benefits that provide financial support to students pursuing non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs. It highlights gaps and limitations in the support, eligibility requirements, and federal oversight. Key reasons for promoting financial support include addressing employer needs and promoting economic growth. The report highlights the need for non-degree credentials for economic growth, providing data on employment and wages for occupations with non-degree entry requirements. Approximately 6.2% of jobs in the national economy in May 2018 required a non-degree postsecondary credential. The Department of Labor assigns entry-level education requirements for tracked occupations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics assigns entry-level education requirements for tracked occupations, with mean annual wages varying across education categories. Research shows earnings premiums for individuals with certain non-degree credentials, such as long-term certificates in technical or health fields. Postsecondary non-degree programs are essential for economic growth. Postsecondary non-degree programs provide training primarily for individuals beyond typical secondary education age, preparing them for specific occupations. These programs can be instructional or work-based learning, offering a combination of courses to fulfill educational or professional objectives without earning a degree upon completion. Non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment by offering a postsecondary curriculum without earning a degree. Upon completion, individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate. These programs are pursued for various reasons such as expanding knowledge and skills, preparing for further education, employment, or promotion. Postbaccalaureate certificates and transfer programs are excluded from non-degree instructional programs. Non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment by offering a postsecondary curriculum without earning a degree. These programs are pursued for various reasons such as expanding knowledge and skills, preparing for further education, employment, or promotion. Transfer programs do not award a certificate or degree but provide education for at least two academic years and are acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree. Non-degree instructional programs should not be confused with certifications and licenses, which are occupational credentials awarded by entities that assess competency in an occupation. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by a variety of entities including traditional postsecondary educational institutions, businesses, professional organizations, and the military. These programs vary in length from a few days to over two years. Non-degree instructional programs vary in length, ranging from a few days to over two years. The duration is influenced by curriculum requirements, industry expectations, and skills complexity. Federal, state, and private entities may set minimum educational hours for eligibility. Programs can be stackable units aligned to a career path, offered in various formats like classrooms or online. Students are responsible for funding the program costs. Program costs for non-degree instructional programs can vary depending on the length, resource requirements, and provider. The average published cost for tuition and fees in AY2018-2019 was over $9,000 at public less-than-two-year colleges and approximately $15,000 at private less-than-two-year colleges. There is a dichotomy between credit and noncredit programs, with courses in the same field of study sometimes offered for credit at one institution and noncredit at another. Individuals must find funding for program costs and related expenses. Credit programs offer industry recognition and credits that can be transferred to other programs, while noncredit programs do not provide currency towards credit programs. Noncredit programs are often more affordable and cover a broader range of topics. Noncredit programs are advantageous as they are less expensive, cover a wider range of topics, and can be quickly adapted to industry and student needs. They may fulfill career entry requirements, offer ABE and ESL instruction, provide personal enrichment, and customized training. Enrollment data from nine colleges showed that 38% were in noncredit courses, including vocational, ABE, ESL, and GED. National data on non-degree programs are incomplete, with some states and the federal government not collecting data. The 2016 nationwide survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 had a postsecondary certificate. Educational institutions awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and approximately 3 million undergraduate degrees in AY2017-2018. Work-based learning refers to training activities to impart workplace skills. Work-based learning encompasses various types of training activities, such as on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, and cooperative programs. Programs that offer wages are known as earn and learn programs, with Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs being a unique form overseen by the Department of Labor (DOL) or approved state agencies. RA programs must meet federal regulations to be registered. RA programs are registered with DOL or a DOL-approved state agency if they meet federal standards. Registration requires a work process schedule outlining competencies and review every five years for compliance. Deregistration may occur for persistent failure. Multiple entities can offer work-based learning experiences. Work-based learning experiences can be offered by various entities such as employers, labor unions, training providers, and educational institutions. These experiences are structured to meet the needs of the employer, potential employer, or trainee, with programs like RA requiring at least 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training lasting one to six years. RA programs typically last four years and can be time-based or competency-based. Hybrid programs may combine both approaches. Related instruction is essential in all program designs. Costs are mainly covered by the provider, but trainees may need to cover living expenses. Program costs include lost work time, trainer fees, and trainee wages. Trainee productivity may offset some costs as the program progresses. Some work-based learning programs require trainees to cover related costs like transportation and board. Data on employer-provided training is limited and varies in methodology. Surveys show that most establishments offer some form of training, but details differ across surveys. In the 1990s, government surveys showed that 16% to 70% of workers received training from most establishments. A 2016 survey found that 21% of adults aged 16-65 completed work-based learning programs, with healthcare and teaching being common fields. In FY2019, there were about 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs, with 81,000 completing a program, mostly in the construction industry. The federal government provides financial support for training and education in various industries, with a focus on non-degree programs. The design and implementation of these programs differ, including the monitoring of non-degree programs. The primary benefit programs include the Workforce Innovation and... The federal government offers financial support for training and education through programs like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I, federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance. WIOA Title I, administered by the Department of Labor, subsidizes training costs for workforce development. Federal student aid programs provide grants and loans for postsecondary education, while tax benefits offer financial support post-education. The IRS administers tax benefits for post-education financial support. VA programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC provide direct financial support for education. SNAP E&T and TANF offer training and education assistance for individuals in need. The Department of Health and Human Services provides training and education opportunities for individuals at high risk of educational failure through TANF. WIOA Title I aims to enhance coordination among federal workforce development programs. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I aims to increase coordination among federal workforce development programs. It is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) and funded through discretionary appropriations. WIOA services focus on improving employment, earnings, and postsecondary credential attainment for participants, enhancing the workforce quality, reducing welfare dependency, and meeting employer skill requirements. Formula grants are provided to states for Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities, with funds allocated to local Workforce Development Boards for establishing One-Stop delivery systems. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) allocates funds to local Workforce Development Boards for various purposes including establishing One-Stop delivery systems, providing career and training services, building relationships with employers, and developing industry partnerships. WIOA offers consumer choice to participants, with services structured around career services and training. Career services include basic and individualized assistance, while training can be pursued at eligible training providers. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) allows eligible participants to pursue training at eligible training providers, identified on the state's Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL). Training activities supported by WIOA funds include non-degree and degree programs, work-based learning, and incumbent worker training for in-demand occupations. Training under WIOA must be for in-demand occupations in the local area or region, or with high growth potential. It includes programs leading to industry-recognized certificates, licenses, degrees, employment, or skill gains. Up to 20% of funds can be reserved for incumbent worker training. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides universal access to career services for adults aged 18 or older in the United States. Individualized career services are offered to help individuals secure and maintain employment. Eligibility for training under WIOA requires a need for economic self-sufficiency, skills for successful training participation, and selection of training linked to local in-demand occupations. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), adults aged 18 or older in the United States have access to career services for economic self-sufficiency. Training eligibility requires skills for successful participation in local in-demand occupations. One-Stop operators assess individuals for training services, with priority given to recipients of public assistance and low-income individuals. Under WIOA, priority for career and training services is given to recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies. Local WDBs, in consultation with the state's governor, determine fund allocation among these groups. Training can be provided through ITAs or contracts, with funds also available for supportive services and needs-related payments. Eligible individuals can choose training services from the ETPL with the assistance of One-Stop operators. Under WIOA, eligible individuals can choose training services from the ETPL with the assistance of One-Stop operators. An ITA is established for payment to the ETP, not the individual, for training services. Local WDBs can set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts. ITA funds can support non-degree programs, degree programs, and related instruction. Supportive services like transportation, child care, housing, and needs-related payments can also be provided by local WDBs to enable participation in training. The local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) can provide training through a contract for services, including work-based learning. This agreement between the WDB and an employer or RA sponsor allows for occupational training for WIOA participants in exchange for reimbursement. This option can be utilized when consumer choice requirements are met, and various training services are needed. The local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) can contract training services for individuals with barriers to employment in in-demand occupations or sectors. They may reimburse OJT providers or RA sponsors for up to 75% of wages through a pay-for-performance contract. States are responsible for developing the ETPL, and local WDBs administer training programs and payments to providers. Administrative structures and procedures vary by state. Quality assurance of training providers is established through initial and continued eligibility processes. The governor and state WDB set criteria for eligible training providers to receive funding. RA programs are automatically eligible for state ETPL inclusion. Non-RA providers must apply for initial eligibility and follow procedures for continued eligibility. WIOA specifies information submission for existing providers. WIOA outlines general requirements for training providers, with local WDBs having discretion on specific factors such as the duration of OJT contracts and employer eligibility for funding. ETPs and states are required to report program participation and outcomes, while RA programs are not mandated to do so. WIOA requires ETPs and states to report program participation and outcomes, including measures like employment rates, earnings, and credential attainment. Providers must submit performance and cost information every two years to the governor for continued eligibility. The WIOA requires ETPs and states to report program participation and outcomes, including employment rates, earnings, and credential attainment. States must publish annual ETP performance reports with information on postsecondary credentials received, cost of attendance, and program completion rates. Governors may request additional performance data for continued eligibility. The WIOA Title I program requires ETPs to report on program participation, outcomes, and performance. This includes data on the number of participants, average cost per participant, barriers to employment, and demographics. Recent data shows high participation in work-based learning programs, with a majority of participants being adults aged 30 and over. In program year 2018, the WIOA Title I program had high participation in work-based learning programs, with a majority of participants being adults aged 30 and over. Most participants were unemployed or had received a layoff notice, with a notable percentage having a degree. Training services were mainly focused on skills upgrading through non-degree programs, with popular occupations including healthcare, transportation, and material moving. The WIOA Title I program supports adult entry or reentry into the workforce by providing career services and short-term training. It focuses on popular occupations such as transportation, computer, office support, and management. Recommendations to enhance support for non-degree training include increasing access to training, dedicating more funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxing limits on incumbent training, and removing restrictions on obtaining other grant assistance. The WIOA Title I program supports adult entry or reentry into the workforce by providing career services and short-term training in popular occupations. Recommendations to enhance support for non-degree training include increasing access to training, dedicating more funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxing limits on incumbent training, and removing restrictions on obtaining other grant assistance. Changes to the Higher Education Act could allow programs to supplement each other and improve the quality of non-degree programs offered through the ETPL. Title IV aid includes Federal Pell Grants and federal student loans through the Direct Loan program, designed to provide portable aid to eligible individuals. Pell Grants and Direct Loans are available regardless of congressional appropriations, with the Direct Loan program being a mandatory entitlement program. The Pell Grant program is often referred to as a quasi-entitlement. Other smaller aid programs authorized by Title IV are not discussed in this report. The Pell Grant program is a quasi-entitlement that provides aid to eligible individuals regardless of discretionary appropriations levels. Pell Grants and Direct Loans can be used for Title IV-eligible programs offered by participating institutions, including non-degree and degree programs. Eligibility criteria for programs and institutions include quality assurance measures. Institutions classified as public, private nonprofit, proprietary, and vocational must meet these criteria to participate in Title IV programs. Non-degree programs at various types of postsecondary institutions must meet eligibility requirements for Title IV aid. These programs must lead to a recognized non-degree credential and have a defined number of credit or clock hours associated with them. Work-based learning must be supervised by the institution, with limits on the portion offered by external entities. Non-degree programs are also subject to specific durational requirements. Non-degree programs offered by postsecondary institutions must meet specific durational requirements for Title IV aid eligibility. For Pell Grants, these programs must be at least 15 weeks long with a minimum of 600 clock hours or 16 semester hours. For the Direct Loan program, non-degree programs must be at least 10 weeks long with 300-599 clock hours. Students must be enrolled in an eligible program of study. Non-degree programs at public and private nonprofit institutions must meet specific durational requirements for Title IV aid eligibility. Programs must be at least 10 weeks long with 300-599 clock hours for the Direct Loan program. Students must be enrolled in an eligible program of study on at least a half-time basis. Eligibility for Title IV funds also requires U.S. citizenship or specified eligible noncitizenship, along with enrollment in a Title IV-eligible program. To be eligible for Pell Grants or Direct Loan program loans, students in Title IV-eligible programs must meet specific criteria including U.S. citizenship, high school diploma or equivalent, and program-specific requirements. Pell Grant recipients must be enrolled in an undergraduate program, show financial need, and have not completed a bachelor's degree. There is a lifetime cap of 12 full-time semesters for Pell Grant aid. Direct Loan program loan recipients must also meet program-specific criteria. Students must meet specific criteria to be eligible for Pell Grants and Direct Loan program loans, including U.S. citizenship, high school diploma or equivalent, and program-specific requirements. Pell Grant recipients are subject to a lifetime cap of 12 full-time semesters. Direct Loan program loans have different types, such as Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for any student, and PLUS Loans for parents or graduate students. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, can only borrow Direct Subsidized Loans for up to 150% of the published program length. The amount of Title IV aid a student is eligible for is determined by statutory award rules and cannot exceed the cost of attendance (COA). The COA includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation costs, and dependent care expenses. Pell Grant awards are determined without considering other financial assistance. The Pell Grant award rules determine the maximum amount a student may receive in an academic year, which for AY 2020-2021 is $6,345 for full-time enrollment. Pell Grant awards may be reduced based on various factors like COA, financial need, enrollment rate, or program duration. Pell Grant awards used for non-degree programs are subject to income taxation, while those used for degree programs are only taxed if not used for tuition and fees. Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type, and other factors can also impact aid eligibility and amount. The Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type and other factors can affect aid eligibility and amount. An individual cannot receive a Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan exceeding statutory annual and aggregate limits based on dependency status and class level. For example, a dependent undergraduate student may borrow up to $5,500 in loans for the first year, while an independent undergraduate student may borrow up to $9,500. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid programs, with various actors handling different functions. FSA manages high-level tasks like system operations and integrity assurance, while IHEs handle day-to-day functions like awarding and disbursing aid to students. IHEs manage day-to-day functions related to awarding and disbursing Title IV aid to students, including verifying eligibility, calculating aid amounts, disbursing funds, and managing program funds. The program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification ensures quality and eligibility requirements. State authorization, accreditation, and ED certification are key components for Title IV eligibility. Non-degree programs may also need to meet gainful employment requirements. IHEs must be authorized within their state and comply with state approval or licensure requirements. State requirements vary among states, with some approving IHEs and programs individually. State approval and licensure requirements for IHEs vary among states, with some states approving individual educational programs while others only require approval of the institution as a whole. States evaluate program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program need justification. Accreditation by a recognized agency is necessary for Title IV eligibility. Accreditation by a recognized agency is necessary for Title IV eligibility. Accrediting agencies evaluate various aspects of an institution, including faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement. Regional or national accreditors must assess whether an institution meets prescribed criteria. Accrediting agencies evaluate institutions based on specific criteria for Title IV eligibility. Programmatic accreditation may be sought to meet employer and licensure requirements. Educational programs are assessed on established standards for their field of study. Institutions seeking Title IV participation must apply for certification from the Department of Education, which evaluates program satisfaction of requirements. The Department of Education (ED) evaluates whether an institution meets Title IV participation requirements by reviewing each educational program for eligibility. Programs must meet specific criteria, such as verifiable completion and placement rates of at least 70% for 300-599 clock-hour programs. Institutions can self-certify new programs or submit an application for approval. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, as defined by 2014 regulations. The 2014 GE regulations aimed to measure program quality by establishing debt-to-earnings rates for educational programs. Programs failing to meet standards risk losing Title IV eligibility for three years. No program has lost eligibility yet. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires that Title IV participating institutions meet third-party standards and report enrollment and financial information to the Department of Education (ED) annually. The HEA does not define performance measures for Title IV programs. In AY2017-2018, ED collects data on non-degree instructional for-credit programs at Title IV-participating institutions. Private for-profit IHEs offer half of these programs, while public IHEs award over two-thirds of the credentials. In AY2015-2016, 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs, receiving $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. In AY2015-2016, Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs and received about $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards, which accounted for roughly 10% of the total recipients and dollar amount. Support for non-degree programs is limited to specific criteria at Title IV-participating institutions, excluding certain students like those without a high school diploma or bachelor's degree. Non-degree program quality is assessed through the program integrity triad, with state authorizers and accreditors having flexibility in determining criteria. Variation among state authorization requirements complicates assessing institutional experiences. State authorization requirements may be influenced by a state's history, resources, and priorities. Researchers have identified potential weaknesses in some states' authorization requirements, including concerns about oversight by state boards, input requirements hindering innovative education models, lengthy timeframes for authorization, and conflicts across state laws. The accreditation system has strengths such as tailored peer reviews and programmatic alignment, but weaknesses include conflicting interests and insufficient resources. The GAO identified conflicting interests, insufficient resources, and challenges in assessing innovative education modes. Education tax benefits, administered by the IRS, provide advantages to upper middle-income taxpayers and are claimed after paying for education expenses. Education tax benefits provide tax advantages to taxpayers after they have paid for education expenses. These benefits are available to individuals in degree programs and some non-degree programs. Unlike other federal education programs, education tax benefits reduce federal revenues and are not subject to annual appropriations. Eligible individuals can receive these benefits when filing their federal income tax return, potentially leading to increased education consumption or subsidizing education that would have occurred anyway. Education tax benefits, such as the Lifetime Learning Credit and 529 accounts, provide financial assistance for education expenses. Taxpayers in non-degree programs may also benefit from Employer Provided Educational Assistance. 529 accounts and the Lifetime Learning Credit can be used for eligible education expenses at Title IV-eligible IHEs for non-degree programs. Qualified education expenses include tuition, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment. Expenses must be reduced by any tax-free educational assistance. Employer provided educational assistance may cover a broader range of non-degree programs. The Lifetime Learning Credit and employer-provided educational assistance can be used for a variety of educational expenses, including tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for courses that improve job skills. The assistance can be used for non-degree programs and does not have to be work-related or part of a degree program. The institution providing the program does not need to be a Title IV-eligible IHE. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses, including tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and equipment at a Title IV-eligible IHE. Eligibility for training is not solely based on the tax code. Participants must file a federal income tax return or be claimed as a dependent to qualify for tax benefits on education expenses. Married individuals filing separately are not eligible for the credit. Taxpayers can claim the LLC for qualified education expenses for themselves, spouses, or dependent children if their income is below $68,000 ($136,000 for married filing jointly). The LLC is 20% of the first $10,000 of expenses, with a maximum credit of $2,000. Participants must have an employer offering educational assistance to qualify. Withdrawals from a 529 account for education expenses are tax-free. Expenses paid from a 529 account or through an employer are tax-free. The LLC is calculated as 20% of the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses, with a maximum credit of $2,000 per taxpayer. The credit phases out for taxpayers with income between $58,000 and $68,000 ($116,000 and $136,000 for married joint filers) in 2019. Employers can provide up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance per year. Taxpayers can withdraw tax-free funds from their 529 accounts for qualifying education expenses. The IRS relies on taxpayers, employers, and states for proper administration of benefits. Taxpayers apply for the LLC by filing their federal income tax return and Form 8863. Taxpayers apply for the LLC by filing their federal income tax return and IRS Form 8863, which outlines eligibility rules and helps calculate the credit amount. Employers must have a written plan to qualify as an educational assistance program, without the need for IRS approval. Employees can apply to the IRS for a determination that their plan is a qualified program under IRC Section 601.201. The program cannot favor certain employees and must provide reasonable notice of its terms. 529 plans are typically sponsored by states, allowing individuals to establish accounts for beneficiaries. Withdrawals from a 529 plan result in a Form 1099-Q showing the total amount withdrawn and the breakdown between earnings and basis. Taxpayers with a Form 1099-Q must show the total amount withdrawn and the breakdown between earnings and basis. If funds are used for non-eligible expenses, a portion may be subject to taxation on federal income tax returns. Documentation of how withdrawals are spent is not required unless audited. The IRS does not have rules on the quality of education programs for tax benefits. Limited IRS data shows that approximately 2.5 million taxpayers claimed education tax benefits in 2015. The IRS data on education tax benefits in 2015 showed that approximately 2.5 million taxpayers claimed about $2.1 billion of the LLC, with an average credit of $830 per taxpayer. Half of the LLC dollars were claimed by taxpayers with AGI between $50,000 and $200,000. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in improving job skills. Administrative data on employer-provided educational assistance is unavailable, and its impact on enrollment in non-degree programs has not been studied. No studies have evaluated the impact of employer provided educational assistance on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in helping non-degree candidates improve their job skills. Data on 529 plans from the IRS is unavailable, but survey data suggests that few families have these accounts, with those who do having higher assets and income. Research on education tax benefits has shown little effect on increasing enrollment, highlighting limitations that may apply to non-degree programs. The research found limited impact on enrollment from education tax benefits, which may not assist students who can't afford upfront costs. There is confusion among taxpayers about eligibility for different benefits and their tax savings. These benefits only help taxpayers with income tax liabilities, excluding many low-income individuals. GI Bills were meant to aid veterans in transitioning to civilian life. The GI Bills and VET TEC programs provide financial assistance to former servicemembers for education and training programs, aiming to aid in their transition to civilian life and promote military retention. VET TEC incentivizes training providers for program completion and employment, while the GI Bills offer benefits to students based on their service in the uniformed services. The GI Bills and VET TEC programs, administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, provide financial assistance to former servicemembers for education and training. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is the primary program, representing 80% or more of total participation and spending since FY2013. Benefits support education through degree pursuit, training, and work-based learning programs. VET TEC benefits support non-degree high-technology education programs at approved training providers. Eligible programs include credit and noncredit instructional programs, apprenticeships, and courses leading to specific educational or vocational goals. The VET TEC program supports high-technology education programs at approved training providers through a Program Participation Agreement with the VA. Eligible servicemembers and veterans, along with their family members, can access Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Qualifying criteria include active duty service requirements and the ability to transfer benefits to family members. To be eligible for VET TEC, an individual must be a GI Bill-eligible veteran enrolled full-time in a VET TEC-eligible program. VET TEC participants may or may not be recipients of GI Bill benefits. Both the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC provide living stipend payments directly to participants and payments to providers for direct program costs. Eligible individuals may also apply for personalized counseling to help guide their career paths and achieve their goals. The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers educational assistance payments over 36 months, with benefits based on service length. Various payment types are available depending on factors like enrollment rate, program type, and location. Transfer of benefits requires sharing the entitlement. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance payments based on service length. Payments cover tuition, fees, housing allowance, books and supplies stipend, tutorial assistance, and additional monthly payments. Veterans can receive up to $24,476.79 for tuition and fees, monthly housing allowance between $800 and $4,300, and up to $1,000 for books and supplies. Under VET TEC, veterans receive monthly housing allowance similar to Post-9/11 GI Bill. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition and fees, paying 25% upon enrollment, 25% upon completion, and 50% upon employment. Training providers cannot charge tuition and fees to VET TEC. Under VET TEC, veterans receive monthly housing allowance similar to Post-9/11 GI Bill. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition and fees, paying 25% upon enrollment, 25% upon completion, and 50% upon employment in a suitable field. Training providers cannot charge tuition and fees directly to VET TEC participants. Eligible individuals apply to the VA for either the Post-9/11 GI Bill or VET TEC, enroll in approved programs, and certifications of enrollment and pursuit are regularly verified by the VA. Program quality for GI Bill-approved programs is overseen by state approving agencies. The VA and state approving agencies oversee program quality for GI Bill-approved and VET TEC programs. Standards are established to ensure education quality and proper administration of benefits, with a focus on participant employment outcomes. The VA and state approving agencies oversee program quality for GI Bill-approved and VET TEC programs, ensuring education quality and proper administration of benefits. Standards include program objectives, independent study restrictions, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. These standards aim to prevent poor quality and abuse in education programs. Non-degree programs offered through contractual agreements must meet specific standards for GI Bill approval, including adequate facilities, qualified instructors, and recognized curricula. Programs preparing individuals for licensure or certification must meet relevant instructional requirements. Programs lacking approval from other government agencies must meet additional quality criteria. Non-degree programs approved by other government agencies, such as FAA flight training programs and DOL Registered Apprenticeships, must meet specific standards for VET TEC eligibility. The VA determines eligibility and ensures program quality through payment structure and criteria for meaningful employment within 180 days of completion. The VET TEC program requires training providers to be licensed and meet quality standards, with programs not being self-paced. The VA reports annually on participants' qualifications earned to assess program effectiveness in preparing individuals for the future. Key requirements include meaningful employment within 180 days of completion and program performance measures like job placement rates. The VET TEC program measures performance through program admittance rate, job placement and retention rates, median annual salary, and transfer rates. GI Bill participants mostly pursue degrees over educational certificates, with a small percentage in OJT or apprenticeships. Many non-degree training providers are approved for GI Bill purposes. In FY2018, 0.4% of Post-9/11 GI Bill participants pursued OJT or apprenticeships. Over 18,000 school locations did not award degrees, with 37% being private for-profit, 37% public, and 27% private nonprofit schools. Popular certificates included welding, information technology, HVAC, healthcare, and gunsmithing. Program eligibility is for uniformed services members and their families. The program had five approved training providers and eight participants, limited to uniformed services members and their families. Oversight of the program may be compromised, as indicated by 2018 GAO and VA OIG reports. SNAP, administered by the Department of Agriculture, provides benefits to eligible low-income households for purchasing food. SNAP provides benefits for eligible low-income households to purchase food. Federal funding for SNAP includes food benefits and other funding for Employment & Training programs to help participants gain skills for employment. Established in 1987, SNAP E&T aims to assist households in obtaining regular employment and meeting workforce needs. SNAP E&T was established in 1987 to help participants gain skills for employment and meet workforce needs. State agencies administering SNAP must implement a SNAP E&T program, which can be voluntary or mandatory. Most states operate voluntary E&T programs, offering components such as job search programs, workfare, education, and WIOA services. Since 1987, SNAP E&T has aimed to help participants gain employment skills. State agencies must implement a program, which can be voluntary or mandatory, offering job search, workfare, education, and WIOA services. Funding for SNAP E&T includes mandatory and open-ended federal match streams, with total funding varying yearly based on states' use. USDA-FNS and Seattle Jobs Initiative have collaborated on SNAP to Skills since October 2015, providing technical assistance to build more effective SNAP E&T programs. SNAP to Skills project provides technical assistance to states for building effective SNAP E&T programs. It integrates with WIOA Title I program and must be delivered through the statewide workforce development system. SNAP E&T recipients can access services through WIOA One-Stop centers, with a focus on addressing unique challenges like low basic skills and housing instability. Services and programs offered vary by state, including specified education activities. SNAP E&T programs offer educational activities to improve basic skills and employability, including high school programs, literacy education, and English as a second language. These activities must directly enhance participants' job readiness and help them transition into employment quickly. States may offer additional services and programs tailored to address specific challenges faced by SNAP E&T recipients. SNAP E&T education activities must have a direct link to employment and help participants move promptly into employment. States offer vocational training, basic education, work experience, apprenticeships, subsidized employment, and unpaid internships. SNAP E&T serves participants subject to work requirements, with some states targeting specific populations. Household income must be at or below 130% of the poverty level to be financially eligible for SNAP. Financial eligibility for SNAP requires household gross monthly income to be at or below 130% of the federal poverty level, with net monthly income at or below 100%. Work requirements are in place for non-disabled adults, who must register for work and maintain at least 30 hours per week. States may make SNAP E&T programs mandatory for this population or a subset of it. The USDA requires states to assess SNAP participants for effective E&T programs. The 2018 farm bill mandates case management services for all states. E&T funds cannot be used for TANF cash assistance recipients. SNAP E&T funds can cover education costs for eligible individuals, including dependent care and transportation. State agencies and contracted programs administer the funds, often through partnerships. USDA-FNS promotes third-party partnerships for SNAP E&T programs, where states collaborate with entities like community colleges. Partners contribute financially, and states reimburse them using federal funds. Pell Grant-eligible students must use the Pell Grant first for college expenses before utilizing E&T funds. Expenses covered by E&T must be reasonable and necessary. The SNAP E&T program covers college expenses not included in the Pell Grant, with a focus on reasonable and necessary expenses. Workforce partnerships, added by the 2018 farm bill, involve private employers, nonprofits, and training providers. Each state designs its SNAP E&T program within federal guidelines, with varying services offered. The 2018 farm bill set requirements for states' E&T plans, which must be implemented in consultation with the state workforce development board or private employers. SNAP E&T participants learn about programs through the state agency or partner referrals. States monitor program quality, with USDA providing technical assistance. The 2014 farm bill required USDA to establish performance indicators reporting, with the first annual report due in January 2018. The 2018 farm bill mandated USDA to establish performance indicators reporting for SNAP E&T programs. The national reporting measures include unsubsidized employment, median quarterly wages, and completion of educational components. Most SNAP E&T participants received services other than education, with 38 state agencies offering an education component in their programs. In FY2016, 38 out of 53 SNAP state agencies included an education component in their E&T program, serving almost 70,000 participants. However, less than 10% of participants receive education, and information on program quality and subsequent employment outcomes is lacking. A forthcoming evaluation on the 2014 farm bill pilot projects may provide insight for future guidance and policymaking. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant aims to provide assistance to needy families with children, promote work and marriage, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and support two-parent families. States have flexibility in using TANF funds to achieve these goals. TANF is administered by HHS and is a mandatory spending program. TANF is a broad-purpose block grant administered by HHS, providing assistance to needy families with children. Funds can be used for various benefits and services, including cash assistance, subsidized employment, and education programs like career pathways. Several states have utilized TANF funds to support career pathways, which offer interconnected education programs and support services to help individuals advance in their chosen career paths. One state program employs coordinators paid with TANF funds at a community college to serve as case managers, recruit students, and provide access to support services. TANF allows flexibility in determining eligible vocational education training programs, with limits on how much training can be counted towards performance measures. These funds are designated for low-income families with children. TANF funds are used for vocational education training for low-income families with children. States set financial eligibility rules, with significant variation. In 2015, many TANF recipients had low levels of education. States determine eligibility rules for TANF assistance programs. The TANF program, created by the Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, allows states to determine eligibility rules and benefit amounts. Adult recipients must participate in required activities, such as training and education, or face reduced benefits. TANF also provides funding for support services beyond cash assistance. TANF funds support services like advising, career planning, and employment services at the state and local level. States decide which participants receive these services. Some states refer assistance recipients to WIOA One Stop Centers for education or employment, while others operate separate employment and training services. There are no federal rules on program quality, but states may establish their own. The minimum work participation rate is TANF's main performance measure, requiring a percentage of recipients to be working or engaged in activities. States must meet a performance standard for TANF that requires a minimum percentage of recipients to be working or engaged in activities. Rules limit training and education, with little program-wide data on participation outcomes. Child care and educational barriers may hinder TANF recipients from succeeding in non-degree programs. States can use TANF funds to assist with child care for single mothers with young children. The TANF cash assistance caseload, mostly single mothers with young children, faces education disadvantages. States can use TANF funds for child care. Limitations on vocational training and income eligibility may restrict program choices. The quality of training programs is uncertain."
