A new technique called neuron editing aims to address this issue by learning how neurons encode edits for specific transformations in a latent space. This approach uses an autoencoder to decompose dataset variations into neuron activations and generate transformed data by editing these neurons. The autoencoder decomposes dataset variations into neuron activations to generate transformed data through editing transformations in a latent space. This technique is showcased in image domain/style transfer and biological applications such as removing batch artifacts and modeling drug treatment effects. Experiments in biology often study treatment effects on a subset of samples, assuming generalization to the entire population. The text discusses the limitations of current methods in studying treatment effects in biology, proposing a neural network-based approach to learn a general edit function for treatment. Neural networks can overfit to specific data and not learn a general edit function. The text proposes a neural network-based approach called neuron editing to learn a general edit function for treatment effects in biology. It aims to address the limitations of current methods by reframing the problem as learning an edit function between pre-and post-treatment data versions. Neuron editing involves extracting differences between pre-and post-treatment activation distributions for neurons in the autoencoder's internal layers and applying them to generate post-treatment data synthetically. This technique encodes complex edits in the ambient space, utilizing denoised and meaningful features. In this work, neuron editing is applied to the latent space of autoencoders to model complex distribution-to-distribution transformations between large samples in high-dimensional space. Autoencoders perform non-linear dimensionality reduction to straighten the curvature of data, simplifying complex effects into shifts in distribution. Neuron editing in autoencoders straightens data curvature in the latent space, simplifying complex effects into distribution shifts. Edited neurons interact with data-context-encoding neurons in predictive ways for treatment modeling. Neuron editing in a low-dimensional internal layer of an autoencoder allows for editing on a denoised version of the data, retaining significant dimensions while discarding noise dimensions. This approach assumes semantic consistency of internal neurons across data manifolds, which is demonstrated in the joint manifold learning of pre- and post-treatment samples in an experimental subpopulation. Neuron editing in an autoencoder's internal layer allows for editing on a denoised data version, retaining significant dimensions while discarding noise dimensions. The approach assumes semantic consistency of internal neurons across data manifolds, demonstrated in joint manifold learning of pre- and post-treatment samples in an experimental subpopulation. The autoencoder learns a joint manifold of all given data, including pre- and post-treatment samples of the experimental subpopulation and pre-treatment samples from the rest of the population. Neural networks prefer learning patterns over memorizing inputs, even with the capacity to do so. Neuron editing extrapolates better than generative models, producing more complex variation by preserving existing data variation. Comparisons with generation-based approaches show the effectiveness of neuron editing. Neuron editing is compared to generation-based approaches like traditional GANs and CycleGAN. While GANs struggle with generating plausible points, neuron editing excels in extrapolation. The method is detailed, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in biological applications. Extrapolation is crucial in biological applications such as correcting batch effects and predicting combinatorial drug effects. GANs learn transformations that mimic target distributions and have piecewise linear properties. The GAN optimization paradigm produces piecewise linear transformations, but they do not behave comparably on both S and X. Instead of learning such a transformation, a transformation is defined on a learned space using an encoder/decoder pair E/D. The activations of an n-dimensional internal layer of the network for inputs from S and T are extracted, and a piecewise linear transformation called NeuronEdit is applied to these distributions of activations. NeuronEdit is a piecewise linear transformation applied to distributions of activations from network inputs S and T. It operates on distributions represented via activations and transforms them based on the difference between the source and target distributions. NeuronEdit is a transformation applied to activation distributions from network inputs S and T, ensuring consistency between source and extrapolation distributions. The transformation is applied to neuron activations through the encoder and decoder without further training, resulting in a transformed output X. The nomenclature of an autoencoder no longer strictly applies in this context. The transformed output X is obtained by applying neuron editing to activation distributions from network inputs S and T. This turns an autoencoder into a generative model by freezing training and exclusively applying transformations on inference. Neuron editing can model the intrinsic variation in X unsupervised, providing more information compared to GANs. GANs are difficult to train due to oscillating optimization dynamics, uninterpretable losses, and mode collapse. Mode collapse occurs when the discriminator cannot distinguish between real and fake examples, leading to the generator producing similar outputs for different inputs. This results in the generator favoring ellipsoid output over the natural variability of real data. Neuron editing offers a solution to the limitations of GANs, which struggle with mode collapse and lack of natural variability in generated outputs. By learning an unsupervised model of the data space using an autoencoder, neuron editing isolates the variation in neuron activations to generate convincing distributions of post-transformation output. This approach is similar to word2vec embeddings in natural language processing, where meaningful transformations are represented as constant vectors in a latent space. Neuron editing is a method that transforms an entire distribution into another distribution, extending word2vec's vector arithmetic. It is compared to various generating methods like regularized autoencoder, GANs, ResnetGAN, and CycleGAN. The regularized autoencoder penalizes differences in distributions using maximal mean discrepancy. The image experiment involves convolutional layers with stride-two. The text chunk discusses penalizing differences in distributions using maximal mean discrepancy in a latent layer. It describes the use of convolutional layers in an image experiment and fully connected layers in other models. Training details such as minibatch size, optimizer, and learning rate are also mentioned. The chunk then introduces a motivational experiment on the CelebA dataset involving transforming images of people with black hair to blond hair. The text discusses the limitations of using generative models to change hair color in images, showing that the models struggle to generalize to out-of-sample data. The models often fail to accurately recreate the input image, especially in areas other than the hair color, and may only sometimes change the hair color. The regular GAN model struggles with artifacts when changing hair color, highlighting the benefits of stable training with an autoencoder. Neuron editing in the internal layer of a neural network simplifies complex transformations like changing hair color. Batch effects are technical artifacts in data that can lead to differences in datasets. They are a common issue in biological experiments, hindering data combination and potentially causing incorrect conclusions. Addressing batch effects is a goal of various models, including deep learning methods. One approach to tackle this problem is by repeatedly measuring a control set of cells with each sample and correcting based on the variation observed. One method to address batch effects in biological experiments is to measure a control set of cells with each sample and correct based on the variation observed. This approach was applied to a dataset from a mass cytometry experiment measuring protein levels in cells from individuals infected with dengue virus. The dataset includes Control1, Control2, Sample1, and Sample2 with varying dimensions. The dataset from a mass cytometry experiment includes Control1, Control2, Sample1, and Sample2 with varying dimensions. The controls reveal a batch effect with artificially low readings in InfG in Control1, while higher values of CCR6 in Sample1 are a true biological difference. The model aims to identify and compensate for variation without losing true biological differences. The GANs in the study fail to capture the biological difference in cells with high CCR6, mapping most cells to the same values. This results in a loss of important information and distorts the comparison between cells. The ResnetGAN also does not address this issue, as it is inherent to the generation objective. Neuron editing successfully removes batch effects and preserves real variation in protein levels, unlike other generative models. It accurately produces intended transformations for proteins InfG and CCR6. Neuron editing accurately produces intended transformations for proteins InfG and CCR6, confirmed globally across all dimensions. A PCA embedding shows accurate variation between controls and neuron-edited samples, preserving intra-sample variation. This offers additional corroboration that neuron editing reflects transformations accurately. The study demonstrates that neuron editing accurately reflects transformations in proteins InfG and CCR6, as confirmed by controls. Biological data from a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is analyzed, showing the correction of batch effects in IFNg while preserving true biological variation in CCR6. The autoencoder does not move the data at all. Neuron editing corrects batch effects in IFNg while preserving biological variation in CCR6 under different treatments. Measurements from mass cytometry on 41 dimensions are analyzed, with distinct datasets for each treatment. The study extrapolates effects from Das to Bez cells, accurately modeling changes in protein levels. The study extrapolates effects from Das to Bez cells, accurately modeling changes in protein levels. Neuron editing accurately models horizontal change without introducing vertical change or losing variation within the dataset. GAN models struggle to predict the real combination accurately, introducing additional vertical shifts and losing original variability. ResnetGAN, despite residual connections, faces similar issues as other models in mimicking the target distribution. The ResnetGAN, despite residual connections, faces challenges in mimicking the target distribution like other models using the generating approach. Neuron editing proves to be more accurate in predicting transformation across all dimensions and better preserving variation in the real data compared to GANs. Neuron editing, inspired by biological experimental settings, addresses the data-transformation problem by generating transformed versions of data based on observed pre-and post-transformation data. It utilizes the encoding learned by the latent layers of an autoencoder to apply treatment effects to the dataset beyond the subset where effects are measured. The study demonstrates that editing neurons in an internal layer of an autoencoder leads to realistic transformations of image data and accurately predicts synergistic effects of drug treatments in biological data. Learning edits in a hidden layer allows for complex data transformations in a non-linear dimensionality reduced space, enabling interactions with other context information during decoding. Future work could involve training parallel encoders with the same decoder or generating conditionally."
