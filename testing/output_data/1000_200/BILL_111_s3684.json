    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations, affects approximately 1,500,000 individuals in the United States. This blood vessel disease is characterized by vascular lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which can lead to serious clinical symptoms such as neurological deficits, seizures, stroke, or sudden death. Detection of these lesions requires costly medical imaging techniques, and individuals may not be aware of the disease until symptoms appear due to limited research on cavernous angioma. Due to limited research, cavernous angioma has no specific treatment regimen other than brain and spinal surgery. Some individuals may not be eligible for surgery, leading to a lack of treatment options. New Mexico has a high population density of cavernous angioma due to a specific disease-causing mutation passed down through generations. There is a shortage of physicians familiar with the disease, making timely diagnosis and appropriate care difficult to obtain. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world, affecting tens of thousands of individuals. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, emphasizes the need for increased research, awareness, and education on cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research through extramural centers of excellence at institutes of higher education. The need for a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is emphasized to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma in New Mexico and the United States. This center aims to provide a model medical system, facilitate research for a cure, and enhance medical care for individuals with cavernous angioma nationwide. The University of New Mexico has the programs and expertise to support this initiative. The University of New Mexico should establish a centralized Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma nationwide. SEC. 3. CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA CARE CENTER. Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a section on establishing Cavernous Angioma Care Centers of Excellence. The Director of NIH will establish a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico to conduct research and provide support for individuals with cavernous angioma. The center will consist of researchers, clinicians, and medical staff, including a medical director with expertise in cavernous angioma research and clinical care. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico will include a team of specialists such as a headache or pain specialist, epilepsy specialist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, dermatologist, nurse practitioner, nurse coordinator, research coordinator, clinical nurse, radiology specialist, and clinical vascular fellow. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico includes specialists in various fields such as headache, epilepsy, psychiatry, dermatology, nursing, research, radiology, vascular, and genetics. The center is affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school, offers training in neurological disease, and conducts research in cavernous angioma. It aims to recruit new researchers and clinicians, provide continuing medical education, and train postdoctoral fellows in cavernous angioma research. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico aims to recruit innovative researchers and clinicians, provide continuing medical education, and maintain patient advocacy and education programs. This includes launching a public awareness campaign, distributing patient education materials, educating school nurses for early detection, and coordinating patient and family support. The CARE Center for Cavernous Angioma aims to establish communication with other research institutions, facilitate clinical trials, and form an advisory board composed of individuals with cavernous angioma or their family members. The CARE Center for Cavernous Angioma is led by a Director with expertise in patient care and research. The center is composed of individuals with cavernous angioma or family members, patient advocacy group representatives, physicians, scientists, and institution affiliates. The Director's duties include promoting understanding and treatment of cavernous angioma and providing high-quality medical and surgical care. The Director of the CARE Center for Cavernous Angioma ensures community-centered care, promotes clinical research participation, and develops the center as a model facility for research and care. Reporting is required within 2 years. The CARE Center for Cavernous Angioma must report on its activities biannually to the Secretary, including progress, expenditures, and outcomes. Authorization of appropriations is required for establishment and operation. The CARE Center for Cavernous Angioma must report biannually to the Secretary on activities, progress, expenditures, and outcomes. Authorization of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2011 is provided for the Care Center's establishment and operation."
