    "content": "North Korea's development of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, along with illicit activities, has been a persistent challenge for U.S. foreign policy. Despite efforts since the 1990s, including negotiations and sanctions, North Korea's capabilities continue to grow. The U.S. has never had formal diplomatic relations with North Korea, but its interests in the region include security, political, and human rights concerns. The U.S. is obligated to defend its allies, South Korea and Japan, from any attack. The United States is obligated to defend South Korea and Japan from North Korean attacks due to bilateral military alliances. Tens of thousands of U.S. troops and civilians in these countries are at risk from North Korean missiles. North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities pose a threat to the U.S. homeland. Negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program impact U.S. relations with major regional powers like China and South Korea. North Korea's totalitarian regime, founded on the philosophy of juche, resists outside influences and has created one of the world's largest militaries. The Kim family's control enables the country to enter and break diplomatic agreements, influencing U.S. relations with major regional powers like China and South Korea. North Korea, a small country surrounded by more powerful neighbors, has built one of the world's largest militaries over the past 70 years. This militarization acts as a deterrent to outside intervention and gives Pyongyang leverage over foreign powers, allowing the regime to extract concessions. However, this same militarization, along with provocative behavior and opaque policymaking, has hindered economic growth by limiting interactions with the outside world. Despite signs of economic improvement, most of the population remains impoverished, and increased access to outside information could lead to discontent with the regime. With most of the population deeply impoverished, increasing access to outside information could lead to greater public discontent with the regime if growth does not continue. Congress influences U.S. policy on North Korea through sanctions legislation and the North Korean Human Rights Act, addressing human rights issues and accepting North Korean refugees. Past nuclear agreements authorized millions in energy assistance, with conditions on aid provision based on North Korean compliance. In future arrangements, if the United States agrees to provide aid in exchange for DPRK steps on denuclearization, Congress will need to authorize and appropriate funds. Congress has held hearings questioning North Korea's capabilities, intentions, human rights record, and sanctions evasion. North Korea's rapid advances in missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have shifted U.S. policymakers' assessment of the regime's threat. North Korea's accelerated nuclear and missile capabilities pose a significant threat to the United States, surpassing concerns in the Middle East and terrorism. Pyongyang's advancements include nuclear tests, long-range missile technology, submarine-based missiles, short-range artillery, and cyberattacks. The regime's sixth nuclear test in 2017 was its most powerful, with missile tests indicating a potential to reach the continental U.S. In 2017, North Korea demonstrated powerful missile capabilities, including tests that could reach the U.S. Pyongyang is developing a submarine-based ballistic missile program to evade U.S. defenses. The Trump Administration blamed North Korea for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack, leading to a \"maximum pressure\" policy to change North Korea's behavior through economic and diplomatic measures. The Trump Administration implemented policies to increase pressure on North Korea, including sanctions and urging other countries to sever ties with Pyongyang. This approach differed from previous administrations and led to the passing of four new sanctions resolutions by the United Nations Security Council. The Trump Administration implemented policies to increase pressure on North Korea, including sanctions and urging other countries to sever ties with Pyongyang. In a departure from previous Administrations, Trump emphasized the option of launching a preventive military strike against North Korea. There have been contradictory statements on U.S. conditions for negotiations and the possibility of a preventive strike. North Korea accepted an invitation to attend the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, leading to confusion about U.S. policy. North Korea accepted an invitation from ROK President Moon Jae-in to attend the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, leading to warmer North-South relations. This paved the way for a meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump in Singapore, following Kim's meetings with Moon and Xi Jinping. Kim's shift towards diplomacy, known as a \"charm offensive,\" was influenced by various factors, including harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration. Kim Jong-un pursued diplomacy due to factors like Trump's military rhetoric, sanctions limiting North Korea's economy, Moon Jae-in's outreach, and Kim's nuclear deterrent. He found willing counterparts in Moon, Xi, and Trump, leading to a summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018, where they discussed North Korea's nuclear program and future relations with the U.S. Trump committed to providing security guarantees. Following the summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018, Trump and Kim issued a joint statement committing to security guarantees for North Korea and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The agreement focused on establishing new bilateral relations, building a lasting peace regime, working towards denuclearization, and recovering the remains of U.S. troops. Notably, there was no mention of North Korea's ballistic missile program. The agreement following the summit in Singapore focused on security guarantees for North Korea, complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, establishing new bilateral relations, and recovering the remains of U.S. troops. Trump announced the suspension of annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises, aiming to save money and potentially withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. The cancellation of the \"Ulchi Freedom Guardian\" exercises was also announced by the Defense Department. After the summit, the Defense Department canceled the annual U.S.-South Korea \"Ulchi Freedom Guardian\" exercises in August. Analysts noted similarities to previous agreements with North Korea, but critics highlighted the lack of a timeframe and verification mechanisms for denuclearization. Uncertainties remain regarding denuclearization, the process sequencing, peace regime establishment, and diplomatic ties normalization. Some believe the agreement aims to secure peace, but concerns persist over Kim's commitment to dismantling the DPRK's ballistic missile program. Some analysts believe North Korea's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks is a tactic to delay and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Maintaining sanctions momentum is challenging amid engagement efforts, with U.N. sanctions crucial for holding North Korea accountable for its weapons programs. The UNSC, led by the United States, adopted resolutions imposing sanctions on North Korea for its weapons programs. A total of 10 sanctions resolutions were passed between 2006 and December 2017, expanding requirements for member states to halt interactions with North Korea. Initially targeting arms sales and materials for weapons programs, sanctions later included individuals involved in WMD activities and luxury goods transfers. Since North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January 2016, the UN has imposed six sanctions resolutions, with the most recent in December 2017. These sanctions ban financial interactions, trade in various sectors, and interactions with North Korea in different activities. As a result, most of North Korea's major exports are now prohibited in international markets, leading to a decline of over 30% in exports in 2017. The value of North Korean exports declined by over 30% in 2017 due to major export items being banned in international markets. The US, under the Obama and Trump Administrations, pushed for global countries to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. The US imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea, with Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump issuing executive orders targeting North Korea and its entities. The US, under the Obama and Trump Administrations, imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea through executive orders targeting North Korea and its entities. These sanctions limit trade to essential goods like food and medicine, prohibit financial transactions, and restrict new investments. Congress has also passed specific statutes to enhance sanctions on North Korea. The US imposes unilateral sanctions on North Korea, limiting trade to essential goods and prohibiting financial transactions. New investments are also restricted, and there are specific statutes to enhance sanctions. U.S. persons are prohibited from trading with designated North Korean entities, vessels, and individuals. Foreign financial institutions could face U.S. sanctions for facilitating transactions for DPRK entities. Travel to North Korea is limited and requires special authorization. North Korea's demands in negotiations have varied, including recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty with the US. Pyongyang's behavior fluctuates between cooperation and provocations, such as testing missiles and nuclear devices. Identifying patterns in North Korean behavior is challenging due to their changing approaches to the outside world. North Korea has a history of provocations, including testing long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear devices. Their willingness to negotiate is often driven by internal conditions like food shortages or economic desperation. North Korea exploits divisions among parties and political transitions to stall nuclear negotiations, leading to debates on the utility of negotiating with them. Some analysts believe negotiations are necessary to reduce conflict and feasible because Kim Jong-un's goal is economic development. Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development in 2018 is seen as a sign of potential denuclearization. Analysts believe North Korea may not give up its nuclear weapons voluntarily, despite potential inducements. Many analysts believe that North Korea will not voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons capability, viewing it as essential for regime survival. Pyongyang's frequent statements reaffirming its commitment to its nuclear program cast doubt on any intentions to denuclearize, despite past pledges and negotiations. North Korea has declared its nuclear weapons as non-negotiable and essential for regime security, even suggesting it will not disarm until all nuclear weapons are eliminated worldwide. The successful test of the Hwasong-15 missile in 2017 marked the completion of its state nuclear force. The 2011 intervention in Libya, which led to the abandonment of its nuclear program, may have reinforced the value of nuclear arms for North Korean leaders. The 2018 Singapore summit between the U.S. and North Korea may have unintentionally reinforced the perceived value of nuclear weapons for regime security. The summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state and satisfied some of its demands, such as canceling military exercises and easing sanctions. This may have led to North Korean leaders believing that nuclear weapons are necessary for their security against outside threats. The United States has engaged in various nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea, including the Agreed Framework, bilateral missile negotiations, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal. The negotiations typically involve North Korea halting its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for economic and diplomatic concessions. In 1986, U.S. intelligence detected North Korea's plutonium production reactor and reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, which were not monitored as required by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In the early 1990s, North Korea announced its intention to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) after obstructing International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. Former Clinton Administration officials considered a preemptive military strike on North Korea's nuclear facilities. Diplomatic efforts, including discussions at the UNSC and a mission from former President Jimmy Carter, led to the U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework. This agreement involved the U.S. providing North Korea with two light water reactor (LWR) nuclear power plants and heavy fuel oil in exchange for North Korea freezing and dismantling its plutonium program under IAEA supervision, with a path toward normalization of diplomatic and economic relations outlined. The Agreed Framework between the U.S. and North Korea involved North Korea freezing its plutonium program under IAEA supervision in exchange for diplomatic and economic normalization, security assurances, and the provision of light water reactors and heavy fuel oil. Despite delays, North Korea froze its plutonium program and received fuel oil, but failed to declare all nuclear facilities to the IAEA. Tensions escalated in 2002 when the U.S. accused North Korea of a secret uranium enrichment program, leading to the suspension of fuel oil shipments and reactor construction. North Korea then expelled IAEA inspectors from the Yongbyon site. In response to the United States halting fuel oil shipments and construction of LWRs, North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, withdrew from the NPT, and restarted its reactor and reprocessing facility. The Clinton Administration began negotiations with North Korea in 1996 to curb its missile program and exports. North Korea agreed to a missile testing moratorium in 1999 in exchange for lifting of U.S. sanctions. Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang in 2000 to finalize a new agreement on ballistic missiles. During the George W. Bush Administration, negotiations expanded to include China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia in an attempt to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Six rounds of the \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008 yielded occasional progress but ultimately failed to resolve the fundamental issue of North Korean nuclear arms. In 2005, a Joint Statement was issued where North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs in exchange for aid, a U.S. security guarantee, and talks over normalization of relations. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks for denuclearization. Key elements included coordinating with Japan and South Korea, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. Despite efforts, the process broke down due to challenges in verifying North Korea's compliance. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang through coordination with Japan and South Korea, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. U.S. officials sought a comprehensive package deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, but insisted on a freeze of nuclear activities and testing before negotiations. Additionally, the administration issued executive orders to implement U.N. sanctions and impose unilateral sanctions on entities involved in weapons proliferation and illicit activities in North Korea. Following the Obama Administration's policy of \"strategic patience\" towards North Korea, sanctions were imposed on entities involved in weapons proliferation and illicit activities, including money laundering, arms sales, and cyberattacks. President Obama issued E.O. 13687 after the Sony cyberattack, allowing the seizure of assets of designated DPRK officials. Despite attempts at engagement, provocations by Pyongyang led to a cycle of action and reaction, with the U.S. focusing on building consensus at the UNSC and pressuring North Korea. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests, missile launches, and uranium enrichment at Yongbyon in exchange for nutritional assistance and cultural exchanges from the Obama Administration. However, North Korea violated the agreement by launching a long-range rocket and conducting a nuclear test in 2013. The U.S. policy towards North Korea relies heavily on China, its largest trading partner and provider of essential aid. China prioritizes stability on the Korean Peninsula to prevent North Korea's collapse, despite not supporting its nuclear goals. Analysts believe Beijing fears the consequences of a humanitarian crisis and significant refugee flows. China prioritizes stability on the Korean Peninsula to prevent North Korea's collapse and sees strategic value in having North Korea as a buffer. Beijing often obstructs U.S. efforts to impose harsher punishments on North Korea in international forums, with Chinese companies violating sanctions and enforcement being uneven. However, in 2017, China increased its enforcement of UNSC sanctions. In 2017, China significantly increased enforcement of UNSC sanctions to deter US military strikes against North Korea. Chinese trade and aid to North Korea are limited, possibly to maintain a responsible image internationally. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang strained after Kim Jong-un's rise to power in 2011. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang suffered after Kim Jong-un's rise to power in 2011, with Beijing appearing displeased with Kim Jong-un's actions, including the execution of his uncle Jang Song-taek in 2013. Chinese President Xi Jinping had summits with South Korean leaders but did not meet with Kim. Chinese public opinion turned against North Korea, with many favoring a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. In 2017, China agreed to strict UNSC sanctions resolutions and appeared to be implementing them. Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts in 2018 improved North Korea-China relations. Kim traveled to Beijing before meeting Trump, signaling a desire to strengthen ties with China. Kim's actions, including deescalation of hostilities and cancelation of U.S.-South Korean military exercises, likely earned goodwill from China. Kim Jong-un's recent diplomatic victories, including deescalation of hostilities and cancelation of military exercises, have improved his relationship with Beijing. As the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea, his bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 suggests consolidated power within the regime. Kim Jong-un's assertiveness in world diplomacy solidifies his power in North Korea. He pursues economic development alongside nuclear weapons, avoiding external pressure to choose one. By achieving a \"limited nuclear deterrent,\" he seeks better relations with South Korea, China, and the US to prevent harsher sanctions. Some hoped for political reform, but his actions suggest otherwise. Since becoming supreme leader in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has ruthlessly consolidated power in North Korea through purges and executions of senior officials, including his own uncle. His actions demonstrate a strong desire to maintain the dynastic dictatorship intact, with over 300 officials replaced in his first four years in office. Kim's brutal leadership style was further highlighted by the assassination of his half-brother in 2017, believed to be authorized by Kim himself. Kim Jong-un has implemented significant changes in North Korea, replacing over 300 senior officials in his first four years in office. Unlike his father, Kim allows Western influences in public, appears informal in public appearances, and introduced his wife to the public. Analysts view these changes as an attempt to appear young and modern, reminiscent of his grandfather Kim Il-Sung. The couple's children remain hidden from the public eye. Kim Jong-un has implemented economic policy changes in North Korea that have spurred growth and improved living standards for many citizens. Despite being one of the world's poorest countries, North Korea has managed to evade international sanctions through increased domestic production and sanctions-evasion activities. Kim Jong-un's economic policy changes in North Korea have led to market principles governing some sectors, legalizing consumer and business-to-business markets, and emphasizing domestic manufacturing. International trade with China has facilitated this marketization process, with over 90% of North Korea's trade coming from China. Since 2016, China has accounted for over 90% of North Korea's trade, facilitating marketization. Agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have led to larger harvests since 2010. Despite stable food prices since 2012, over 10 million North Koreans still suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition. Analysts debate the extent of Kim's economic reforms. North Korea's economic reforms under Kim Jong Un are debated for their extent, with uncertainty over their similarity to past socialist reforms. The government's stance on marketization is unclear, with periodic crackdowns on market activity reported. Many North Koreans face limited access to healthcare and food shortages, despite the regime's claim of providing universal healthcare. In Pyongyang, healthcare facilities are better, but only accessible to the elite. In Pyongyang, healthcare facilities are better than in the rest of the country, but only the elite have access. The regime tightly controls residency in the capital based on loyalty, limiting access to quality medical care. North Koreans struggle to afford medications and bribes for doctors. The government tries to restrict outside information flow, but some citizens are turning to foreign news sources. The regime attempts to jam foreign broadcasts like VOA, RFA, and the BBC. The North Korean government tries to prevent citizens from listening to foreign broadcasts by jamming stations like VOA, RFA, and the BBC. Despite efforts to alter radios, some citizens have illegal or modified radios to access foreign programs. A 2015 survey found that 29% of North Korean defectors listened to foreign broadcasts. North Korea restarted a mobile phone network in 2009, with over 3 million subscribers in 2017. Reports suggest that some North Korean cadres consume foreign media and are involved in smuggling and selling operations. Increased access to information through the use of Chinese cellphones near the North Korean border could potentially lead to positive changes in the political system, as some North Korean cadres are involved in smuggling and selling operations. A 2015 survey revealed that 28% of North Koreans owned domestic mobile phones, with 15% using them to access sensitive media content. This increased access to information could weaken the Kim regime, according to Thae Yong-ho. Increased access to information through Chinese cellphones near the North Korean border could weaken the Kim regime, as it could inform citizens about their living conditions and encourage them to question their regime. The North Korean military is one of the largest in the world, with significant defense spending. Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to Britain, believes that outside sources of information could be the Achilles Heel of the regime. North Korea relies heavily on military capabilities, with a significant portion of its forces stationed near the DMZ for quick deployment. The country prioritizes developing nuclear weapons, long-range missiles, and cyber warfare capabilities to offset deficiencies in its conventional forces. Additionally, North Korea possesses chemical and possibly biological weapons, making it a significant threat according to U.S. intelligence assessments. North Korea has developed offensive cyber operations capabilities, with 6,000 cyber warfare troops according to South Korea's Defense Ministry. Despite weakened conventional military capabilities, North Korea could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. In the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula, the United States and South Korea are expected to prevail, but at a high cost due to North Korean artillery forces. Analysts estimate that North Korean artillery forces, fortified in underground facilities, could fire thousands of rounds at Seoul in the first hour of a war. North Korean military equipment is outdated compared to the US and South Korea. North Korea has been focusing on improving its asymmetric capabilities in recent years, such as UAVs, cyber operations, special forces, GPS jamming, and electromagnetic pulse technology. They have also made advancements in long-range artillery, tanks, infantry weapons, and unmanned aerial vehicles. North Korea has made advancements in long-range artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, infantry weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles, surface-to-air missiles, ballistic missile-capable submarines, and special operations forces. The military suffers from institutional weaknesses due to a highly centralized command and control structure, limiting independent actions. War plans are inflexible and mid-level officers lack training and authority. General resource scarcity affects the country. The military in North Korea faces institutional weaknesses with a centralized command structure, lack of training for mid-level officers, and general resource scarcity impacting readiness. Concerns persist over the pace of their nuclear weapons development and the purpose behind it, despite talks of denuclearization with the United States. The United States is in talks with North Korea about denuclearization, but the intelligence community is skeptical of Pyongyang's willingness to give up its nuclear weapons. North Korea sees its nuclear arsenal as vital for survival and aims to deter attacks from the US by developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified warheads. North Korea has been developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified nuclear warheads, conducting six tests since 2006. Despite announcing the end of nuclear tests in 2018, fissile material production continues. The program began in the late 1950s with Soviet cooperation. The North Korean nuclear program started in the late 1950s with Soviet cooperation near Yongbyon. They built a small nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium. The reactor and reprocessing facility have been alternately operational and frozen under safeguards since the 1994 Agreed Framework and the Six Party Talks. Since 2008, North Korea has restarted its 5MW(e) reactor. North Korea's nuclear program, initially plutonium-based, has also developed a uranium enrichment program for alternative weapons material. They have produced 30-40 kilograms of separated plutonium, enough for several nuclear weapons. North Korea acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, claiming it is for nuclear power fuel production. In 2010, they displayed early construction of a 100 MWT light-water reactor to American experts. In 2010, North Korea displayed early construction of a 100 MWT light-water reactor and a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant at the Yongbyon site. The enrichment plant's operational status remains unconfirmed, with suspicions of other clandestine facilities. Reports in 2018 identified a potential enrichment site at Kangson. Estimates on North Korea's warhead and material stockpiles are challenging due to lack of transparency. Scholarly analyses provide scenarios for the amount of fissile material produced by 2020 and potential nuclear warhead numbers. North Korea's ballistic missile technology development has been a top priority, with over 80 test launches since 2011 under Kim Jong-un. In 2016, they conducted 26 ballistic missile tests, and in 2017, 18 tests were carried out, including suspected ICBM trials. Estimates suggest North Korea could have 20 to 100 warheads by 2020 based on fissile material production scenarios. North Korea conducted 18 ballistic missile tests in 2017, including suspected ICBM trials. They have approximately 700 short-range ballistic missiles, but their effectiveness is limited. The main goal of North Korea's nuclear weapons program is to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range missiles. The Nodong missile poses a near-term threat to the Korean Peninsula, mainland Japan, and potentially the U.S. The Nodong missile poses a near-term threat to the Korean Peninsula, mainland Japan, and potentially the U.S. North Korea has the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on the Nodong missile and has displayed mock-ups of ICBMs. In 2017, North Korea conducted two ICBM tests. North Korea has shown progress in its missile programs, including medium-range ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. They are also transitioning towards solid rocket motors for their missiles, with successful tests leading to mass production plans. The focus now seems to be on developing capabilities to counter missile defenses. North Korea is focusing on developing ballistic missiles to defeat missile defenses like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Tests in 2016 showed missiles launched at higher altitudes and shorter ranges, making interception more difficult. In 2017, North Korea demonstrated the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession, indicating a goal of conducting large ballistic missile attacks with large raid sizes. North Korea's progress with SLBMs suggests an effort to counter land-based THAAD missile defenses by launching attacks from sea positions outside the radar field of view. The United States has previously attempted to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program, but talks have not led to concrete agreements. The Clinton Administration pledged to lift economic sanctions in exchange for promises from Kim Jong-il, but negotiations failed. The Bush Administration prioritized the North Korean nuclear program over ballistic missiles. UN resolutions imposed restrictions on North Korea's missile activities, which were violated in 2009. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on ballistic missile tests. Recent talks have not addressed missiles specifically, but U.S. reports indicate North Korea's active biological and chemical weapons programs. North Korea's active biological and chemical weapons programs are a concern, with reports indicating a large arsenal of chemical weapons including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas. Estimates suggest they have multiple facilities for production and storage, with a production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons in a typical year. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense estimates their current inventory to be between 2,500 to 5,000 tons. North Korea's chemical weapons program poses a significant threat, with a potential inventory of 2,500 to 5,000 tons. A RAND analysis warns that one ton of sarin could cause mass casualties. North Korea is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention and is suspected of maintaining a biological weapons production capability. North Korea is suspected of maintaining a biological weapons production capability, with a longstanding infrastructure to support it. The country also has a munitions production capacity to weaponize biological agents. South Korea's Ministry of National Defense estimated in 2012 that North Korea possesses anthrax and smallpox, among other weapons agents. Additionally, North Korea's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile-related technology is a serious concern for the United States, as they have sold missile parts and technology to several countries. North Korea has been a key source of hard currency for the Kim regime through missile tests and has assisted Syria with building a nuclear reactor. There have been transfers of chemical weapons-related materials to Syria by North Korea, and cooperation between North Korea and Iran on missile development since the 1980s. China may have also assisted the North Korean missile program. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn foreign currency, including selling heavy transport vehicles to North Korea for missile purposes. They are involved in trafficking drugs, counterfeit currency, cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals through a global network of entities. The United States has not prioritized countering these activities, which provide crucial support for the regime. Office 39 oversees many of these illicit dealings. North Korea's Office 39 oversees illicit activities that generate significant foreign currency for the regime, including producing methamphetamine and supplying international smuggling networks. The country has also been involved in smuggling illegal narcotics and cheap Cold War-era weapons. It is unclear whether these activities are directed by state authorities or local criminal gangs. North Korea is a provider of cheap Cold War-era weapons, selling arms to states in the Middle East and North Africa. In August 2016, a shipment of rocket-propelled grenades was seized outside the Suez Canal, allegedly destined for the Egyptian military. North Korea cooperates with Iran and Syria, developing ballistic missiles with Iran and supplying weapons to Syria. The regime uses front companies in China to conceal its illicit activities and access the international financial system. North Korean regime uses front companies in China to conceal illicit activities and access international financial system. Chinese companies set up partnerships with North Korean diplomats to keep regime's earnings in overseas bank accounts, avoiding repatriation to North Korea. US government sanctions companies aiding North Korean regime, such as banning Bank of Dandong for facilitating illicit financial activity. In 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department banned Bank of Dandong, a Chinese bank, for facilitating illicit North Korean financial activity. Previously, Banco Delta Asia in Macau was identified for distributing North Korean counterfeit currency and laundering money for the country's criminal enterprises. The North Koreans boycotted talks until frozen funds were returned. Congress has addressed North Korea's human rights record through bills and hearings. The State Department and private organizations report on the dire situation of most North Koreans. The State Department and private organizations have reported on the dire human rights situation in North Korea, highlighting extreme abuses by the regime. Reports emphasize the lack of political, civil, and religious freedoms, with no room for dissent or criticism of leadership. Citizens face severe physical abuse for violating laws, and there are prison camps holding political prisoners, including their families. The system of prison camps in North Korea, known as kwanliso, houses around 100,000 political prisoners and their family members. Conditions in the camps are extremely harsh, leading to high mortality rates. Reports indicate that close to 400,000 prisoners died in captivity due to starvation, disease, executions, and torture. Nonpolitical prisoners in local-level centers also face dire conditions. The United Nations has been actively addressing human rights violations in North Korea, with a focus on the harsh conditions in prison camps where political prisoners and their families are held. The number of political prisoners has decreased due to high mortality rates in the camps. In 2013, the UN Human Rights Council established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the widespread violations in North Korea, aiming to ensure accountability for potential crimes against humanity. The Commission of Inquiry (COI) investigated human rights violations in North Korea, concluding that the regime committed \"crimes against humanity.\" Despite recommendations to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court (ICC), no action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. In 2017, the UN Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of human rights abuses in the country. The UN Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of human rights violations in North Korea, which could be used for future prosecutions. Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to China to escape food shortages and persecution, facing further abuse and trafficking risks. The UNHCR has not been granted access to conduct a systematic survey on the situation. Reports indicate that many women and children are victims of human trafficking, especially women lured to China for a better life but forced into marriage or prostitution. Some North Korean refugees make their way to Southeast Asia, seeking passage to South Korea where they receive citizenship. The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased in recent years, possibly due to tightened border patrols. Elite defections in 2016 highlighted a changing demographic profile of defectors. The changing demographic profile of North Korean defectors has shifted towards those with good social status, possibly due to increased border security. Diplomats are under pressure to earn foreign currency, leading some to defect if unable to meet expectations. Elite defectors risk imprisonment or execution if caught, with many fleeing to China where thousands are in hiding. China has been implicated for its strict policies towards North Korean escapees. China has been implicated for its strict policies towards North Korean escapees, with between 50,000 and 200,000 in hiding. The U.N. Commission of Inquiry accused China of aiding crimes against humanity by repatriating defectors. China denies the allegations and continues to cooperate with North Korea in arresting and repatriating refugees. China has intensified its crackdown on North Korean groups and redoubled efforts to repatriate border crossers, contravening the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention. North Korean defectors are labeled as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deported, facing imprisonment, torture, and executions upon return. Assistance to refugees is illegal in China, but political refugees who reach foreign embassies and consulates may be allowed to leave the country. Beijing allows defectors to leave the country to reach foreign embassies and consulates. Despite facing imprisonment, torture, and executions upon return, Beijing maintains its policy of repatriation to preserve China-North Korea ties. The Chinese government fears destabilization from North Korean defections and the regime's collapse. The North Korean Human Rights Act was passed in 2004 to address these issues. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was passed in 2004 to support human rights efforts in North Korea. It authorized funds for information flow improvement and asylum applications for North Koreans in the US. The act also called for nonhumanitarian assistance to be linked to human rights improvements. Congress reauthorized the NKHRA in 2008, 2012, and 2018. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was reauthorized by Congress in 2008, 2012, and 2018, with amendments made each time. The 2018 reauthorization bill emphasized increasing freedom of information into North Korea and enhancing efforts to resettle North Korean refugees. President Trump signed the 2018 bill into law. Analysts have raised concerns about North Korea's overseas workers and their working conditions. The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report has consistently cited North Korea's overseas-labor program, highlighting the exploitative working conditions faced by the laborers. Workers are subjected to long hours, with some working up to 20 hours a day, and the regime takes a significant portion of their earnings. The workers' families remain in North Korea, and government minders monitor them while they are abroad. North Korea's overseas-labor program exploits workers who endure long hours, with the regime taking a large portion of their earnings. The program has been in place for decades, with workers sent to various countries. The Trump Administration and Congress have taken steps to pressure foreign governments to send these workers home by 2019. The US has imposed sanctions on North Korea, prohibiting their goods from entering the country and sanctioning foreign entities using North Korean labor. The US provided over $1.2 billion in aid to North Korea between 1995 and 2008, with assistance ending in 2009. Energy aid was tied to progress in talks that broke down in 2009. In 2008, Congress enabled expanded assistance for North Korea's nuclear disablement process, but funding requests were rejected after North Korea's actions in 2009. U.S. food aid ended in early 2009 due to disagreements with Pyongyang. North Korea has periodically appealed for international support since then. The abrogated Leap Day Agreement would have provided 240,000 metric tons. In 1990-1992, North Korea engaged with US officials to discuss recovering POW-MIAs. In 1996, joint investigations were agreed upon to recover US servicemen's remains. In 1996, North Korea and the United States agreed to conduct joint investigations to recover the remains of U.S. servicemen from the Korean War. Despite difficulties, 229 sets of remains were recovered, with 107 successfully identified. However, in 2005, the Department of Defense suspended all joint field activities due to North Korea's nuclear ambitions and safety concerns for search teams. Between 1996 and 2005, the DOD provided North Korea with over $20 million for assistance in recovering remains of U.S. servicemen. Talks on joint recovery programs resumed in 2011, but were suspended in 2012 due to North Korea's rocket launch. The U.S. has not undertaken any joint field activities with North Korea since 2005. In 2014, North Korean state media warned about the remains of U.S. POW-MIAs. In October 2014, North Korean state media warned about the remains of U.S. POW-MIAs being in danger of damage or displacement. The Department of Defense has stated that recovering the remains of missing U.S. soldiers is a top priority. Trump and Kim committed to recovering POW/MIA remains at the June 2018 Singapore summit. In late July, North Korea turned over 55 cases of remains to the United Nations Command. According to Trump, the last-minute addition to the summit's agenda was the repatriation of 55 cases of remains from North Korea to the U.S. military for examination. North Korea's delay in transferring the remains was reportedly due to a request for payment, which the U.S. does not provide. Aid to North Korea has mainly come from government contributions, with some NGOs involved in capacity building and exchanges in various fields. NGOs play smaller roles in capacity building and people-to-people exchanges in areas like agriculture, health, informal diplomacy, information science, and education. Some U.S.-based NGOs maintain good working relationships with North Korean counterparts despite turbulent relations. These NGOs have diverse aims, including joint ventures between academic and diplomatic NGOs, as well as religious organizations providing humanitarian aid and promoting peaceful relations through people-to-people ties in North Korea. Many NGOs working in North Korea aim to promote peaceful relations through people-to-people ties, but have faced challenges due to U.S. sanctions and restrictions on travel to North Korea.
