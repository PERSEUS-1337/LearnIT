    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, falling from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000. The majority of job losses occurred after November 2008, with a small uptick in employment in November 2009. Despite this, the number of jobs on employer payrolls fell the following month. Private and public employers have since increased aggregate employment, with the number of jobs rising to 130,470,000 in July 2010. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been most affected by job losses. Service-providing industries like education and health services have continued to add workers. The service-providing sector peaked in December 2007, with job losses outweighing gains in industries like financial activities due to the housing market collapse. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, the pattern following past recessions suggests an uninterrupted trend. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, historical data shows that sustained job growth may not be immediate. Job growth typically occurred within three to five months after previous recessions, but in some cases, it took up to 22 months for steady job growth to begin. Congress has historically directed funds towards infrastructure projects to create jobs during economic downturns. During economic downturns, federal spending is often directed towards infrastructure projects for job creation. This includes traditional heavy and civil construction activities as well as green economic activities. Green jobs involve industries utilizing renewable resources and producing energy-efficient goods and services. Despite numerous studies, a consistent definition of green jobs is currently lacking. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, including green economic activities like renewable energy and energy-efficient goods. It examines how job creation estimates are developed, models for calculating nationwide and state-specific job numbers, and the challenges in estimating jobs supported by green economic activities. The difficulties in estimating the number of jobs supported by expenditures on green economic activities are highlighted, emphasizing the caution needed when using these estimates. Interest in job creation arises during economic downturns and when policymakers compare stimulus options or shift expenditures between budget categories. Input-output (I-O) models are commonly used to estimate job creation due to their cost-effectiveness. An input-output (I-O) model is used to estimate job creation by economic activities, showing how sales value is distributed across industries. For example, an I-O table can display the value of products like roof trusses and bricks used in construction. Employment requirements are then calculated based on industry productivity estimates. Employment requirements are derived from productivity estimates for each industry at a particular point in time. The total employment requirement associated with a given type of final demand is an approximation of both direct and indirect employment supported by economic activity. It is expressed as the number of jobs per billion dollars of expenditures. An employment requirements table is a matrix showing the number of jobs supported in each industry by an expenditure of one billion dollars in a specific industry. An employment requirements table allows estimation of the impact of expenditures on different industries and types of economic activities. Input-output models freeze technology and productivity, so the job-generating potential of current economic activities may differ from past periods due to technological advancements. The impact of economic activities may vary over time due to technological advancements and changes in price levels. Estimates of job creation may not always align with actual numbers, especially during periods of high economic activity. Input-output models do not account for resource constraints or differentiate between imported and domestically produced goods. During economic downturns, input-output tables may overstate domestic employment impacts by not differentiating between imported and domestically produced goods. They also do not account for full-time equivalents, which can skew job creation estimates for programs relying on part-time workers. A comprehensive job estimate includes direct and indirect job creation from economic activities. The multiplier effect in job creation considers direct, indirect, and induced jobs resulting from economic activities. Induced jobs depend on spending by workers in direct and indirect jobs, but estimating the multiplier is challenging. Factors like spending versus saving habits and economic conditions impact the actual number of jobs created. The multiplier effect in job creation considers direct, indirect, and induced jobs resulting from economic activities. Estimates of the multiplier effect vary widely, with different studies using different multipliers. The Federal Highway Administration's estimate of the employment impact of federal spending on roads is widely cited, with the most recent update indicating that $1.25 billion in highway construction expenditure supported a significant number of jobs. The FHWA's most recent update in 2007 shows that $1.25 billion in highway construction expenditure, with $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from state government, could support 34,779 jobs. Without a state match, $1 billion in Federal funds supports 27,800 jobs. The number of jobs has decreased due to rising input costs like asphalt and diesel fuel. The estimate breaks down to 9,536 construction-oriented jobs and 4,324 jobs in supporting industries per billion dollars of federal spending on highways. The FHWA's analysis shows that $1.25 billion in highway construction expenditure, with $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from state government, could support 34,779 jobs. Induced jobs, accounting for half of the total estimate, are dependent on consumer expenditures from wages of workers in construction-oriented and industry-supporting jobs. Specific projects and local utilization ratios can alter the estimated number of jobs supported. The FHWA states that highway spending has been used to justify economic stimulus packages, but funds for projects other than short-term resurfacing are slow to spend. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment requirements tables for assessing the impact of different policies on employment. These tables are publicly available and based on official I-O tables for the nation. The BLS develops employment requirements tables based on official I-O tables from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis every five years. These tables reflect 2006 production and distribution technologies and labor productivity. The construction industry is covered in the employment requirements table, which was last updated in late 2008. The construction industry is divided into three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. Around 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion spending in construction, with the majority in the industry itself. The BLS employment requirements table for construction expenditures is slightly lower than the direct and indirect jobs figure. The BLS employment requirements table for construction expenditures is lower than the direct and indirect jobs figure for highway expenditures from the FHWA. Potential reasons for the difference include industry definition, data sources, model updating method, and time period. BLS does not provide details on other construction types like public school construction. The survey data on construction activities is outdated, with estimates from RIMS II by BEA. The BEA provides estimates of employment, earnings, and output in various industries based on additional spending. Using the 1997 benchmark I-O or the 2006 annual I-O adjusted by regional data, the BEA offers these estimates at the subnational level for a fee. Each state's job creation estimates vary due to differences in industry mix, affecting their ability to supply goods for construction. Each state's capacity to supply goods for construction projects varies due to differences in industry mix and earnings. Estimating jobs dependent on green infrastructure activities is challenging as current data collection methods do not identify green industries separately. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) does not distinguish green industries, such as those utilizing renewable resources or minimizing energy use. For example, the electric utility industry is disaggregated into various sources of energy production like hydroelectric, fossil fuel, nuclear, and others. The electric utility industry is disaggregated into different sources of energy production, including hydroelectric, fossil fuel, nuclear, and other categories. Renewable sources like wind, solar, and biomass are grouped under \"other.\" The conventional I-O model may not accurately estimate the number of jobs supported by green activities due to differences in input mixes. Similarly, the construction industry lacks a unique category for retrofitting, which requires a different mix of inputs compared to new construction projects. Retrofitting buildings, such as for energy efficiency, requires a different mix of inputs compared to new construction projects. This poses a challenge for conventional input-output models used in analyzing green job creation. One study addressed this issue by creating synthetic industries to account for sectors like wind, solar, biomass, building retrofitting, and mass transit, which are not specifically recognized in existing data sources. The researchers combined industries like farming, forestry, wood products, and refining to create the biomass industry. Green job estimates are often based on different assumptions and timeframes, including direct and indirect jobs supported by shifts in energy sources. Some reports also include induced employment, but this is not always clear, and results may be specific to a particular state. Some analyses on green job estimates are specific to a particular state and may not be generalizable to other areas due to different state economies. Assumptions and methodologies underlying job creation estimates are often unclear, making review of results difficult. Studies on green economy strategies were not initially intended to quickly stabilize or increase jobs during the recession. The September 2008 report, Green Recovery: A Program to Create Jobs and Start Building a Low-Carbon Economy, commissioned by the Center for American Progress, proposed a $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" that could create almost 2 million jobs. A $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" proposed by the Apollo Alliance could create or preserve nearly 2 million jobs. The program includes federal spending on public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and tax credits for building retrofits. Some strategies can deliver results within a year, while others may take up to two years to implement. The Apollo Alliance proposed The Apollo Economic Recovery Act in 2008, aiming to create 5 million green-collar jobs through a $500 billion program. The initiative includes federal spending of $50 billion to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs. Job creation figures are based on spending-to-jobs relationships estimated by other organizations, with allocations for improving the electric grid, repairing roads and bridges, and replacing aging buses and trains with clean-energy alternatives. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $8 billion for repairing roads and bridges, $8 billion for replacing aging buses and trains with clean-energy vehicles, and emphasized the need for tracking job creation resulting from the legislation. Congress addressed this issue in bill language more than previous Congresses, requiring entities receiving ARRA funds to report estimates of direct jobs created by infrastructure projects quarterly. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated recipients of funds to report estimates of direct jobs created by infrastructure projects quarterly. Recipients were required to submit the information in October 2009, with federal agencies posting the reports online 30 days after each quarter. The Office of Management and Budget provided guidance for job estimates, and the Congressional Budget Office and Government Accountability Office reviewed the estimates within 45 days. Self-reported data showed 633,342 jobs saved or retained through September 30, 2009. Based on self-reporting, 633,342 jobs were saved or retained through September 30, 2009. OMB revised its guidance on jobs saved to define them as positions funded by the Recovery Act, leading recipients to report 608,311 jobs funded by ARRA. Based on the definition provided in December 2009, recipients reported that 608,311 jobs were funded by ARRA in the fourth quarter of 2009. Another 682,370 jobs were created or saved at ARRA recipients in the first quarter of 2010. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) was tasked with submitting quarterly reports on the impact of ARRA provisions on employment and economic indicators. The first CEA report was issued in September 2009, estimating that ARRA may have added around one million jobs in August 2009. Based on two estimating procedures, ARRA may have added around one million jobs to employer payrolls in August 2009. CBO provided a broader estimate of the impact of ARRA beyond direct government purchases, grants, and loans, using macroeconomic models and historical relationships. Based on CBO and CEA estimates, ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases may have added between 600,000 to 2.1 million jobs by September 2009. CEA's estimate of 1.0-1.1 million additional jobs aligns with CBO's findings. Additionally, CEA's report in January 2010 suggested that ARRA could have raised year-end employment by 1.7-1.9 million jobs, while CBO estimated an increase of 1.0-2.1 million jobs in the fourth quarter of 2009. The CEA and CBO reports on ARRA's impact on employment showed estimates ranging from 1.0-2.8 million additional jobs by the first quarter of 2010. The CEA's fourth quarterly report in 2010 suggested that ARRA may have increased employment by 2.5-3.6 million jobs in the second quarter. The CEA estimated that public investment outlays under ARRA may have increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 and by over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter."
