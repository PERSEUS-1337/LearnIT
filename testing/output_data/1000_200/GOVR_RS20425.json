Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite TV services through their DBS systems. Rainbow DBS, a subsidiary of Cablevision, also provides satellite channels through Voom. SHVIA allows consumers greater access to broadcast network television programming via satellite dishes. The 1999 law, SHVIA, allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals in addition to distant network signals. Local signals are received within a network affiliate's local area, while distant signals come from elsewhere in the country. This distinction is important for understanding SHVIA. The SHVA law established criteria for receiving distant network signals via satellite based on the Grade B contour. Consumers inside the contour were not eligible, while those outside could receive them. Court challenges arose when some satellite companies transmitted signals to ineligible households. In 1998, a Miami judge ruled to terminate distant network signals for over 2 million consumers. In 1998, a Miami judge ruled to terminate distant network signals for over 2 million consumers. The SHVA law established criteria for receiving distant network signals via satellite based on the Grade B contour. New subscribers must not be able to receive a signal of Grade B intensity to receive distant network signals. The FCC concluded that the Grade B standard should still be used for the purposes of SHVIA. The FCC concluded that the Grade B standard should still be used for SHVIA purposes. Consumers can seek a waiver from their satellite company to receive distant network signals if they believe they are not receiving a Grade A or Grade B signal. The local affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting the waiver, after which consumers may receive distant network signals from the satellite company. If the waiver is denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test. Consumers can request a signal intensity test from their satellite company if a waiver is denied. The cost of the test is covered by the \"loser\" (either the satellite company or the affiliate). Exceptions are made for recreational vehicles, commercial trucks, and consumers using large \"C-band\" satellite dishes. These consumers may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004. Consumers may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004 if they do not receive a Grade B signal from the local affiliate, have a satellite dish on an RV or commercial truck, or had illegal signals terminated. \"C-band\" dish users can receive signals indefinitely. SHVIA allows DBS companies to provide \"local-into-local\" service in designated market areas. DBS companies can provide \"local-into-local\" service in designated market areas, but it is not required by law. Under the \"must carry\" provision, DBS companies must carry all local broadcast stations in a market if they choose to provide any local station in that market. This does not mean they have to carry local broadcast programming nationwide. Cable companies were already subject to similar regulations. DBS companies are not required by law to provide \"local-into-local\" service in designated market areas, but must carry all local broadcast stations in a market if they choose to offer any local station. The must carry provisions for DBS went into effect on January 1, 2002, and despite opposition from DBS companies, the requirement remains. As of October 2004, EchoStar offered local-into-local in 152 markets and DirecTV in 106 markets, with plans to expand as capacity allows. However, there are 210 designated market areas in the United States, meaning many smaller communities do not receive local signals via satellite. EchoStar and DirecTV are expanding their local-into-local services to reach more designated market areas (DMAs). EchoStar reported that 83% of the population could receive its service when it passed the 100 DMA mark. DirecTV aims to provide local-into-local in at least 130 DMAs by the end of 2004, covering 92% of TV households. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to ensure small and rural areas without access to local-into-local service from these providers can still receive local television through other technologies. Compulsory copyright licenses are also a concern for satellite carriers retransmitting programming. The 1999 law extended the compulsory copyright license for distant network signals until December 31, 2004. The 108th Congress is considering whether to extend it further and change how prices are set. Satellite companies have a royalty-free permanent compulsory copyright license for retransmitting local signals. Cable also has a permanent compulsory copyright license. The SHVIA provisions allow satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service and make must-carry requirements effective for satellites on January 1, 2002. It also applies syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations. Subscribers affected by the 1998 Miami court rulings can have their distant network signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004.

Subscribers affected by the 1998 Miami court rulings can have their distant network signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004. The legislation retains the Grade B signal intensity standard for receiving distant network signals, allows waivers for signal strength doubts, limits distant network signals for certain vehicles, and extends the satellite copyright compulsory license until December 31, 2004. The SHVIA provisions extend the satellite copyright compulsory license until December 31, 2004, reduce royalty payments for satellite companies, eliminate the waiting period for cable subscribers, and allow national PBS feed until January 1, 2002. H.R. 1554 would have created a loan guarantee program for small and rural markets to benefit from local-into-local provisions. The loan guarantee program proposed in H.R. 1554 aimed to benefit subscribers in small and rural markets with local-into-local provisions. However, the provision was removed due to objections by Senator Gramm. Instead, the \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) was passed, creating a board to select recipients for loan guarantees of up to $1.25 billion. These loans could be used to build systems ensuring access to television for consumers. The LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program, established by the \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act,\" aims to provide loan guarantees of up to $1.25 billion for projects that ensure access to local television signals nationwide. The program prioritizes serving \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas and providing high-speed Internet access. The Board issued regulations for the program in December 2003, with an application period ending in April 2004. Only one incomplete application was received, prompting the Board to return it and unanimously vote to reopen applications. The Board voted to return an incomplete application received after the April 21, 2004 deadline. They then decided to open another 60-day application period but rescinded that decision on July 6. The loan guarantee program is administered by the Rural Utilities Service and received funding from the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. GAO criticized the slow progress of the program in their reports. The FCC was required to select an independent entity to test for interference between terrestrial systems and DBS satellites in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, known as the \"Northpoint provision\". Northpoint Technology's subsidiary, Broadwave, seeks to offer TV programming and data services through a terrestrial wireless system called MVDDS. This band has previously been assigned only to satellites. The FCC licensed MVDDS for terrestrial service in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, previously assigned to satellites. MITRE conducted interference tests in 2001, concluding MVDDS and DBS could co-exist with mitigating techniques. FCC decided to auction frequencies instead of granting licenses, leading to objections from Northpoint. Other companies participated in the auction, which was completed on January 27, 2004. The FCC auctioned frequencies in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band instead of granting licenses, leading to objections from Northpoint. The auction raised $118.7 million on January 27, 2004. Legislation proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services in that band."
