    "content": "The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for graduate medical schools outside the US and Canada to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. Congress finds that three for-profit Caribbean medical schools receive a significant portion of Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act, despite being exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements as other foreign medical schools. The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation recommends that all foreign medical schools should meet the same eligibility requirements for Federal funding. The attrition rate at US medical schools was 3.4% in 2014, while for-profit Caribbean medical schools can reach 30%. Residency match rates for foreign-trained graduates in 2016 were 54%, compared to 94% for US graduates. Students at for-profit medical schools outside the US and Canada accumulate more debt than those in the US. SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 60 percent of enrolled and graduating students at a foreign medical school are not described in section 484(a)(5) in the year before seeking a loan under part D of title IV. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 75 percent of individuals from foreign medical schools pass exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in the year before seeking a loan under part D of title IV. The Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017 amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to set an expiration date for the authority of graduate medical schools to qualify for loan programs under part D of title IV. If a graduate medical school loses eligibility for loan programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965, enrolled students can still receive loans while meeting academic progress requirements until they withdraw, complete their program, or the fourth June 30 after the loss of eligibility."
