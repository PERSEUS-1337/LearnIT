    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" It includes findings related to the development of electricity and environmental technology. Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for the growing US economy. The increasing use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, competitive electricity market, and rising energy prices highlight the importance of clean electricity. Coal, the most abundant fossil energy resource in the US, currently generates over half of the country's electricity and can sustain the nation for 250 years at current usage rates. Investments in electricity generating facility emissions control technology over the past 30 years have reduced pollutants from coal-based generating facilities by 21 percent. Continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental performance from electricity generating facilities would allow continued use of coal and preserve less abundant energy resources for other uses. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can eliminate health-threatening emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50 percent. Initial commercial deployment of these technologies is crucial. The initial commercial deployment of new coal generation technologies poses significant risks in a competitive electricity market. Continued research for near-zero emissions in coal-based generation is important for environmental improvement. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cost and performance goals\" refers to those established under section 4, and \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will assess cost and performance goals for technologies enabling the competitive use of coal for electricity, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel in 2007, 2015, and 2020. Consultation with various stakeholders is required. The Secretary will issue draft cost and performance goals for public comment within 120 days of the Act's enactment, and submit the final goals to Congress within 180 days after considering public feedback. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs for achieving goals. The Secretary must develop recommendations for technology development programs in cooperation with industry to achieve cost and performance goals. Expert advice from representatives of relevant entities must be considered. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a research and development program on coal-based technologies under various Acts to achieve cost and performance goals. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for sections 4, 5, and 6. This funding is in addition to existing authorizations and does not limit Department of Energy fossil energy research and development. Additionally, there is a Clean Coal Power Commercial Applications Initiative. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for power plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards and may include new technologies not previously considered for commercial use. A plan must be submitted to Congress within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will submit a plan to Congress within 120 days of the Act's enactment, detailing program elements, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies at electric generation units. The plan aims to improve design efficiency by at least 3 percent compared to current standards. The plan aims to achieve a significant improvement in environmental performance related to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or mercury control, as well as recycling a significant portion of coal combustion or gasification wastes. The plan focuses on reducing environmental impact from coal-based generating units by capturing and reusing carbon dioxide at a lower cost than current technologies. The plan aims to reduce environmental impact from coal-based generating units by capturing and reusing carbon dioxide at a lower cost than current technologies. Financial assistance is provided for this purpose. The Secretary will solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve performance levels outlined in the plan. Projects must demonstrate improved design efficiency without increasing emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, or carbon monoxide. The Secretary will solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve performance levels outlined in the plan, including reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide. The emission levels for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter are specified based on heat input or boiler type. The Secretary shall provide financial assistance to projects that involve emission levels for pollutants specified in the Clean Air Act or the production of coal combustion byproducts with economic value. The Secretary provides financial assistance to projects reducing coal usage costs, enhancing coal competitiveness, meeting electricity needs, and applicable to 25% of coal-based electricity facilities. The Federal share of project costs funded under this section does not exceed 50%. The Federal share of project costs funded under this section shall not exceed 50%. Authorization of appropriations is set at $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 through 2012, with alternative funding sources available to the Secretary."
