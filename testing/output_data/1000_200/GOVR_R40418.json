Various government departments have expanded their high-containment laboratory capacity to study dangerous pathogens, playing a crucial role in biodefense efforts. The federal government increased funding for biodefense after 9/11 and the anthrax attacks, focusing on expanding laboratory capacity to study dangerous pathogens. Funding for civilian biodefense rose from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008, supporting academic and industrial researchers. This influx of funds and researchers has raised concerns about aging laboratory infrastructure and limited capacity. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories internationally has raised new policy questions regarding laboratory capacity, federal investment, consolidation vs. dispersion, and optimal size/type of laboratories. Coordination among agencies expanding capacity is also being questioned. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about the need for a coordinated plan to manage risks and benefits. Policymakers are interested in increasing oversight following incidents and community resistance. The federal government regulates these laboratories, focusing on biosecurity and biosafety. This report focuses on the federal government's regulation of high containment laboratories, explaining biosecurity and biosafety concepts, oversight mechanisms, proliferation of such labs, issues facing policymakers, and policy options for consideration. Biosecurity involves securing pathogens from theft, while biosafety aims to reduce infection risks. Both are closely related but have distinct practices and oversight mechanisms. The federal government established the Select Agent Program in 1996 to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. This program identifies select agents for potential bioterrorist attacks and regulates their transfer. The federal government established the Select Agent Program in 1996 to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. The 2001 anthrax mailings increased interest in bioterrorism threats, leading to the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. These laws increased restrictions on the possession of select agents, requiring entities to develop security and biosafety plans certified by the government. The Select Agent Program oversees regulation of select agents possession, transfer, and use, focusing on individuals with access to select agents and facilities where they are used. The Select Agent Program regulates possession, transfer, and use of select agents. Scientists must register with the federal government for access, undergo background checks, and obtain nontransferable permits valid for five years. Facilities using select agents must develop security plans submitted to HHS or USDA for review and audit. CDC conducts announced inspections for regulatory compliance. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and CDC regulate facilities working with select agents. Inspections are conducted every three years for compliance. Noncompliance can result in fines or violations of the USA PATRIOT Act. Around 390 entities are certified to work with select agents, with the majority being state or local government-owned. The federal government has developed a Laboratory Response Network linking state or local public health laboratories to handle dangerous pathogens. Tensions have risen in academia over the Select Agent Program, with some entities transferring or destroying their access to select agents. The Select Agent Program has faced criticism for being too burdensome, leading to entities either transferring or destroying their select agent inventories. Investigations by agency Inspectors General have highlighted non-compliance with select agent regulations among universities and laboratories. The USDA IG found that APHIS controls over registered entities and compliance with select agent regulations were incomplete. Several entities, including Texas A&M University, have faced suspensions and fines for violations of select agent regulations. The HHS OIG has fined 12 organizations a total of $1,887,000 for non-compliance. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens acknowledge the risk of contracting them. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens generally acknowledge the risk of contracting the disease under study and the potential of accidentally releasing a pathogen into the environment. Best practices to mitigate these risks have been developed over time, with formal guidelines issued by the U.S. government in the 1970s and 1980s. The CDC and NIH have established four main levels of biosafety (BSL-1 to BSL-4) to guide laboratory researchers in safe handling of biological agents. Each biosafety level is associated with specific protections. The current BMBL guidelines provide criteria for defining biosafety levels and best practices for safe laboratory operation. These levels are associated with specific physical and procedural protections, with higher levels recommended for more dangerous pathogens. The term \"high-containment laboratory\" typically refers to BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities. The guidelines aim to protect laboratory workers from the specific risks posed by different pathogens. The BMBL guidelines provide criteria for defining biosafety levels, including best practices for safe laboratory operation. Biosafety levels are linked to specific pathogens and experiments, with primary and secondary barriers to infection outlined. The most recent edition also includes security guidelines. Researchers and laboratory workers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing the laboratory. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen and its potential risks. The BMBL guidelines outline biosafety levels for handling pathogens based on their potential risks and the research procedures being conducted. Activities are categorized into BSL-1 to BSL-4 depending on the pathogen's transmission potential and treatment availability. Researchers must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing the laboratory to ensure safe handling of potentially deadly pathogens. The BMBL guidelines recommend biosafety levels for handling pathogens based on their risks and research procedures. Certain deadly pathogens can be safely handled at lower biosafety levels for specific activities. For example, anthrax bacteria can be handled at BSL-2 for certain activities and at BSL-3 for others. Thirteen out of 73 select agents and toxins require BSL-4 containment for any procedure. The BMBL guidelines recommend biosafety levels for handling pathogens based on their risks and research procedures. Thirteen out of 73 select agents and toxins require BSL-4 containment for any procedure, while 30 others may be studied at BSL-2 containment depending on the circumstances. BSL-4 facilities in the United States work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program, while BSL-3 facilities may not always use select agents and are not always subject to select agent regulations. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is typically voluntary, but some mandatory adoption and compliance requirements exist. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is often voluntary but widely adopted. Some mandatory requirements exist, such as for federal contracts and grants. Noncompliance can lead to loss of funding. Various laboratories appoint health and safety officials to ensure equipment operation and guideline compliance. Select Agent Program-regulated labs must consider BMBL guidelines for security plans. The BMBL guidelines are essential for biosafety in security plans, incorporated into building design standards, grant requirements, and federal regulations. Federal facilities and those funded by federal agencies adhere to these guidelines, including security requirements specified in separate documents. For high-containment laboratories, NIH issues checklists for compliance. The NIH issues checklists to ensure compliance with security requirements for high-containment laboratories before occupancy. The commissioning process, guided by NIH, involves testing and certification of laboratories to meet biosafety guidelines established by HHS through the BMBL. Other agencies also follow similar processes, often contracting out the commissioning of laboratories to third-party companies not involved in the facility's design or construction. The NIH recommends commissioning or certifying high-containment laboratories through third-party companies not involved in design or construction. Individuals overseeing this process should be specialized, licensed Professional Engineers with extensive experience in facility systems. Non-compliance with biosafety guidelines could result in the withdrawal of federal funding for laboratories receiving federal grants. The NIH recommends certifying high-containment laboratories through third-party companies. Non-compliance with biosafety guidelines could lead to the withdrawal of federal funding. Grantee organizations must adhere to BMBL guidelines to maintain federal funding. The grantee must create an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) to oversee compliance with federal guidelines for recombinant DNA research. The IBC determines biosafety levels and can require specific precautions. Some suggest expanding IBC oversight to other research areas, but concerns exist about its effectiveness. The Select Agent Program incorporates BMBL guidelines for oversight. The Select Agent Program regulations require entities possessing select agents to develop security and biosafety plans following BMBL guidelines. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in the United States has increased significantly in recent years due to federal construction and funding. The number of high-containment laboratories in the United States has increased twelve-fold since 2004, driven by federal construction and funding for research activities. Examples of federal investment in biocontainment laboratories are provided by the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture. The investment is creating both government-owned and privately operated facilities. The Department of Defense has maintained high-containment laboratories since World War II, focusing on defensive research and developing countermeasures against biological weapons. USAMRIID in Frederick, MD is the only DOD location with BSL-4 lab space. The United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Frederick, MD is the sole DOD location with BSL-4 lab space. The DOD is expanding its facilities at USAMRIID with a $683 million project to increase BSL-3 and BSL-4 lab space. Other DOD labs have also enhanced their BSL-3 capacity since 2001 for research, vaccine evaluation, and disease outbreak testing. The federal government established the National Bioforensics Analysis Center in response to the anthrax mailings, assigning bioforensic responsibility to the Department of Homeland Security in 2004. The center, part of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, is located at USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, with permanent facilities, including a BSL-4 laboratory, under construction and expected to be fully operational in 2010. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS, which contains BSL-3 facilities. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS, which contains BSL-3 facilities. DHS is establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to replace PIADC, with a main goal of researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. The NBAF will be a BSL-4 laboratory in Kansas, expanding research capabilities for animal pathogens requiring high biocontainment. The DHS announced the decision to site the NBAF in Kansas, which will be a BSL-4 laboratory. HHS maintains BSL-4 laboratories at NIH in Bethesda, MD, and at CDC in Atlanta, GA. They are also constructing two NBLs in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX, along with thirteen RBLs across the United States. These facilities will support research on pathogens and assist in public health efforts during emergencies. The HHS is constructing two NBLs in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX, along with RBLs dispersed throughout the United States. The LRN is a network of laboratories that respond to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies, including federal and state facilities with BSL-3 capabilities. The USDA will conduct research in these laboratories. The USDA is constructing new BSL-3 laboratories in Ames, IA and Fort Collins, CO. Academic institutions are investing in high-containment laboratory facilities to increase their ability to compete for federal funding and recruit new faculty. Examples include the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University. The University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University are examples of academic institutions investing in high-containment laboratory facilities to compete for federal funding and recruit new faculty. Private sector companies and non-profit institutions also have such facilities for medical testing and product development purposes. Some companies have in-house high-containment labs while others contract with firms like Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and Battelle Memorial Institute. The expansion of these labs raises issues for policymakers. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has raised issues for policymakers regarding determining appropriate capacity, increasing oversight, balancing desire for more capacity with increased risk, international ramifications, and local concerns. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers realized the existing infrastructure was insufficient, leading to the decision to construct additional high-containment laboratory space with federal support to avoid over-building capacity. The capital and maintenance costs of high-containment laboratories require federal investment and support to avoid over-building capacity. Decision-making for these facilities lacked a national needs assessment, leading to concerns of exceeding national needs or safe operation. Lack of information on existing laboratory capacity hinders coordinated planning efforts. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified 277 domestic BSL-3 laboratories, but its survey had a low response rate. DHS and HHS estimated 630 BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, criticized by experts. Government Accountability Office couldn't definitively determine the number of high-containment laboratories. Nongovernmental estimates show a significant increase in high-containment laboratory capability, with a rise in BSL-3 laboratories documented by the Government Accountability Office. A government-wide assessment involving multiple federal agencies may be needed to determine if construction has exceeded future national needs. Congress may need to decide on conducting a survey at the agency level or through an external coordinating body. Increased funding for research, operations, and management will be necessary to fully utilize the additional capacity in high-containment facilities. Increased funding may be needed for agencies to fully utilize additional capacity in high-containment facilities, leading to pressure for larger research budgets. Interagency federal planning efforts could help manage overcapacity costs, but would require agreement on prioritization and shared facility use among agencies. Individual agency initiatives may struggle to address synergies or redundancies between agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security's role in high-containment laboratory capacity. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about potential pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Congress may need to consider central coordination or agency-level coordination for multi-agency high-containment laboratory use. Pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation from high-containment laboratories have raised concerns. There is a debate on the oversight framework, with some calling for stricter federal regulations, while others suggest enhancing self-regulatory measures like mandatory biosafety training. Increased high-containment laboratory capacity has benefits such as diverse research and efficient testing, but also raises concerns about theft and accidental release of pathogens. Previous legislation addressed security issues through the Select Agent Program. The Select Agent Program aims to enhance physical security in high-containment facilities to prevent theft of dangerous pathogens. Despite efforts to minimize accidents, incidents can still occur and overwhelm safety measures. Regulatory focus on compliance with the program may help reduce security weaknesses identified by GAO and agency inspectors general. The GAO has testified that high-containment facilities have inherent risks, which increase with the construction of additional facilities. The incremental risk is challenging to measure and depends on factors like accidental releases, subsequent illnesses, and the number of laboratories. Policymakers may need to conduct a cost/benefit analysis to estimate the benefits of research in these facilities versus the costs of potential infectious releases. The potential benefits and costs of research in high-containment laboratories are a concern for policymakers. Benefits include breakthroughs in biodefense research, while costs may involve the loss of infected animals or infection of laboratory workers. Policy decisions may be influenced by high-profile incidents rather than a thorough evaluation of risks and benefits. Personnel surety, such as the \"insider threat,\" is also a significant concern with the expansion of high-containment facilities. The expansion of high-containment laboratories requires additional trained technicians, scientists, and employees to utilize the increased capacity. Concerns about personnel surety, specifically the \"insider threat,\" arise as more individuals receive training in high-containment techniques. Some experts believe that malicious intent could be present among trained individuals, citing the 2001 anthrax mailings as an example. The increase in high-containment capacity may be perceived internationally as excessive for biodefense and health research, potentially leading to suspicions about the United States' intentions. The expansion of high-containment laboratories may be perceived internationally as excessive, potentially leading to suspicions about the United States' intentions. This perception could damage U.S. efforts to promote adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention and may encourage other countries to build similar facilities, increasing the risk of malevolent use of high-containment techniques. Differences in biosafety regulations among countries could impact business decisions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The location of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in different countries could impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. Foreign production of disease treatments may lead to reduced access to countermeasures during international crises. Governments may hoard domestically produced countermeasures, affecting international collaborations among scientists. The differences in biosecurity regulations between countries have caused some U.S. scientists to limit their international collaborations, potentially hindering the scientific process. This could lead to industry investing in countries with perceived lower barriers to collaboration. The impact of biosecurity regulations on international collaboration and research remains unclear, but U.S. standards may influence other countries to adopt similar policies. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the U.S. has faced varying levels of local opposition. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States has faced local resistance, with some groups supporting the economic benefits while others oppose it for public health and quality of life reasons. Policymakers have various options to address these issues. Policymakers have options to address issues with high-containment laboratories, including stepping up oversight or deferring action until expert panel reports are complete. Balancing security controls with research productivity is crucial, with potential trade-offs between additional oversight and scientific progress. The scientific community supports measures to reduce terrorists acquiring deadly pathogens, but opposes measures hindering research. Some argue current oversight for high-containment labs is enough, as additional measures may impede scientific progress. Supporters of the status quo suggest focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists rather than increasing lab security. The Bush Administration established expert groups to address biosafety and biosecurity issues, suggesting a focus on disrupting individual bioterrorist activities rather than implementing costly regulatory frameworks. Policymakers may defer action to fully understand policy options and impacts. President Bush established the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States in 2009 through an Executive Order, co-chaired by the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services, with members from various government departments. Congress could endorse ongoing efforts by expert groups to address biosafety and biosecurity issues, while some policymakers may call for additional studies. The Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States, established by President Bush in 2009, includes members from various government departments and is tasked with reviewing and evaluating biosafety and biosecurity laws and practices. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight was formed by HHS in 2007 to address oversight of research in this area. In 2007, a task force was established to develop an options paper addressing biosafety and biocontainment oversight of high-containment laboratories. Co-chaired by HHS and USDA, the task force includes staff from various government departments. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies related to dual-use research. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies for oversight of dual-use research, including a code of conduct and biosafety training programs. Multiple working groups are producing analysis and recommendations. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 on high-containment laboratory issues with potential legislative and executive branch recommendations. Congress may benefit from waiting for these recommendations to avoid duplication and generate new policy ideas. Previous efforts have failed to determine the number and capacity of high-containment laboratories, prompting calls for a comprehensive inventory. Congress may choose to wait for recommendations from various groups or address the issue without delay. Efforts are being made to compile a comprehensive inventory of non-federal high-containment laboratories, located in various institutions and facilities. Challenges include the complexity of identifying existing facilities, capturing future construction/expansion, and concerns about industrial competitiveness and reporting burden. Incentivizing self-reporting may increase participation in obtaining a complete inventory. Efforts are being made to compile a comprehensive inventory of non-federal high-containment laboratories. Incentivizing self-reporting or mandating registration with penalties could help create a complete list of these facilities, providing valuable information on laboratory capacity and distribution. The government could require federal facilities to report their high-containment facilities and capacity to Congress, allowing for efficient planning and resource allocation. Comparing the needs assessment with existing federal capacity can help determine if there is an overexpansion of high-containment facilities. The government may need to assess if federal high-containment capacity exceeds the actual need to avoid overexpansion. Congress should consider the economic costs of surveying high-containment laboratories and compare this data with a needs assessment. Some policymakers suggest a moratorium on new federally funded high-containment laboratory construction. Some policymakers have called for a moratorium on new federally funded construction of high-containment laboratories to avoid overbuilding and redundant operations. Incremental increases in capacity may be more beneficial than large constructions. Some policymakers advocate for a moratorium on new federally funded construction of high-containment laboratories to prevent overbuilding. Incremental capacity increases may be more effective than large constructions. Agencies argue that existing infrastructure is outdated and not suitable for expansion, but without a government-wide assessment, potential synergies or available infrastructure in other agencies may be overlooked. Enacting a construction moratorium on high-containment laboratories could delay national research goals and priorities, such as establishing a permanent bioforensics capability. Calls for expanding specific facilities may be hindered, and some suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment labs. Currently, only labs handling select agents require federal registration and certification. One approach to licensing high-containment laboratories is to apply Select Agent Program requirements to all labs, ensuring uniform security standards. Alternatively, a separately administered licensing program could offer flexibility in requirements. Establishing a separately administered program for laboratory licensing could provide flexibility in requirements, especially for high-containment facilities handling select agents. However, challenges exist in implementing and gaining acceptance for licensing and certification mandates. A more comprehensive approach would involve overseeing all laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment to ensure biosecurity standards are met. A different approach to biosecurity oversight could involve expanding the select agent list to capture dangerous pathogens not covered by the current regulations. Some experts argue that certain diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are not included in the Select Agent Program. Some dangerous pathogens not covered by the Select Agent regulations include SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever, which have been considered as biological weapons. Expanding the regulated pathogens would lead to more high-containment facilities being regulated. Some scientists are concerned about the select agent list's construction and resist its expansion, arguing that the current definition may hinder research by not accurately differentiating between pathogens of concern and similar non-concerning pathogens. The NIH has requested the National Academies to determine scientific advances necessary to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy. Focusing on the Select Agent list would only impact entities using pathogens of concern, not all high-containment facilities. This approach could limit disruption of scientific development and public health activities, allowing regulatory efforts to target high-risk laboratories. Background checks for personnel in BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities could be expanded. The DOJ Inspector General has identified background checks for personnel in high-containment facilities as sharing requirements with other security regimes. Different levels of background screening may be needed based on the risks associated with accessing these facilities. Implementing enhanced personnel oversight may face challenges, including resistance from laboratory researchers. The implementation of enhanced personnel oversight in high-containment laboratories may face challenges, including potential resistance from laboratory researchers to government documentation and certification. The Department of Defense has extensive personnel oversight programs, but the DOJ has cited a DOD scientist in the 2001 anthrax mailings as an example of oversight failure. The Select Agent Program requires worker training tailored to individual needs, work tasks, and risks posed by select agents. The regulations emphasize the need for training tailored to individual needs, work tasks, and risks posed by select agents. Experts suggest that current biosafety training programs are insufficient and should be expanded, possibly through mandatory federal certification. The impact of such training on reducing laboratory-acquired infections is uncertain. Enhanced biosafety training, including considerations for biosecurity and dual-use pathogens, may improve understanding and address vulnerabilities in high-containment laboratories. Reporting mechanisms for accidents and near accidents can help disseminate lessons learned within the laboratory worker community. Enhanced biosafety training and reporting mechanisms for accidents are crucial in high-containment laboratories to disseminate lessons learned and improve practices. Suggestions include establishing a database of accidents and corresponding remediation to prevent future incidents. A database of accidents in high-containment laboratories could provide warnings to scientists, with recommendations to minimize penalties for reporting accidents. Policymakers must balance oversight and regulatory burden when implementing such programs. Policymakers must balance oversight and regulatory burden when considering expanding the Select Agent Program to reduce opportunities for misuse in biological weapons pursuit. Critics argue that such expansion could hinder public health response to emerging diseases by impeding timely material transfer between high-containment laboratories. The response to emerging diseases like SARS and avian influenza relies on efficient material transfer between high-containment labs. Expanding the Select Agent Program may create barriers to collaboration, impacting public health response. International collaboration on regulated pathogens could be hindered due to differing security regimes. Licensing and certification requirements may significantly affect regulated entities, reducing scientific productivity and increasing costs for public health labs and hospitals. The licensure requirement may reduce scientific productivity in academic and industrial sectors, increase costs for public health labs and hospitals, and require more federal resources for inspections. Identifying the appropriate oversight agency is a key issue, with USDA and HHS being considered suitable regulators. Concerns historically focused on lab worker safety and pathogen release risks, but now include homeland security threats like pathogen theft. Many concerns focus on laboratory worker safety and preventing pathogen accidental release. Homeland security issues, such as pathogen theft and malicious training, may lead policymakers to consider assigning oversight to another agency like DHS. Existing authorities could be augmented for oversight, or new authorities could be created, potentially leading to a mix of oversight responsibilities. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones, including the possibility of consolidating oversight into one agency, is crucial for smooth implementation of new oversight responsibilities. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to address issues related to biosafety practices for high-containment laboratories. Bills such as H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the authorization of the Select Agent Program and expand oversight criteria. Additional funding and staffing may be required for agencies to meet new mandates. Bills H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the Select Agent Program authorization, expand oversight criteria, and require improvements recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. Mandatory biosafety and biosecurity training would be implemented, along with enhanced monitoring and inventory procedures. Reporting to Congress on capacity evaluation and sharing best practices across biodefense and infectious disease communities would also be required. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) directs the establishment of a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System for voluntary reporting of biosafety incidents. It authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories and requires a report to Congress on integrating the RBL network and BSL-3 laboratory surge activities. The report to Congress will detail activities integrating the RBL network and assess the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity in response to biodefense or infectious disease emergencies. International coordination is crucial to address the threat of high-containment laboratories being used for bioterrorism. Congressional policymakers face the challenge of defining the goal of enhanced oversight for these laboratories, which will impact policy decisions. Focusing on a registry of existing high-containment laboratory capacity could aid in planning. When considering policy options for high-containment laboratories, policymakers must balance security benefits with regulatory burden, cost, and impact on scientific progress. Reconciling competing national needs is essential in addressing complex policy issues."
