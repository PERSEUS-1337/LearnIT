    "content": "The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of unemployed individuals in the civilian labor force age 16 and older. It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total labor force. The rate can fluctuate based on changes in both the number of unemployed workers and the size of the labor force. The unemployment rate is influenced not only by the number of jobless workers but also by changes in the labor force size. During a recession, the labor force may shrink as discouraged workers stop looking for jobs. Conversely, it may grow if people believe the economy is improving. The unemployment rate is a lagging economic indicator, improving after other signs of recovery. Firms are cautious about hiring until they are confident in economic stability. During a recession, firms are hesitant to hire new workers until they are certain of economic growth. They may increase production by extending current employees' hours or having them work overtime instead. Job growth may not immediately follow signs of economic recovery. Labor market analysts rely on the Current Employment Statistics program for job data from nonfarm employers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) conducts an establishment survey each month to gather job data from nonfarm employers, which is considered more accurate than household surveys. The Business Cycle Dating Committee uses GDP and employment trends from this survey to determine recession periods. The U.S. economy has had 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. Unemployment rates typically continue to rise even after recessions end. The unemployment rate typically continues to rise even after recessions end, peaking at the bottom of the business cycle in some instances. In other cases, it peaks well into the economic recovery period. The unemployment rate continued to rise for months after the end of several recessions, with job growth not picking up until later in the economic recovery period. In most cases, sustained job growth did not occur until several months after the recession ended, except for a brief recession in 1980. The delayed improvement in the labor market following the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions led to jobless recoveries, with job growth not picking up until well over a year after the recession's end. Despite private sector employment starting to rise in January 2010, fiscal issues in local governments have slowed overall job growth."
