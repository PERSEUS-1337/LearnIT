    "content": "The \"Rural Land Conservation Act of 1993\" is cited in this section, which focuses on amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Additionally, it addresses the estate tax treatment of land under a qualified conservation easement. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 focuses on estate tax treatment for land under a qualified conservation easement. If the executor elects, the value of such land (minus any debt) can be excluded from the gross estate. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for the exclusion of the value of land under a qualified conservation easement from the gross estate for estate tax purposes. Land subject to a qualified conservation easement is defined as land located in or within 50 miles of a metropolitan area or national park. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amendment excludes land under a qualified conservation easement from the gross estate for estate tax purposes. The land must be within 50 miles of a park, owned by the decedent or their family for 3 years before death, and have a qualified conservation contribution made by the decedent or their family. Certain contributions are not included for this purpose. The estate tax code amendment excludes land under a qualified conservation easement from the gross estate. If the donor retained any development right when the contribution was made, an additional estate tax is imposed. The term 'member of the decedent's family' is defined as per section 2032A(e)(2). An additional estate tax is imposed on the first person disposing of property after the decedent's death if a contribution with retained development rights was made. The tax amount is based on the increase in estate tax liability that would have occurred if the development right value had been included in the gross estate. The tax imposed on property disposition requires payment by April 15 of the following year, with a pro rata portion for partial dispositions. The tax on property disposition must be paid by April 15 of the following year, with a pro rata portion for partial dispositions. A \"development right\" refers to the right to establish or use structures for commercial purposes not directly supportive of the conservation purpose. The election under this subsection for land subject to qualified conservation easement must be made on the tax return and is irrevocable. The executor making the election computes the additional estate tax due. The executor must file a 'Notice of Potential Estate Tax Due' in the locality where the land with a qualified conservation easement is located. The computation and filing must be done as prescribed by the Secretary. Additionally, Section 1014(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended regarding the basis of property acquired from a decedent. The basis of property excluded from the gross estate of the decedent under section 2031(c) is amended. The effective date for these amendments is for estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1992, including land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after that date. Gift tax on land subject to a qualified conservation easement. Gift Tax With Respect to Land Subject to a Qualified Conservation Easement: The transfer of land subject to a qualified conservation easement may not be considered a gift for tax purposes, upon the donor's election. This applies to land with retained development rights as well. The additional gift tax is imposed on the first person disposing of property subject to retained development rights after the gift is made. The tax amount is based on the increase in gift tax liability that would have occurred if the development right had been treated as a gift. The amendments made by this section apply to gifts of land subject to qualified conservation easements granted after December 31, 1992. SEC. 4 amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow for qualified conservation contributions where surface and mineral rights are separated, with a special rule for properties with remote probability of surface mining. The effective date is contributions made after December 31, 1992. SEC. 5 states that qualified conservation contributions are not considered a disposition. (a) Qualified Conservation Contribution Is Not a Disposition.-- Subsection (c) of section 2032A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to clarify that a qualified conservation contribution by gift or otherwise shall not be treated as a disposition for tax purposes. If real property is subject to a qualified conservation easement, this subsection does not apply to that property. (b) Land Subject to a Qualified Conservation Easement Is Not Disqualified.-- Subsection (b) of section 2032A is amended to ensure that land subject to a qualified conservation easement is not disqualified from certain valuation methods. The amendment to section 2032A of the Internal Revenue Code clarifies that property with a qualified conservation easement remains qualified real property. This amendment applies to estates of decedents who passed away after December 31, 1992, and includes land with qualified conservation easements granted after that date."
