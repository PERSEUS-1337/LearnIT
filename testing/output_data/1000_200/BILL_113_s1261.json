    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" is the short title of the Act. It focuses on energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technologies. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies, requiring collaboration between Federal agencies and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop best practices for using such technologies. The Federal agency must develop a flexible, cost-effective implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies. This strategy should be based on the agency's specific operating requirements and statutory mission. The Federal agency must implement efficient data center strategies, ICT power management, building information modeling, and secure telework tools to increase efficiency and utilization. Performance goals must be established within 180 days of enactment. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish performance goals for Federal agencies to improve energy-efficient information and communications technology systems. This includes specifications and benchmarks for data center operators to make informed decisions on energy efficiency and cost savings, with an overall Federal target. The performance goals established for Federal agencies aim to improve energy efficiency in data centers, focusing on metrics like Power Usage Effectiveness, asset utilization, and acquisition methods like energy savings performance contracting. The Director shall maintain a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force comprised of acquisition methods to measure information technology costs, cost savings from energy-efficient solutions, and provide a complete picture of all costs and savings. The Director will maintain a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force consisting of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. The task force will collaborate to achieve agency and Federal energy efficiency goals, and share best practices with the private sector. The Federal agencies are required to report their efforts and results on energy efficiency, while the Director will include a description of these efforts in the annual report and scorecard starting from October 1, 2013. Federal agencies must report their efforts and results on energy efficiency as required by the Energy Policy Act of 2007. Federal agencies are required to report on their energy efficiency efforts under the Energy Policy Act of 2007, including measures to improve energy efficiency in data centers. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization to coordinate energy efficiency programs and conduct a study by December 31, 2013. The Secretary, with assistance from the Administrator, is required to update the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency by December 31, 2013. This update should include a comparison of estimates from 2007 to 2012, an analysis of the impact of information technologies, and infrastructure solutions like virtualization and cloud computing. The Secretary, in collaboration with designated organizations, will update projections and recommendations for infrastructure solutions like virtualization and cloud computing in public and private sectors. Additionally, a Data Center Energy Practitioner Program will be maintained to certify energy practitioners for evaluating energy usage and efficiency in data centers. The Federal agencies must have their data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified energy practitioners. Additionally, an open data initiative will be established to make Federal data center energy usage data accessible. The Secretary will establish an initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while protecting national security interests. Collaboration will occur to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency. An efficiency metric will be developed to measure the overall data center's energy efficiency. The Secretary will establish an initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while protecting national security interests. Collaboration will occur to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency. A new efficiency metric will be developed to measure the energy efficiency of the overall data center."
