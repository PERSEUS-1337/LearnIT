    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Instructional Level Assessment Pilot Program. This program aims to assess students' instructional levels. The Secretary will award grants to State educational agencies for pilot programs to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency and provide quality instruction. Grants will be for a 3-year period. States must apply for the grant and meet eligibility criteria set by the Secretary. To be eligible for a grant, a State must not need intervention in implementing requirements, have alternate assessments for modified academic standards, identify at least 5 local education agencies for participation, and provide guidance to those agencies. The State must provide guidance to local education agencies on student selection, assessment tools, and data collection for a pilot program. Participating agencies must have a response to intervention approach in place to ensure quality instruction for all students. Monitoring and oversight of agencies is required, including reviewing documentation. The pilot program for students with disabilities involves reviewing documentation by the IEP Team to ensure appropriate identification. Participation is limited to 0.5% of the student population in each agency, with the IEP Team determining the need for alternate assessments. The pilot program requires participating local educational agencies to ensure that the student's IEP Team has determined the appropriateness of the alternate assessment, provided written consent from parents, and ensured quality instruction in grade-level content. The IEP Team must analyze various data sources before assessing the student. The pilot program requires local educational agencies to analyze data sources to determine the appropriateness of alternate assessments, obtain parental consent, and provide quality instruction. The IEP Team must then use response to intervention approaches, teacher recommendations, and other data to assess if the student is performing significantly below grade level in reading or math. Based on this assessment, targeted interventions must be developed and implemented by the local education agency. The IEP Team will develop targeted interventions to remediate identified gaps in student's knowledge. Data from instructional assessments cannot determine proficiency levels or adequate yearly progress. Local education agencies must participate in reporting. The educational agency must show adequate yearly progress as per section 1111(b). Local education agencies in the pilot program will report on student progress towards grade level proficiency using valid assessments. State education agencies will report on the number of students in the pilot and progress towards closing proficiency gaps. The Secretary will use data collected to inform a report to Congress on student progress in closing the gap between instructional and grade level proficiency. $5,000,000 is authorized for grants under this section for fiscal year 2008."
