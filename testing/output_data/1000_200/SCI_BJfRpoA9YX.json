    "content": "We propose a generative model architecture to learn image representations that separate object identity from attributes. This allows for manipulation of image attributes without changing the object's identity. The success of our approach is demonstrated by synthesizing images with and without specific attributes. Our model successfully separates object identity from attributes, allowing for image attribute manipulation. It achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks using latent space generative models like GANs and VAEs. The latent space learned by these models is organized in a near-linear fashion, with certain directions corresponding to changes in attribute intensity. In latent space, directions correspond to attribute changes in images, useful for image synthesis and editing. Latent space generative models can be used for class conditional image synthesis, including fine-grain subcategories like different dog breeds. The text discusses using latent space generative models for synthesizing images with attribute manipulation, such as changing a person's facial expression. This differs from fine-grain synthesis as it focuses on editing specific attributes while keeping the overall similarity between images. The paper proposes a new model for learning a factored representation of faces to separate attribute information from facial features. It focuses on training a VAE encoder with a novel cost function to factorize binary facial attributes from continuous identity representation. The model is applied to the CelebA BID21 dataset for controlling facial attributes. The paper introduces a model that separates facial attribute information from identity representation using a VAE encoder. It includes quantitative analysis of loss components, competitive classification scores, successful attribute editing, and code for experiment reproduction. The model distinguishes between conditional image synthesis and attribute editing, highlighting Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks as state-of-the-art generative models. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are state-of-the-art generative models that allow synthesis of novel data samples from latent encodings. VAE consists of an encoder and decoder, trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p(x). The encoder predicts \u00b5 and \u03c3 for a given input x, and a latent sample is drawn from the encoder. KL-divergence can be calculated analytically with a multivariate Gaussian prior. VAEs offer a generative model and an encoding model for image editing in the latent space. However, VAE samples are often blurred. An alternative model for sharper images is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), consisting of a generator and a discriminator. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model consisting of a generator and a discriminator, both implemented using convolutional neural networks. GAN training involves a mini-max game where the generator synthesizes samples to confuse the discriminator, aiming to produce images that are indistinguishable from real samples. The objective function includes the distribution of synthesized samples and a chosen prior distribution like a multivariate Gaussian. The vanilla GAN model lacks a simple way to map data samples to latent space. While some GAN variants involve learning an encoder model, only the approach by allows faithful reconstruction of data samples. Adversarial training on high dimensional distributions remains challenging, so an alternative latent generative model combining VAE with GAN is considered. This setup allows the VAE to learn encoding and decoding processes, with a discriminator ensuring higher quality of outputted data samples. Combining VAE with GAN allows for learning encoding and decoding processes, with a discriminator ensuring higher quality of outputted data samples. The synthesized samples depend on the latent variable z drawn from a random distribution. Vanilla VAE or GAN cannot choose to synthesize samples from a specific category, but conditional VAEs (and GANs) provide a solution for attribute editing. Conditional VAEs and GANs offer a solution for synthesizing class-specific data samples by incorporating label information into the encoder and decoder models. This approach allows for category-conditional image synthesis and minimizes classification loss between the true label and the attribute vector \u0177. Incorporating attribute information in conditional VAEs can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples when modifying the attribute vector \u0177 for a fixed latent vector \u1e91. This suggests that information about the attribute to edit is partially contained in \u1e91 rather than solely in the attribute vector y. The text discusses the problem of incorporating attribute information in conditional VAEs, where changes in the attribute vector \u0177 for a fixed latent vector \u1e91 can lead to unpredictable results. To address this issue, the proposed 'Adversarial Information Factorization' process aims to separate the information about the attribute y from the latent vector \u1e91 using a mini-max optimization involving various networks. The 'Adversarial Information Factorization' process aims to separate attribute information from the latent vector in a conditional VAE. By training an auxiliary network to predict the attribute from the latent vector accurately, the encoder is updated to output values that prevent the auxiliary network from succeeding. This ensures that the latent vector contains no information about the desired attribute, which is instead conveyed in the attribute vector. The novel approach involves training the encoder of a VAE to separate attribute information from the latent vector. An auxiliary network is introduced to predict the attribute from the latent vector, ensuring that the latent vector does not contain information about the desired attribute. This method is integrated into a VAE-GAN model to improve image quality. The encoder in a VAE is trained to separate attribute information from the latent vector. An auxiliary network predicts the attribute from the latent vector to ensure it does not contain attribute information. This method is integrated into a VAE-GAN model to enhance image quality. The curr_chunk describes the proposal of an additional network and cost function for training an encoder used for attribute manipulation. It introduces a model with a VAE and information factorization, including a discriminator in a GAN architecture. The previous work mentioned is a cVAE-GAN architecture without an auxiliary network for information factorization. The curr_chunk introduces an auxiliary network, A \u03c8, for information factorization in a conditional VAE-GAN model. The encoder, E \u03c6, is updated to prevent attribute information, y, from being encoded in\u1e91. Training is complete when A \u03c8 cannot predict y from\u1e91, resulting in an Information Factorization model. The curr_chunk discusses the training procedure of an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN model, where attribute manipulation is achieved by encoding images and appending desired attribute labels. The model allows for simple 'switch flipping' operations in the representation space to synthesize samples with different attributes. Both quantitative and qualitative results are presented to evaluate the proposed model. The curr_chunk discusses quantitatively assessing the contribution of adversarial information factorization in an x \u223c D training data output of the auxiliary network. Facial attribute classification is performed using a DCGAN architecture for the ablation study, incorporating residual layers to achieve competitive results. A qualitative evaluation demonstrates the model's potential for image attribute editing. The curr_chunk discusses quantifying the impact of adversarial information factorization in training data output. It evaluates facial attribute classification using a DCGAN architecture with residual layers for competitive results. The focus is on image attribute editing potential through a novel function analysis. The curr_chunk evaluates the model's ability to edit image attributes, specifically 'Smiling' and 'Not Smiling', with a focus on the impact of information factorization. The model successfully edits images in 81.3% of cases to have the 'Not Smiling' attribute and in all cases to have the 'Smiling' attribute. The absence of the proposed L aux term in the encoder loss function results in a complete failure to perform attribute editing. The model fails to perform attribute editing effectively due to the absence of the proposed L aux term in the encoder loss function. Including a classification loss on reconstructed samples does not contribute to the factorization of attribute information. The IcGAN is included in the ablation study. The IcGAN model is included in the ablation study to compare its performance with the proposed model. The proposed model aims to separate identity and facial attribute information by minimizing mutual information between them. This approach encourages the model to encode label information in \u0177 rather than \u1e91, making it potentially useful for facial attribute classification. The model successfully separates facial attribute information from identity representation, as shown by its competitive performance in facial attribute classification compared to a state-of-the-art classifier. The model effectively factorizes attribute information from identity representation, focusing on attribute manipulation by reconstructing images for different attribute values. A cVAE-GAN may struggle to edit desired attributes when trained for low reconstruction error, as shown in edited images for 'Not Smiling' and 'Smiling'. The study highlights the importance of models with factored latent representations for editing attributes in images. The model achieved good reconstruction quality by adjusting weightings on loss terms and using specific training parameters. The study utilized the BID3 model with specific hyper-parameters and achieved successful image synthesis of 'Not Smiling' attribute with a 98% success rate, outperforming the naive cVAE-GAN model. The study successfully manipulated the 'Not Smiling' attribute using the BID3 model, outperforming the cVAE-GAN model. The IFcVAE-GAN model demonstrated high-quality reconstructions for image attribute editing tasks. The IFcVAE-GAN model successfully manipulates facial attributes by factorizing identity and using an auxiliary classifier for representation. High-quality reconstructions and attribute editing are achieved, as shown in Figure 4. The model factorizes attributes from identity, uses an auxiliary classifier, and achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification. It incorporates adversarial training to factorize attribute label information from the latent representation. Other related approaches like Schmidhuber FORMULA3 and BID16 also perform similar factorization techniques but may not be used as classifiers. BID4 proposed a general approach for predicting mutual information, implicitly minimizing it via adversarial information factorization. Their work is similar to cVAE-GAN architecture by BID3, which synthesizes samples of a particular class. Unlike separating categories, changing attributes in an image require specific factorization in the latent representation. Our model focuses on attribute editing in images, emphasizing the need for targeted changes with minimal impact on the rest of the image. Unlike category conditional image synthesis, our approach involves learning a classifier for input images and preserving identity in the latent space. Other works have used VAE-GAN architecture but do not condition on label information or perform image editing in an end-to-end fashion. Our work emphasizes the importance of targeted changes in attribute editing for images, highlighting the need to factor label information out of the latent encoding. Unlike category conditional image synthesis, our approach focuses on learning a classifier for input images and preserving identity in the latent space. This is different from image-to-image models that aim to learn a single latent representation for images in different domains. Progress has been made in image-to-image domain adaptation, translating images from one domain to another. By factorizing in the latent space, a single generative model can edit attributes by changing a single unit of the encoding. While labeled data is used to learn representations, there are models that learn disentangled representations from unlabeled data. The \u03b2-VAE objective minimizes mutual information to learn disentangled representations. Our approach involves a supervised factorization of the latent space to learn disentangled representations of images, allowing for modification of specific attributes. This method was demonstrated on human face images but is applicable to other objects as well. The model separates the identity and facial attributes of a person into distinct representations in the latent space. The Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN model separates identity and facial attributes in images, allowing for easy attribute editing without affecting identity. It outperforms existing models for category conditional image synthesis and has been validated through an ablation study. Our model is highly effective as a classifier, achieving state of the art accuracy on facial attribute classification for several attributes. The ablation study confirms the importance of our proposed method, showing the need for the L aux loss and the impact of increased regularization on reconstruction quality. Regularisation reduces reconstruction quality, with no significant benefit from using the L class loss. Results without L KL and L gan show that small amounts of KL regularisation are necessary for good reconstruction. Models trained without L gan have slightly lower reconstruction error but produce blurred images. Even without L gan or L KL loss, the model can still accurately edit attributes, although sample visual quality is poor, highlighting the main contribution of factored representations in our work. In our model, we use labelled data to learn factored representations, while other models can learn disentangled representations from unlabelled data. The performance of our classifier is compared to a linear classifier trained on latent representations from a DIP-VAE, known for learning disentangled representations."
