    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code applies to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers. The article is subject to the Internal Revenue Code and Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. Compliance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code is required for administration. The article exempts certain entities and public employees from its application, including those protected under federal law. Retirement plans approved before January 1, 2013, by excluded entities are not affected. The article exempts certain public employees from its application if the Secretary of Labor determines it conflicts with federal law. Additionally, a multiemployer plan established before January 1, 2013, regulated by ERISA, is also exempt. The benefit plan applies to new public employee members. The benefit plan under this article applies to new public employee members, with specific provisions for individuals transitioning between public employers before and after January 1, 2013, based on concurrent membership or reciprocity agreements between public retirement systems. An individual who changed employment positions before January 1, 2013, and became subject to a different defined benefit plan in a different public retirement system offered by their employer shall be subject to that plan as if they were first employed on or before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offers a defined benefit pension plan with a lower cost formula before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that formula. However, if they adopt a new formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only participate in the new formula. New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in a lower cost formula approved by the Legislature. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan consisting solely of a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they may continue with that plan. However, if they adopt a new defined benefit pension plan or formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the retirement system's chief actuary, board, and the Legislature. New members can only join the defined contribution plan in place before 2013 or a plan that meets the article's requirements. The employer can offer a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, or a plan that complies with the article's requirements. This does not prevent the employer from introducing a defined contribution plan after January 1, 2013, with or without a defined benefit plan. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they may offer employees the same defined benefit plan they had before joining the authority. This applies to employees from the City of Brea, City of Fullerton, or other specified cities who are not new members and are hired by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the common power being exercised. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members must participate in a defined benefit plan that complies with the requirements of the article. The Judges\u2019 Retirement System is exempt from certain defined benefit formula and compensation limitations. The article does not grant membership in a public retirement system to those who are not eligible under its rules. Public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with the article by January 1, 2013."
