    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration is required to provide estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes for each facility producing cellulosic biofuel during the period of January 1 through October 31 of the current calendar year. The Administrator determines the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility based on actual production during the specified period. The Administrator determines the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility based on the average monthly production. The Administrator estimates the annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility based on average monthly production. For facilities starting production after January 1 of the current year, the production of cellulosic biofuel is monitored. The Administrator estimates the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility based on actual production from initial production to October 31. The Administrator estimates the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility from initial production to October 31 of the current calendar year. The Administrator estimates the annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility based on the average monthly production up to October 31 of the current calendar year. The Clean Air Act is amended to require an estimate of cellulosic biofuel production for the following year based on current year production volumes from all facilities. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify using the exact volume for estimates of cellulosic biofuel production and to exclude certain fuels from the definition of cellulosic biofuel. The Clean Air Act is amended to exclude certain fuels like compressed natural gas and electricity from the definition of biofuel. The final rule of the EPA regulates cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways. The EPA's regulation of fuels and fuel additives under the Clean Air Act is being amended to address conflicts with new biofuel pathways. The Administrator is required to reissue the rule to align with the amendments. Additionally, the exclusion of certain fuels from the biofuel definition is specified in the Clean Air Act. In the Clean Air Act, the cellulosic biofuel mandate for calendar year 2014 is being removed."
