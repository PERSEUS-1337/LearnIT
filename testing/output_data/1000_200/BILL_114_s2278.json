    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Act, known as the \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015,\" defines key terms such as \"appropriate committees of Congress,\" \"Assistant Secretary,\" \"Commission,\" \"Federal entity,\" and \"Spectrum Relocation Fund.\" The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines unlicensed operations as the nonexclusive use of spectrum without protection from interference under specific regulations. The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines unlicensed operations as the nonexclusive use of spectrum without protection from interference under specific regulations. SEC. 3. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ALLOCATION AND ALLOTMENT OF SPECTRUM. The Commission must ensure a balance between exclusive licensing and unlicensed operations in spectrum allocation. Within 18 months of the Act's enactment, rules must be established for future allocation, including considering unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum. These rules must be included in the service rules of spectrum auctions. The Commission must include rules from subsection (b) in spectrum auction service rules. Reports to Congress must reflect the rulemaking required by this section. SEC. 4. NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR UNLICENSED SPECTRUM. The United States aims to maximize spectrum resources, promote innovation in wireless broadband, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy. A national strategy will be developed to make additional radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations, including clearing bands for unlicensed devices. The national strategy aims to identify radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations, ensure access to low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum, and allow spectrum sharing for additional unlicensed operations without causing interference to licensees. The FCC is exploring ways to improve spectrum sharing for unlicensed operations, including expanding opportunities in spectrum bands, enhancing database accuracy, and harmonizing bands for greater economies of scale. The FCC is exploring ways to improve spectrum sharing for unlicensed operations, including harmonizing bands for greater economies of scale. A report describing the strategy developed must be submitted to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment, with recommendations for legislative change. The report will also be made publicly available on the Commission's website. SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days on designating additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. Recommendations on reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund and ensuring its solvency will be considered in the report. The report to Congress will address the possibility of allowing unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without causing interference, as well as exploring other spectrum sharing techniques for radio technologies conducting unlicensed operations."
