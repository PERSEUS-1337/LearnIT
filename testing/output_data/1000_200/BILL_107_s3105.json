    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act\" and includes a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. The Secretary may make grants to States for prevention and control, with a preference for states with a high incidence of West Nile Virus. The Secretary may give preference to States with a substantial incidence of West Nile Virus or related diseases for grants under this program. Funds must be used for developing mosquito control plans and medical entomology programs. The program aims to support prevention and control efforts for vector-borne diseases by developing medical entomology and arbovirology programs. States must provide assurances to the Secretary to receive grants and are required to make matching funds available for the program. States receiving grants for the program must provide non-Federal contributions amounting to at least 50% of the program costs, which can be in cash or in kind. Federal contributions or services subsidized by the Federal Government cannot be included in the non-Federal contributions. States receiving grants for the program must provide non-Federal contributions amounting to at least 50% of the program costs, which can be in cash or in kind. Federal contributions or services subsidized by the Federal Government cannot be included in the non-Federal contributions. Amounts provided under a grant should supplement, not supplant, State and local funds for similar activities. The Secretary may waive requirements for a State based on extraordinary economic conditions. States should involve local entities to the extent practicable when receiving funds under this program. States receiving grants for the program must involve localities in planning, implementation, and evaluation of mosquito control plans. A State must ensure that 85% of the grant amount is spent at the local level for public health improvement related to West Nile Virus. Amounts appropriated for technical assistance can be used to expand the program. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can use funds to provide technical support to State and local health departments for mosquito control programs and arboviral disease containment. Up to 20% of the funds can be used for this purpose. The Secretary can develop mosquito abatement guidelines. The Secretary, in consultation with health organizations, will develop guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs at the state and local level to identify new disease cases. The guidelines for building public health infrastructure include identifying new disease cases, tracking disease spread through monitoring, providing laboratory support, increasing surveillance participation, conducting educational campaigns, and outlining mosquito control procedures. The Secretary will also evaluate the effectiveness of these programs. The Secretary will evaluate the program established under the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act, submitting a report to Congress within 18 months of enactment. The report will include the evaluation results and information on developing sustainable mosquito abatement programs for funded States. The program established under the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act will be evaluated by the Secretary, with a report to Congress within 18 months of enactment. The report will include progress in developing sustainable mosquito abatement programs for funded States, along with an evaluation of costs and benefits. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The program established under the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act will terminate on September 30, 2004, but may be extended for an additional fiscal year based on evaluation. SEC. 249.
