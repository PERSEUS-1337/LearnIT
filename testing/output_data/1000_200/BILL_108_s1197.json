    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003\" is established for the purpose of ensuring radiologic excellence. Congress finds that over 300 million medical imaging exams and radiation therapy treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. The impact of these procedures on public health and safety, as well as interstate commerce, is significant. It is crucial to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure by ensuring that personnel performing these procedures have the appropriate education and credentials. The importance of having adequately educated personnel with appropriate credentials for medical imaging and radiation therapy procedures is crucial for public health and safety. Competence should be demonstrated through education, training, and experience, with responsibilities shared between State and Federal Governments to protect against unnecessary procedures and ensure efficacy. Facilities conducting medical imaging and radiation therapy impact interstate commerce as patients travel across state lines for services. Congress established Federal standards in 1981 for accrediting education programs in these fields. The Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 set federal standards for accrediting education programs in medical imaging and radiation therapy. Currently, 13 states do not require licensure for these professionals, while others have varying levels of licensing and regulation. The Act aims to accredit education programs and license/certify individuals in medical imaging and radiation therapy to ensure safety and accuracy in patient dose. States have varying regulations for radiographers, radiation therapists, nuclear medicine technologists, medical physicists, and medical dosimetrists. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. This aims to ensure safety and accuracy in patient dose through accreditation of education programs and licensing/certification of individuals in the field. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, and accreditation requirements. Exemptions apply to physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Individuals must pass a national examination approved by the Secretary before performing such imaging or therapy. The Secretary certifies approved bodies for accreditation of educational programs and exams in medical imaging and radiation therapy. Minimum standards are set for recordkeeping and assurance requirements. The Secretary certifies approved bodies for accreditation of educational programs and exams in medical imaging and radiation therapy. Standards for recordkeeping, curricula approval, instructor approval, reasonable fees, and other additional standards may be required. Approved bodies must provide assurances of compliance with standards, timely notification of changes, and other required information. Withdrawal of approval is possible. The Secretary may withdraw certification of an approved body if it fails to meet standards. Accreditation or exam completion remains valid for a reasonable period after withdrawal. The Secretary may withdraw certification of an approved body if it fails to meet standards, with accreditation or exam completion remaining valid for a reasonable period. Existing State standards are deemed compliant unless determined otherwise by the Secretary. Periodic evaluations of approved bodies are conducted by the Secretary. The Secretary will evaluate programs for medical imaging and radiation therapy to ensure compliance with standards. Regulations will be promulgated within 18 months to enforce these standards. Alternative standards for rural areas may be considered for payment of medical imaging services. The Secretary may develop alternative standards for payment of medical imaging in rural areas to ensure access to quality care. Regulations to enforce these standards will be promulgated within 18 months. In this section, regulations will be implemented by the Secretary, defining terms like 'approved body' as a nonprofit organization or State agency certifying individuals for medical imaging or radiation therapy. 'Medical imaging' refers to procedures for diagnosing or treating diseases in humans, excluding ultrasound. 'Perform' involves directly exposing patients to medical imaging or radiation therapy. The term 'perform' in medical imaging or radiation therapy involves directly exposing patients to radiation or a magnetic field and positioning them for the exposure. The term 'plan' refers to preparing for the procedure by evaluating site-specific information to customize it for the patient. Radiation therapy involves customizing procedures for patients through verification of radiation dose distribution, computer analysis, or direct measurement of dose."
