    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impact of products in its market. Courts have ruled against consumer civil actions for enforcing the prohibition on goods made with forced or convict labor under the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 aim to prevent and punish forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in the supply chains of goods imported into the United States. However, enforcement actions have been limited, with fewer than 40 recorded in the past 80 years. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2003 and 2005 allow for the termination of Federal contracts if contractors engage in trafficking or forced labor. Executive Order 13126 prohibits the acquisition of products made by forced or child labor. Executive Order 13126 and other legislation have banned Federal contractors from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. Federal contractors and subcontractors must adhere to anti-trafficking compliance plans, including a complaint mechanism and measures to prevent trafficking in persons. Congress recognizes forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor as severe forms of abuse for profit, emphasizing the need to prevent goods produced through these means from entering the market. Legislation is needed to prevent goods produced through forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor from entering the US market. Providing consumers with information on products free of these practices can help businesses and consumers avoid supporting these crimes through their purchases. Legislation is necessary to prevent goods made through forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor from being sold in the US. Disclosure of information on efforts to combat these practices is crucial. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require covered issuers to disclose efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their annual reports. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 now mandates covered issuers to report on measures taken to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. This includes disclosing policies to identify and eliminate these risks. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires covered issuers to disclose policies addressing forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. This includes prohibiting employees from engaging in commercial sex acts with minors and evaluating and addressing risks in the product supply chain. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandates covered issuers to disclose supply chain risks, measures taken to eliminate them, and whether third-party evaluations were conducted. It also requires consultation with independent labor organizations, workers' associations, or workers, and incorporating their input. The covered issuer must disclose consultation with independent labor organizations, workers' associations, or workers, specify the entities consulted, and describe the method of consultation. They also need to specify the extent of coverage within the supply chain, including entities upstream and across product lines. Additionally, efforts must be made to ensure audits of suppliers within the supply chain investigate working conditions. The covered issuer must conduct audits of suppliers in their supply chain to investigate working conditions, labor practices, and risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. They must also evaluate if suppliers have appropriate systems in place and ensure compliance with the issuer's policies. The covered issuer must require suppliers to attest compliance with laws on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. They should also maintain internal accountability standards and reporting procedures for non-compliant entities in the supply chain. The covered issuer must ensure that entities in its supply chain meet standards on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. This includes training employees on these issues and monitoring labor recruitment practices at suppliers. The covered issuer must ensure that labor recruitment practices at suppliers comply with policies to eliminate exploitative labor practices contributing to forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Efforts should be made to address any instances of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor within the supply chain and take remedial action. The regulations require disclosure of information on the company website regarding the identification and remedial action for the worst forms of child labor within the supply chain, labeled as 'Global Supply Chain Transparency'. The Commission will provide a searchable list of covered issuers disclosing measures taken to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains on its website. The term 'covered issuer' refers to companies with annual global receipts exceeding $100,000,000. 'Forced labor', 'slavery', and 'human trafficking' are defined as labor practices violating international standards. The term 'remedial action' refers to activities or systems implemented by an issuer to address non-compliance, while 'supply chain' includes labor recruiters and product suppliers for a covered issuer disclosing required information. Under the regulations, all labor recruiters, suppliers of products, component parts, and raw materials used in manufacturing products are included, regardless of direct relationship with the supplier. The term 'the worst forms of child labor' refers to child labor that violates national and international standards, including International Labor Organization Convention No. 182."
