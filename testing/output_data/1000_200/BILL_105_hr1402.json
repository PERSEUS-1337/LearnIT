    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on Probabilistic Methods Act\". The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integrating these methods into business practices has saved billions for companies, but federal use lags behind industry. Probabilistic methods offer better understanding of safety and environmental risks, leading to more business-friendly regulations. If incorporated into federally funded design efforts, they could enhance product specifications. Probabilistic methods can improve efficiency and reduce overdesign in government programs, leading to cost savings. Integrating these methods into federally funded design efforts could enhance product specifications and benefit transportation systems and other federal agency programs. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to improve efficiency and reduce overdesign in government programs. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify how these methods can benefit the Department of Transportation, assess their potential for maximizing ROI and enhancing public safety, evaluate the technology state, recommend practical techniques, establish uncertainty quantification models, identify key technology areas for development, and provide implementation guidelines. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for implementing probabilistic technology, setting reliability levels for public safety, safety testing, creating databases, expediting technology transfer, addressing legal and cultural barriers, and making recommendations for the use of probabilistic methods at the Department of Transportation. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for implementing probabilistic technology, setting reliability levels for public safety, safety testing, creating databases, expediting technology transfer, addressing legal and cultural barriers, and making recommendations for the use of probabilistic methods at the Department of Transportation, including recommendations for institutionalizing probabilistic methods values and pilot projects for evaluation of probabilistic methods technology. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 19 members, including a chairperson from an engineering society with experience in probabilistic methods, representatives from higher education, government, industry, labor, environmental community, public interest, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, and National Institutes of Health. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, including representatives from various sectors. Members serve for life, vacancies filled as per original appointment. They serve without pay but receive travel expenses. A quorum is 10 members. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, with a quorum of 10 members required for hearings.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. The Department of Transportation will provide administrative support to the Commission as needed. The Commission can hire experts and consultants and obtain official data from government agencies. It can also use the United States mails. SEC. 7. REPORTS.\n\nThe Commission must submit an interim report to the Administrator within 2 years of its initial meeting and a final report within 36 months. The final report will include findings, conclusions, and recommendations.\n\nSEC. 8. TERMINATION.\n\nThe Commission will end 10 days after submitting the final report.
