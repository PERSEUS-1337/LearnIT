    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries facing injury from subsidized imports. Relief is provided through additional import duties equal to the subsidy amount. Two conditions must be met: the International Trade Commission must find injury to the domestic industry, and the ITA must confirm the subsidies. Before a 2007 investigation on CFS paper from China, CVD laws were not applied to NME countries like China. The ITA decided not to apply CVD laws to nonmarket economy (NME) countries like China due to difficulties in measuring market distortions. However, in a 2007 investigation on coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China, the ITA found it possible to identify subsidies as many industries in China operate based on market principles. China was reaffirmed as an NME country, but the 2007 subsidy decision was specific to China and not applicable to other NME countries. The ITA does not apply CVD laws to nonmarket economy (NME) countries like China due to difficulties in measuring market distortions. NME designations are based on various factors, and currently, ITA-designated NME countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. The ITA does not apply CVD laws to NME countries like China, which is the United States' second largest trading partner. This decision was made in 1983-1984 in connection with countervailing investigations involving carbon steel wire rod and potassium chloride imports. China's designation as an NME country has led to concerns about the U.S. trade deficit and the impact of Chinese imports on American industries and workers, prompting calls for increased use of U.S. trade remedy laws. China's alleged use of \"illegal\" subsidy programs to boost industries and exports has led to concerns in Congress, resulting in increased use of U.S. trade remedy laws against Chinese products. The 1984 ITA ruling limited recourse for U.S. producers impacted by China's subsidies. China is the main target of U.S. antidumping actions, with over 80 duty orders in place as of August 2010. AD duty amounts are higher for Chinese imports due to ITA methodology for NME countries. Policymakers and labor representatives also raise concerns about China's currency. The ITA uses a specific methodology for calculating AD duties for NME countries. U.S. policymakers, business people, and labor representatives are concerned about China's undervalued currency, which they believe contributes to the U.S. trade deficit and harms U.S. production and employment in various sectors. This issue has led to congressional interest in countervailing actions against Chinese imports. Congressional interest in countervailing actions against Chinese imports due to concerns about China's undervalued currency. The ITA determined China as a nonmarket economy country in 1983, which remains in effect unless revoked. Subsidies could not be found in China according to current U.S. law. The ITA determined China as a nonmarket economy country in 1983, which remains in effect unless revoked. Subsidies could not be found in China according to current U.S. law. The NME designation for China may only be used for a limited time, until December 11, 2016, after which the U.S. and other WTO members may no longer use nonmarket economy methodology in CVD or AD investigations. The United States had two countervailing duty laws in force during the 1983-1984 investigations, requiring determination of subsidization and injury to U.S. industries. The earlier law, repealed in 1995, was a modified version of a countervailing law from 1897. The countervailing duty law in force until 1995 was a modified version of a law from 1897. It applied to products from countries not \"under the Agreement\" defined by GATT. Section 303, repealed in 1995, allowed for levying a countervailing duty without the need for injury determination. The countervailing duty law, in force until 1995, applied to products from countries not \"under the Agreement\" defined by GATT. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 expanded the legislation to include detailed procedural provisions and implemented international Subsidies and Countervailing Code provisions agreed upon in 1979. The countervailing duty law, in force until 1995, required a determination of injury to a US industry from subsidized imports. The URAA repealed certain provisions and amended the law to include injury determination only for imports from \"Subsidies Agreement countries.\" Investigations of subsidized imports from countries other than \"Subsidies Agreement countries\" have been initiated. Countervailing duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were started based on petitions alleging public benefits received by manufacturers in those countries. Both Czechoslovakia and Poland received grants in the form of multiple exchange rate systems and other incentives for exporting firms. The investigations on subsidized imports from these countries proceeded in parallel, with minor differences between them. The ITA found both countries to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and conducted countervailing procedures accordingly. The ITA found Czechoslovakia and Poland to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and conducted countervailing procedures without determining injury. They were considered nonmarket economy countries, with the question of countervailing duty law application unresolved. This issue arose in a previous CVD investigation of textile imports from China but was addressed in preliminary determinations in two carbon steel wire rod cases. The ITA addressed the issue in the preliminary determinations of two carbon steel wire rod cases, finding that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from countervailing duty law. They were disposed to not exclude nonmarket economies without further review in each case, determining if government practices confer countervailable benefits. The ITA determined that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from countervailing duty law and had its first opportunity to preliminarily assess government practices for conferring countervailable benefits. Prices in nonmarket economies are set by central planners without considering economic value, leading to different implications for subsidization compared to market economies. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine their impact on market subsidies. The ITA preliminarily determined that alleged Czechoslovak and Polish practices did not provide bounties or grants within the meaning of the law, despite nonmarket economy countries not being exempt from countervailing duty law. The ITA found that alleged Czechoslovak and Polish practices did not violate the CVD law, despite the law not specifically addressing nonmarket economy countries. The investigations continued into the final phase, focusing on the application of the CVD law to NME countries. The concept of nonmarket economy countries was introduced into trade legislation, with remedies provided specifically for imports from them. Congress amended the CVD law in 1979, addressing dumping by NME countries. The Trade Act of 1974 enacted provisions for injurious imports from \"State-controlled-economy\" or \"Communist\" countries, equivalent to NME countries, focusing on antidumping and market disruption but not countervailing action. Congress recognized the need for special remedial legislation in this regard. The Trade Act of 1974 introduced provisions for imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries, focusing on antidumping and market disruption remedies. Congress recognized the need for special legislation due to the unique economic conditions in these countries. The legislative history of the CVD law restructuring in 1979 did not address the application of CVD law to NME countries. The Trade Act of 1974 introduced provisions for imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries, focusing on antidumping and market disruption remedies. The Subsidies and Countervailing Code of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade permits regulation of unfairly priced imports from NME countries. It is challenging to identify and quantify subsidies in NMEs due to the lack of market reference points. The countervailing duty law requires measuring a resource transfer from the state to the producer, which is difficult in nonmarket economies. The ITA concluded that in nonmarket economy (NME) countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland, it is challenging to measure subsidies due to the lack of market reference points. They determined that manufacturers in these countries did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations. Producers in Czechoslovakia and Poland did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations. Two U.S. chemical manufacturers filed petitions alleging subsidization of potassium chloride imported from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, but investigations were rescinded due to the determination in the carbon steel wire rod cases. The ITA dismissed petitions for potassium chloride investigations. A countervailing duty investigation was initiated for Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China based on a petition claiming market-oriented industry principles. The ITA initiated a countervailing duty investigation for Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China based on the claim of market-oriented industry principles. The ITA concluded that the Chinese fan industry did not meet the criteria of a market-oriented industry due to non-market-determined input prices, but the investigation was not rescinded pending verification of the information used. The ITA determined that the PC fans industry in China did not qualify as a market-oriented industry due to non-market-determined input prices. As a result, the countervailing duty law could not be applied, leading to a final negative determination by the ITA. Petitioners challenged this decision in the U.S. Court of International Trade, which held that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade held that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket economies, reversing the ITA's decision on PC fans industry in China. The court remanded the carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered the potash cases investigations to be resumed. The CIT addressed the grounds for nonapplicability of countervailing procedure to NME countries. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the ITA's decision on countervailing duty law, stating that it applies to countries with nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that subsidies can be found in nonmarket economies and that the CVD law applies to any country without exemptions. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for creating a major exemption for countries with nonmarket economies by redefining subsidies. The court emphasized that the CVD law applies to all countries, including those with nonmarket economies, and that the ITA must investigate deviations from regular patterns regardless of the country's economic system. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for exempting nonmarket economies from CVD law, emphasizing that the law applies to all countries. The court highlighted the ITA's obligation to investigate deviations from regular patterns regardless of the country's economic system. The U.S. Court of International Trade criticized the ITA for exempting nonmarket economies from CVD law, emphasizing the law applies to all countries. The court dismissed the ITA's reliance on economic academia's views and challenged its broad discretion in determining subsidies. The U.S. government appealed the CIT decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history of trade remedy laws and concluded that the CVD statute had remained unchanged since 1897. The court could not determine if the statute applied to nonmarket economies based on the language of the statute. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the CVD statute and concluded that Congress did not exclude nonmarket economies from its reach. The court determined that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for potash exports did not violate the CVD law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the ITA's final CVD determinations in the wire rod cases, stating that the benefits provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for potash exports were not considered bounties or grants under the CVD law. The court vacated the CIT order and remanded the cases for lack of jurisdiction due to untimely filing. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the ITA's final CVD determinations in the wire rod cases, stating that benefits provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for potash exports were not considered bounties or grants under the CVD law. Congress reacted to the decision by introducing H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress, which proposed applying countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries if a subsidy could be identified and measured by the ITA. In response to a court decision, Congress introduced H.R. 3 in the 100th Congress to apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries if a subsidy could be identified and measured by the ITA. Companion bills were introduced but not further considered, and the issue was revisited in later Congresses. The countervailable subsidy definition was expanded in the Tariff Act of 1930 to include NME countries, determining the amount using a surrogate market-economy country method. Identical bills were introduced in multiple Congresses to apply the CVD duty law to NME countries for investigations of subsidies provided after the respective act's enactment date. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from NME countries, with provisions included in broader trade-remedial legislation. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from NME countries, with provisions included in broader trade-remedial legislation. H.R. 3306 and H.R. 1498 focused on trade issues with China, subjecting all NME countries to countervailing action and defining foreign exchange-rate manipulation as a countervailable subsidy. In the 110th and 111th Congress, multiple bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to non-market economy (NME) countries, including China. Bills such as H.R. 571, H.R. 708, H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, H.R. 1229, S. 974, and S. 1919 aimed to address trade issues and countervailing subsidies. The \"Trade Enforcement Act of 2009\" and the \"Nonmarket Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2009\" aim to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership or economic reforms. The bills also prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in anti-dumping cases. The bills aim to prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in anti-dumping cases and provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidies. Administrative authorities would use methodologies that consider the unique conditions in China when calculating subsidy amounts. The bills aim to prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in anti-dumping cases and provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidies. Authorities are directed to adjust terms and conditions prevailing in China, or use terms outside of China if necessary, especially if China is deemed an NME country. The bills aim to prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in anti-dumping cases and provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidies. The Bush Administration took steps to address China's alleged subsidies of exports, including initiating a CVD investigation and consultations in the WTO. In the CVD investigation against China, the ITC and ITA made affirmative preliminary determinations of subsidy for coated paper. The ITA set preliminary estimates of net countervailable subsidy rates, ranging from 10.9% to 20.35%. The final determination found that countervailable subsidies are being provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China. In mid-October, the ITA finalized that countervailable subsidies are provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China, with subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Despite reaffirming China's status as an NME country, the ITA noted that China's current economy differs significantly from Soviet-style economies, with a significant role for the state in economic activities. The ITA determined that market forces influence prices of over 90% of products in China, wages are negotiated, foreign currency access is easier, and private ownership rights are recognized by the government. Despite being an NME country, China has reduced state control in some areas while maintaining it in others. The ITA concluded that despite China being an NME country, the current state of its economy allows the agency to determine if the Chinese government has provided a benefit to Chinese producers. The ITC announced a negative determination of injury in both countervailing and antidumping investigations on CFS paper, citing reasons such as modest production capacity increases in China and Indonesia, lack of potential for product shifting, and absence of significant price effects from imports. Based on the absence of negative effects of subject imports on the domestic industry and the conclusion that the domestic industry is not vulnerable, it was determined that material injury by reason of subject imports will not occur without antidumping and countervailing duty orders against imports from China and Indonesia. The domestic CFSP industry was found not to be threatened with material injury by imports from these countries. The investigation was terminated after the ITC issued a final negative CVD determination, and all duties deposited or bonds posted were refunded or canceled. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, although no CV duties were ultimately imposed. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, leading to the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. Countervailing duties have been placed on 13 products from China, with 8 investigations pending. China filed a lawsuit to prevent the CVD investigation, but the Court ruled it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. On March 29, 2007, the Court ruled it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case regarding the application of countervailing duty law to NME countries. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States on CFS paper duties. China has been active in using AD investigations against the US and other countries since joining the WTO. China has been actively using AD investigations against products from the United States and other countries since joining the WTO. In 2009, China initiated its first CVD case and had ongoing CVD investigations on US products in 2010. The United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies, leading to the termination of one challenged subsidy program by China. The United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies, leading to the termination of subsidies by China that were deemed illegal under WTO rules. On November 29, 2007, USTR Schwab announced that China agreed to end all subsidies deemed illegal under WTO rules by January 1, 2008. China signed MOUs with the United States and Mexico to eliminate these subsidies. In the 2010 National Trade Estimate Report, the USTR confirmed China's removal of the subsidies. Despite the ITA's ability to identify subsidies in China, some challenges remain. Despite the ITA's ability to identify subsidies in China, some in Congress intend to address unfair trade practices that disadvantage American workers, farmers, and businesses. Congress may consider legislation to ensure that countervailing duty laws apply to nonmarket economy countries, including China. Congress may want to consider legislation to ensure that countervailing duty laws apply to nonmarket economy countries other than China, such as Vietnam. Currently, there are no specific methodologies provided in trade remedy laws for identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies other than China. The antidumping statute provides a methodology for determining normal value in nonmarket economy (NME) countries, allowing for the calculation of expenses using inputs from a market economy country. Countervailing duties (CVD) procedures have trade-offs, with AD duties generally higher than CVD duties. AD duties on imports from NME countries are even higher due to the third-country data methodology. If China remains an NME and subsidies are found on targeted merchandise with existing AD duties, adjustments may be needed to avoid double counting. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the uncertainty in AD duty calculations due to the possible inclusion of export subsidy amounts. If ITA targets subsidies in China or legislation is amended, there could be a reduction in overall protection. However, CVD procedures may provide relief to U.S. industries that were previously unable to obtain it through the AD statute."
