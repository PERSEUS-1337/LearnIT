The Navy plans to promote domestic biofuel production with a $170 million investment. Army, Navy, and Air Force have collectively spent $48 million on alternative fuels. The report discusses DOD's alternative fuels policy, including a $170 million investment in biofuel production capacity. It also provides data on DOD's alternative fuels purchases, testing platforms, and certification for fleet-wide use. Additionally, it covers the Navy's biofuel production initiative under the Defense Production Act, recent legislative actions, and appropriated funding. The Navy's biofuel production efforts under the Defense Production Act are discussed in relation to DOD's alternative fuels policy. Section 314 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act assigned oversight of DOD's alternative fuels initiatives to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Plans and Programs is responsible for overseeing DOD's alternative fuel activities, investments, and development recommendations. A memorandum issued by Sharon Burke in 2012 outlined the goals of DOD's alternative fuels policy to ensure operational military readiness. Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs Sharon Burke issued a memorandum outlining DOD's alternative fuels policy goals, including ensuring military readiness, improving battlespace effectiveness, and increasing fuel source options. DOD investments in alternative fuels aim to enhance resilience against supply disruptions, mitigate petroleum price volatility, and improve expeditionary effectiveness. Alternative fuels for DOD use must be drop-in, cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities, with desirable characteristics such as non-food crop feedstock production and reduced lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. The DOD's alternative fuels policy goals include ensuring military readiness, improving battlespace effectiveness, and increasing fuel source options. Alternative fuels must be drop-in, cost-competitive, and have desirable characteristics such as non-food crop feedstock production and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. DOD investments in alternative fuels must be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget certification process. Future investments will be subject to a rigorous, merit-based evaluation. Alternative fuels development initiatives will generally follow three phases, starting with certification. The DOD's alternative fuels development initiatives will follow three phases: Certification, Field Demonstration, and Ongoing Purchases. Alternative fuels will compete with petroleum products for operational quantities. The Army aims to increase the use of renewable/alternative energy, with goals including having at least 25% of energy for tactical power generation derived from alternative sources by 2028. The Air Force aims to acquire 50% of its domestic aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016 and test all aircraft on a 50:50 alternative fuel blend by 2012. The Navy has set more ambitious goals for alternative fuels. The Navy aims to deploy a \"Great Green Fleet\" strike group using alternative fuel blends by 2016 and meet 50% of its energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. This includes reducing liquid fuel usage to 38 million barrels of oil equivalent per year and utilizing nuclear power for 11 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2020. The Department of Defense aims to replace approximately 8 million barrels of petroleum used afloat with unblended alternative fuels by 2020 to achieve the goal of 50% alternative energy consumption. Since 2007, DLA Energy has procured about 1.9 million gallons of various types of alternative fuels for the Army, Navy, and Air Force, totaling $48 million in alternative fuels purchases for engine performance testing and certification. The Department of Defense has purchased various types of alternative fuels, including Fischer-Tropsch fuels and biofuels, such as hydrotreated jet and diesel biofuels. The Air Force and Navy have bought different types of alternative fuels, with the Air Force also purchasing alcohol-to-jet fuels. Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 restricts federal agencies, including DOD, from contracting for alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies, including DOD, from contracting for alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions. DOD's position is that this provision does not apply to bulk fuel purchases. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for potential fleet-wide use. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for potential fleet-wide use. The Army is testing 50:50 blends of Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and hydrotreated renewable jet with JP-8 for use in ground systems and field generators, aiming for certification by 2014. They are also working on obtaining Air Force certification for H-60 Black Hawk helicopters to fly on the 50:50 FT-SPK: JP-8 blend. Army's 2009 Energy Security Implementation Strategy includes completing testing of tactical ground equipment systems for alternative fuels by FY2014. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for potential fleet-wide use. The Air Force has certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel blends for its fleets, including biofuels and alcohol-to-jet fuels. The Navy has tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for all aircraft. The Navy has tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for use in all manned and unmanned aircraft, with certification anticipated in early 2013. Testing of other alternative fuels, such as Fischer-Tropsch fuels, alcohol-to-jet, pyrolysis oils, and direct sugar to hydrocarbon, will continue in the future. In June 2011, the Departments of the Navy, Energy, and Agriculture signed a Memorandum of Understanding to support the development of a sustainable commercial biofuels industry. The MOU calls for government investment to support advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries that produce biofuels meeting military specifications, are price competitive with petroleum, and have no significant impact on the food supply. The Navy and Department of Energy plan to fund this initiative with $340 million in federal funds, with industry cost-sharing, while the Department of Agriculture will provide an additional $171 million. The government will provide $340 million in federal funds for biofuel production, with additional support from the Department of Agriculture. Total funding for the project is expected to reach $510 million over three years, with contributions from the Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of Agriculture. Awards for biofuel production facilities will be given in two phases. The MOU released on June 27, 2012, includes government funding of $210 million for biofuels production facilities. Awards will be given in two phases: Phase 1 for planning and preliminary designs, and Phase 2 for construction and testing. Successful proposals require 50% cost share, domestic production of advanced biofuels, compliance with regulations, use of renewable feedstock, production of drop-in fuel, cost-competitiveness with petroleum-based fuels, and a minimum production capacity. The funding for biofuels production facilities includes $210 million from the government, with awards given in two phases for planning, design, construction, and testing. Successful proposals must have a 50% cost share, use renewable feedstock, produce drop-in fuel, be cost-competitive with petroleum-based fuels, and have a minimum production capacity of 10 million gallons per year. Funding sources include $100 million from DOD, $70 million from the Navy, and $40 million from DOE. The MOU between the Navy, DOE, and USDA does not include $171 million of USDA funding for bio-based jet fuel production. The Commodity Credit Corporation has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion for this purpose. Legislative activity in 2012 focused on expanding DOD's alternative fuels efforts and appropriations for the Navy's biofuel production under the DPA. Legislative activity in 2012 focused on expanding DOD's alternative fuels efforts and appropriations for the Navy's biofuel production under the DPA. H.R. 4310 contained provisions exempting DOD from EISA Section 526 and limiting purchases of expensive alternative fuels, while S. 3254 did not restrict DOD's abilities in this area. Amendments removed restrictive provisions added during the Senate Armed Services Committee markup. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act removed restrictive provisions related to biofuels production funding. The Act stated that funds for biofuel refineries cannot be used until matching contributions are received from the Departments of Energy and Agriculture. Additionally, the Departments of Defense and Energy requested appropriations for a joint biofuels production initiative. The Departments of Defense and Energy requested $70 million and $40 million in appropriations for FY2013 for a joint biofuels production initiative. The Navy, Department of Energy, and Department of Agriculture are involved in developing a domestic advanced biofuel industry. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the $70 million requested for the initiative. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the $70 million requested for the joint biofuel production initiative as part of the DPA Fund. H.R. 5856 contains $63.5 million in DPA funding, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommends funding the DPA Fund at $189 million with no specific mention of biofuel production. H.R. 933 appropriates $223,531,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund, an increase of about $134.3 million over the amount requested. The House and Senate reduced funding for advanced drop-in biofuels by $10 million, with an appropriation of $60 million. H.R. 933 also included $20 million for research on lowering emissions of coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force. The conferees did not include a provision for the Energy Independence and Security Act but provided $20 million for research to improve coal to liquid fuel emissions. The Air Force received $20 million for research on lowering emissions of coal to liquid fuels to improve competitiveness as an alternative energy resource. The Secretary of the Air Force must inform Congress before using these funds. The Department of Energy requested to transfer $40 million to the Defense Production Act Fund in FY2013. The House-passed version of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act does not authorize this transfer. The Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 5325) passed on June 6, 2012, does not allow the Department of Energy to transfer funds to the Defense Production Act Fund. However, the Senate version (S. 2465) permits up to $100 million transfer from Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funds. The Department of Energy received approximately $1.8 billion in funding under the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933/P.L. 113-6). The services' alternative fuels initiatives raise oversight questions for Congress regarding benefits over conventional fuels, funding investment, coordination efforts, and impact on the biofuel industry. The $510 million investment in the domestic advanced biofuel industry raises questions about private vs. government involvement, DOD's leadership in jumpstarting the industry, and coordination efforts by ASD(OEPP). The oversight of military services' alternative fuel goals and investments is also being examined for effectiveness and impact. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act allocated $150 million to support DPA Title III funding for alternative fuel initiatives. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act allocated $150 million to support DPA Title III funding for alternative fuel initiatives. The additional funding was not specifically directed to biofuels production, but both the House and Senate reports supported DOD biofuels initiatives and encouraged longer contract terms for biofuels procurement. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding multi-year contracts with purchase periods up to 15 years to ensure an adequate supply of biofuels. The Department of Defense may fund multi-year contracts for biofuels products to maximize efficiencies of scale and purchase price. The House Appropriations Committee supports long-term contracts for biofuels to benefit the armed forces and the nation. The Department of Energy requested authority to transfer funds to the DPA Fund to support pilot-scale demonstration projects for biofuel production. However, the House Appropriations Committee declined to fund this initiative in the FY2013 Congressional Budget Request. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund the Department of Energy's portion of a joint initiative for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D, recommending $203,000,000 for research activities advancing technologies for fuel and electricity production from biomass and crops. The Department's proposed funding for a joint initiative with the Navy and Department of Agriculture to develop biofuels production capacity for defense purposes was not justified. The Department of Energy's proposed funding for a joint initiative with the Navy and Department of Agriculture to develop biofuels production capacity for defense purposes lacks adequate justification. The recommendation includes no funding for the initiative and does not include the requested legislative language. (p. 85-86) In FY2013, the Senate Appropriations Committee Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act provides that the Secretary may transfer up to $100,000,000 to the Defense Production Act Fund for activities of the Department of Energy pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950. The report includes language supportive of the DOD, DOE, and USDA joint biofuel production initiative for military uses. The collaboration aims to develop innovative technologies for jet and diesel fuels, with the Department of Defense as an early adopter to encourage wider marketplace acceptance. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 4310 / S. 3254) includes provisions exempting the Department of Defense from alternative fuel procurement requirements and limiting funds for the production or purchase of alternative fuels. This supports the DOD, DOE, and USDA joint biofuel production initiative for military uses, aiming to encourage wider marketplace acceptance. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act limits funds for alternative fuel procurement by the Department of Defense, except for fleet certification for 50/50 blends. The Act does not restrict the DOD's ability to procure or produce biofuels. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act does not restrict the Department of Defense's ability to procure or produce biofuels. S. 3254, as reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee, had provisions affecting biofuel procurement, but these were removed via floor amendments. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act does not restrict the Department of Defense's ability to procure or produce biofuels. S.Amdt. 3095, sponsored by Senator Hagan and co-sponsored by several senators, passed 54-41, striking Section 2823 from S. 3254. This section would have prohibited the Department of Defense from entering into contracts for biofuels refinery infrastructure without specific authorization. Amendments by Senator Inhofe and Senator McCain were removed, while a third amendment by Senator Inhofe failed in a tie vote. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved two amendments in close votes of 13-12, while a third amendment by Senator Inhofe failed in a tie vote of 13-13. The failed amendment aimed to exempt the Department of Defense from a provision in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 regarding the purchase of alternative fuels. This was similar to a section in H.R. 4310 passed by the House. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved amendments regarding the purchase of alternative fuels for the Department of Defense. One amendment failed to exempt the Department from a provision in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Another amendment limits the funds for procurement of alternative fuel for the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved amendments regarding the purchase of alternative fuels for the Department of Defense. One amendment failed to exempt the Department from a provision in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Another amendment limits the funds for procurement of alternative fuel for the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013. The Department of Defense is prohibited from entering into contracts for biofuel refinery construction without specific authorization by law. Additionally, funds for alternative fuel procurement in fiscal year 2013 cannot be used if the cost exceeds the cost of traditional fuel. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved amendments regarding the purchase of alternative fuels for the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013. One amendment limits funds for procurement of alternative fuel if the cost exceeds traditional fuel costs. The Department of Defense is prohibited from contracts for biofuel refinery construction without specific authorization by law. The Department of the Navy made a significant biofuel purchase for testing purposes, despite the higher cost per gallon. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved amendments limiting funds for procurement of alternative fuels if costs exceed traditional fuel costs. The Department of Defense faces pressure on readiness accounts from increased fuel prices, impacting current and future defense budgets. The committee supports initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies but expresses concern about budget constraints. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the use of operation and maintenance funds for significantly higher costs of biofuels in RDTE efforts. They direct the Secretary of Defense to develop guidance on the difference between operational use of alternative fuels and RDTE initiatives. This is in line with the limitations on Department of Defense funds for biofuel refinery construction outlined in the National Defense Authorization Act. The Department of Defense for fiscal year 2013 requires matching contributions from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture for biofuel refinery construction. House Appropriations Committee allocated $70,000,000 for advanced drop-in biofuel production. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not provide funding for the construction or retrofit of domestic biofuel plants in fiscal year 2013, urging the Secretary of Defense to request funding in future years when it can be executed in a timely manner. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided an additional $100 million for the DPA fund in FY2013, recognizing its importance in strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base. The funding is to be competitively awarded to new initiatives, with priority given to completing projects from previous years. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933/P.L. 113-6) appropriates $223,531,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund, with an increase of $134.3 million over the amount requested. However, funding for production of advanced drop-in biofuels was reduced by $10 million to $60 million. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act reduced funding for advanced drop-in biofuels production by $10 million to $60 million. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for research on reducing emissions from coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development. The conferees emphasized the importance of improving coal to liquid fuel technology to meet energy security goals. The Department of Energy funding for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy was approximately $1.8 billion under the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. The Secretary of the Air Force must inform congressional defense committees 30 days before using these funds."
