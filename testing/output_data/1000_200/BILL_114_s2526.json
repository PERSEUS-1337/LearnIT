The Secretary will establish the program and provide support to designated manufacturing communities. The Act establishes a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating and supporting manufacturing communities. Preferential consideration may be given to consortium members seeking financial or technical assistance if consistent with the economic development strategy. The program aims to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness by supporting designated manufacturing communities.

The Secretary may provide a Federal point of contact to help manufacturing community consortia access funds and assistance under the program. The head of a participating agency may award financial or technical assistance to a member of a consortium designated as a manufacturing community for the purpose of improving the competitiveness of US manufacturing. The recipient can use the assistance to support investments in an ecosystem. Investments supported under this program for improving US manufacturing competitiveness may include infrastructure, access to capital, promotion of exports, workforce training, energy efficiency, business incubators, site preparation, and advanced research. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs for improving US manufacturing competitiveness, leveraging activities from non-Federal sources and avoiding duplication of efforts.
