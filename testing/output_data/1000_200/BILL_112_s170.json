    "content": "The Act titled \"Helping Responsible Homeowners Act\" allows for affordable refinancing of mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Act defines key terms such as \"Director\" as the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, \"Enterprise\" as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and \"Qualified mortgage\" as a mortgage for a one to four-family dwelling occupied by the mortgagor. The Act defines key terms and qualifications for mortgages, including the criteria for a refinancing mortgage. This type of mortgage must be used to pay off existing debt and closing costs, and the mortgagor must be current on payments. The refinancing mortgage must include costs from the refinancing, have the same property as the original mortgage, bear a fair interest rate not exceeding 40 basis points above the required net yield, and have a loan-to-value ratio within specified limits. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation must carry out a program where the mortgage interest rate is locked in, not limited by loan-to-value ratio, prepayment penalties are waived, and the term to maturity is not more than 40 years. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation are required to implement a program for refinancing qualified mortgages on single-family housing. This program includes the purchase and securitization of refinancing mortgages, with a prohibition on loan level price adjustments and post settlement delivery fees. In implementing the program for refinancing qualified mortgages, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation cannot charge upfront fees beyond the standard guarantee fee. Servicers or creditors refusing to resubordinate second liens on qualified mortgages will have new mortgages ineligible for purchase or guarantee. The requirement to refinance qualified mortgages does not apply after a 1-year period. The Director may extend the program for refinancing qualified mortgages beyond the 1-year period after enactment of the Act. Regulations will be issued to carry out the program. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation must ensure that mortgage servicers inform borrowers about the refinancing program. The Director will include updates on the program in the monthly Foreclosure Prevention & Refinance Report."
