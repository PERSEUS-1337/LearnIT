The Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001 highlights findings on early brain development, emphasizing the importance of quality early care and education for children's cognitive abilities and long-term success. Research shows that many child care centers do not promote healthy development, with some even posing risks to children's safety and health. Full-day child care can be costly, ranging from $4,000 to $10,000 per child. Federal assistance for child care is limited, making it unaffordable for many families. Payment rates for child care providers are too low, affecting the quality of care children receive. Low payment rates impact the quality of child care, leading to reduced staff, limited training, and fewer educational activities. This results in children experiencing delayed skills and increased aggression. Higher payment rates improve child care by attracting qualified staff and providing better services. The Act aims to enhance child care quality and accessibility by increasing payment rates, which will help providers attract qualified staff, offer better services, and improve the overall environment for children. Incentive grants are provided to improve the quality of child care. Funding for grants to improve child care quality is authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act, with $500,000,000 appropriated for fiscal year 2002 and additional funds for subsequent years. Block grant funds can be used for this purpose as well. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act authorizes grants to improve child care quality, with funds appropriated under section 658B(a). Section 658H is excluded from the use of block grant funds for this purpose. \"Section 658H authorizes grants to improve child care quality, separate from block grant funds.\" The Secretary will use funds to make grants to eligible States for child care services based on market rates surveys conducted within 2 years. Eligible States must submit an application to receive annual payments determined by their allotment. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application detailing the methodology and results of a market rates survey, along with a plan for child care services. The State must conduct a market rates survey to increase payment rates for child care services and maintain eligibility for annual payments under this section. The State must conduct a market rates survey to increase payment rates for child care services and maintain eligibility for annual payments under this section. To be eligible for a grant, the State must provide at least 25% of the costs in cash from State sources, excluding any Federal funds. The State must conduct a market rates survey to increase payment rates for child care services up to the 100th percentile of the market rate survey. Eligible States shall receive allotted funds to significantly increase child care assistance payment rates. An eligible State that achieves the 100th percentile of the market rate survey can use grant funds for activities enhancing child care services. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other Federal, State, or local funds. States must submit evaluations to the Secretary. The eligible State must submit evaluations to the Secretary on efforts to increase payment rates for child care. The Secretary will then report to Congress biennially on the impact of increased rates on child care quality and accessibility. The term 'payment rate' refers to reimbursement rates for subsidized child care.
