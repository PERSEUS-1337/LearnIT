    "content": "The \"Shared Responsibility in Preserving America's Future Act\" includes a surtax on millionaires contingent on the passage of a balanced budget amendment or spending limit amendment. This amendment adds a new part to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, imposing a surtax on millionaires. In taxable years after 2012 and before 2023, non-corporate taxpayers face a 5% tax on income exceeding $1,000,000, with adjustments for inflation starting in 2013. For taxable years after 2012 and before 2023, non-corporate taxpayers are subject to a 5% tax on income over $1,000,000, with adjustments for inflation. Threshold amounts are adjusted annually based on the cost-of-living index. Married individuals filing separately have a threshold amount that is half of the standard threshold. For individual taxpayers filing separately, the threshold amount is half of the standard threshold for taxable years. Modified adjusted gross income is calculated by reducing adjusted gross income by the excess of gross income from a non-passive trade or business with wages paid to at least 1 full-time equivalent employee. The IRS regulations define income for employees, excluding the taxpayer, and deductions properly allocable to that income. Special rules apply to nonresident aliens and citizens/residents living abroad, with adjustments to the threshold amount for individual taxpayers filing separately. The tax imposed under this section has specific provisions for citizens and residents living abroad, charitable trusts, and is not considered tax imposed by this chapter for certain purposes.
