The Congress recognizes the Department of Energy's contributions to math and science education, the need for collaboration between agencies and educators, the importance of outstanding teachers, and the effectiveness of pilot programs. A pilot program has confirmed the effectiveness of outstanding elementary and secondary school mathematics and science teachers serving in professional staff capacities in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Act establishes a national fellowship program for exceptional math and science teachers, known as \"Albert Einstein Fellows\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act establishes the \"Albert Einstein Fellows\" national fellowship program for outstanding math and science teachers. Definitions in the Act include terms like \"contractor\" for the organization administering the program, \"Secretary\" for the Secretary of Energy, and criteria for an \"outstanding\" teacher. The Act establishes the \"Albert Einstein Fellows\" national fellowship program for outstanding math and science teachers who have received national or State recognition comparable to the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching. These teachers must have also received a sabbatical leave from teaching to participate in the fellowship program. The term \"secondary school\" is defined by section 1471(21) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. SEC. 5. FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.

The number of fellowships awarded may be reduced if the appropriated amount is less than authorized. Priority is given to awarding fellowships in such cases. The Secretary prioritizes awarding fellowships to selected individuals in cases where the number of fellowships may be reduced due to funding constraints. The Secretary provides fellowships to outstanding math or science teachers in various government departments and agencies. The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program is administered by various government departments and agencies, including the Department of Education, National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and NASA. Fellowships are awarded for a 10-month period coinciding with the academic year, and program administration is contracted out to a third party. The Albert Einstein Fellowship Program requires contractors to develop and administer the application process, publicize the program, and screen applicants to select 10 outstanding math teachers for elementary and secondary schools. The responsibilities of the Albert Einstein Fellowship Program include selecting 10 outstanding math and science teachers, developing the selection process, providing orientation for recipients, establishing a reporting and evaluation program, and submitting annual reports to the Secretary. The Albert Einstein Fellowship Program is responsible for selecting outstanding math and science teachers, developing the selection process, providing orientation for recipients, and submitting annual reports to the Secretary.

Final selections are made before May 1, with the Speaker of the House and Minority Leader each selecting a fellowship recipient for the House of Representatives. The fellowship recipients are selected by various officials, including the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate, as well as key government agency heads, to be assigned to either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Each fellowship recipient selected by officials is assigned within the department, agency, institute, or office they administer.
