    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, with new screening technologies and changes in policies overseen by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) created after 9/11. The TSA is mandated by the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA) to provide comprehensive security screening for all airline passengers and property, while also having the authority to implement trusted traveler programs and utilize technologies to expedite security. The TSA has the authority to implement trusted traveler programs and use technologies to expedite passenger screening. Congress directed TSA to check all airline passengers against terrorist watchlists. TSA has faced challenges in implementing risk-based passenger screening strategies, mostly relying on a uniform risk assumption. This contrasts with risk-based approaches used in other areas of aviation security. The TSA's uniform approach to airport screening, focusing on technology like whole-body imagers and advanced X-ray equipment, has limitations due to budget constraints and time constraints for personnel. This approach contrasts with risk-based strategies used in other areas of aviation security. The TSA's approach to airport screening is limited by budget and personnel constraints, leading to cumbersome procedures for passengers. This has resulted in public dissatisfaction and criticism from experts like former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley. TSA has attempted to address these concerns by shifting its security methods. The TSA has faced criticism for making air travel difficult and creating a rigid security system. They have responded by implementing risk-based screening, which has sparked controversy due to differing views on risk assessment and mitigation. The focus on security efforts should prioritize the main points, as advised by Frederick the Great. The importance of prioritizing main security points, as advised by Frederick the Great and echoed by Michael Chertoff, emphasizes the need to focus on minimizing risks rather than trying to defend everything. Understanding security risks and implementing informed strategies to mitigate them is crucial in a free and open society where perfect security is unattainable. In aviation security, risk is defined as the probability of loss and is influenced by threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Specific strategies are used to manage risk, focusing on detecting and managing threats through categorical techniques and scoring methods. A comprehensive risk-based aviation security strategy aims to mitigate all elements of risk, including passenger screening initiatives. Passenger screening focuses on detecting and managing threats by identifying individuals who may pose risks and using detection technologies to screen for dangerous objects. Vulnerabilities are addressed through multiple security layers, such as reinforcing cockpit doors and deploying air marshals. Consequences are assessed for severity to determine risk valuation and are mitigated through emergency management and response activities primarily handled by airports. The responsibility for emergency management and response activities in aviation security lies with airports, airlines, and state and federal agencies, not TSA. Establishing an effective risk-based strategy for aviation security involves defining the risk environment and specifying acceptable levels of risk. While TSA uses risk scoring for air cargo security, it primarily relies on categorical processes for assessing passenger risk in commercial aviation. Risk assessment of airline passengers is primarily done through categorical processes, assigning passengers to different threat categories based on biographical data and behavioral indicators. The validity of behavioral-based risk scores has been questioned, and there may be disagreement on which specific risks a security strategy should address. For example, TSA's proposal in 2013 to allow small knives and sports equipment onboard aircraft sparked debate over diminishing threats and alternative security measures. The TSA considered allowing small knives and sports equipment onboard aircraft, citing reduced threats and alternative security measures. Critics argued that risks from unruly passengers wielding such items were not adequately addressed. Legislation was introduced to prevent the TSA from lifting the ban, leading to the agency dropping the proposal. TSA dropped proposal to allow small knives on planes due to concerns about security risks and the limitations of relying on prohibited items lists and detection technology. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli security expert Ron both highlight the challenges of focusing on small items versus the bigger security picture. Ron emphasizes the limitations of detection technology in preventing terrorist attacks, suggesting a need for a more integrated approach to assessing threats and minimizing vulnerabilities. This approach would require TSA to be more proactive rather than reactive in screening passengers. Advocates of risk-based security suggest a proactive approach like Israel's, which uses demographic profiling and extensive security interviews to identify high-risk passengers. Despite ongoing threats, Israel has avoided major terrorist attacks for over 40 years. The effectiveness of their methods in deterring attacks is uncertain. Adopting a similar approach in the US is seen as problematic. Research by TSA's Kenneth Fletcher suggests that a risk-based approach to passenger screening tailored to the US aviation security framework would be more effective and legally defensible than the Israeli airport security model. Risk-based screening is part of a comprehensive aviation security strategy, interacting with physical measures. Risk-based programs interact with physical screening measures to focus resources on unknown and elevated risk passengers, informing security protocols and adjustments based on threats. These programs also impact decisions on behavioral detection officers and air marshal deployment. Risk-based approaches to passenger screening have been in use since the early 1970s. In the early 1970s, risk-based approaches to airline passenger screening were implemented by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) using rudimentary passenger profiles. Screening techniques evolved with the deployment of metal detectors and X-ray scanners in the late 1970s, leading to a shift away from profiling. However, FAA continued to use profiling tools to analyze passenger name records for potential threats. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask all passengers basic security questions to address concerns over aircraft bombings. The basic security questions, used for years as screening measures, aimed to target elevated-risk checked baggage. They were criticized for being obvious and posed by airline ticket agents with little security training. The questions aimed to raise passenger awareness of security threats posed by bombers trying to deceive individuals into carrying devices aboard aircraft. TSA eliminated the use of these questions in 2006. Following the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system was developed to identify potential security threats based on flight reservation data. CAPPS, now overseen by TSA, uses algorithms to flag suspicious behavior like purchasing one-way tickets or paying with cash. Additionally, a \"no-fly\" list was created by FAA and FBI to deny boarding to known terrorists, but on 9/11, only 12 names were on the list. After the 9/11 attacks, the ATSA directed TSA to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for passengers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated TSA to evaluate all passengers using CAPPS or a successor system before boarding, focusing on risk-based screening. The TSA was directed to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for passengers after the 9/11 attacks. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated TSA to evaluate all passengers using CAPPS or a successor system before boarding, focusing on risk-based screening. This led to the development of CAPPS II, which aimed to enhance passenger prescreening with identity authentication, watch list checks, and expanded risk-based assessments. CAPPS II was a follow-on system to CAPPS that aimed to integrate identity authentication, watch list checks, and risk-based assessments of passengers. Despite controversy over privacy issues, CAPPS II was scrapped in 2004. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists for air passenger screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended in 2004 that air passengers be screened against a larger set of watchlists maintained by the federal government. TSA was required to take over passenger watchlist screening from air carriers and utilize the Terrorist Screening Database. TSA was prohibited from using algorithms to assign risk scores or commercial data for screening. The TSA implemented the Secure Flight program in 2009 for domestic flights and in 2010 for international flights. It screens passenger information against the Terrorist Screening Database, including the \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists. The TSDB contains fewer than 400,000 names, with about 50,000 on the watchlists. The Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) has grown to include about 875,000 names, serving as a principal data source for foreign terrorist identities in the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB). The expansion of TIDE was due to increased reliance after the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. The TSDB has also expanded to contain over 500,000 identities as of September 2012, with improved watchlist practices for timely and accurate processing of nominations and removals. Secure Flight, with over 500,000 identities as of September 2012, focuses on improving watchlist practices for timely and accurate processing of nominations and removals. It compares airline passenger data against \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists, as well as the TSDB, to determine access denial or additional screening. It also checks passenger names against a CDC list for public health concerns. The TSA uses Secure Flight to compare airline passenger data against watchlists, including the CDC list for public health concerns. Records are destroyed within seven days if no potential match is found, but potential matches are retained for 7 years and confirmed matches for up to 99 years. Known traveler lists and lists of individuals disqualified from expedited screening are kept until updated. Secure Flight was developed based on experience with the Advance Passenger Information System. CBP collects passenger manifest data from airlines for international flights to the US, cross-checking it with law enforcement and terrorist watchlists using the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) for risk assessments. ATS-P helps CBP decide on admitting individuals to the US by comparing passenger data against databases. The system does not use a risk scoring methodology but identifies potential matches to terrorist databases. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) compares passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify potential matches to terrorist identities and wanted criminals. Data in the ATS may be retained for up to 15 years, with passenger name record data depersonalized within six months. Travelers with passports from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. Travelers with passports from Visa Waiver Program countries must electronically submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization before boarding a U.S.-bound flight. This information is checked against various databases for potential threats. Secure Flight and TSA's SPOT program aim to enhance airport security through database checks and behavioral observation. SPOT was tested in 2003 and by FY2012, almost 3,000 BDOs were deployed at 176 airports, costing around $200 million annually. The TSA's SPOT program, initiated in 2003, deployed almost 3,000 BDOs at 176 airports by FY2012, costing around $200 million annually. Despite claims of scientific validity, questions persist over the program's effectiveness and cost. SPOT is based on behavior detection techniques used in law enforcement, customs, and security, but differences exist between SPOT and traditional law enforcement behavior profiling. The TSA's SPOT program, unlike traditional law enforcement behavior analysis, focuses on interpreting non-verbal cues like facial expressions and eye contact to establish suspicion. This sets SPOT apart from law enforcement techniques that investigate specific crimes through extensive interviewing methods. The TSA's SPOT program uses non-invasive observation techniques and a formal scoring system to rate suspicion based on behavioral indicators, including non-verbal cues. Despite questions about its effectiveness, TSA claims a behavior detection officer can observe an average passenger in less than 30 seconds. The Government Accountability Office reported concerns about the program's ability to identify specific threats to aviation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported concerns about the TSA's SPOT program's effectiveness in detecting specific threats to aviation. GAO found that known terrorists had passed through checkpoints where Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) were stationed without being detected. TSA responded by conducting validation studies showing their behavior detection techniques were more effective than random selection. However, the study has not been publicly released for independent analysis. The TSA reported that its behavior detection techniques were nine times more likely to detect high-risk travelers than random selection. Despite impressive results, doubts have been raised by the GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General about the validity and utility of these techniques. The GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General raised concerns about the validity and utility of behavior detection techniques used by TSA in the SPOT program. Metrics used to evaluate the program do not directly relate to TSA's mission to deter, detect, and prevent terrorism. Wide individual differences among Behavior Detection Officers in terms of referrals to law enforcement were reported, questioning the training and operational use of behavioral indicators. The DHS Office of Inspector General found significant lapses in records-keeping and incomplete data about the SPOT program presented to TSA's senior leadership. They also noted a lack of consistent refresher training for behavior detection officers, raising concerns about the quality and consistency of the program. Questions have been raised about the quality and consistency of BDO training due to a lack of performance evaluation and recurrent training. Despite concerns raised by the GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General, Congress has not taken specific action to revamp the SPOT program. However, TSA's Pre-Check program, aimed at expediting processing for low-risk passengers, has received more positive feedback. TSA's Pre-Check program, designed to expedite processing for low-risk passengers, has been well-received. It began in 2011 and is available to select frequent flyers, trusted traveler program members, and others for a fee. This program is similar to the former Registered Traveler program, which was discontinued in 2009. The Registered Traveler program, implemented in 2007 under a public-private partnership model, allowed expedited screening for travelers at multiple airports. Background checks were initially conducted but later eliminated in 2008. The program was dismantled shortly after and replaced by TSA's Pre-Check program in 2011. The Pre-Check program by TSA resurrected extensive background checks for passengers, using biographic information to identify threats to aviation security. Approved individuals receive a known traveler number for expedited screening, but random thorough physical screenings may still occur. Authentication for Pre-Check is solely based on boarding passes, raising concerns about security measures. TSA's Pre-Check program relies on boarding passes for authentication, but there are concerns about the limited ability to verify them. The deployment of authentication technologies has faced delays and challenges, potentially compromising the screening process. TSA issued a system of records notice for individuals to apply for Pre-Check, defining the legal framework for collecting and retaining applicant information. The Pre-Check program allows members of the public to voluntarily apply by submitting biographic and biometric data to TSA for security threat assessments. TSA conducts criminal history checks through the FBI and accepts applications from U.S. citizens, nationals, and legal permanent residents. Ineligibility criteria include recent convictions or being under want within specified time periods. Applicants for the Pre-Check program must meet eligibility criteria, including not having recent convictions or being under want within specified time periods. TSA may reject applicants with certain criminal convictions and information from terrorist watchlists. Approved applicants pay a $85 processing fee and receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Those not qualified can appeal within 30 days. Applicants not qualified for Pre-Check can appeal within 30 days by providing supporting records. The $85 processing fee is non-refundable. TSA opened the first enrollment center in Indianapolis in December 2013, with plans for 300 nationwide. Applicants can pre-enroll online but must visit a physical center. The Pre-Check program has 300 enrollment centers nationwide and an online application process. Applicants can pre-enroll online but must visit a physical center for identification and fingerprints. Early feedback shows frequent travelers are satisfied with Pre-Check. TSA aims to provide expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by FY2015, but rapid expansion may lead to longer wait times in Pre-Check lanes. The Pre-Check program aims to provide expedited screening to half of all airline passengers by FY2015. As the program grows, wait times in Pre-Check lanes may increase, benefiting non-participating travelers who may also save time. Managed inclusion allows low-risk individuals to be randomly selected for Pre-Check lanes. New passenger screening canine teams and behavioral detection officers enhance security measures. New passenger screening canine teams and behavioral detection officers perform initial screening of passengers in the checkpoint queue. If no elevated risk is detected, passengers may be randomly selected for Pre-Check screening lanes. Military servicemembers are also allowed to use Pre-Check. Military servicemembers, including active duty members, reservists, and National Guard members, are allowed to use Pre-Check screening lanes for official and personal travel. Family members under 12 can also use Pre-Check when traveling with cleared military personnel. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard will soon be eligible for expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Pre-Check lanes are also used for screening uniformed airline crewmembers. Airline crewmembers, including pilots and flight attendants, undergo TSA-managed background checks and security assessments for expedited screening. The Known Crew Member database verifies their credentials for Pre-Check lanes. Military personnel and civilian employees also receive equivalent screening for expedited travel. TSA considers background screening for military personnel and civilian employees with defense clearances to be extensive, providing secure means for expedited screening. Random selection is still used for certain individuals in these sub-populations. TSA uses random selection for certain individuals in sub-populations eligible for expedited screening. Risk-based screening programs collect biographic and biometric data, as well as intelligence sources. TSA deletes data no longer needed according to its policy. TSA's collection and retention rules involve deleting data no longer needed, retaining records of individuals matching terrorist or criminal databases for extended periods, and keeping voluntary data like Pre-Check applications until updated. Personal data collected under risk-based programs may be used for identity validation and risk assessments but not shared with consumer reporting agencies. Personal data collected under risk-based programs by DHS may be shared among agencies for counterterrorism and homeland security purposes. Data may also be shared with intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial agencies for investigating violations, with protections under the Privacy Act of 1974. TSA and DHS were required to establish appeals procedures by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required TSA and DHS to establish appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats based on records in the TSDB. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 mandated DHS to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress for individuals wrongly identified as threats, leading to the creation of the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP). The DHS established the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to address situations where individuals claim to have been wrongly singled out. Passengers can file complaints online or by mail, and DHS requests supporting information within 30 days. Filers receive a control number to track their inquiry status online. If a traveler was delayed due to misidentification, DHS provides steps to resolve the issue, such as presenting a response letter during check-in for flights. The DHS established the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to address situations where individuals claim to have been wrongly singled out. Passengers can file complaints online or by mail, and DHS requests supporting information within 30 days. If a traveler disagrees with the resolution decision made by DHS, they may take further steps to appeal the decision. TSA decisions based on records maintained on individuals in connection with the Secure Flight program are largely exempt from judicial review. TSA released a market research announcement in January 2013 seeking information to expand expedited screening beyond the Pre-Check program by relying on third-party prescreening of passengers. The TSA is considering using large commercial databases for passenger risk assessments, raising concerns about privacy and data accuracy. Commercial data services have traditionally been used for consumer credit risk assessment and targeted marketing. The TSA is considering using commercial databases for passenger risk assessments, including CBP's ATS and other systems. Concerns have been raised about privacy and the use of personal information for purposes other than counterterrorism. Congress had previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening. Congress previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening for counterterrorism purposes. However, TSA's consideration of utilizing commercial data for risk-based assessments may lead to congressional oversight and potential legislative action. This raises concerns about privacy, behavioral profiling, and broader issues for Congress to address as TSA's passenger threat screening evolves. The TSA's risk-based screening of airline passengers raises broader issues for Congress, including concerns about data security, privacy, and the effectiveness of the programs. Experts suggest that risk-based screening should be part of a comprehensive security strategy rather than a standalone technique. The TSA's risk-based screening of airline passengers should be part of a comprehensive security strategy rather than a standalone technique. It is important to assess the adaptability and evolution of the risk-based approach to address shifting threats and incorporate new methods and capabilities. The effectiveness of the approach is difficult to evaluate due to limited public information on programs like the Pre-Check program and terrorist watchlists. The evolution of processes for terrorist watchlists and behavioral profiling techniques is not publicly disclosed. Changes made in response to security threats have not been acknowledged. The adaptation of TSA's risk-based strategy and intelligence practices remains undisclosed, raising concerns for congressional oversight. The selection of appropriate metrics is crucial for assessing security measures. The selection of appropriate metrics for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies is a key issue. Identifying suitable metrics is challenging due to the secrecy surrounding security measures and the limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism. Questions have been raised about TSA's choice of metrics for behavioral detection programs, with an emphasis on efficiency rather than security effectiveness. The limited number of terrorist encounters also raises concerns about false alarms. Efforts to address security effectiveness raise concerns over false alarms in terrorist encounters. The limited number of suspected terrorists compared to airline passengers results in more false alarms than valid threat detections. Reducing false positives could create gaps in threat detection capabilities. High false alarm rates misdirect screening resources and complicate the lives of individuals mistakenly targeted. Initiatives to reduce false alarms focus on thorough, accurate, and up-to-date terrorist databases. Secure Flight focuses on systematic culling and parsing of terrorist databases for thorough and accurate information. A redress process is in place for falsely targeted individuals. The effectiveness of these steps in reducing false alarm rates has not been publicly disclosed. TSA anticipates risk-based security efficiencies to save $120 million and reduce staffing by 1,500 positions in FY2015. Congressional oversight may examine if these gains compromise security effectiveness. Privacy concerns are also a consideration. In FY2015, TSA anticipates saving $120 million and reducing 1,500 positions through risk-based security efficiencies. Congressional oversight may question if these gains impact security effectiveness. Privacy and data protections are also of interest to Congress, with concerns about the implementation of privacy protections and data security measures. The curr_chunk discusses the characteristics of a comprehensive risk-based strategy in aviation security, including the ability to adapt to changes in threats, resources, and technologies. It also emphasizes the importance of identifying metrics for assessing program effectiveness and addressing potential impacts of false positives. Despite post-9/11 security measures, there is still a potential for large-scale threats. The debate over balancing security and privacy in aviation security policy post-9/11 remains a central issue despite elaborate security measures."
