    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom Consolidation Act of 2001\". Congress finds that full and active participants in the Partnership for Peace should be invited to become full NATO members, as stated in previous Acts. This includes the prompt admission of certain countries to NATO to promote economic stability and security in the region. Congress emphasized the importance of expanding NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe, beyond just Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia. The European Security Act of 1998 also highlighted the potential contributions of Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria to NATO's goals. At the Madrid Summit of the NATO Alliance in July 1997, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were invited to join the Alliance in the first round of NATO enlargement. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria are also seen as potential future NATO members, with the Alliance expecting to extend further invitations to nations willing and able to meet membership criteria. At the Washington Summit of the NATO Alliance in April 1999, it was declared that NATO will continue to welcome new members who can further the principles of the Treaty and contribute to peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area. No European democratic country fulfilling the Treaty's objectives will be excluded from consideration, regardless of geographic location. In late 2002, NATO will hold a summit in Prague, Czech Republic, to decide on additional emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to invite for the next round of NATO enlargement. In May 2000, foreign ministers of several countries declared cooperation in seeking NATO membership, stating that success for one country would benefit all, and eventual membership for all would be a collective success. President George W. Bush expressed support for NATO membership for all new democracies in Europe from the Baltic to the Black Sea during a speech in Warsaw, Poland on June 15, 2001. He emphasized the importance of security, freedom, and equal opportunities for all European democracies to join NATO. The speech highlighted the need to avoid using nations as pawns and to work towards advancing the collective goals of free European peoples. Former President William J. Clinton emphasized NATO's openness to all of Europe's emerging democracies during a speech in Detroit, Michigan on October 22, 1996. He stated that no nation would be automatically excluded, and no country outside NATO would have a veto. Clinton also warned against the reemergence of a gray zone of insecurity in Europe. Congress reaffirms its support for NATO enlargement as expressed in previous acts and declarations, endorsing further expansion of the alliance as outlined by Presidents Bush and Clinton, urging NATO allies to work towards this goal at the Prague Summit in 2002. Designation of Slovakia to receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Slovakia is designated as eligible to receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994, in addition to other countries already designated for assistance under related acts. The NATO Participation Act of 1994 designates Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria as eligible for assistance. Other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe may also be designated for assistance under the same Act. SEC. 5. Authorization of security assistance for countries designated under the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Authorization of Foreign Military Financing for fiscal year 2002 includes grants for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Romania. Subsection (a) of section 515 of the Security Assistance Act of 2000 is amended accordingly. The Security Assistance Act of 2000 is amended to provide grants for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Romania. Section 515 is amended by removing certain paragraphs and redesignating others."
