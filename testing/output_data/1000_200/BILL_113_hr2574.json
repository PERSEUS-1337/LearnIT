The \"Keep Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013\" extends the interest rate deadline to July 1, 2014 and includes modifications to required distribution rules for pension plans, specifically regarding the distribution of an employee's interest after their death. The distribution of an employee's interest after their death is subject to exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries, with distributions made over the beneficiary's life expectancy. If an eligible designated beneficiary meets certain criteria, distributions must begin within a year of the employee's death. The portion allocated to the beneficiary will be treated as distributed on the date distributions begin. The distributions to the surviving spouse of the employee must begin no earlier than the date the employee would have turned 70 1/2. If the surviving spouse dies before receiving distributions, the rules will be applied as if the spouse were the employee. The rules upon the death of an eligible designated beneficiary state that if they die before the employee's interest is fully distributed, the remaining portion must be distributed within 5 years. The definition of an eligible designated beneficiary is amended in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 401(a)(9)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define 'designated beneficiary' and 'eligible designated beneficiary' as individuals designated by the employee, with specific criteria for the latter including being the surviving spouse or meeting certain conditions upon the employee's death. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amends 401(a)(9)(E) to define 'designated beneficiary' and 'eligible designated beneficiary' as individuals designated by the employee, including the surviving spouse, a child under majority, disabled individuals, and chronically ill individuals. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 defines 'designated beneficiary' and 'eligible designated beneficiary' as individuals designated by the employee, including the surviving spouse, children under majority, disabled individuals, and chronically ill individuals. An individual not more than 10 years younger than the employee may also be considered an eligible designated beneficiary. Employees who become 5-percent owners after age 70 1/2 must distribute any remaining portion of an employee's interest within 5 years after reaching majority to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Employees who become 5-percent owners after age 70 1/2 must distribute any remaining portion of an employee's interest within 5 years after reaching majority to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section apply to distributions for employees who die after December 31, 2013, and to employees becoming a 5-percent owner. The amendment applies to employees becoming a 5-percent owner for plan years ending in calendar years before, on, or after the enactment of the Act. If an employee became a 5-percent owner before 2013 and has not retired by 2014, they will be treated as a 5-percent owner for the year 2013.
