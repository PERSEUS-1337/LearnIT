    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The findings by Congress highlight the importance of physical education for children's development, health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. Participation in quality physical education programs can lead to improved health and fitness in children, especially as the rate of overweight youth has increased significantly in recent decades. The percentage of young people overweight has more than doubled in the 30 years preceding 1999. Low activity levels contribute to obesity among children in the US. Obesity-related diseases cost over $100 billion annually. Inactivity and poor diet cause 300,000 deaths yearly in the US. Physically fit adults have reduced risk for heart attacks and stroke. Children are not active enough, with less than 1 in 4 getting vigorous activity daily. Surgeon General's 1996 Report emphasizes the importance of physical activity for health. \"Surgeon General's 1996 Report and CDC recommend daily physical education for all students in kindergarten through grade 12. Despite past resolutions, little progress has been made in providing quality physical education programs for all students.\" Quality physical education programs aim to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity for all students to promote healthy and active lifestyles. Every student in the nation's schools should have the opportunity to achieve the goals set by Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Local educational agencies must submit applications to the Secretary outlining plans to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals and state standards. These programs should include fitness education, motor skills instruction, and assessments to improve students' physical well-being. Physical education programs aim to help children improve their physical well-being through motor skills, physical activities, cognitive concepts, social skills, and healthy eating habits. Teachers in this field should receive professional development to stay updated on research and trends. The curr_chunk discusses the exclusion of extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC from the curriculum of physical education programs. This ensures that professional development opportunities focus on staying updated with research and trends in the field. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural areas, and large and small student populations. Funds may include participation of private and home-schooled students. Reporting is required for continued funding. \"Annual report required for continued funding of grants or contracts under this part to demonstrate progress towards goals. Secretary to submit a report to Congress on programs' success in improving physical fitness and recommendations for program continuation and improvement. Administrative costs addressed in section 10999J.\" \"Administrative costs for local educational agencies limited to 5% of grant funds. Federal share not to exceed 90% for first year and 75% for subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not supplant other available funds. Authorization of appropriations under section 10999L.\" Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 totaling $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 for each year from 2002 to 2004 to carry out the specified part."
