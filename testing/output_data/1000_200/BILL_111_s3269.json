    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with a high fatality rate for drivers in this age group compared to older drivers. Teenage drivers have a crash rate almost 10 times higher than drivers aged 30-60. They account for over 1/3 of fatalities in crashes they are involved in, with nearly 2/3 of fatalities being other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. The chance of a crash for 16-17 year old drivers doubles with 2 peers in the vehicle and quadruples with 3 or more peers. Cognitive distraction from hands-free devices is a concern according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, cognitive distraction from cell phones significantly affects teenage drivers' performance. Teenage drivers have a higher crash rate at night, with over 50% of fatalities occurring during nighttime. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found a 9% decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers after implementing Florida's graduated driver licensing system in 1997. The Journal of the American Medical Association reports that crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased between 1995 and 1999 in Michigan and North Carolina due to comprehensive graduated driver licensing systems. In California, teenage passenger deaths and injuries from crashes involving 16-year-old drivers declined by 40%, and the number of at-fault collisions decreased by 24% between 1998 and 2000 under the state's graduated driver licensing program. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that over 40 states have implemented 3-stage graduated driver licensing systems, but many states have not yet implemented other basic safety features to protect teenage and novice drivers. A 2001 Harris Poll shows that 95% of Americans support 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with an adult, and 92% support a 6-month learner's permit period. According to a 2001 Harris Poll, 74% of Americans support limiting the number of teenage passengers in a car with a teenage driver and supervised driving during high-risk periods like night driving. State graduated driver licensing laws. State graduated driver licensing laws require novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage process, starting with a learner's permit stage at 16 years old, lasting at least 6 months, and prohibiting the use of cell phones while driving. State graduated driver licensing laws require novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage process. The learner's permit stage lasts at least 6 months and prohibits the use of cell phones while driving. The intermediate stage follows immediately after the learner's permit stage, lasting at least 6 months and also prohibiting the use of cell phones while driving. The graduated driver licensing laws prohibit drivers under 21 from using cell phones in nonemergency situations, driving at night, having more than 1 non-familial passenger under 21 without a licensed driver over 21 present, and remain in effect until the driver turns 18. Additional requirements may be imposed by the Secretary of Transportation. The transportation requirements for learner's permits include 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training with a licensed driver over 21, a driver training course, and supervision by a licensed driver over 21 while operating a vehicle. Additional penalties may apply during the learner's permit or intermediate stage. During the learner's permit or intermediate stage, the grant of an unrestricted driver's license may be automatically delayed for individuals convicted of driving-related offenses like driving while intoxicated, misrepresentation of age, reckless driving, driving without a seat belt, or speeding. The Secretary of Transportation will create regulations for implementing penalties for driving offenses such as not wearing a seat belt, speeding, or other violations. SEC. 4. INCENTIVE GRANTS. For the first 3 fiscal years post-enactment, the Secretary of Transportation will grant states in compliance with section 3(a) if they apply. States must submit an application including a certification of compliance by the Governor. The Secretary will review applications to determine compliance. Amounts appropriated will fund these grants. The State must apply for grants to determine compliance with section 3(a). Funds will be apportioned based on a ratio of funds received under section 402 of title 23. Grants can be used for enforcing licensing processes and training law enforcement personnel. The State must enforce a 2-stage licensing process, provide training for law enforcement personnel, publish educational materials related to the law, and carry out administrative activities. $25,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from the Highway Trust Fund for these purposes. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year, the Secretary will withhold 3 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a). In the fifth fiscal year, the withholding increases to 5 percent. During the sixth and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will withhold 10 percent of funds from states not compliant with section 3(a) on the first day of the fiscal year under section 104(b) of title 23, United States Code. During the sixth fiscal year, the Secretary will withhold funds from non-compliant states. Withheld funds before the sixth fiscal year are available for distribution, while funds withheld after that period cannot be distributed. After the sixth fiscal year, the Secretary will withhold funds from non-compliant states. If a state complies with the requirements, the Secretary will distribute the withheld funds available for apportionment to the state. The distributed funds will remain available for expenditure by the state for three fiscal years. The distributed funds must be spent by the State within three fiscal years, or they will revert back to the Treasury of the United States if not used. If a State is not compliant with the requirements, any withheld funds will also revert back to the Treasury."
