    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing different approaches to controlling this pollution, focusing on market-oriented mechanisms for cost-effective solutions. The study compared versions of the \"Clear Skies\" proposal with more stringent bills introduced by Senators Jeffords and Carper. The Administration initially resisted conducting the study due to cost and difficulty but eventually relented. The Administration initially resisted conducting a cost-benefit analysis of the Clear Skies bill, but relented after pressure from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The analysis compared Clear Skies with other Senate bills and found that electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson promised to conduct the analysis, which has now been released. Electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution, emitting gases like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. These pollutants pose risks to human health and welfare. While some gases are regulated under the Clean Air Act, carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute to global warming, continue to rise. SO2 and NOx emissions have decreased due to regulations, but CO2 emissions remain unregulated. Regulations from the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments have reduced SO2 and NOx emissions from fossil-fuel-fired electric generating plants, but CO2 emissions continue to rise. In 2003, these plants accounted for significant percentages of the country's emissions. Controls on power plant emissions have evolved over time, leading to a complex system of regulations. Additional controls are being implemented to address the environmental and health impacts of these emissions. The health and environmental impacts of power plant emissions have led to a complex system of controls, including measures for NOx, SO2, and Hg pollutants. The US has voluntary limits on CO2 emissions but rejected mandatory limits under the Kyoto Protocol. The Senate has called for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases that won't harm the economy. There are ongoing efforts to simplify the air quality control regime. The air quality control regime is complex, with calls for a simplified \"multi-pollutant\" approach. This approach aims to regulate utility emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 to balance environmental goals with industry stability. Recent rules like CAIR, CAMR, and CAVR have already incorporated this approach. The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) and Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) aim to cap emissions of Hg from coal-fired power plants and reduce SO2 and NOx emissions that impair visibility. New ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particles require further reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions. Concerns also exist about mercury emissions affecting water bodies. Legislation is being considered to address power plant pollution, including mercury emissions into water bodies. Various stakeholders support comprehensive multi-pollutant controls on utilities to achieve health and environmental goals more effectively. Proposed bills would regulate SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from electric generating facilities through a system of tradeable allowances, similar to the acid rain program. Some proposals also include CO2 caps. Legislation is being considered to regulate power plant pollution, including mercury emissions. Proposed bills would implement national or regional caps on emissions through tradeable allowances, including CO2 caps. Key questions in the debate include the stringency of caps, reduction timelines, and whether carbon dioxide should be capped. The bills aim for 70%-80% reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions, and 70%-90% reductions in mercury emissions. The Clear Skies bill (S. 131) has the least stringent standards and longest phase-in period, with final deadlines set for 2018 but actual reduction targets may not be met for a decade due to \"banking\" provisions. The proposed legislation aims for significant reductions in power plant pollution, including mercury emissions. The use of \"banking\" provisions in the regulatory scheme may cause delays in meeting the 70% reduction targets, with full reductions not expected until 2026 or later. The EPA's analysis of the Clear Skies bill shows that full 70% emission reductions may not be achieved until 2026 or later. The Jeffords and Carper bills, with earlier and more stringent caps on emissions, would lead to compliance at least a decade sooner. Clear Skies does not impose controls on carbon dioxide, unlike the Jeffords and Carper bills. This difference could impact compliance strategies, market dynamics for coal, and the use of natural gas or renewable fuels. EPA's cost-benefit analysis examined various options, including variants of Clear Skies and regulatory counterparts. The EPA's analysis compared six options, including variants of the Clear Skies bill, Carper's Clean Air Planning Act, and Jeffords' Clean Power Act. The results showed little difference between the Clear Skies options, simplifying the discussion to three main choices. The most recent version of Clear Skies, the Managers' Mark version, was chosen for analysis. EPA assumed that without new legislation, EPA and states would take action. The EPA's Multi-Pollutant Regulatory Analysis assumes no additional action on emissions without new legislation, despite recent rules finalized by EPA. The report uses this analysis as a baseline for clean air regulation. EPA's decision not to include these rules in the analysis is unclear. The EPA's Multi-Pollutant Regulatory Analysis serves as the baseline for clean air regulation, despite uncertainties in future legislation and evolving proposals. Regulations supporting passed legislation would face similar uncertainties and delays. It is crucial for analysis to work from updated baseline projections and assumptions. The EPA's cost analysis focuses on Electric Demand Price Elasticity, Short-term Construction Constraints, and Electricity Demand Growth. It considers scenarios with different levels of demand response to increasing electricity prices and constraints on emissions control equipment construction. The EPA analyzed scenarios with different electricity demand growth rates and natural gas prices, leading to the development of four scenarios based on these assumptions. The scenarios include variations in price demand elasticity and construction constraints. The EPA analyzed scenarios with different electricity demand growth rates and natural gas prices, leading to the development of four scenarios based on these assumptions. The scenarios include variations in price demand elasticity and construction constraints. The scenarios are: Zero Price Demand Elasticity, No Construction Constraint, Demand Response, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. The report uses the Demand Response Scenario as the benchmark analysis due to a compromise based on factors and lack of alternative combinations. Each scenario raises questions, but the strongest case is for including a short-term demand response function in the modeling. The EPA analyzed scenarios with different electricity demand growth rates and natural gas prices, leading to the development of four scenarios based on these assumptions. The Demand Response Scenario is chosen as the benchmark analysis due to a compromise based on factors and lack of alternative combinations. The strongest case is for including a short-term demand response function in the modeling, with well-established price elasticities. EPA's decision to only include this in one scenario is unclear. The EPA assumed limited boilermaker labor for constructing SO2 and NOx control equipment until 2010 in their regulatory rulemaking on the Clean Air Interstate Rule. This assumption has been questioned by the Institute of Clean Air Companies, who found no constraint on construction even if the deadline was moved to 2010. The air pollution control industry has shown they can install significant amounts of equipment in short periods of time. The air pollution control industry has demonstrated the ability to install significant amounts of equipment quickly, including SCRs for NOx SIP call, Germany, and Japan. Resources for projected installations under IAQR will not be limiting, with factors like modular construction and non-union labor reducing demand for union boilermakers. Additional boilermaker labor can be sourced from the Canadian union if needed. The availability of boilermaker labor for projected IAQR and control installations in 2010 and 2015 is sufficient, with additional labor sources from Canadian union and ship builders. Limited availability only affects certain scenarios, with questions on assumptions regarding electricity demand elasticity. Addressing these assumptions is necessary according to CRS. The importance of including a demand elasticity function in benchmark analysis is emphasized by CRS, despite questions about feasibility constraints. Sensitivity analysis is crucial for understanding cost estimates due to uncertainties in future natural gas supply projections. EPA's model shows more natural gas availability at lower prices compared to EIA's projections. The EPA provides scenarios with steeper EIA supply curves for natural gas, but there are doubts about their accuracy due to the market's volatility. The Demand Response Scenario is used for analysis, with Clear Skies being a cost-effective option compared to other bills. Clear Skies is a cost-effective option with minimal costs and benefits compared to other bills. It has less stringent requirements, weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2. It aims to revamp the Clean Air Act's structure with a more cost-effective approach. The Clear Skies bill offers fewer benefits compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills, with annual benefits of $6 billion in 2010. The benefits of Clear Skies almost merge with the baseline increase in later years and lag behind the other bills. This is due to Clear Skies' less stringent pollution caps and relaxed implementation schedule. EPA compares the effects of the three bills to a baseline that does not include current Clean Air Act requirements. Adjusting the baseline to reflect current requirements shows that Clear Skies falls short in comparison. The Clear Skies bill, compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills, offers fewer benefits with annual benefits of $6 billion in 2010. Adjusting the baseline to reflect current Clean Air Act requirements shows that Clear Skies has essentially no incremental cost and its benefits are relatively small. Senator Jeffords' bill would have the greatest benefits, with $83 billion annually in 2010. Senator Jeffords' bill would have the greatest benefits, with estimated annual benefits of $83 billion in 2010, surpassing the Carper bill by $32 billion and Clear Skies by 14 times. In 2020, the benefits of Jeffords' bill are estimated to be $66 billion annually, three-and-a-half times more than the Carper bill and 22 times more than Clear Skies. Additionally, S. 150 would also be the most costly bill among the proposals. The Jeffords bill, while having the greatest benefits, would also be the most costly among the proposals. It would reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40%, leading to a significant increase in renewable energy sources and oil- and gas-fired capacity. EPA projects that a shortage of skilled labor will limit the installation of scrubbers by 2010, resulting in coal-fired power plants shutting down under the Jeffords bill. The projected impacts of S. 150 show significant increases in renewable energy sources and oil- and gas-fired capacity, with coal use also increasing. The net benefits of S. 150 exceed those of Clear Skies and S. 843, with S. 843 aiming for substantial emission reductions while avoiding short-term price increases. The bill's phased-in schedule helps mitigate EPA constraints on the analysis and develops a flexible approach to CO2 reduction. The bill S. 843 aims for emission reductions while avoiding short-term price increases. It develops a limited and flexible CO2 requirement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on various bills, focusing on price elasticity, short-term construction constraints, and electricity growth. The analysis assumes limited short-term price elasticity and construction constraints, along with EPA's electricity growth and natural gas supply curves. The EPA analyzed different scenarios including the No Construction Constraint Scenario, EPA Base Case Scenario, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. These scenarios varied in price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth assumptions. The No Construction Constraint Scenario removes short-term construction constraints but includes zero demand price elasticity. The analysis shows minimal impact on S. 843 and the Managers' Mark. The analysis shows that the swap of assumptions between S. 843 and the Managers' Mark has minimal impact. However, the assumption of zero demand price elasticity significantly affects the cost of S. 150, leading to a substantial increase in both short-term (36%) and long-term (157%) costs. This is due to the lack of demand-side reaction from consumers with zero elasticity assumed. The EPA Base Case Scenario replaces short-term price elasticity with zero elasticity, significantly increasing costs for S. 150 by 63% in 2010 and 147% in 2020. For S. 843, removal of price elasticity results in an 86% higher cost estimate in 2010. Demand response and construction constraints heavily influence EPA's 2010 cost estimates for S. 843. EPA's assumptions have little effect on long-term costs or the Managers' Mark. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario modifies EPA's assumptions by incorporating EIA's higher electricity growth and steeper natural gas supply curves. This results in higher costs, particularly for S. 150, due to zero demand response, increased demand for electricity, and tighter natural gas supply. The impact of higher growth and natural gas costs on S. 150 is significant, putting pressure on EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity. S. 843 is less affected, and the Managers' Mark shows no impact. A more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability is needed for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity greatly affects the short and long-term cost estimates for S. 150, especially with higher electricity growth and natural gas assumptions. The effect of EPA's assumptions on S. 843 is significant in the short term, with little impact on the Managers' Mark cost estimates. Over the long term, the effects decrease, especially with EIA's higher cost assumptions, due to S. 843's less aggressive time frame. EPA's assumptions have about equal effects on S. 843 in the short term, but decrease substantially over time. The Managers' Mark has minimal economic impact compared to existing laws and regulations. Two bills analyzed by EPA, S. 150 and S. 843, aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. S. 150 sets an emissions cap of 2.05 billion tons annually from 2010, while S. 843 sets a cap of 2.655 billion tons in 2009, decreasing to 2.454 billion tons in 2013. S. 843 has lower costs for CO2 allowances compared to S. 150 due to its more modest reduction requirement and slower schedule. The cost of CO2 allowances is significantly lower under S. 843 compared to S. 150, with S. 150 being more aligned with the Kyoto Protocol. EPA estimates show costs of $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020 for S. 150. The current EU price for a metric ton of carbon dioxide reduction is around $25. EPA did not develop new data on control technologies due to time constraints. The EPA and its contractor did not develop new data on the cost or cost-effectiveness of control technologies due to a short deadline. The analysis may overstate the cost of emission controls for mercury significantly, as advancements in technology have lowered costs since 2003. The air pollution control industry states that the cost of activated carbon injection controls is now only one-fourth of what it would have been in 2003. EPA's assumptions have less distortion in its analysis of S. 150 compared to S. 843. The EPA's analysis of S. 150 and S. 843 shows benefits outweighing costs, with monetized human health effects being the main benefit. Environmental benefits were not monetized due to methodological difficulties. The analysis did not estimate benefits, particularly environmental benefits like sulfur dioxide emissions' impact on acid deposition and mercury's effects on fish consumption advisories. This omission has the greatest effect on S. 150 and S. 843, which have more aggressive control schemes for SO2, NOx, and Hg. Additionally, the analysis does not model mercury health effects. The analysis did not estimate the benefits of reducing mercury health effects or controlling CO2 emissions. This omission has a significant impact on bills S. 150 and S. 843, which have more aggressive control schemes for pollutants. The absence of these factors understates the potential benefits of the Jeffords and Carper bills. The Jeffords bill is more aggressive in controlling CO2 emissions compared to Clear Skies. EPA's analysis shows that the Jeffords and Carper bills have more stringent standards with benefits outweighing costs. The reduction requirements and implementation schedule of S. 843 result in minimal carbon dioxide reduction costs. The costs of carbon dioxide reduction depend on the reduction amount and schedule. S. 843 has modest reduction requirements and a relaxed implementation schedule, resulting in low costs. As requirements increase and schedules tighten, costs rise. Mercury control costs are influenced by data timeliness, but EPA's analysis lacks current data. The analysis favors Clear Skies alternatives by overstating costs and penalizing short-term pollution reduction schedules. EPA's benefit analysis is limited and incomplete, disadvantaging alternatives with more stringent standards. The analysis of EPA's cost analysis for mercury control favors Clear Skies alternatives by overstating costs and penalizing short-term pollution reduction schedules. It lacks current data on natural gas price volatility and Hg control costs, making it outdated for congressional debate."
