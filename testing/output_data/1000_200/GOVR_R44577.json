    "content": "The House and Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the versions, and the final bill was signed into law on December 23, 2016. The President signed the final bill into law (P.L. 114-328) on December 23, 2016, highlighting selected personnel-related issues of high congressional and constituent interest. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for each issue discussed. Some issues were previously addressed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (P.L. 114-92) and CRS Report R44120. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but began reversing these increases due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. FY2016 and FY2017 authorized end-strengths are shown in Figure 1. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all branches. The FY2016 and FY2017 authorized end-strengths for military services are compared in Figure 1. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the House bill approving higher end-strengths than the Administration's request, particularly for the Army. The final bill set the minimum end-strengths at a level equal to the authorized end-strengths for FY2017. The final bill sets the minimum end-strengths at a level equal to the authorized end-strengths for FY2017, with a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength requested for FY2017. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. The Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for FY2017, with increases for two reserve components. The House bill proposed increasing the Army National Guard and Army Reserve end-strengths. The military pay raise for 2017 is set to increase by 2.1% unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. Increases in basic pay are typically effective at the start of the calendar year. Congress has not included a provision specifying an increase in basic pay. The military pay raise for 2017 is set to increase by 2.1% unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. Congress has not included a provision specifying an increase in basic pay for the past three years. The enacted bill for FY2017 specified a 2.1% pay raise effective January 1, 2017, overriding the President's requested 1.6% raise. The enacted bill for FY2017 specified a 2.1% pay raise effective January 1, 2017, overriding the President's requested 1.6% raise. Military personnel are entitled to government-provided housing or a housing allowance based on paygrade, geographic location, and dependents. The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) in the United States is determined by paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status. BAH rates vary by location but servicemembers of similar rank and family status should be able to afford comparable housing. A Senate bill proposed changes to BAH calculations, removing dependents as a factor in rate determination. The Senate bill proposed changes to BAH calculations, basing it on actual servicemember housing expenditures up to a maximum amount for a given location/paygrade. The new formula would also adjust BAH for servicemembers sharing living quarters based on the number of occupants. This provision would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting January 1, 2018. The Senate proposed changes to BAH calculations, adjusting it based on actual housing expenditures for servicemembers starting January 1, 2018. The new provision would cover certain members of the Armed Forces, including those entitled to basic pay on or after January 1, 2018, reserve and retired personnel on active duty, and servicemembers losing eligibility for BAH after December 31, 2017. The Secretary of Defense would need to submit proposed regulations by March 31, 2017, and DOD must provide a report to congressional committees by March 1, 2017 on transitioning. The enacted bill requires DOD to provide a report on transitioning to a new pay structure by March 1, 2017, eliminating Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. The provision aims to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force. The BAH has evolved over the past 20 years as a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas without government-provided quarters. The housing allowance was created to offset housing costs in high-cost areas where government quarters were not available. The allowance is tax-free and varies based on dependency status. The Secretary of Defense is directed to transition to a salary system aligning the allowance with compensation rather than its original purpose. The military retirement system is undergoing changes to modernize and reduce costs, including reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding a 401k-type element, allowing for a lump-sum payment, and introducing continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018, for new servicemembers and those with 12 years or less of service. The military retirement system is being updated to reduce costs and modernize, including changes like reducing the retired pay multiplier and introducing continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will apply to new servicemembers and those with 12 years or less of service starting January 1, 2018. The House and Senate agreed on a provision (Section 633) allowing the DOD to offer continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service in exchange for a 3-year commitment. This provision gives DOD flexibility in managing personnel based on retention trends. Additionally, Section 633 amends procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members, ensuring equal pay for reserve component members on active duty. The Senate bill considered expressing the sense of Congress that default contributions to the TSP should be to a Roth plan, which was not adopted. Additionally, a provision was adopted to allow cadets, midshipmen, and reservists in inactive duty status before January 1, 2018, a 30-day election period for the new retirement system following commissioning or transfer. The Senate bill did not adopt the sense of Congress for default contributions to the TSP to be to a Roth plan. However, a provision was added to allow cadets, midshipmen, and reservists in inactive duty status before January 1, 2018, a 30-day election period for the new retirement system following commissioning or transfer to active duty or active status. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases. Up to 50% of a servicemember's disposable retired pay can be divided in a divorce. Proposed changes would base the division on pay grade and years of service at the time of the divorce court order. The enacted bill allows for the division of disposable retired pay in divorce cases based on pay grade and years of service at the time of the divorce court order. Cost-of-living adjustments are included in spousal payments, and this provision does not affect prior divorce settlements. A military retiree's monthly retired pay may have a portion withheld to provide a survivor benefit after their death. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) typically pays 55% of the retired basic pay. Previously, servicemembers who died on active duty received 75% of their basic pay, while reservists who died during inactive-duty training received less based on years of service. This disparate treatment was addressed in the FY2017 NDAA. Surviving spouses can receive annuities from both DOD and VA. The FY2017 NDAA addressed disparate treatment by reducing SBP payments for surviving spouses who receive DIC from VA. The SSIA offsets this reduction and was set to expire in FY2017. Sections 642 and 643 of the enacted bill eliminate differential treatment under SBP for reserve and active component members who die from injuries during IADT. Section 643 of the FY2017 NDAA allows DOD to withhold SBP payments from CRSC when retired pay is insufficient. Section 646 extends SSIA until May 31, 2018, with a report due on affected individuals. Section 648 mandates an independent assessment of SBP. Section 648 of the FY2017 NDAA mandates an independent assessment of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) by a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC). The report will evaluate the effectiveness of the SBP for survivors of servicemembers, compare benefits with other government and private sector employees, and explore the feasibility of providing survivor benefits through alternative insurance products. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE, including replacing current options with TRICARE Select and TRICARE Preferred, with new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments. Annual enrollment fees were proposed for Medicare-enrolled retirees. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees and military family members. TRICARE for Life expenditures would also be reduced, with each uniformed service contributing $4,252 per active duty servicemember to the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees and military family members. The Congressional Budget Office estimated savings and costs associated with TRICARE proposals, such as pharmacy co-payment increases and TRICARE for Life enrollment fees. Section 701 of the enacted bill will establish a new TRICARE Select health plan option and modify the existing TRICARE Prime plan. The bill proposes changes to TRICARE, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees. It establishes a new TRICARE Select plan, modifies the existing TRICARE Prime plan, and requires the Secretary of Defense to submit an implementation plan by June 1, 2017. The bill proposes changes to TRICARE, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-payments for retirees. It establishes a new TRICARE Select plan, modifies the existing TRICARE Prime plan, and requires the Secretary of Defense to submit an implementation plan by June 1, 2017. The plan also includes a pilot program on value-based health care methodology in the TRICARE program. The enacted bill includes changes to TRICARE, such as new enrollment fees and cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and TRICARE Prime options. Cost-sharing for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries remains unchanged. The enacted bill includes changes to TRICARE, such as new enrollment fees and cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and TRICARE Prime options. A \"reserve and young adult\" category will be created for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee after a report is submitted to the armed services committees by the Comptroller General. The enacted bill includes changes to TRICARE, such as new enrollment fees and cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and TRICARE Prime options. The bill also addresses issues related to health care coverage changes, appointment availability, network providers accepting TRICARE patients, and satisfaction of TRICARE Select beneficiaries. TRICARE beneficiaries can access a pharmacy program through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments at military pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. DOD policy prefers generic medications over brand-name ones. Non-formulary medicines are generally not available at military pharmacies. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual co-payment increases to save money. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. Section 702 of the Senate-passed bill would have allowed beneficiaries to continue receiving drugs at no cost in military medical treatment facilities, with no changes to cost-sharing amounts for certain groups. Section 702 of the Senate-passed bill would have authorized the Secretary of Defense to exclude drugs with little value, give preferential status to non-generic drugs, and reduce DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021. It would also save $2.7 billion in health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries over 2017-2026. Section 702 of the Senate-passed bill would reduce net health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026. It would also decrease accrual payments into the DOD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund by about $1.5 billion over 2018-2021. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established in 2013 to support Armed Forces medical services. It manages TRICARE and oversees military treatment facilities. The agency aims to maintain medical force readiness. The conferees recommend consolidating all Military Treatment Facilities under a single agency to improve medical force readiness, access to care, health outcomes, and reduce costs. They believe the current structure hinders decision-making and innovation, and a streamlined management structure would lead to true reform and better care experience. The conference bill aims to consolidate all Military Treatment Facilities under a single agency to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the care experience for beneficiaries. Section 702 of the bill assigns the Defense Health Agency the responsibility for the administration of each MTF, including budget, IT, healthcare management, and policy oversight. Section 702 of the conference bill establishes a professional staff within the Defense Health Agency to oversee Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and codifies the roles of the services' Surgeons General. The Surgeons General will advise the Secretary on health matters and manage medical personnel. The Secretary must develop an implementation plan and submit reports to the armed services committees. The Government Accountability Office will review the plan. Section 703 of the bill adds a new section to Title 10 of the United States Code, requiring the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces. The provision includes exceptions for changes that may impact access to care for covered beneficiaries. The provision in the bill requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities for the armed forces' medical readiness, with exceptions for changes affecting access to care for covered beneficiaries. Current law specifies citizenship requirements for active and reserve component enlistees, which may be waived under certain circumstances. The Senate bill aimed to amend the citizenship requirements for enlistment in the reserve components, tying them to the active component's requirements. However, the conference bill did not include this provision. The Secretary of Defense can waive citizenship requirements for enlistment if deemed vital to national interest. The DOD announced new policies for maternity and parental leave, extending maternity leave to 12 weeks and seeking legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days. Parental leave for a servicemember whose spouse gives birth was first authorized in 2009 and is currently for a maximum of 10 days. Adopting servicemembers are eligible for up to 21 days of leave since 2006. In dual-service married couples, only one servicemember can take leave for adoption. Parental leave for servicemembers has been extended to 12 weeks for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, and 6 weeks for adoption. Secondary caregivers can receive up to 21 days of leave. The Secretary of Defense will define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers. Leave must be taken within a year of the event. The parental leave benefit for servicemembers has been extended to 12 weeks for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child and 6 weeks for adoption. The leave must be taken within a year of the event and is available to active component members, reserve component members on active duty, or those subject to a mobilization order exceeding 12 months. The Secretary of Defense may require servicemembers to extend their service obligation or reduce existing leave when taking parental leave. Section 521 of the final bill explicitly prohibits additional leave for military servicemembers. The bill adopted a provision prohibiting unauthorized military leave, with supporters citing benefits for military families and recruitment. Opponents fear negative impacts on readiness. Opponents of extending military maternity and parental leave are concerned about potential negative impacts on military readiness. Congress has shown interest in improving the Defense Commissary system, with no changes enacted yet. In FY2016, $1.4 billion was authorized for commissary funding, $100 million more than the President's budget request. The President's FY2017 budget proposed $1.2 billion for commissaries, reducing subsidies by $200 million from FY2016. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retired personnel, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians stationed overseas. The FY2016 NDAA required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on obtaining budget neutrality for the Defense Commissary and Exchange System. The report released by DOD stated that privatization would not replicate the benefits and savings provided by DeCA while achieving budget neutrality. Critics argue that unknowns should be fully evaluated before initiating a pilot program. Some critics argue that unknowns should be fully evaluated before initiating a pilot program for privatization of the Defense Commissary and Exchange System. A report by the Comptroller General highlighted that DOD's plan lacks specific metrics to achieve budget neutrality by October 2018 without taxpayer dollars or affecting benefits. The DOD report addressed three of the seven mandated benchmarks but did not define specific metrics for each. Sections 661 and 662 of the enacted bill allow DeCA to set prices based on market conditions. A pending report by the Comptroller General will address the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program. The conference report highlights reforms to the commissary system, allowing DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and accept the Military Star Card. These changes aim to maintain benefits, ensure savings for patrons, and support morale and welfare activities. Reforms include congressional oversight, common business practices, and private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products. Under current law, DeCA is required to set prices based on actual costs and can add a markup to private label goods to offset operating costs. CBO estimates this markup will decrease spending by less than $500,000 over the next decade. DOD is mandated to develop a strategy to optimize practices across DeCA and military exchanges to reduce reliance on appropriated funds without compromising benefits or revenue. The Defense Department aims to reduce reliance on appropriated funds for commissaries while maintaining patron benefits and revenue. Flexible pricing may be implemented, and conversion to a non-appropriated fund entity is possible if savings are maintained. The Defense Secretary must ensure no loss in pay for DeCA employees during the transition. Collaboration with industry experts is allowed for improving commissary operations. Acceptance of the Military Star Card is authorized. The conference report authorizes acceptance of the Military Star Card at commissary stores. References include CRS reports on defense budget highlights and military personnel issues, as well as DOD and GAO reports on commissary and exchange system operations. In the past few decades, Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemember off-duty education, credentialing programs, and transition services to support servicemembers and veterans in translating military skills into post-service education and employment opportunities. Notable programs include the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and the DOD Skillbridge program. The final bill eliminates the requirement for credentialing programs to be accredited by third-party bodies, instead focusing on meeting quality assurance benchmarks. Sections 567 and 568 mandate DOD reports on transition initiatives for servicemembers to obtain merchant mariner licenses, assess college credit for military skills, and evaluate program usage. The final bill includes provisions for processing TWIC applications for separating military servicemembers, providing information and applications for TWIC cards as part of TAP, notification on recoupment of separation payments, counseling on substance abuse during TAP, but does not include a pilot program for job placement services for reserve component members. The military's most senior officers, known as general or flag officers, hold key positions in the DOD. These officers include the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, service chiefs, and combatant commanders. The highest-ranking officers are generals or admirals, followed by lieutenant generals and vice admirals. The most senior General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the military hold key positions in the DOD, with ranks ranging from 1-star to 4-star. Congress limits the number of GFOs in each grade and periodically reviews their duties and compensation. A proposed bill aimed to restrict service and functional component commanders under combatant commanders to ranks no higher than lieutenant general or vice admiral, and to reduce the total number of active duty generals and admirals by 5. The proposed bill aims to restrict service and functional component commanders under combatant commanders to ranks no higher than lieutenant general or vice admiral. It also requires the reduction of active duty generals and admirals by 5. Additionally, it calls for the establishment of a new unified combatant command for cyber operations, led by an admiral or general. The bill would reduce the number of authorized active and reserve GFOs by 25%, with a heavier reduction in higher-ranking GFOs. The Senate bill proposes reducing the number of authorized active and reserve General and Flag Officers (GFOs) by 25%, with a heavier reduction in higher-ranking GFOs. The Secretary of Defense is required to decrease the total number of GFOs on active duty by 110 by December 31, 2022, amounting to an 11% reduction in authorized positions. The reduction in General and Flag Officer positions will result in a decrease in authorized positions for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, with an increase for the Marine Corps. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to adjust these reductions for national security reasons, with reporting requirements and a global manpower study mandated. The provision mandates a global manpower study for General and Flag Officer positions, with a 10% reduction in authorized positions. Results are to be submitted to Congress by April 1, 2017. Chapter 38 of Title 10 U.S.C. addresses the management of active duty officers trained in joint matters. There is debate over the qualification requirements for joint qualified officers, with concerns about the mix of service and joint experiences. Joint matters involve unified action by integrated military forces across different domains like land, sea, air, space, and the information environment. To become a joint qualified officer, individuals must complete specific joint professional military education requirements and a full tour of duty in a joint assignment. Joint duty assignments typically last two years for general and flag officers and three years for other officers, with the Secretary of Defense having the authority to waive this requirement. Both the House and Senate bills aimed to modify the statutory criteria for joint duty assignments. The House and Senate bills proposed changes to joint duty assignments, including standardizing the length at two years for all officers and expanding the definition of joint matters to include various operational areas. The Secretary of Defense would have the authority to designate other joint matters, and the definition of joint duty assignment would have been modified. The enacted bill adopted changes to joint duty assignments, including standardizing the length at two years for all officers and expanding the definition of joint matters. The Secretary of Defense would have the authority to designate other joint matters, and the definition of joint duty assignment would have been modified. The Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) requires most males between 18 and 26 in the US to register with Selective Service. Women are not required to register. Failure to register can result in criminal penalties and loss of certain benefits. Recent DOD policy changes have raised questions about the Selective Service registration exemption for women. Some argue for requiring women to register, while others question the need for the registration requirement. A Senate bill proposed expanding registration to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018, but this provision was not included in the final bill. There is debate about the necessity of the Selective Service System. The final bill did not include a provision to expand Selective Service registration to women. Instead, it requires the Department of Defense to conduct a review of the Selective Service System's benefits and viability, as well as potential manpower needs in emergencies. Additionally, the bill establishes a National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service to further examine these issues. The provision would establish a commission over 36 months with $15 million in funding in FY2017. Background: Issues of sexual assault and harassment in the military have received congressional and media attention. DOD issued sexual assault policies in 2005. DOD established sexual assault policies in 2005, following recommendations from the Joint Task Force and congressional requirements. The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) oversees service-level programs. DOD released a strategic plan in 2013 with updates in 2015, implementing initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to military justice, investigations, prevention, victim services, and accountability. The DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) is required by law to report statistics and analysis of sexual assault in the military annually. The Senate bill aimed to extend reporting requirements to 2025 and change the deadline for reports to Congress. The estimated cost for preparing the FY2015 report was $6.9 million. The FY2015 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military included findings from focus groups and surveys, highlighting concerns about retaliation for reporting instances of sexual assault. Both House and Senate bills aimed to increase training requirements for investigators, with the enacted bill adopting the Senate provision. The House bill's proposed modification of burden of proof requirements was not adopted. The conferees are concerned about reports of military personnel facing retaliation after making protected communications. They intend to assess the impact of the bill's provisions on reducing retaliation in the military. The enacted bill includes provisions for DOD to develop metrics on preventing and responding to retaliation in connection with reports of military sexual assault. Congress has also raised concerns about the character of discharge for veterans who experienced sexual trauma while serving. Congress has raised concerns about the character of discharge for veterans who experienced sexual trauma while serving in the military. Other-than-honorable discharges can prevent servicemembers from receiving certain benefits. The enacted bill amends the law to provide additional medical assessments and enhanced discharge review board consideration for servicemembers and veterans with PTSD or TBI related to sexual trauma. Currently, DOD handles sexual harassment under the Military Equal Opportunity Program, while SAPRO oversees sexual assault policies. The Senate Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about the definition of sexual harassment in the military and how it is handled under the Military Equal Opportunity Program. Section 548 of the enacted bill modifies the definition of sexual harassment for investigating complaints by commanding officers. In FY2014, there were 7,676 confirmed cases of child abuse or neglect in military homes, raising concerns about prevention and reporting. Rates of child abuse among military families are a concern, leading to the implementation of prevention and reporting initiatives through the Family Advocacy Program (FAP). DOD personnel are required to notify state child welfare agencies of suspected instances of abuse. The enacted bill requires reporting of child abuse and domestic abuse data to Congress annually. This provision aims to improve oversight of abuse in military families. Additionally, DOD domestic schools were initially required to conduct employee background checks, but this provision was not included in the final bill. The final bill did not include a provision for child abuse and neglect registries or National Sex Offender databases. Instead, it urged DOD to work closely with local school districts educating military family members to improve employment screening policies for the safety of military children. DOD is required to report on efforts to identify and address any shortcomings in employee screening processes within a year of the Act's enactment. In 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed a review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) at the recommendation of General Martin Dempsey. The review aimed to address shortfalls in employee screening processes in local school districts educating military family members. The General Counsel was tasked by Secretary Hagel to review the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), as well as consider recommendations from the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel. The Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) was established to propose legislative changes to the UCMJ and implementing rules in the MCM. This led to the submission of the Military Justice Act of 2016 by the Department of Defense on December 28, 2015. The Military Justice Review Group proposed changes to the UCMJ and MCM, leading to the submission of the Military Justice Act of 2016 to Congress. The House bill included comprehensive revisions to military justice, addressing courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. Notably, the House bill allowed the government to appeal sentences deemed unlawful or unreasonable, a right previously held only by servicemembers. Substantial revisions were also proposed to the punitive articles. The House bill proposed significant revisions to the punitive articles of the UCMJ, including the creation of new offenses such as prohibited activities with military recruits, fraudulent use of credit cards, offenses concerning government computers, and retaliation. The Senate bill also addressed various aspects of military justice, such as courts-martial composition, trial procedure, and sentencing. The proposed Senate bill addresses various aspects of military justice, including courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. Differences exist between the House and Senate language, particularly regarding the appeal of sentences and changes to offenses related to rape. The Senate bill proposed significant changes to offenses related to rape and sexual assault in the military justice system, including adding the use of \"position, rank, or authority to coerce the acquiescence of the other person in the sexual act\" as a punishable act. Differences between the House and Senate bills were resolved in conference, resulting in a comprehensive revision of the UCMJ. However, some provisions, such as interim guidance on sentencing parameters and an increase in minimum punishment for sex-related offenses, were not included in the final bill. The Senate bill proposed changes to offenses related to rape and sexual assault in the military justice system, including expanding the definition of committing a sexual act to include coercion through position, rank, or authority. The MOH review process has been criticized for being lengthy and bureaucratic, leading to lost records and conflicting evidence. Retroactively awarding the MOH or upgrading other awards is generally resisted to maintain integrity. The reluctance to retroactively award the MOH or upgrade other awards is based on maintaining integrity. DOD periodically reviews inquiries and reevaluates historical records. A review of military awards and decorations was announced on January 6, 2016, including the timeliness of the MOH process and review of recommendations for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Results are due to the Secretary of Defense on September 30, 2017. Medal recommendations for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan since September 11, 2001 are under review by the Secretary of Defense, with results expected by September 30, 2017. Section 582 of the final bill allows for the President to award certain valor awards, including the Congressional Medal of Honor, during specific contingency operations until December 31, 2019. The final bill authorizes the award of the Medal of Honor to Gary M. Rose and James C. McCloughan for acts of valor during the Vietnam War, waiving time limitations specified in the United States Code. Rose's valor was from September 11-14, 1970, while serving in Vietnam, and McCloughan's was between May 13-15, 1969, as a combat medic. The enacted bill authorizes the review of service records for Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander veterans of the Korean and Vietnam Wars previously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, or Air Force Cross. If records support, the Medal of Honor can be awarded with waived time limitations. The curr_chunk provides references to CRS reports and studies related to military personnel issues required by the National Defense Authorization Act. Congressional requests for pilot studies and reports are common within the provisions of the Act. The appendix includes reports related to military personnel issues required by the final bill."
