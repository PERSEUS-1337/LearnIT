    "content": "The \"Track It to Prevent It Act\" includes sections on improved climate assessments, service-wide 360 assessments, health welfare inspections, and reviews of security and diversity management. It also authorizes appropriations. In fiscal year 2012, there were 3,374 reported sexual assault cases in the Armed Forces, a 6% increase from the previous year. Additionally, approximately 26,000 members made anonymous reports of sexual assault, a significant rise from the previous year. Female members experienced unwanted sexual contact, with 77% also facing sexual harassment, while male members experienced unwanted sexual contact, with 52% also experiencing sexual harassment. In fiscal year 2012, male members of the Armed Forces who experienced unwanted sexual contact also faced sexual harassment, with 62% perceiving some form of retaliation. Commanders must comply with climate assessments to create a safe environment and identify trends in bad behavior earlier. According to a recent Government Accountability Office report, members often choose not to report sexual harassment and assault incidents due to fear of inaction and negative impact on their military career. Commanders' tolerance or ignorance of sexual misconduct perpetuates this behavior in the military, hindering cultural change. The Act defines \"sexual harassment\" and \"sexual assault\" as per Department of Defense directives. It also focuses on improving climate assessments and tracking results. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that command climate assessment results are shared with relevant commanders and their superiors. Each military department must include a designated form in performance evaluations for senior commanders to indicate if required assessments were conducted. Failure to conduct assessments will be noted in evaluations and impact consideration for promotion. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense will develop a tracking system to monitor commanders' conduct of command climate assessments. Unit commanders, in collaboration with the Inspector General, will compile climate assessments and create compliance reports detailing concerns, perceptions of leadership, and strategic plans for addressing issues. The Secretary of Defense will require commanders to include reprimands, counseling statements, and actions related to sexual harassment or assault in performance evaluations to increase visibility, identify trends of bad behavior early, and prevent the transfer of offenders. Additionally, there will be service-wide 360 assessments implemented. SEC. 6. SERVICE-WIDE 360 ASSESSMENTS. The Secretary of each military department will implement a 360-degree assessment program modeled after the Department of the Army Multi-Source Assessment and Feedback Program. A report on the feasibility of including the 360-degree approach in performance evaluations must be submitted to Congress. Individual counseling will be included in the performance evaluation process. SEC. 7. HEALTH WELFARE INSPECTIONS. The Secretary of each military department conducts monthly health welfare inspections to maintain security, military readiness, and discipline. Results are shared with commanders. SEC. 8. REVIEW OF SECURITY OF MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, INCLUDING BARRACKS AND MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENCES. The Secretary of Defense will review security measures on military installations, focusing on barracks and multi-family residences to ensure the safety of Armed Forces members and their dependents. This includes identifying security gaps and evaluating the use of 24-hour electronic monitoring or security personnel at entry points. Results must be submitted within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Defense will submit a report to Congress within 90 days, detailing the costs to address security gaps and implement 24-hour security monitoring at military installations. The Secretary of Defense will conduct a review of the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity to evaluate resource gaps, the role in sexual harassment cases, and collaboration with the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal year 2014 to carry out this review."
