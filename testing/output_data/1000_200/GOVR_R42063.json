    "content": "In the short run, the relationship between economic growth and the unemployment rate may be loose. Unemployment may not immediately decrease when economic growth picks up after a recession due to firms having underutilized employees on their payrolls. Employers can initially increase output without hiring more workers by raising current employees' productivity, temporarily boosting labor productivity growth. In the long run, output growth is determined by the combined rates of growth in labor supply and productivity. As GDP growth exceeds productivity growth, employment rises, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate. Okun's law, established in the 1960s, highlights the negative relationship between GDP growth rates and unemployment. Okun's law, established in the early 1960s by economist Arthur Okun, states that real GDP growth about equal to the rate of potential output growth is needed to maintain a stable unemployment rate. Potential output is a measure of the economy's capacity to produce goods and services when resources are fully utilized. The rate of growth in potential output depends on productivity growth and labor supply at full employment. High unemployment results in actual GDP falling short of potential GDP. When the economy is at full employment, growth in potential productivity and labor supply is crucial. High unemployment leads to actual GDP falling short of potential GDP, creating an output gap. If GDP growth lags behind labor force growth, not enough new jobs will be created, causing a rise in the unemployment rate. Conversely, if GDP growth exceeds labor force growth, the unemployment rate will decrease as new jobs are filled by previously unemployed workers. In full employment, growth in productivity and labor supply is essential. High unemployment results in actual GDP falling short of potential GDP, creating an output gap. If GDP growth lags behind labor force growth, the unemployment rate will rise. Only when GDP growth exceeds the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity will the unemployment rate fall in the long run. Policymakers need to know the rate of GDP growth to implement stimulus policies to reduce unemployment. The growth necessary to lower unemployment rates requires knowledge of labor force and productivity growth rates. Labor force growth has slowed over time, from 1.6% between 1950 and 2000 to 0.7% projected between 2010 and 2020. Productivity growth has varied, with rates of 2.8% between 1947 and 1973, 1.4% between 1973 and 1995, and 2.9% between 1995 and 2005. Since 2005, productivity growth in the private nonfarm business sector has slowed to 1.6% annually. To lower the unemployment rate, real GDP growth above 2.5% is needed. Okun's law suggests that for a 1 percentage point decline in unemployment, real GDP must grow about 2 percentage points faster than potential GDP. The unemployment rate may take some time to decline after an economic recovery. Following past recessions, it has varied from five months to over a year for the rate to start decreasing. The current recovery is closer to the longer end of this range, with the unemployment rate showing two consecutive monthly declines 12 months after the 2007-2009 recession. This delay in the decline of the unemployment rate has led to some periods being labeled as jobless recoveries. The unemployment rate varies in its decline after economic recoveries, ranging from five months to over a year. The current recovery from the 2007-2009 recession is considered a jobless recovery, with the unemployment rate taking about 3\u00bd years to fall by one-half of a percentage point. In contrast, the expansion following the July 1981-November 1982 downturn saw the unemployment rate fall more than one percentage point in just eight months. The July 1981-November 1982 downturn began with the highest postwar unemployment rate of 10.8%, falling to 9.4% in eight months. There was a debate on Okun's law and economic growth's impact on unemployment. Slow GDP growth in 2011 led to a stalled unemployment rate at 9.0%, but it dropped to 8.5% in December 2011 after output growth accelerated. In 2011, the unemployment rate dropped to 8.5% in December, despite slow GDP growth below 2 percent. Bernanke suggested a temporary disconnect may have compensated for earlier deviations from Okun's law. The New York Federal Reserve Bank found that Okun's law underpredicted the actual decline in the unemployment rate during long recovery periods after recessions. There is instability in the relationship between economic growth rates and unemployment, with variations possibly due to the stage of the business cycle. Owyang and Sekhposyan caution against relying too heavily on calculations linking changes in unemployment to output growth, while Ball et al estimated that output changes have the same effect on unemployment as suggested by Okun. Ball et al estimated that Okun's law holds true for both recoveries and recessions, with large output gaps persisting in jobless recoveries from 2009 to 2011. They believe that Okun's Law has earned its name as a reliable macroeconomic relationship. According to economist Robert J. Gordon, potential output has grown at an average annual rate of 3.4% since 1875. However, he predicts a slower growth rate of 2.4% in potential output over the next 20 years due to diminishing gains from information technology investments and declining labor force growth. This could result in a declining rate of unemployment with real economic growth exceeding 2.4%. Economists Basu and Fernald predict a 2.4% growth in potential output over the next 20 years. They suggest that disruptions in financial markets and a decline in household net worth could impact labor supply and constrain growth in the near term. Uncertainty surrounds estimates of potential output growth. Weidner and Williams analyzed past recoveries and found that potential output growth varied. They estimated rapid growth in the 1960s-1980s, moderate growth in the 1990s-2000s, and sluggish growth after the Great Recession. The Congressional Budget Office regularly projects potential output growth. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects potential output growth, with a forecast of 2.2% annual growth between 2012 and 2022. This lower projection is due to reduced potential labor force growth, mainly from increasing retirements among baby-boom generation workers. CBO also predicts that real GDP growth will remain below potential output growth until 2018, keeping the unemployment rate above 8.0% through 2014. The average growth rate of real GDP will stay below potential output growth until 2018, leading to an estimated unemployment rate above 8.0% through 2014, then decreasing to 5.9% by 2017 as the output gap narrows."
