For tax purposes, a child shall be considered a qualifying individual if they receive over half of their support from the parent with custody for the majority of the year. This parent is then classified as the \"custodial parent\" under the Internal Revenue Code. The child must receive over half of their support from parents who never married and lived apart during the last six months of the year. The child must also be in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the year. Amendments to this section apply to taxable years starting in 2002 and 2011.
