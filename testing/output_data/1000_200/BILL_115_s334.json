    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress finds that hydraulic fracturing has been used in the US for over 60 years in more than 1,000,000 wells. The Ground Water Protection Council released a report in 2009 stating that current state regulations for oil and gas activities are proactive in protecting water resources. All oil and gas producing states have regulations in place to protect water resources. The regulations in oil and gas producing states aim to protect water resources. Studies from the EPA and Ground Water Protection Council found no evidence of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission supports state regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission and EPA have not found evidence of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. Lisa Jackson and Bob Abbey also stated there have been no proven cases of water contamination from the fracking process. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are regulated at the Federal level under various environmental statutes, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. Congress has chosen not to include hydraulic fracturing in the underground injection control program under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The hydraulic fracturing process is regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 2011, new Federal regulations were proposed for hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A 2012 study found no evidence of chemicals from fracturing fluid in aquifers. In 2014, a report described state regulations designed to protect water resources. The report titled \"State Oil and Gas Regulations Designed to Protect Water Resources\" highlights the advancements in state-based regulations for groundwater protection in response to industry growth over the past five years. The term \"Federal land\" in this Act includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. State authority is addressed in Section 4. State authority is granted to regulate well treatments involving fluids under pressure with propping agents for fracturing purposes within a State's boundaries. On Federal land, such treatments are subject to the laws of the State where the land is located."
