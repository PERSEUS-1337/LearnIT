    "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are powered aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator. They can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. UAVs are either single air vehicles or part of a UAV system (UAS) consisting of multiple air vehicles, a ground control station, and support equipment. Military use of UAVs has been prominent in recent conflicts such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The military use of UAVs in recent conflicts has highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of unmanned aircraft. UAVs offer advantages such as eliminating the risk to a pilot's life and having aeronautical capabilities not limited by human factors. They may also be cheaper to procure and operate than manned aircraft. However, the lower procurement cost of UAVs must be balanced against their higher crash risk, and the minimized risk to pilots must be considered against potential drawbacks. The employment of UAVs has grown due to advancements in navigation and communication technology. Despite the historical use of UAVs dating back to the 1920s, it was not until the Vietnam War that they were utilized in combat. The \"silk scarf syndrome\" preference for manned aviation over unmanned has diminished as UAVs have become more mainstream. During the Vietnam War, UAVs like the AQM-34 Firebee were first used for surveillance. The Israeli Air Force's success with UAVs in the 1980s influenced the US to acquire UAV capabilities, leading to increased funding in the Reagan Administration's FY1987 budget. This marked the transition of UAVs in the US from experimental projects to acquisition programs. The FY1987 budget requested higher UAV funding, marking the transition of UAVs in the US from experimental projects to acquisition programs. The Predator and Global Hawk were utilized in conflicts like Operation Desert Storm and Afghanistan, showcasing their value in surveillance and armed reconnaissance missions. Investment in UAVs has been increasing annually, with the FY2001 budget at $667 million and FY2003 at over $1.1 billion. Congress has shown support for UAV development, with a requested $1.6 billion for FY2006. Congress has directed joint program offices to ensure commonality between services' UAV programs and expressed concerns about UAV program management. Congress has directed the formation of joint program offices for UAV program management and required DOD to submit a UAV roadmap. There have been instances where Congress advocated for a more aggressive approach to fielding UAVs. Congress has shown support and confidence in UAV technology, predicting that one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft will be unmanned within ten years. In 2001, Congress predicted that one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft would be unmanned within ten years. The development of UAVs has accelerated, raising questions about cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability. Congress may assess DOD's UAV efforts to ensure alignment with new investment goals. The comparison of UAV costs to manned aircraft costs is also a key consideration. UAVs are cost-effective compared to manned aircraft. They are used for various roles beyond reconnaissance and surveillance. Analysts suggest replacing manned aircraft with UAVs. The introduction of UAVs in large numbers may raise personnel issues related to recruitment and retention. The widespread deployment of UAVs may raise personnel and industrial base issues. Concerns about the impact on recruitment, retention, and skills needed for manned aircraft design are being raised. Additionally, as U.S. companies compete in the international UAV marketplace, concerns about proliferation and the need for control measures may grow. As the international UAV marketplace grows, concerns about controlling the spread of UAVs to dangerous groups or countries arise. Congress may need to strike a balance between supporting legitimate U.S. exports and curbing proliferation. The development and diversity of UAVs are accelerating, prompting questions about their management and incorporation into future military capabilities. The development and diversity of UAVs are accelerating, prompting questions about their management and incorporation into future military capabilities. The UAV programs range from combat-tested to not yet tested, with varying sizes and ranges. The inventory of UAVs has significantly increased, including second-generation derivatives and non-traditional vehicles. The inventory of UAVs has significantly increased, including second-generation derivatives and non-traditional vehicles such as Predator B, I-Gnat-ER, Snow Goose, Onyx, and Neptune. The increase in DoD's UAV inventory is largely due to the rising demand for UAVs to conduct a wide variety of missions beyond typical intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) tasks. The rise in DoD's UAV inventory is driven by increasing demand for UAVs to perform various missions beyond ISR tasks. Predator B has strike capabilities, while Predator As have been modified to carry weapons. The Joint-Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) will target air defenses. UAVs are also being considered for roles such as mine detection, border patrol, medical resupply, and force perimeter protection. Research and development funding for UAVs has increased due to their cost-effectiveness and advancements in technology. The rise in DoD's UAV inventory is driven by increasing demand for UAVs to perform various missions beyond ISR tasks. R&D funding in FY2006 for UAVs is more than double the total procurement funding for UAVs, suggesting accelerated acquisition will continue. Despite recent acceleration in UAV production, manned aircraft still represent 95% of all DoD aircraft. UAVs are seen as complements to manned aircraft, with the pace of UAV production expected to either continue or accelerate in the future. The rise in DoD's UAV inventory is driven by increasing demand for UAVs to perform various missions beyond ISR tasks. The Defense Science Board recommends accelerating the introduction of UAVs into the force structure. Air Force plans to grow UAV operations in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve are described as a \"massive introduction\" of the technology. General John Jumper indicated a significantly faster pace of production of UAVs, specifically of the Predator. This raises questions about the current and anticipated pace of UAV production. The rise in DoD's UAV inventory is driven by increasing demand for UAVs to perform various missions beyond ISR tasks. Congress has historically encouraged the acceleration of UAV acquisition and incorporation of certain capabilities. In the 109th Congress, there were calls for increased procurement and application of UAVs for non-military purposes. In the 109th Congress, there were calls for increased procurement and application of UAVs for non-military purposes, with concerns raised about DoD's enthusiasm potentially leading to issues in the future. Critics worry that an overly ambitious pace could impact the quality and efficiency of UAV programs, making congressional oversight more challenging. Representative Curt Weldon cautioned against aggressively fielding new types of UAVs. Oversight challenges arise in UAV programs due to potential cost overruns and deviation from design objectives. Representative Curt Weldon warns against hasty deployment of new vehicles, emphasizing the need for common standards and proper funding authorization. Some services are purchasing expensive UAVs without specific authorization, leasing UAV services from maintenance accounts, and reducing congressional oversight by incorporating UAV projects into larger program requests. The Global Hawk program faces challenges with crowded production schedules and aggressive funding strategies, leading to technology immaturity. A 2004 GAO report suggests a need for a slower pace and management changes to maintain quality and efficiency. Some argue that the rapid production of other UAVs like the Hunter and Predator shows that a fast pace can be successful. The Global Hawk program's challenges include crowded production schedules and aggressive funding strategies. Congress seeks assurances on taxpayer spending for UAV programs, with Section 142 of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act requiring written approval for new UAV procurement. Congressional oversight may focus on the effectiveness of DoD's administrative processes for UAV development and acquisition. Congressional oversight may focus on the effectiveness of DoD's administrative processes for UAV development and acquisition, including potential duplication of effort and calls for centralization of UAV acquisition authority. Many call for centralization of UAV acquisition authority to reduce duplication and ensure unity of effort, but concerns exist about stifling competition and innovation. UAVs are facing cost growth issues, with some now rivaling manned aircraft in expenses. The GlobalHawk program, for example, is estimated to cost $6.5 billion for 51 aircraft, with significant development cost overruns triggering concerns among appropriators. The Global Hawk program has experienced significant development cost overruns, leading to concerns among appropriators. The cost growth is attributed to factors like \"mission creep\" and inconsistent management practices, with the addition of multiple sensors driving up costs. Originally intended to carry one primary sensor, the requirement was changed to carry two or more sensors, increasing the UAV's price. The Global Hawk program's cost increased due to the requirement change for multiple sensors, leading to budget cuts and management shifts. The frequent organizational realignments in DoD's UAV development highlight the challenges in establishing a comprehensive management system. The challenges in establishing a comprehensive UAV management system within DoD's organizations have been evident through frequent organizational realignments. The Joint Program Office (JPO) and Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) were established but faced criticism and little progress. DARO was created in 1993 to manage UAV programs more effectively but was disbanded in 1998. Since the disbandment of DARO in 1998, there has been no centralized procurement focal point for managing DOD UAV efforts. Oversight authority now rests with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (OASD(C3I)), while the military services handle program development and acquisition. To enhance joint coordination of UAV programs, the OSD established the Joint UAV Planning Task Force in 2001. The OSD established the Joint UAV Planning Task Force in 2001 to increase joint coordination of UAV programs. The task force, under the authority of the Pentagon's acquisition chief, works to standardize payload development and promote a common vision for future UAV efforts. Dr. Glenn Lamartin argued that the task force is empowered to institute requirements and provide discipline to individual programs. The task force has published three UAV Roadmaps through the OSD. The UAV Task Force, established in 2001 by the OSD, aims to standardize UAV programs and promote a common vision. Despite concerns from Congress about management and interoperability, additional management mechanisms have been implemented, such as the Joint UAV Task Force and the UAV Interoperability Working Group. In 2003, the DoD created the UAV Interoperability Working Group to promote joint-service cooperation in UAV programs. The JROC established a UAV Special Studies Group in 2005 to advise on UAV issues. Reports in 2005 suggested OSD was considering appointing a service as the executive agent for UAV programs, but this plan was later abandoned by DoD. The DoD initially considered appointing a service as the executive agent for UAV programs, but later abandoned this idea in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The Joint UAV Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) addresses major interoperability and standardization issues, while the Joint UAV Center of Excellence works to improve interoperability and enhance UAV applications through various means. Management initiatives to increase system uniformity and interoperability have been numerous in the past three years. The DoD has established two organizations, the Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE, to promote joint coordination of production. Concerns have been raised over the constant organizational changes in UAV management, indicating a lack of a final structure. The GAO testimony in March 2005 criticized the DoD for the lack of oversight in UAV development, leading to the creation of these management groups. The GAO criticized DoD for the lack of oversight in UAV development, leading to the creation of management groups. The testimony highlighted the need for a central authority to guide UAV development efforts and investment decisions, questioning if the intended purpose of these bodies aligns with the GAO's concept. The GAO criticized DoD for lacking oversight in UAV development, leading to the creation of management groups. Questions arise about the final management authority and the future integration of UAVs in U.S. warfighting. The Joint UAV Task Force released roadmaps to guide UAV roles, technological progress, and investment needs. The GAO called for a binding framework from the Department of Defense. The 2005 UAS Roadmap emphasized the need for a strategic plan for UAVs, focusing on standards development and interoperability solutions. It does not prioritize specific UAS but identifies future technology advancements to meet warfighters' needs. The Roadmap provides guidance for incorporating new capabilities into current or planned UAS. The 2005 UAS Roadmap provides guidance for incorporating new capabilities into current or planned UAS, without establishing an authoritative blueprint for future UAV development paths. The discrepancy between the DoD's approach to the Roadmap's authority and the GAO's vision of a strategic UAV plan may spark debate. Congress may revisit GAO recommendations to evaluate the Roadmap's mandate for integrating UAVs into future warfighting capabilities. The U.S. Special Operations Command, U.S. Coast Guard, and other services are developing UAVs. A coordinated DOD-wide UAV investment strategy is crucial to avoid duplication and maximize resources. Congress plays a role in arbitrating between competing UAV investments and balancing cost with capability. Quantifying UAV cost efficiency is complex but essential for maximizing capabilities. The UAV community is exploring cost efficiency, with flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost (PAUC) being key measurements. Flyaway cost includes prime mission equipment and program management, while PAUC considers all acquisition-related appropriations. The difference between Global Hawk's PAUC and flyaway cost highlights a significant gap. The cost of individual remotely piloted vehicles can be misleading as they are part of a system that includes various supporting elements. Analysts comparing UAV costs to manned aircraft need to consider the cost of these supporting elements and operational infrastructure. Monitoring UAV costs can be complicated by budgeting. The cost of unmanned aviation systems includes supporting elements and operational infrastructure. Monitoring UAV costs is complicated by budgeting conventions and the allocation of funds in different accounts. Establishing a uniform cost comparison mechanism is crucial for Congress to balance spending between UAVs and manned aircraft. The next step for Congress is to find a balance in spending between UAVs and manned aircraft. UAV funding is projected to exceed $18 billion from 2001-2010, far surpassing the previous decade's $3.5 billion. Funding for Joint Unmanned Combat Air System is expected to break $1 billion by FY2011. The Presidential Budget Requests for the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System is expected to exceed $1 billion by FY2011, indicating the Department of Defense's focus on UAV funding. UAV funding will remain under 10% of total military aviation spending, representing only three percent of all military aviation funding. The procurement and RDT&E of manned aircraft do not include small UAVs or lighter-than-air platforms. Cost savings from unmanned aircraft are often negligible due to expenses related to ground control stations and training for UAV \"pilots.\" While the air vehicle itself may be cheaper, the overall UAV system can be more expensive due to higher attrition and maintenance costs compared to manned aircraft. The higher attrition rate and lower reliability of unmanned aircraft can lead to higher operation and maintenance costs. UAV ground control stations can fly multiple UAVs simultaneously, somewhat offsetting the cost advantage. Studies have shown that replacing manned aircraft with UCAVs may not result in significant cost savings. Development costs for manned and unmanned aircraft are similar, but there can be savings in procurement costs for unmanned aircraft. The OSD faces challenges in balancing cost and capability between manned and unmanned aircraft. Concerns arise over rising prices of UAVs, including both high-tech and less technologically ambitious models. Former Air Force Secretary James Roche notes that sensor costs contribute to the overall expense of UAVs. The cost of UAVs is influenced by sensor expenses, with sensor payloads making up a significant portion of the overall cost. The increasing demand for sensors, coupled with limited competition in the market, is driving up costs. Some suggest adding self-protection devices to UAVs to mitigate these rising expenses. UAV sensor producers face little competition, keeping costs down. Some recommend equipping UAVs with self-protection devices as they are no longer considered expendable. Two schools of thought for UAV employment aim to balance cost with capability: fielding many smaller, less expensive UAVs controlled through a communications network, or fewer, more expensive UAVs. The use of UAVs in military operations can be approached in two ways: one advocates for a robust communications network to distribute mission duties among various platforms, while the other suggests using fewer, more capable UAVs like the Global Hawk. However, both approaches have faced delays and funding cuts due to management and technology issues. The key question now is where to invest to maximize the effectiveness of these UAVs. The future plans for UAV usage in military operations focus on key issues like interoperability, reliability, autonomy, and engine systems. Lack of interoperability has been a major concern, with the Department of Defense emphasizing the need for seamless communication between UAVs and ground components to prevent potential pitfalls. The Department of Defense has prioritized advancing the interoperability of UAVs to enhance mission effectiveness. Seamless communication between UAVs and ground components is crucial to prevent potential pitfalls and improve situational awareness. Dyke Weatherington highlighted the importance of interconnectivity in sharing data between services to address specific threats effectively. The DoD is investing in establishing inter-communication among UAVs to facilitate interoperability among different categories. The DoD is advancing UAV interoperability by establishing inter-communication between similar UAVs to facilitate interoperability among four categories: situational awareness, payload transfer, weapons coordination, and air vehicle control. Despite the framework being in place, technology development has been slow. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act encouraged inter-platform communication by requiring all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link for real-time situational awareness and targeting data. The 2005 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap aims to expand this communication system to all large UAVs for increased interoperability. The Common Data Link communications system is essential for tactical and large UAVs to achieve interoperability. The finite bandwidth available for military aircraft may hinder the expansion of UAV applications. The increased use of UAVs in wars highlights the need for a more robust information transfer system in the future. The military's use of UAVs is limited by inadequate bandwidth for information transfer, hindering their effectiveness. Representative Curt Weldon highlighted the issue of UAVs sitting idle due to bandwidth constraints. The Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to address this concern. The Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to provide unlimited bandwidth for U.S. armed forces to send and receive critical information worldwide. Despite funding cutbacks, the project is expected to be deployed between 2015 and 2016. Additionally, a more autonomous UAV could reduce bandwidth requirements by processing more data onboard. Investment in reliability upgrades is a high priority for UAVs in recent years. One solution to alleviate bandwidth issues is allowing UAVs to be operated from a manned stand-off aircraft, reducing reliance on satellites for communication. This approach also addresses pilot manpower and retention concerns by allowing pilots to \"fly\" while operating the UAV. Experimentation is ongoing in controlling UAV sensor payloads from the air. Investment in reliability upgrades is a high priority for UAVs. The Defense Science Board highlighted high UAV mishap rates as a potential obstacle to widespread deployment. Comparing mishap rates between UAVs and manned aircraft, UAVs appear to have higher rates. The Defense Science Board also noted that manned aircraft have improved their mishap rates over the years through system design advancements and reliability upgrades. The Defense Science Board highlighted high UAV mishap rates as a potential obstacle to widespread deployment. Most UAVs have lower total flight times than the 100,000 hours used to calculate mishap rates. Some UAVs have flown missions while still under development, like Predator and Global Hawk rushed into combat before their initial operational capability. Comparing mishap rates of developmental UAVs with manned aircraft may be unfair, as manned aircraft have undergone decades of modernization and refinement. The Defense Science Board highlighted high UAV mishap rates as a potential obstacle to widespread deployment. The report suggests that nominal upgrades and investments could reduce mishap rates. Investments in emerging technologies like self-repairing flight control systems and advanced materials are proposed to enhance reliability and survivability in adverse environments. One innovative priority is enabling one ground operator to pilot multiple UAVs simultaneously. At the 2003 Paris Airshow, Boeing's Mike Heinz discussed the goal of reducing operator workload by enabling one operator to control multiple UAVs. Currently, most UAVs require two ground operators, but the aim is to have a 2:1 operator-vehicle ratio and eventually allow one operator to control multiple vehicles. This advancement could significantly enhance UAVs as a force-multiplier on the battlefield. The potential for UAVs to act as a force-multiplier on the battlefield could be significantly enhanced by reducing operator workload through autonomous flight capabilities. Investments in control technologies are necessary for UAVs to work together effectively towards a common objective. The goal is to enable one operator to control multiple UAVs, ultimately improving combat capability. The OSD quantifies UAV autonomy on a scale of one to ten. Global Hawk has an ACL of 2.5, while J-UCAS aims for a level of six. Collaboration between FAA, UAV industry, and DoD is ongoing to enhance UAV autonomy. The timetable for achieving autonomous flight levels of six for UAVs is still far off. Collaboration between FAA, UAV industry, and Department of Defense is focused on developing \"see and avoid\" technology to increase the standard ACL for UAVs to four. Inter-UAV communication and interoperability are crucial for matching autonomous flight abilities. Full automation of sensor capabilities would allow a single operator to control a network of intelligence collecting drones. The Air Force has already begun steps towards one operator controlling multiple UAVs, with a recent evaluation of a Predator upgrade allowing one operator to pilot up to four UAVs using the Multi-Aircraft Control system. The Multi-Aircraft Control system upgrade allowed one ground pilot to control the flight plan of four Predator UAVs. The next step is to consolidate the tasks of the four mission payload operators into one or fewer operators. Heavy fuel engines are a top priority for UAV investment, with the development of heavy fuel engines being urged for Predator, Shadow, Hunter, and Fire Scout drones. The Defense Science Board recommended investing in heavy fuel engines for Predator, Shadow, Hunter, and Fire Scout drones due to the lack of commercial demand. The military has expressed a clear need for these engines, but industry has been slow to respond. Heavy fuel engines could improve UAV performance by allowing faster climbs, operation at higher altitudes, and reducing maintenance time on the ground. The integration of heavy fuel engines in UAVs like Shadow, Pioneer, and Predator could enhance performance, reduce servicing time, and lower maintenance costs. However, the initial acquisition cost of heavy fuel engines is higher, which may increase production costs for these UAVs. Developers are facing challenges in designing a lightweight engine for UAVs. Developers are struggling to design a lightweight engine for UAVs, which could increase production costs. An alternative being considered is a modified fuel cell that could double the efficiency of mid-sized UAVs. The Air Combat Command is sponsoring the project with the goal of using fuel cells in smaller UAVs. Concerns arise about the DoD's plan for UAV roles and applications in light of the growing UAV industry. The DoD's plan for UAV roles and applications is being questioned due to the rapid growth of the UAV industry. There are concerns about whether UAVs are being applied to new roles aggressively enough and if DoD is too eager to use them. Most UAVs are currently used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, with projections that this will continue to be the dominant role until at least 2014. The rapid growth of UAV programs has led to concerns about potential duplication of aircraft with the same mission. There are worries that like joint manned aircraft in the past, different services may be unwilling to compromise and accept UAVs developed by others. Congress has questioned the need for new maritime UAVs for the Navy. The Navy's need for a new maritime surveillance UAV has been questioned by Congress, who wonders why they can't just purchase the Global Hawk. Different ISR UAVs have similar sensors but vary in altitude, communications range, endurance, and takeoff/landing procedures. Congress may intervene to determine when a new UAV program is necessary or redundant. Performance specifications show most UAVs have 4-8 hours of endurance, fly at 10,000-20,000 ft, reach speeds of 105-125 knots, and have radiuses of 100-150 nm. Critics question the need for multiple UAVs with similar performance capabilities, suggesting a consolidated inventory of specific models could fulfill the same duties. However, proponents argue that the variety of UAVs reflects specific mission needs and user services, not unnecessary duplication. Landing/takeoff capabilities are also considered in the debate. In recent years, the role of UAVs in combat missions has significantly increased. The use of UAVs for combat operations was first publicly acknowledged in 2002 when a Predator UAV equipped with a Hellfire missile attacked and killed Al-Qaeda operatives in Yemen. The UAV combat landscape has evolved with various UAV models being equipped with different munitions and the development of UAVs primarily designed for offensive applications. The I-Gnat-ER, Fire Scout, and Hunter UAVs are being evaluated for arming, while the J-UCAS program aims to create the first UAV designed for offensive use. UAVs offer the advantage of attacking targets without risking flight crew. However, cost and effectiveness comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft are necessary to determine the best option for combat operations. The MQ-9 Predator B costs $11.7 million, while the F-16 Falcon costs $35.5 million. The F-16 can carry four times the payload of the Predator B, making it more cost-effective in terms of delivering munitions. The F-16 Falcon is a versatile combat aircraft that can carry four times the payload of the Predator B, making it more cost-effective in delivering munitions. Manned aircraft may generally be more cost-effective for air-to-ground combat compared to UAVs. UAVs have unique combat capabilities valued in niche circumstances, such as when manned aircraft are at extreme risk. UAVs are also useful for missions like electronic attack, psychological operations, and delivering medical supplies on the battlefield. UAVs like the Army's Shadow and Coast Guard's Eagle Eye are being considered for delivering medical supplies and homeland security missions. Congressional support exists for using UAVs for border security, with interest growing in their use for domestic roles like law enforcement surveillance. Interest is growing in using UAVs for various domestic roles, such as law enforcement surveillance, security monitoring of hazardous cargo trucks, and measuring radiation in the atmosphere. The GoldenEye 100 UAV is expected to be used for small-package transport by local law enforcement during civil unrest. UAVs may also be utilized in sparsely populated areas to search for forest fires and in disaster relief efforts like Hurricane Katrina. Some suggest that UAVs like Global Hawk could play roles in disaster relief efforts, including \"consequence management\" after events like Hurricane Katrina. Countries like South Korea and Japan have used UAVs for agricultural purposes. UAV advocates emphasize the need for FAA regulations to align with safety requirements for UAVs to be used in homeland security. The FAA granted the Air Force a certificate of authorization for national airspace operation in August 2003. The FAA granted the Air Force a certificate of authorization for national airspace operation in August 2003, marking the first steps towards reconciling discrepancies in UAV operations. Upgrading UAV collision avoidance capabilities is crucial for reaching common ground with airspace regulations. The FAA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems Working Group is collaborating with the Department of Defense to ensure safe UAV operations. The integration of UAVs into national airspace may face challenges, as highlighted in a February 2004 study by the Defense Science Board. The DoD has an urgent need to allow UAVs access to the National Airspace System. NASA planned to cancel funding for Access 5, a partnership for UAV incorporation, which could hinder UAV development. Large UAVs could potentially take on aerial refueling tasks currently done by tanker aircraft. The KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft have relatively benign flight profiles and operate far from enemy air defenses. The refueling crew's main job is to keep the aircraft flying straight and level. UAVs like the Global Hawk have demonstrated the ability to fly missions similar to aerial refueling. Future tasks for UAVs could include air-to-air combat, with experiments being conducted to outfit them with sensors and weapons. A Predator UAV reportedly engaged in air-to-air combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft, launching a Stinger missile before being shot down. In March 2003, a Predator UAV engaged in air-to-air combat with an Iraqi MiG, launching a Stinger missile before being shot down. This event signifies a potential advancement towards UAVs taking on more aggressive missions, although the debate continues on whether UAVs are the best platforms for such roles compared to manned aircraft, blimps, or space satellites. Some defense contractors are developing unmanned blimps that can float for months at high altitudes, carrying heavy payloads. The OSD's UAS Roadmap includes plans for lighter-than-air blimps and aerostat platforms for various roles like psychological operations and border monitoring. These platforms could offer similar services to border surveillance UAVs but with lower operational costs due to less fuel dependency. However, they lack maneuverability and speed compared to UAVs like the Global Hawk. Major UAV manufacturers aim to have an operational system by 2010. Some major UAV manufacturers aim to develop an operational system by 2010 for homeland security missions. Space satellites offer benefits like advanced capabilities and invulnerability to attack, but tasking them can be cumbersome due to competing national priorities. UAVs like Global Hawk are being considered as substitutes for low-orbiting satellite constellations due to high space launch costs. One concern is that UAVs may replace manned aircraft in large numbers. Critics warn that mass UAV production may lead to a decline in pilot skills and the loss of tactical flexibility in combat operations. The aviation culture has faced challenges in transitioning to flying aircraft remotely. The Air Force is now encouraging pilots to consider piloting UAVs as a major mission and to redefine concepts of operations. The Air Force is realizing the retention implications of requiring rated pilots to fly UAVs and is offering incentives such as plum assignments and allowing pilots to maintain their manned flying hours during their UAV tour of duty. The impact of DoD's UAV programs on recruitment is more complex than just a preference for manned aircraft, with recruitment and retention varying among the services and personnel types. The Air Force is addressing retention challenges by offering incentives for pilots to fly UAVs. Different services have varying requirements for UAV operators, with the Air Force requiring pilot-rated officers for Predator and Global Hawk operators. The increased use of UAVs may attract individuals who are interested in aviation but lack physical qualifications for manned aircraft. The Air Force is addressing retention challenges by offering incentives for pilots to fly UAVs. Some individuals may enlist due to the opportunity to \"fly\" UAVs, especially if they lack physical qualifications for manned aircraft. Flying armed UAVs may be more appealing to those inclined to fly manned aircraft. Flying UAVs offers a compromise, avoiding hardships of manned aircraft while still providing excitement. Control stations in the US may attract Reservists and Guardsmen disinclined to active duty. Not all UAVs compete with manned aircraft for pilots. The Air Force may reconsider the policy of requiring pilot-rated officers to operate UAVs as technology advances. Increased use of UAVs could attract enlistment in other specialties if they are seen as effective in missions. The potential impact of UAVs on boosting enlistment in other specialties and addressing defense industrial base issues is a key consideration for Congress and the Department of Defense. The pursuit of UAVs by the Department of Defense raises concerns about the impact on funding for manned aircraft programs and the erosion of technical expertise. Some argue that the ability to produce world-class combat aircraft should be protected, while others believe the industrial base is evolving towards advanced UAV production. Some argue that focusing on UAVs may lead to a loss of critical skills and technologies in manned aircraft design, potentially weakening U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft. However, others believe that pursuing UAVs does not jeopardize manned aircraft design skills as there is commonality between the two. Unmanned combat aircraft may require similar advanced features as manned aircraft. Unmanned combat aircraft, like manned aircraft, require stealthy airframes, advanced avionics, and high-performance engines. Major defense contractors are shifting towards unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive due to the increasing role of UAVs in warfare. Companies like Boeing and Northrop Grumman are exploring unmanned bombers and fighters for growth opportunities. The global UAV market is growing rapidly, with Northrop Grumman Corp. aggressively pursuing UAV business. The global market for combat aircraft is larger but projected to grow slower, while the UAV market is expected to generate much new business. The global UAV market is growing rapidly, with projections showing potential for new business opportunities. If U.S. companies do not capture this market share, competitors from other countries will. This growth presents policy concerns regarding UAV proliferation and export controls, with Congress expressing worries about the implications of UAV and cruise missile proliferation. UAVs and cruise missiles are concerns for policymakers due to difficult control of their proliferation. UAV components are similar to civil aviation, making it easy to divert technology for covert programs. This accessibility to countries or non-state actors raises worries about cost-effective weapon creation and defense. The George W. Bush Administration has expressed concern over the potential military effectiveness of UAVs in the wrong hands, as foreign companies are gaining access to key technologies that could make future UAVs even more effective. Policy makers are wary of potential exports of stealth technology and other advanced systems that could be incorporated into foreign UAVs. The potential for UAV proliferation raises policy issues regarding the dissemination of critical UAV technologies, balancing military aid to allies with concerns about weapon system proliferation, and the effectiveness of UAVs in enabling the discriminating use of military force. The section discusses the potential benefits of UAVs in reducing collateral damage and the need for tighter controls on UAV proliferation to prevent their use by enemy groups. It also addresses the program status and funding of prominent UAV programs pursued by the Department of Defense. Small man-portable UAVs are gaining popularity with ground forces but do not receive as much congressional attention as larger UAV programs like Predator or Global Hawk. These smaller UAVs are not weaponized and lack detailed cost and budget documentation. However, they are likely to compete with major UAV programs for congressional attention and funding in the future. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is a high-profile UAV with integrated surveillance and armament capabilities. It has accelerated development schedules and increased procurement funding due to its widespread use in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Predator has also paved the way for the development of related UAVs for various missions. It is a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV, roughly half the size of an Air Force F-16 Falcon. The MQ-1 Predator is a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. It has surveillance capabilities and operates at 10,000 to 15,000 feet with a maximum altitude of 25,000 feet. The Predator can stay on station for 24 hours, 500 nautical miles away from its base. Operated by the Air Force's 11th, 15th, and 17th Reconnaissance Squadrons, it is also used by the CIA for various missions. The MQ-1 Predator is a UAV used for reconnaissance and target acquisition. It is equipped with surveillance payloads including electro-optical and infrared cameras, a Multi-Spectral Targeting System, and synthetic aperture radar. The Predator also has satellite communications for beyond line-of-sight operations. The MQ-1 Predator, equipped with surveillance payloads and satellite communications, was upgraded to carry Hellfire missiles for precision attacks. Its military designation was changed to MQ-1 for multi-mission capabilities. The MQ-9 Predator B, or \"Predator B\", is General Atomic's follow-on to the MQ-1. The MQ-9 Predator B is General Atomic's follow-on to the MQ-1 Predator, with upgrades including a longer length and wingspan, a more powerful engine, and improved surveillance capabilities. It can reach a maximum altitude of 50,000 feet, a speed of 225 knots, an endurance of 32 hours, and a range of 2000 nautical miles.

The Global Hawk UAV is being enhanced with hyper-spectral sensors for increased imagery precision and laser communications for improved information transfer. The goal is to create a \"staring net\" with space-based sensors to prevent tactical surprises. The Federal Aviation Administration granted authorization for the Global Hawk to fly in U.S. civilian airspace, expanding its mission potential for anti-drug smuggling and Coast Guard operations. The RQ-4A is expected to reach initial operational capability in 2006. The Global Hawk UAV, developed by Northrop Grumman Corporation, entered low-rate initial production in February 2002. The Air Force plans to acquire 51 Global Hawks at a cost of $6.6 billion. Currently, the Air Force has 12 RQ-4A vehicles with a program unit cost of $128.7 million. The program has experienced an 18% cost overrun due to increased aircraft capacity for advanced sensor suites. The Global Hawk UAV program has faced rising costs and accusations of mismanagement by the Air Force. A Government Accountability Office report recommended delaying future purchases until a development strategy is in place. Congress and the Pentagon are concerned about the program's costs and management, leading to a debate on the Air Force's development strategy. The FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill criticized the Air Force for not using authorized funds for a counter-drug surveillance program, recommending a cut of $18 million to the President's R&D budget. In 2001, the Global Hawk program faced budget cuts, with a reduction of $18 million to the R&D request. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns in 2004 and cut the president's budget request for procurement. Despite these cuts, the Air Force's procurement budget for FY2005 was fully funded. Michael Wynne emphasized in December 2004 that DoD would not purchase UAVs that cost as much as manned aircraft with equivalent capabilities. In 2004, Michael Wynne, acting UnderSecretary of Defense for Acquisitions, emphasized that DoD would not purchase UAVs that cost as much as manned aircraft of equivalent capabilities. The Air Force planned to restructure the Global Hawk program in early 2005 to facilitate IOC by the end of the year. The House Appropriations Committee cut the President's FY2006 procurement request by $110 million and increased Global Hawk R&D by $21 million. Final appropriations and authorizations were pending Senate approval. The Army's Hunter program, originally developed by Israel Aircraft Industries and TRW, has faced turbulence with the cancellation of full-rate production in 1996. Despite this, the Army acquired 18 MQ-5B Hunter IIs with improved capabilities in FY2004 and FY2005. The Army acquired 18 MQ-5B Hunter IIs with improved capabilities in FY2004 and FY2005.
