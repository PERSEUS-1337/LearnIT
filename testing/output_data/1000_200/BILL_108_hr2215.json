    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year, caused by inadequately treated sewage filled with harmful pathogens. Swimming in contaminated waters can lead to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, resulting in significant economic losses due to beach closures. The economic impact of sanitary sewer overflows is significant, with beach closings valued at $1-2 billion annually and swimming-related illnesses costing $28 billion yearly. Many sewer systems lack monitoring and reporting, leading to public health risks. Improved monitoring and reporting could prevent millions of illnesses each year. Public health authorities are often not informed of sewer overflows that pose a threat. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system. This definition excludes combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups into buildings caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for publicly owned treatment works to implement measures for timely detection and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows that may impact human health. Publicly owned treatment works must notify the public and relevant authorities within 24 hours of any sanitary sewer overflow that may endanger human health. They must also report the overflow to the Administrator or State promptly. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 24 hours and provide a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, steps taken to prevent recurrence, and mitigation efforts. Monthly discharge reports must include all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows, including details such as the amount of wastewater released, duration of each overflow, location, responses taken, and actions to prevent future overflows, to the Administrator or State on monthly discharge reports. The State must report annually to the Administrator on the details of sanitary sewer overflows that occurred, as required by the EPA. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nSEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nIncreases appropriations to $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2004 through 2008."
