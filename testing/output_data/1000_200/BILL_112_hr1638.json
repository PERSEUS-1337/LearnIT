    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dollar Bill Act of 2011\". The Congress delegated the power to regulate the value of money to the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The value of the US dollar has significantly decreased compared to gold, oil, and other currencies, leading to instability. The Federal Reserve has not provided a stable value for the dollar. The Federal Reserve System has not produced a stable and reliable value for the United States dollar, leading to economic consequences such as increased costs of capital, risks in long-term investments, higher corporate income tax rates, reduced earnings for American workers, and decreased value of financial assets and retirement accounts. An unstable dollar has negative effects on pension plans, retirement accounts, economic standing, and causes anxiety in financial markets and the public. SEC. 3. DIRECTIVES TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is directed to make the value of the U.S. dollar equal to the price of gold on the COMEX exchange and maintain it at that level. They are also instructed to regulate the dollar's value without using open market operations and to use their banking powers to ensure stable financial markets during and after the transition. Effective January 1, 2011, entities can expense 100 percent of capital investment for tax purposes in the year of investment. The Congressional Budget Office will calculate the impact on Federal revenues of tax changes in this Act on a present value basis, similar to calculations done by the Social Security Trustees. This includes considering the acceleration of first-year expensing of capital investment and the historically higher returns on capital investments compared to government bonds. SEC. 6 of the Act states that in case of conflict with the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, the provisions of this Act will take precedence. SEC. 7 removes the Federal Reserve Bank's authority to pay earnings on reserves. SEC. 7 amends the Federal Reserve Act to remove the authority of Federal Reserve Banks to pay earnings on reserves."
