The Health Insurance Affordability and Equity Act of 2001 introduces a tax credit for individuals who pay for qualified health insurance for themselves, their spouse, and dependents. The credit is limited to $1,500 per eligible coverage month for each individual. The tax credit for individuals under the Health Insurance Affordability and Equity Act of 2001 is limited to $1,500 per eligible coverage month for each individual. A taxpayer can only take into account up to 2 individuals, with special rules for married individuals who do not file a joint return. The tax credit for individuals under the Health Insurance Affordability and Equity Act of 2001 is limited to $1,500 per eligible coverage month for each individual. An eligible coverage month is when an individual is covered by qualified health insurance paid by the taxpayer, and there was a 12-month period without coverage before that month. The tax credit under the Health Insurance Affordability and Equity Act of 2001 is limited to $1,500 per eligible coverage month for individuals who were not covered by qualified health insurance and were not eligible for an employer-provided group health plan. The credit amount is reduced based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. The tax credit under the Health Insurance Affordability and Equity Act of 2001 is limited to $1,500 per eligible coverage month for individuals without qualified health insurance or employer-provided group health plan. The credit amount is reduced based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income, which includes income excluded under specific sections. Amounts not multiples of $10 are rounded down. The applicable dollar amount for qualified health insurance coverage is $60,000 for taxpayers covering more than one individual and $30,000 for others or married individuals filing separately. Marital status is determined under section 7703 for this purpose. The term 'qualified health insurance' is defined as insurance that constitutes medical care, excluding coverage with less than 50 percent of the cost borne by the taxpayer. No credit is allowed for amounts paid under certain government-provided programs like title XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act. The section outlines that amounts paid under specific government programs are not eligible for a tax credit. Coverage under these programs is considered as coverage under qualified health insurance. Special rules state that no credit is allowed if the amount paid for qualified health insurance is used to determine other deductions. The amount paid for qualified health insurance is considered for deductions under sections 162(l), 213, or 222. No credit is allowed if a deduction under section 151 is available to another taxpayer for the same taxable year. Dollar amounts for adjustments are increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The amount for adjustments in qualified health insurance deductions shall be increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $100, it will be rounded down to the next lowest multiple of $100.
