    "content": "Establishment of initiatives for predominantly Muslim countries. The Congress finds that negative opinions of the United States in predominantly Muslim countries are distorted by misinformation and propaganda, which is detrimental to US interests. To improve this image, programs promoting American society and values should be established. The establishment of programs to promote American society and values among predominantly Muslim populations includes initiatives such as a journalism program and library development. The Secretary of State is developing a program to assist foreign governments in improving their public library systems to promote literacy, education, and youth recreation centers. The program includes training in library sciences and exchange opportunities for postsecondary study in the United States to advance American values, particularly freedom and democracy. Additionally, a program will be established to provide grants for U.S. citizens to work as English language teaching assistants in middle and secondary schools for at least an academic year. The Secretary will expand sister city partnerships to promote global cooperation at the community level, focusing on economic development, health care, education, and humanitarian assistance. Additionally, a program will be created for middle and secondary school students to visit the United States during school holidays. A program is established for middle and secondary school students from diverse countries to visit the United States for cultural and educational activities during school holidays. The visits aim to familiarize students with American society and values, with coordination with US schools encouraged. Additionally, efforts will be made to increase awards under the Fulbright exchange program. The J. William Fulbright Educational Exchange Program aims to increase awards for graduate students, scholars, professionals, teachers, and administrators from the US studying in predominantly Muslim countries, including subjects related to American studies. The Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowships will also be increased for candidates from these countries. Programs will be carried out under the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948. Programs established under this section will be carried out under the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 and the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961. The Secretary will establish a database of American and foreign alumni of international exchange programs to promote networking and communication. Additionally, a report will be made on the inclusion of freedom and democracy advocates in educational and cultural exchange programs. The Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress within 90 days regarding the implementation of a specific section of the Human Rights, Refugee, and Other Foreign Relations Provisions Act of 1996. The report will detail the number of grants for exchange programs, measures taken to include supporters of freedom and democracy in the selection process, and evaluate the openness of US exchange programs to these supporters in certain countries. The Act does not allow visas or admission to the US for inadmissible aliens. $35,000,000 is authorized for the Department of State for 2003 and 2004. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of State."
