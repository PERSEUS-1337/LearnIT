    "content": "Restrictions on transfers or discharges of nursing facility residents in case of voluntary withdrawal from Medicaid program. In case of a nursing facility voluntarily withdrawing from the Medicaid program, residents cannot be transferred or discharged solely based on the facility's withdrawal. Residents of a nursing facility cannot be discharged solely due to the facility's withdrawal from the Medicaid program. The facility must continue to provide care to existing residents until they are discharged, and new residents must be informed of the withdrawal orally and in writing. The nursing facility must provide oral and written notice to new residents about important information upon their arrival, separate from other documents signed by the individual. This requirement does not affect any participation agreement obligations of the facility. The nursing facility must provide advance notice to the State or the Secretary of its intention to terminate the agreement. Information for new residents includes the facility not participating in the program for that resident and the ability to transfer or discharge the resident if unable to pay charges. The nursing facility must give advance notice before terminating the agreement, even if a resident becomes eligible for medical assistance but cannot pay. Payments and oversight continue even after the facility withdraws voluntarily. After a nursing facility voluntarily withdraws from the State plan, it can still receive payments for services, maintain compliance with regulations, and be subject to survey and enforcement authority. The provisions of this subparagraph apply to a significant voluntary reduction in participation under a State plan for a resident entitled to medical assistance for nursing facility services. The subparagraph applies to voluntary withdrawals from participation in nursing facility services, excluding new residents starting after the withdrawal's effective date. The amendment applies to significant voluntary reductions in participation under a State plan for residents receiving medical assistance. The amendment applies to voluntary withdrawals from nursing facility participation and significant reductions in participation under the State plan, effective after the enactment date. A report on the impact of the changes on nursing facilities, residents, and Medicaid beneficiaries must be submitted to Congress within 5 years. The amendment requires reporting on the impact of changes to Medicaid participation, including recommendations for legislative changes deemed appropriate by the Secretary."
