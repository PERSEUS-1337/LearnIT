Congress finds that approximately 60 percent of Indian tribe members and Alaska Natives live on or near Indian lands with a high unemployment rate of 45 percent. These individuals own over 197,000 businesses, generating more than $34 billion in revenue. The service industry is the largest sector, followed by construction and retail trade. The number of businesses owned by these groups increased by 84 percent from 1992 to 1997. The number of businesses owned by Indian tribe members and Alaska Natives grew significantly from 1992 to 1997, with their gross receipts also showing substantial growth. The Small Business Development Center program proved to be cost-effective, generating additional tax revenues that far exceeded the program's cost to the Federal Government. Small businesses owned by these groups receiving services under the program are expected to have a higher survival rate. The Act aims to stimulate and foster economic development on Indian lands by providing business counseling and technical assistance to tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Increased counseling has been shown to reduce default rates associated with lending programs. The goal is to create new small businesses and expand existing ones owned by these groups. The Act aims to stimulate economic development on Indian lands by providing business counseling and technical assistance to tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. It seeks advice from Tribal Councils on where assistance is needed and ensures full access to existing business counseling programs. The Act provides small business development center assistance to Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to stimulate economic development on Indian lands. The Small Business Act is amended to provide an additional grant for Small Business Development Centers in eligible states to assist Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians with small business startups and expansions on Indian lands. The Small Business Act is amended to provide a grant for Small Business Development Centers in eligible states with a population of at least 1 percent Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians.

The grant applicants must outline objectives for the services to be provided, including the capability to train a representative number of Indian tribe members, the location of the proposed Small Business Development Center site, the required grant funding, and consultation with local Tribal Councils. The grant applicants must comply with all requirements of the section, with a maximum grant amount of $300,000 per fiscal year. The Administration will issue final regulations after consultation with the recognized Association to implement the grant program.
