    "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 placed restrictions on patents involving human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. The courts and USPTO have traditionally interpreted Section 101 broadly, but exceptions exist for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Several implicit exceptions exist to the four categories of patentable subject matter set out in Section 101, including laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Recent Supreme Court decisions have increased the use of Section 101 to invalidate patents and reject patent applications at the USPTO. Recent Supreme Court decisions have led to an increase in the use of Section 101 to invalidate patents and reject pending patent applications at the USPTO. Views differ on the impact of these decisions, with some concerned observers declaring the U.S. patent system to be in a \"state of crisis\" due to confusing legal standards, while others believe they may lead to patents of appropriate scope and curb abusive patent litigation. Former Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit criticized the Supreme Court decisions for creating chaos and departing from sensible patent policy. This report reviews the current law governing patentable subject matter and recent proposals for legislative reform, focusing on the implications of recent Supreme Court decisions. It discusses the impact on the information technology and life sciences industries and closes with a review of legislative reform options for patent protection. The USPTO officials, known as examiners, assess patent applications to determine if they meet the requirements set by the Patent Act of 1952. The application must include a detailed description of the invention and at least one claim that distinctly points out the subject matter. The examiner evaluates if the invention is novel and nonobvious compared to prior patents or publications. To be patentable, an invention must be novel, nonobvious, and useful. Novelty requires that the invention is not fully anticipated by prior patents or publications. Nonobviousness means the invention must not have been readily achievable by a skilled artisan based on prior knowledge. Utility is satisfied if the invention is operational and provides a tangible benefit. Additionally, the invention must fall within a category of patentable subject matter as outlined in Section 101 of the Patent Act. A patent may be obtained for a useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, subject to certain conditions. Process patents claim a series of steps to achieve a specific result, often related to methods of manufacture or use. The term \"machine\" includes mechanical devices, while \"manufacture\" refers to the production of a tangible product. The term \"manufacture\" refers to the production of articles from raw materials, while \"composition of matter\" includes all compositions of substances. Courts have set limits on patentable processes, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The Supreme Court has ruled that laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable. This decision is based on the belief that such inventions are essential tools for scientific and technological progress and should be freely available to all. If a patent application meets the requirements set by the USPTO, the applicant will be granted a patent, giving them the exclusive right to use and sell the invention for twenty years. The patent grants inventors the right to exclude others from using or selling the invention for twenty years. It allows inventors to profit from their discovery by charging higher prices. Patent owners must monitor competitors and may need to litigate to enforce their rights. The Federal Circuit has national jurisdiction over most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary authority to review cases. Recent decisions have shaped the law of patentable subject matter, with key cases in 1980 and 1981 establishing broad patentable subject matter for information technologies and life sciences. The Supreme Court's decisions in the 1980s established broad patentable subject matter for information technologies and life sciences. However, from 2010 to 2014, the Court issued four decisions narrowing patent eligibility, deeming inventions unpatentable under Section 101. This report discusses each decision, starting with Bilski v. Kappos in 2010, where the Court considered the patentability of a method of hedging risk in commodities trading. In 2010, the Supreme Court examined the patentability of a method for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading in the case of Bilski v. Kappos. The patent application involved initiating transactions between a commodity provider and consumers at fixed rates based on historical averages, balancing risk positions through transactions with market participants. The USPTO rejected the application. The Federal Circuit rejected Bilski's patent application for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading, stating that it did not claim patentable subject matter under Section 101. The Court concluded that the claimed process was not tied to a specific machine or apparatus, making it ineligible for a patent. The Court of Appeals rejected Bilski's patent application as it did not satisfy the first prong of the Section 101 inquiry and did not achieve a physical transformation. The USPTO decision to deny Bilski's application was affirmed by the Federal Circuit. The Supreme Court issued three opinions on the case, with no single opinion joined by a majority of Justices. The Supreme Court issued three opinions on Bilski's patent application, with a plurality rejecting the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for patentable processes. Justice Kennedy's opinion stated that abstract ideas like hedging are not patentable subject matter. Justice Stevens, along with Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor, expressed concerns about patenting risk hedging, stating it would grant a monopoly over abstract ideas. They agreed that the machine-or-transformation test is useful but not the only criteria for patentability. Justice Breyer highlighted four points of consensus among all nine justices regarding patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court's decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. shifted focus from information technologies to life sciences. Prometheus Laboratories held patents for methods of determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs for autoimmune diseases. The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole standard for assessing patentability, and not everything achieving a \"useful, concrete, and tangible result\" qualifies as patentable subject matter. The patents claim methods of administering a thiopurine drug to a patient and determining the levels of the drug or its metabolites in red blood cells. If the metabolite levels are outside the known range, the drug dosage should be adjusted to enhance treatment efficacy. Claim 1 of the `623 patent focuses on optimizing therapeutic efficacy for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders by administering 6-thioguanine and determining its levels in the patient. The Supreme Court concluded that the claims related to administering a thiopurine drug and determining 6-thioguanine levels in a patient were unpatentable as they were directed towards natural laws. The Court explained that patenting phenomena of nature and abstract concepts could impede innovation rather than promote it. The Supreme Court ruled that abstract concepts and natural laws could not be patented as it might hinder innovation. However, in the case at hand, the claims involved more than just natural laws, including steps like administering a drug and determining metabolite levels. The Supreme Court ruled that the claims involving administering a drug and determining metabolite levels did not add enough to natural laws to be considered patent-eligible processes. The Court reasoned that simply limiting the use of a natural law to a particular technological environment was not sufficient for patentability. The Supreme Court's ruling in Mayo v. Prometheus stated that simply limiting a natural law to a specific technological environment or advising individuals to use the law does not make it patentable. The three steps in the claim did not transform unpatentable natural correlations into patentable applications. The Supreme Court's opinion in Mayo v. Prometheus rejected arguments that the patents satisfied the machine-or-transformation test. Justice Breyer explained that the claims only required measuring metabolite levels, not transforming human blood or the body, and that identifying individuals interested in applying the law of nature did not affect patentability. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus addressed concerns about applying the law of nature and rejected the idea that any step beyond stating a law of nature would meet Section 101 standards. Justice Breyer emphasized that Section 101 considerations are separate from novelty and nonobviousness requirements. Additionally, the Court discussed worries that rejecting the patents would hinder diagnostic research, with Justice Breyer noting that granting patents on natural body responses could limit physician access to critical information. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101 due to the \"product of nature\" doctrine. Products of nature may not be patented, but can be if significant artificial changes are made, such as purifying or isolating them. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad in June 2013 ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. Over 50,000 patents related to DNA were issued by the USPTO, but some experts believed that patenting human genes was misconstrued. Litigation began in 2009 when the Association for Molecular Pathology and others filed a lawsuit challenging gene patents. The lawsuit challenged Myriad Genetics' patents on isolated human genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, associated with breast and ovarian cancer predisposition. The U.S. District Court invalidated Myriad's gene patent claims, stating human genes are naturally occurring and not patentable. The Southern District of New York invalidated Myriad's gene patent claims, ruling that isolated DNA was not markedly different from native DNA and therefore not patentable. The Federal Circuit later reversed this decision, stating that isolated DNA has been chemically manipulated to be patentable. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the matter back to the Federal Circuit with instructions to reconsider the appeal. Justice Thomas, writing for the Court, stated that Myriad had discovered the genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes but did not create anything. The Court was unimpressed with Myriad's claims of isolated DNA as not being an act of invention. The Supreme Court found that Myriad's claims on isolated DNA were not patentable as they did not involve chemical changes, but they did view claims on complementary DNA (cDNA) more favorably as it is synthetic and distinct from naturally-occurring DNA. Justice Thomas emphasized that cDNA is not a \"product of nature\" and can be patented. The case did not involve innovative gene manipulation methods related to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Justice Thomas clarified that the Myriad opinion did not address innovative gene manipulation methods or new applications of gene knowledge. The Court specifically stated that it did not consider the patentability of altered DNA sequences, affirming that genes and their information are not patent eligible simply by isolating them from surrounding genetic material. Justice Scalia concurred with the Court's judgment but abstained from endorsing detailed molecular biology aspects due to lack of personal knowledge or belief. In a recent Section 101 decision, the Supreme Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. The patents in question aimed to reduce settlement risk in financial transactions through method claims, computer system claims, and computer-readable medium claims. Justice Scalia abstained from endorsing detailed molecular biology aspects in the Myriad case, acknowledging his lack of personal knowledge or belief. The Supreme Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. The patents aimed to reduce settlement risk in financial transactions through method claims, computer system claims, and computer-readable medium claims. The district court and Federal Circuit ruled the inventions unpatentable as they were deemed a basic business or financial concept. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, addressing the patent eligibility of computer-implemented inventions. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that patents directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained the two-part test for identifying such patents, requiring additional elements to transform the claim into a patent-eligible application. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that patents directed to an abstract idea must have additional elements to be patent-eligible. Justice Thomas applied a two-step test to determine if the claims contained an inventive concept, concluding that the patented claims were merely implementing an abstract idea on a computer. The Supreme Court ruled that implementing an abstract idea on a computer does not make it patent-eligible. Justice Thomas emphasized that simply adding generic computer hardware to a claim does not transform it into a patentable invention. The Court rejected claims that only linked the invention to a specific technological environment without meaningful restrictions. This decision aligns with previous rulings on patent eligibility. The Supreme Court decisions in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice establish the current law on patent eligibility. The courts and USPTO use a two-part test to determine eligibility, focusing on whether a claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and if the claim includes additional inventive elements. If a claim preempts a field of activity or covers every practical application of a fundamental concept, it cannot be patented under Section 101. The Court also considers a claim's recitation of routine hardware. The courts use a two-part test to determine patent eligibility, focusing on whether a claim recites a fundamental concept and includes additional inventive elements. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost in this process. Section 101 determinations can be resolved early in litigation, often without a formal construction of the patent's claims. Statistical analyses show that challenging claims under Section 101 has a good probability of success. Statistical analyses indicate that challenging patent claims under Section 101 has a high success rate. Courts have examined 568 challenged patents citing Alice, with an average invalidation rate of 66.5%. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. The USPTO has rejected over 36,000 patent applications under Alice, indicating a good chance of success in invalidating claims. Recent statistics show that challenging patent claims under Section 101 has a high success rate, especially in the fields of information technologies and life sciences. The Supreme Court's interest in patentable subject matter has led to the invalidation of numerous patents on computer-related inventions. This trend has implications for various technologies, including chemicals, consumer devices, electronics, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, tools, and vehicles. The courts have invalidated numerous patents on computer-related inventions following the standards established in Bilski and Alice. Patent claims that do not describe specific solutions or improvements in technology are vulnerable to a Section 101 challenge. Invalidated patent claims include those for generating a second menu from a first menu, collecting information on an electric power grid, and extracting data from hard copy documents. The curr_chunk discusses various patents invalidated for not meeting the standards of patentable subject matter, including systems for digitizing data, tracking life insurance policies, and processing credit applications. One patent invalidated involved a broadcast system for cellular phones to receive content from a regional broadcaster. The Federal Circuit applied the Supreme Court's test for patentable subject matter. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent for a broadcast system on cellular phones that allowed out-of-region access to local content. The court deemed the concept abstract and not directed to implementation on cellular phones, but rather as an idea confined to that technological environment. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent for a broadcast system on cellular phones, deeming it abstract and not directed to implementation on cellular phones. The patent did not describe how the invention accomplished the claimed functions, confining the idea to cellular telephones. The Federal Circuit concluded that these circumstances did not satisfy Section 101, which has implications based on Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had consequences for the life sciences industry, affecting patentability of diagnostic methods and isolated bodily substances. The interaction of Section 101 with respect to life sciences has been less addressed compared to information technologies, with the 2015 ruling in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. being a notable case. The 2015 ruling in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. involved a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic method for detecting fetal DNA in maternal serum. The Federal Circuit decision on U.S. Patent No. 6,258,540 has sparked significant discussion in the patent community. The Federal Circuit ruled that the invention of detecting cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma failed the patentable subject matter test as it was considered a naturally occurring phenomenon. Judge Linn expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, highlighting the importance of the non-invasive technique in prenatal diagnosis. Judge Linn disagreed with the ruling on the patentability of detecting cell-free fetal DNA, emphasizing the significance of the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis technique. He argued that the breakthrough invention should be eligible for a patent, suggesting that Congress could consider legislative changes to the law of patentable subject matter. No bills addressing this issue have been introduced since 2011, but industry associations have proposed modifications to Section 101. Industry associations, including the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) and the Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO), have proposed modifications to Section 101 of the patent law in 2011. The AIPLA's proposal suggests replacing Section 101 with language that defines patentable inventions and exceptions to subject matter eligibility. The AIPLA and IPO proposed modifications to Section 101 of patent law in 2011, suggesting definitions for patentable inventions and exceptions to subject matter eligibility. The ABA Section of Intellectual Property Law also offered a related proposal to amend Section 101. The proposed amendment to Section 101 of patent law aims to clarify eligible subject matter for patents, with exceptions for preempting practical applications of laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. The AIPLA and ABA Section on Intellectual Property argue that eligibility under Section 101 should not be negated based on patentability considerations defined in Sections 102, 103, and 112. They believe Section 101 should serve as an enabling provision rather than a standard for determining patent protection for technical advances. The Supreme Court decisions have introduced ambiguity into patent eligibility by applying criteria like 'well known,' 'routine,' 'conventional or obvious,' turning eligibility into a patentability test. The IPO criticizes this analysis as contrary to congressional intent and too restrictive. Some argue against legislative reform, stating that restrictive rules have not impacted innovation or investment significantly. Proposed amendments could eliminate limits to software patenting. Proposed amendments could essentially eliminate limits to software patenting, according to observers. The AIPLA proposal would change the current statutory phrase regarding patent eligibility. This could unintentionally eliminate other common law patentability standards. Patents in software and life sciences have been controversial, with recent Supreme Court interest making patenting in these fields more difficult. Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has made patenting in software and life sciences more difficult. There is a debate on whether Section 101 strikes a balance between innovation and patent rights. Some experts fear that limited patent rights will hinder innovation and investment in the US, sparking further inquiry into what inventions can be patented."
