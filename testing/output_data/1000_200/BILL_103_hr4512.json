    "content": "The \"Welfare to Work Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress acknowledges the importance of transitioning individuals from welfare to work. The Congress recognizes the challenges faced by welfare recipients in finding permanent employment and believes that work experience in the private sector is crucial for developing valuable skills and breaking the cycle of welfare dependency. To break the cycle of welfare dependency, a one-year tax credit should be given to businesses for hiring AFDC recipients, leading to permanent employment and economic value. SEC. 3. REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR HIRING AFDC RECIPIENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a refundable credit for businesses hiring AFDC recipients. A tax credit is allowed for qualified first-year wages, with 50% of wages up to $6,000 and 25% of wages between $6,000 and $12,000. Qualified first-year wages are defined as wages for services in the first year of employment. The 1-year period in paragraph (1) is reduced by prior periods of service for other employers if wages were considered as qualified first-year wages. Qualified wages are wages paid to qualified former AFDC recipients. Wages are defined as per section 51(d). A qualified former AFDC recipient is certified by the designated local authority. For this section, a qualified former AFDC recipient is defined as an individual certified by a designated local agency as a family member receiving benefits under a State plan before employment, with wages making the family ineligible for benefits. No credit is allowed for wages paid to a qualified former AFDC recipient replacing an employee. No credit is allowed for wages paid to a qualified former AFDC recipient who replaces an employee with satisfactory performance and is terminated without cause. Certain definitions and special rules from section 51 and section 52 apply for this section. Technical amendments are made to sections of the Code. The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by striking the last item and inserting a new item from section 35. The amendments made by this section apply to individuals who start working for the employer after the enactment of this Act."
