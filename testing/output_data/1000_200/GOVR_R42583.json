    "content": "Federal job training and employment programs have aimed to connect vulnerable youth to work and school since the 1930s. These young people are typically low-income with barriers to employment, such as dropping out of school or being in foster care. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. WIA includes titles for job training, adult education, employment services, and vocational rehabilitation. Youth job training programs under WIA are carried out by the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor carries out federal job training programs for youth under Title I of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). These programs aim to connect young people to educational and employment opportunities, leadership development, and community service activities. Despite WIA's authorization expiring in 2003, funding continues through annual appropriation acts. Policy makers in the 112th Congress indicated potential reauthorization of the law. This report focuses on WIA youth programs, specifically Youth Activities and Job Corps. The report provides an overview of issues related to WIA youth programs, including Youth Activities and Job Corps. It discusses provisions of two bills: H.R. 803 and Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356). Job training and employment services for youth under WIA include WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. The Youth Activities under WIA include services at residential centers, YouthBuild for job training in construction, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders for juvenile and adult offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants for employment services in low-income communities. Although WIA's authorization expired in FY2003, Congress continues to appropriate funds for youth job training programs, except for the YOG program. These programs are carried out by the Division of Youth Services in DOL's Employment and Training Administration. The Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program, and Youth Opportunity Grants have been funded since FY2003. These programs aim to connect low-income youth with educational and employment opportunities, each serving youth with specific barriers. YouthBuild requires high school dropouts, while the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program focuses on youth offenders and those at risk of dropping out. Despite providing similar services, each program is implemented differently. The programs for youth offenders and at-risk youth provide employment and educational services in different ways. Youth Activities program requires specific elements like mentoring, while YouthBuild focuses on construction work. Job Corps offers residential services, and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program varies in activities. Funding for these programs is allocated by the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor funds various programs for youth offenders and at-risk youth, including mentoring, educational services, and reentry services. Funding is allocated based on formulas to states and local Workforce Investment Boards. Job Corps centers are operated through agreements with nonprofit and for-profit organizations, and cooperative agreements with the USDA Forest Service. YouthBuild and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program award grants to nonprofit organizations and local communities. Congress is working on reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act. For more information, refer to CRS Report R40929 on vulnerable youth employment and job training programs. During the 111th Congress, efforts were made to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) with a focus on youth programs. The Senate HELP Committee held listening sessions to address positive aspects of WIA and potential improvements. Stakeholders discussed refining the law to enhance the Youth Activities grant program. Subsequent hearings in July and October 2009 explored updating WIA to meet the needs of workers and employers in a changing economy. During the 112th Congress, hearings were held to discuss updating the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to meet the demands of a changing economy. The House Education and Workforce Committee focused on declining youth employment and removing inefficiencies in job training programs. Legislation to reauthorize WIA was introduced as the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012 (H.R. 4297) and was favorably reported in June 2012. The Senate HELP Committee also released discussion drafts to amend and reauthorize WIA during the 112th Congress. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce introduced the SKILLS Act (H.R. 803) to amend and reauthorize WIA. The bill was passed by the House and introduced in the Senate as the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) by Senators Murray, Alexander, Harkin, and Isakson. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) was introduced by Senators Patty Murray, Lamar Alexander, Tom Harkin, and Johnny Isakson on July 24, 2013. The Senate HELP Committee marked up the bill on July 31, 2013, and it was reported by a vote of 18 to 3. Issues raised during the WIA reauthorization process include proposals to consolidate workforce programs to make them more efficient and less costly, but concerns exist about potentially overlooking at-risk youth and other groups with barriers to employment. Congress may need to consider the role of one-stop centers and oversight bodies if youth programs are consolidated. Issues surrounding the coordination and effectiveness of youth workforce programs, including the need for greater coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth, have been raised. Congress is interested in evaluating the impact of programs like Job Corps and YouthBuild in meeting the needs of at-risk youth. Congress is interested in evaluating the impact of Youth Activities and Job Corps programs, specifically regarding eligibility requirements and serving older youth. Some argue that income eligibility criteria may exclude needy youth, while others believe it is necessary to ensure enrollment of vulnerable young people. Additionally, there is a debate on the emphasis the program should place on serving older youth. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily allowed youth ages 22-24 to access services under the Youth Activities program. There are debates on whether WIA should target older youth and focus on out-of-school youth. Concerns have been raised about the performance of Job Corps centers, leading to proposals for federal funding for states to operate or close centers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified overlapping federal workforce programs with varying models of service delivery. GAO recommended consolidating administration of selected workforce programs to improve performance outcomes. Legislation in the 113th Congress aims to consolidate various workforce programs, including those for youth, into a single Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) allocated to states and local areas for employment and training activities. Job Corps would remain separate, with substantive changes proposed. The bill aims to consolidate workforce programs into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states and local areas for employment and training activities. Required activities would include providing \"work ready services\" in the one-stop delivery system, with funding distributed based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth in each state. Job Corps would remain a stand-alone program with substantive changes proposed. The bill aims to consolidate workforce programs into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states and local areas for employment and training activities. States would set aside funding from the WIF for a competitive grant program to assist low-income individuals, including youth aged 16 or older. Grants could be awarded to local boards or nonprofits to provide employment and training services. State and local workforce plans would need to include strategies to help at-risk and out-of-school youth acquire education, skills, and industry-recognized credentials. The bill aims to consolidate workforce programs into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states and local areas for employment and training activities. It includes provisions to assist at-risk youth and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, credentials, and employment experience for success in the labor market. \"At-risk youth\" is defined as those ages 16 through 24 who are low-income and high school dropouts, youth in foster care, youth offenders, youth with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth. Chairman Kline stated that consolidating workforce programs in H.R. 803 would eliminate duplicative programs and ensure accountability. Concerns were raised about the proposed Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) potentially serving fewer youth due to lack of specific funding allocation. S. 1356 would maintain youth programs and establish Youth Innovation and Replication Grants (YIRG) for states and localities to improve education and employment outcomes for youth. The curr_chunk discusses the potential consolidation of youth programs with other workforce programs, highlighting the role of one-stop centers in serving youth. These centers aim to connect youth to job training, employment, and other services, even if they are ineligible for specific programs. Various federal programs currently provide services through the one-stop system, offering different methods to attract youth to the centers. Some one-stop centers use different methods to attract youth, such as actively recruiting, placing youth program staff, and training one-stop staff. However, some areas struggle to attract youth unless they are referred by schools or service providers. Stakeholders recommend that one-stops cater more to youth and improve training for service professionals. DOL supports targeting youth by funding planning projects for local WIBs and youths to enhance connections to the one-stop system. The Department of Labor (DOL) supports targeting youth by providing funding for planning projects to enhance connections to one-stop centers. This includes methods like co-locating youth program staff, customizing centers to be more \"youth-friendly,\" and establishing separate satellite centers for youth. Legislation requires states to continue funding one-stop centers for job search assistance, but does not specify youth services. Youth councils play a role in the possible consolidation of youth services. The bills do not address the extent to which youth would be served at these centers. Each local Workforce Investment Board (WIB) has a youth council responsible for developing parts of the local workforce plan related to eligible youth and coordinating services on behalf of eligible youth. Members of the youth council include representatives from various agencies and parents of eligible youth seeking assistance through WIA's grant programs. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented issues with some youth councils. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). Reports from GAO and DOL in 2002 identified difficulties in establishing youth councils, including issues with youth and parent participation due to transportation and scheduling conflicts. The DOL report highlighted \"enabling conditions\" for successful youth councils, such as having an established intermediary organization with strong stakeholder relationships and infrastructure for youth, provider, and business engagement. An intermediary organization with a strong reputation and infrastructure is essential for successful youth councils. Recommendations include creating stronger school-to-career partnerships and community-wide planning processes. Stakeholders suggest giving youth councils more flexibility in partner selection and requiring them to develop comprehensive youth plans. The legislation proposed in the 113th Congress would make youth councils optional and not require local workforce investment boards to have youth representatives, but would mandate state boards to include youth interests. Additionally, the bill would require state and local workforce investment boards to address the needs of vulnerable youth in their plans. S. 1356 would change local workforce investment boards to local workforce development boards (LWDB) and require them to establish three standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. The bill in the 113th Congress would make youth councils optional and not require local workforce investment boards to have youth representatives. State boards would need to include youth interests and address the needs of vulnerable youth. Local workforce development boards would be required to establish standing committees for the one-stop system, youth services, and disability services. Congress may want to consider best practices from existing youth councils to improve coordination between workforce and youth-serving systems. The perceived lack of coordination between youth workforce programs and other systems serving youth, like education, is a concern. WIA includes provisions for coordination, such as requiring local boards to have education representatives. Stakeholders suggest that better coordination can meet youth needs as intended by WIA. Existing WIA infrastructure can help facilitate coordination. The existing WIA infrastructure, including one-stop centers and youth councils, can facilitate coordination to meet the needs of youth as intended by WIA. A 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted ways in which the workforce and education systems have collaborated, emphasizing the importance of partnerships with community-based organizations, secondary schools, and colleges or universities for providing services to youth under the Youth Activities program. Some educators were cautious about partnering, but better coordination is essential for comprehensive youth development. Some educators were cautious about partnering with WIA for youth development services, citing concerns about the program being targeted only to at-risk youth. However, the Department of Labor and Department of Education are committed to collaborating to ensure all youth receive necessary services and support. The Department of Labor and Department of Education are working together to ensure that all youth, whether in-school or out-of-school, receive the services they need. The School-to-Work program was a past collaboration between the two agencies, providing grants for work-based learning and job training. Lessons from this program could inform future partnerships between the school and work systems. H.R. 803, a reauthorization bill, includes provisions for coordinating workforce and education systems. The House bill passed on March 15, 2013, allows local areas to include education officials on the local workforce investment board to facilitate coordination between workforce and education systems. The Senate bill, S. 1356, also addresses coordination with the education system by requiring states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years. The Senate bill, S. 1356, requires states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years, covering various programs under Titles I and II of WIA. This plan must analyze state economic conditions and outline goals for workforce preparation, including for youth. Stakeholders are concerned about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA. The D. Perkins Career and Technical Education programs under WIA are being evaluated for their effectiveness in serving at-risk youth. Few evaluations have been conducted, but the programs have generally met or exceeded their goals. Section 172 of WIA requires continuous evaluation of these programs to assess their effectiveness relative to their cost. The evaluations of programs and activities authorized under Title I of WIA are required to assess their effectiveness and cost. Legislation from the 113th Congress would mandate independent evaluations every five years. Limited information exists on the effectiveness of these programs, with only a few impact studies conducted since 2004. Rigorous impact studies involve randomly assigning individuals to treatment and control groups. The GAO report identified five programs not authorized under WIA, making it difficult for policymakers to determine their effectiveness. The Youth Activities program lacks formal impact evaluations, with only a few studies focusing on implementation. DOL has commissioned an impact evaluation through a research organization. The Department of Labor (DOL) has conducted impact evaluations of YouthBuild and Job Corps programs to assess their effectiveness. YouthBuild evaluation will provide initial results in 2015, while Job Corps evaluation focused on center practices related to performance measures. The study examined center practices in various areas such as general management, academic and Career Technical Training practices, student life, staff dynamics, corporate oversight, and community relations. Factors linked to strong performance included robust student support, staff accountability, and strong partner relationships. Job Corps program was evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s, showing positive outcomes in education and employment for youth ages 16-24. The evaluation of Job Corps program found positive outcomes in education and employment for youth. A follow-up report analyzed longer-term impacts on earnings and employment rates 5 to 10 years after enrollment. While overall employment effects diminished, older youth aged 20-24 at application saw increased earnings. The benefits for older youth outweighed the costs, with specified performance measures for Youth Activities and Job Corps under WIA. The discussion includes an overview of performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization bill, aims to eliminate current youth core performance measures and introduce new indicators for workforce program participants. These proposed measures would track entry into unsubsidized employment within the second quarter after program completion. The proposed indicators for measuring performance in workforce programs include entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in employment, earnings change, credential attainment, participation in education or training programs, and employment in a related field. S. 1356 establishes performance indicators for eligible youth in WIA Youth Activities programs, focusing on entry into education, training, or employment. S. 1356 establishes six performance indicators for eligible youth in WIA Youth Activities programs, including entry into education, training, or employment, retention, earnings, credential attainment, skills gains, and program effectiveness in serving employers. States may add more indicators, and the DOL Secretary must establish measures for Job Corps centers based on these indicators. Section 136 of WIA outlines state and local performance measures for the Youth Activities program. Under WIA, state and local performance measures are set forth for the Youth Activities program to assess the effectiveness of workforce investment activities. Core indicators for youth ages 14 through 18 include attainment of basic skills and secondary school diplomas. The core indicators for youth ages 14 through 18 in the Youth Activities program include attainment of basic skills, secondary school diplomas, and placement in postsecondary education or employment. Performance measures are negotiated between states and DOL, with stakeholders expressing concerns that the measures may not capture gains made by at-risk youth. The Government Accountability Office found that some local programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accepted high-functioning youth to meet performance targets. Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to help service providers assist lower-skilled youth while achieving goals. The Government Accountability Office found that some local programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accepted high-functioning youth to meet performance targets. Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to assist service providers in serving youth most in need while still achieving performance goals through six specific strategies. The GAO report encourages interagency collaboration for youth needs before WIA enrollment. Common measures allow flexibility for different ability levels. DOL guidance suggests using real-time indicators like attitude and skill changes. Some argue common measures don't promote workforce investment. The GAO report suggests interagency collaboration for youth needs before WIA enrollment. Some argue that common measures do not encourage workforce investment for higher-risk groups. Recommendations include adjusting performance levels downward for areas serving challenging youth populations, similar to adjustments made under the Job Training Partnership Act. Governors could adjust national performance standards based on economic and demographic factors for service delivery areas. The Job Training Partnership Act allowed governors to adjust national performance standards for service delivery areas based on economic and demographic factors. Different approaches were used to level the playing field across areas with varying conditions. WIA requires Job Corps to establish over 20 core performance metrics, including measures for entered employment, average wage, and retention in postsecondary education or employment. Additionally, DOL has implemented 33 performance metrics to assess program performance. The DOL has implemented 33 performance metrics to assess the Job Corps program's performance, developed from DOL policy and the Government Performance and Results Act. A 2011 report by the DOL Office of the Inspector General raised concerns about inaccurate reporting of results, lack of established targets for some metrics, and miscalculation of program participant costs. The YouthBuild program requires applicants to describe the results to be achieved, including common performance indicators. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, outlines performance indicators such as placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, and literacy and numeracy gains. DOL will provide further details on performance indicators through administrative guidance. DOL has issued guidance to grantees for awarding grants in the YouthBuild program. Performance indicators include retention rate and recidivism rate. Retention rate measures individuals placed in employment or education after exiting the program. Recidivism rate tracks participants re-arrested within one year of enrollment. Under H.R. 803, states and local areas would be required to have strategies and services to assist at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals with barriers to employment, and out-of-school youth ages 16 through 24. However, there is no mandate to serve a specific percentage of these young people or allocate a minimum amount of funding for such services. Eligibility for the Youth Activities formula program is contingent on meeting certain criteria. The Youth Activities formula program eligibility criteria include being age 14-21, low-income, and facing barriers like literacy deficiencies, homelessness, or being a school dropout. There is debate over the need for youth to prove their low-income status for the program. State and local officials find documenting income eligibility challenging. State and local officials find it challenging to document a youth's income eligibility for the WIA Youth program, as many eligible youth struggle to provide the required documentation. This diverts resources from direct service delivery. Youth face difficulty proving their eligibility, and the income requirements may exclude some needy individuals. Some states struggle to document youth's eligibility for the WIA program due to difficulties in providing required documentation. Youth may also face challenges in proving eligibility under other criteria, such as involvement in foster care or the justice system. States have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria, but waivers for participant eligibility are not allowed by DOL. States and local areas face challenges in documenting youth eligibility for the WIA program. DOL does not allow waivers for participant eligibility criteria. WIA regulations give states and local governments authority to establish their own policies for verifying eligibility, but stakeholders argue that flexibility is limited. Some states prefer using eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act. Eligibility for in-school youth included qualification for the federal free lunch program or participation in a Title I program. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) determined eligibility for in-school and out-of-school youth based on economic disadvantage. Stakeholders suggest adding eligibility based on residency in high-poverty areas. Youth in Youth Opportunity grant program sites were automatically eligible. Some propose including at-risk youth like dropouts, foster care youth, and homeless youth. Some stakeholders suggest expanding eligibility for at-risk youth in the Youth Activities program, including dropouts, foster care youth, and homeless youth, without regard to income. There are discussions on changing eligibility requirements to focus on means-tested programs or certain risk factors. Additionally, there is a debate on whether the program should prioritize out-of-school youth, including those who are not working. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) requires that 30% of Youth Activities funds be used for out-of-school youth who are unemployed or underemployed. However, local programs face challenges in recruiting and retaining these youth due to higher costs and difficulties in maintaining contact. Some stakeholders suggest allocating more funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, even if they are still in school. Some stakeholders recommend allocating a greater share of WIA Youth funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, including those still in school. There are differing opinions on whether to prioritize out-of-school youth or provide more technical assistance to meet their needs. Flexibility in funding allocation at the local level is also emphasized. The Department of Labor (DOL) has provided guidance to states and localities on serving out-of-school youth and at-risk in-school youth. DOL recommended strong alternative education programs for out-of-school youth, including dropouts, and funded Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants to reconnect youth who have dropped out to education pathways. Additionally, a 2004 report addressed successful implementation of WIA programs at the local level. The 2004 report for DOL addressed the successful implementation of WIA programs at the local level, including providing technical assistance, resources for out-of-school youth, and contracting with service providers for GED and vocational training programs. Youth aged 14 through 21 are eligible for WIA, with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily extending services to youth up to age 24. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded WIA Youth services to include individuals up to age 24 to address the growing number of unemployed young adults. Research suggests that factors like delayed marriage and high living costs have prolonged the transition from adolescence to adulthood, especially for vulnerable youth facing challenges like family conflict and employment barriers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded WIA Youth services to include individuals up to age 24 to address challenges like family conflict, employment barriers, and high living costs. Research shows older youth are more likely to be disconnected from work or school. Whether WIA should target these older, disconnected youth in reauthorization legislation is a key consideration. Funding constraints may arise if the program's age limit is increased, as seen in the influx of 21,000 youth aged 22-24 in the Youth program funded by ARRA. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expanded WIA Youth services to include individuals up to age 24. This led to an influx of about 21,000 older youth in the program. DOL advised workforce systems to co-enroll older youth in both Youth and Adult programs to meet their needs. It is unclear how youth ages 18-21 choose to participate in the programs. Exiters ages 19-21 in the Youth program increased from 28.1% to 34.8% in a recent period. In the Youth program, exiters ages 19 to 21 increased from 28.1% to 34.8% in a recent period, compared to the Adult program where youth ages 18 through 21 made up 10% of the exiter population. The Youth program offers more academic services like tutoring, while the Adult program focuses on job search assistance and dropout services. The Adult program offers dropout services and job search assistance during the core phase, while also providing occupational skills training and links to employment. Training activities include on-the-job training, workplace training with related instruction, private sector training programs, skill upgrading, and entrepreneurial training. The Youth program focuses on developing leadership skills, community service activities, and offers supportive services like child care and transportation. The Youth program provides supportive services like child care and transportation, adult mentoring, and job counseling including drug and alcohol abuse counseling. The Adult program focuses on job counseling during the intensive phase and offers referrals to services. DOL published a request for comment on selecting low-performing centers for closure based on performance rating and on-board strength criteria. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing low-performing centers as part of its reform agenda to improve center performance. Factors considered include on-board strength, facility condition, and ensuring at least one center remains in each state. DOL also plans to exempt certain centers from closure and consider the impact on specific student subpopulations. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers as part of its reform agenda to improve performance outcomes. The closure proposal is part of H.R. 803, which includes provisions to improve centers and close those that do not meet performance standards. The comment period for the closure proposal ended in February 2013, with no further information issued as of February 2014. The bill would require the DOL Secretary to develop improvement plans for centers reporting less than 50% on certain performance indicators. The bill H.R. 803 aims to improve performance outcomes of centers by implementing a program improvement plan for low-performing centers and closing those that do not meet standards. The DOL Secretary is required to conduct an audit ranking centers based on performance and incidents of violence, with a mandate to close the bottom quintile of centers within 12 months of enactment. The bill H.R. 803 aims to close underperforming Job Corps centers ranked in the bottom quintile within 12 months of enactment. Similar proposals have been made in prior Congresses to improve program efficiency by identifying and closing least efficient centers based on various criteria. The proposal in bill H.R. 803 aims to close underperforming Job Corps centers based on criteria such as center performance, incidents of violence, and cost. It also suggests transferring operation of Job Corps from the federal government to states, but some members are concerned about potential limitations on student access and funding shifts. Both the House and Senate bills passed, but a conference committee was not convened to resolve differences. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) would direct the Secretary to determine center closures and establish performance levels for the Youth Activities program. It also requires the DOL Secretary to develop a performance improvement plan and take necessary actions within current law. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 would require the DOL Secretary to develop a performance improvement plan (PIP) within a one-year period. Common measures, developed by the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA), include placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree, and literacy and numeracy gains. ETA introduced three measures for youth programs to collect and report program performance data. ETA introduced three measures for youth programs to collect, record, and report program performance data. These common measures are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The common measures do not supersede existing statutory performance reporting requirements for WIA, and states will continue to negotiate performance goals for the indicators required under the Youth Activities program. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires federal agencies to measure program performance. Table A-1 shows the goals and outcomes of common measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs. Goals are set ambitiously and may be adjusted for individual grantees. Performance targets are developed using regression analysis. The performance targets for Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Job Corps programs are set using regression analysis to determine the relationship between outcomes and explanatory factors. Factors such as program results, labor market conditions, and individual characteristics are considered to correct for the effects of the business cycle. The targets for placement in employment or education are based on economic assumptions, program results, and unemployment rates. Each program has met or exceeded its targets. The Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Job Corps programs have all met or exceeded their goals in PY2011 and PY2012. The placement measure tracks the share of youth enrolled in postsecondary education or employed in the first quarter after the program. The attainment measure tracks the share of youth who earn a degree or certificate during or after the program. The measure refers to the percentage of youth participants who attain a diploma, GED, or certificate by the end of the third quarter after exiting the program. The diploma includes credentials equivalent to a high school diploma, Associate's degrees, and Bachelor's degrees, earned from various educational programs excluding work readiness certificates. The measure assesses the literacy or numeracy gains of out-of-school youth in the program. Participants are tested in reading, writing, and math before and during the program to track educational functional level improvements. The program assesses literacy or numeracy gains of out-of-school youth through testing in reading, writing, and math before and during the program. Youth are tested at regular intervals after entering the program, excluding those not basic skills-deficient to focus on remediation. DOL provides guidance on types of tests, accommodations for disabilities, and eliminating testing burden on young people."
