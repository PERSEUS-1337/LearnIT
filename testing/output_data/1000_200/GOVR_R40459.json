    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) fuel consumption fluctuates annually based on mission changes. DOD may use up to 1% of US refined petroleum products, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) buys fuel for all DOD services and agencies, both in the US and overseas. DESC's origins trace back to World War II, evolving into the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) in 1964 under the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) was established in 1964 as part of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to manage the Department of Defense's (DOD) petroleum products and coal purchases. In 1998, it was renamed the Defense Energy Support Center with an expanded mission to manage a variety of energy products. DESC awards fuel contracts based on cost and manages bulk petroleum products, ships' bunker fuel, refueling at airports, and post-camp-and-station fuel. DOD is a major consumer of petroleum products, primarily JP-8, JP-5, and diesel fuel. The report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing spending to overall DOD spending, prices to commercial equivalents, and quantities to U.S. refined petroleum production. It discusses refining, refineries supplying jet fuel, and DESC's procurement practices. Recent legislation directs DOD to consider using alternative fuels. Recent legislation directs DOD to consider using alternative fuels to meet its needs and stimulate commercial interest in supplying them. High fuel prices have sparked interest in producing alternative fuels from coal and oil shale, but no projects have reached commercial operation yet. Legislation now prevents federal agencies from spending taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources that worsen global warming. Proposed rules on greenhouse gas emission reporting may have minimal impact on refineries. Legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions could affect refinery operations and responsiveness to DOD's fuel requirements. DOD's fuel consumption varies yearly in response to mission changes. The Department of Defense's fuel consumption varies annually in response to mission changes. The majority of DESC's bulk fuel purchases are for JP-8 jet fuel, with the Air Force and Army being the primary consumers. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked in FY2003 at 145.1 million barrels during the Iraq invasion, with JP-8 purchases peaking in FY2004 and declining since then. Overall DESC fuel expenditures increased from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008\u2014a nearly 500% increase. DESC's fuel expenditures grew from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008, a 500% increase. Actual volumes purchased only increased by 30% over the same time. DESC's purchases do not necessarily correspond with DOD's actual consumption, as DESC may draw fuel down from storage to supplement demand. Fuel costs continued to increase due to rising crude oil prices and refining margins. The cost of petroleum products purchased by DESC rose significantly from FY2000 to FY2008, with prices spiking to nearly $140 per barrel. Jet fuel prices reversed their price advantage over commercial equivalents due to events like September 11, 2001, and the Iraq invasion. Refiners' crude oil cost versus refined product prices margin also increased during this period. DOD responded by purchasing commercial jet fuel at lower prices when offered by refiners. The cost of petroleum products purchased by DESC rose significantly from FY2000 to FY2008, with prices spiking to nearly $140 per barrel. DOD responded by purchasing commercial jet fuel at lower prices when offered by refiners. DESC offset decreasing JP-8 purchases with increasing purchases of alternate jet fuels and diesel fuel. Total defense outlays increased 200% from FY2000 through FY2007. Total defense outlays increased by 200% from FY2000 through FY2007, with Operation and Maintenance spending rising by 231%. Fuel costs surged by 497% during the same period, reaching 3% of DOD's spending by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil, relying on imports from countries like Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. Refineries rely on light sweet crude oil like West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for pricing. Due to decreasing supply, they are turning to heavier sour crudes. Crude oil is separated into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel in a refinery's distillation tower. Residuum from this process is further processed into gasoline and middle distillate products using heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts. Refineries may also produce kerosene/jet fuel depending on complexity. Refineries produce petroleum products like gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel through processes involving heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts. Different grades of crude oil are used, with light sweet crude being preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier processing. Refineries can be set up as topping refineries that separate crude oil through distillation or hydroskimming refineries equipped with atmospheric processes. A topping refinery produces naphtha but no gasoline, while hydroskimming refineries run light sweet crude to produce gasoline. Cracking refineries add vacuum distillation and catalytic cracking to process light sour crude for distillates. Coking refineries use coking/resid destruction to process medium/sour crude oil. The refinery's atmospheric distillation capacity determines its crude oil processing limit, with secondary processing units increasing output volume. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the proportion of secondary processes to primary distillation capacity in refineries. Gulf Coast refineries with higher complexity may yield significant amounts of jet fuel and diesel. Upgrades in processes are driven by changes in crude oil supplies. The Nelson Complexity Index rates refinery processes, with higher complexity leading to increased jet fuel and diesel production. Upgrades are driven by changes in crude oil supplies and EPA regulations for ultra-low sulfur diesel. Refiners must produce lower sulfur diesel to meet regulations and prevent contamination during pipeline transport. The military has shifted to using JP-8 instead of diesel fuel for land-based equipment to streamline fuel supply chains and reduce sulfur content variability. This change was driven by the concept of \"single battlefield fuel\" to use the same fuel for aircraft and ground equipment within a theater of operation. The U.S. Army relies on regionally supplied diesel fuel or JP-8 with limited sulfur content for vehicles in theater of operations. EPA guidelines recognize the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 for readiness. EPA has not indicated plans to reduce jet fuel sulfur content. The Unites States Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that EPA can regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles. EPA issued a finding in 2009 that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution. Recently, EPA proposed a rule for petroleum refineries to report emissions, which account for 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal. The proposed rule for petroleum refineries aims to reduce 3% of U.S. GHG emissions, with compliance costs potentially minimal. Future legislation like H.R. 2454 could establish a cap-and-trade system to further reduce emissions from refineries and other industrial sources. Between FY2003 and FY2008, DESC reported its top domestic suppliers as Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation, operating a total of 31 refineries in the United States with nearly 6 million barrels per day of crude capacity. These refineries have an average Nelson Complexity Index rating of 10 and two-thirds have coking capacity. Between 2000 and 2009, the number of refineries in the United States decreased from 155 to 141, but the crude oil distillation capacity increased to 18.6 million barrels per day. The median capacity of operating refineries is around 80,000 barrels per day, with the majority of refining capacity held by 70 larger refineries. Gulf Coast refineries may yield jet and diesel fuel depending on the type of crude oil processed. Gulf Coast refineries make up 85% of U.S. refining capacity and yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel fuel. U.S. refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel. Military jet fuel production ranges from 9% to 11% of U.S. net production of jet fuel but makes up less than 1% of all U.S. refined petroleum products. DESC's worldwide jet fuel purchases have exceeded U.S. refining industry's jet fuel output in recent years. U.S. refineries have not met all of DOD's demand for military specification jet fuel. In recent years, U.S. refineries have not met all of DOD's demand for military specification jet fuel. To compensate, DESC has increased purchases of commercial jet fuels, which are then upgraded to military specification. This strategy has reduced DESC's fuel spending as commercial jet fuel prices are lower. DESC also relies on contracts with foreign refineries to support U.S. forces and installations outside the continental United States. DESC purchases fuel through contracts with foreign refineries to support U.S. forces outside the continental United States. Originally authorized by the Navy, DESC now relies on general procurement authority to buy various supplies and services. DESC now relies on general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304 to purchase fuel through contracts and awards, transferring it to DOD customers. This allows for price breaks on large quantity purchases and provides stabilized prices for all products during the fiscal year. Acquisition, as defined by Title 41 U.S.C. Section 403, involves acquiring property or services with appropriated funds to support executive agency missions and goals. The procurement process for acquiring property or services is governed by Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 \u2013 Procurement and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Title 48 CFR. The Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) is used by DOD for acquisition regulations. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustments. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustments. They use economic price adjustment provisions in contracts when general economic factors make future cost estimation unpredictable, especially for refined petroleum products. Supplies and related services are eligible for multi-year contracting provisions under FAR17.105-1(b) and DFARS 217.170(a) and 217.172(b). DESC adopted contracting instructions for entering into multiyear contracts for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, into-plane, and post-camp-and-station for the period of October 1, 2008, through September 30. The Department of Defense (DOD) and military departments can enter into multiyear contracts for liquid fuels or natural gas storage, handling, or distribution. These contracts can last up to five program years with options for renewals, not exceeding a total of twenty years. Performance in subsequent years is contingent on fund appropriation, with a cancellation payment clause if funds are not allocated by Congress. Multiyear contracts for supplies under DOD authority can result in substantial savings and promote national security. Multiyear contracts buy multiple years' requirements without needing to exercise options each year, while multiple year contracts last more than one year regardless of fiscal year funding. The DOD can enter into multiyear contracts for supplies to save costs and enhance national security. Contracts must be canceled if Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years. Multiyear contracting is encouraged for lower costs and other objectives. The contract cannot exceed $500 million without the Secretary of Defense's approval. The DOD is authorized to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922d, including multi-year contracts. The Secretary of Defense has waiver authority over acquisition of alternative fuels based on market conditions for defined fuel sources like petroleum. The DOD is authorized to procure fuel from various sources under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922d, including multi-year contracts. The term \"defined fuel source\" includes petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke. The five-year limit on multi-year contracts can be waived by the Secretary. DESC has not decided whether to waive this limit to avoid jeopardizing sales authority granted under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922e. Delivery prices are based on the \"lowest laid down cost.\" The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) bases contract delivery prices on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, which includes a surcharge for operating costs. Additional costs may be incurred by operational commands for fuel delivery forward. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 now requires analyses to consider fuel logistics requirements and vulnerabilities. The Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 (P.L. 110-417) mandates that fuel logistics be considered in force planning processes and acquisition, with a focus on life-cycle cost analysis including the fully burdened cost of fuel. A director is appointed to oversee energy needs for military operations. The Department of Defense faced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade due to rising crude oil prices and military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fuel costs have been a significant challenge for the Department of Defense, representing up to 3% of DOD's spending and over 7% of the Operation and Maintenance budget in the past decade. Unlike the airline industry, DOD has limited options to address high fuel costs, relying on supplemental appropriations to cover the increased expenses. For example, in FY2007, DOD requested $0.5 billion in emergency funding to cover higher fuel costs. The Department of Defense has faced challenges with high fuel costs, representing a significant portion of its budget. In FY2007, DOD requested $0.5 billion in emergency funding to cover increased expenses due to rising fuel costs. To address this issue, DOD has explored options such as fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and using alternate fuels like commercial Jet A fuel to reduce costs and expand supply options. DESC's business model includes fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to manage fuel price fluctuations based on crude oil prices. DESC has a contract provision that adjusts fuel prices based on crude oil price fluctuations, reducing costs if prices decline and adjusting to market rates if prices rise. This limits risk but doesn't control costs during rapid price increases. Airlines use hedging strategies like buying futures contracts to minimize fuel price risks. Southwest Airlines hedged fuel at $51/barrel when oil prices peaked at $147/barrel in 2008. The Defense Business Board convened a Fuel Hedging Task Group in 2004 to reduce DOD's exposure to fuel price volatility. They suggested engaging in \"no-market\" hedging through the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service to offset increasing DOD fuel costs during crude oil price spikes. DOD could request legislative authority to transfer funds between Interior and Defense depending on price changes. Interior's revenues come from Outer Continental Shelf leases, which are already allocated by Congress. Interior derives most of its revenues from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases, which are already allocated by Congress. OCS lessees pay royalties-in-kind by delivering oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), created in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo. The SPR, when filled to capacity, represents about 70 days of imported supply. A drawdown of the SPR under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act can involve a sale to the highest bidder or an exchange. President George H.W. Bush's drawdown authorization during the 1991 Persian Gulf War led to a rapid crude oil response. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the SPR. Refineries processing heavy oil cannot operate at normal capacity with lighter oils. GAO cited a DOE estimate that U.S. refining throughput would decrease by 735,000 barrels per day if 36 vulnerable refineries had to use SPR oil, reducing the SPR's effectiveness during an oil disruption, especially with heavy oil involved. The SPR does not have a defined role in mitigating a DOD fuel supply disruption. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve's effectiveness is limited during an oil disruption, especially with heavy oil involved. Refineries under contract to supply DOD may bid on a drawdown sale, but their operational limitations in producing jet fuel restrict the SPR's role in supporting DOD's requirements. As a last resort, DOD may seek alternative fuels, but federal agencies are restricted from procuring alternative or synthetic fuels without meeting specific criteria. The Energy Policy Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from purchasing alternative fuels unless they meet specific greenhouse gas emission criteria. This provision aims to prevent taxpayer money from being spent on fuel sources that worsen global warming. The Air Force abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant in Montana but is interested in a pilot program for synthetic fuels in Alaska to support DOD fuel requirements. Despite recent declines in crude oil prices, the possibility of supply shortages and price spikes remains, keeping fossil-based alternatives economically out of reach. The DOD is shifting towards efficiency due to declining crude oil supply and potential price spikes. Congress may be concerned about the lack of responsiveness from the refining sector to DOD's procurement announcements during high petroleum prices. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits versus operating marginally profitable refineries. Congress may also worry about operators shutting down refineries, potentially reducing the number available. In the long term, Congress may be concerned about operators shutting down refineries, potentially reducing the number of defense fuel suppliers. Background information on alternative fuel sources and greenhouse gas legislation is available in CRS reports. Avgas is high octane fuel for light aircraft, while DFM and DF2 are used in shipboard propulsion plants. Since 1975, diesel fuel marine (F-76) has been used in shipboard propulsion plants. DF2 is the primary fuel for ground mobility vehicles. FSII prevents fuel systems from icing. FOB is a trade term for delivery on board a vessel.
