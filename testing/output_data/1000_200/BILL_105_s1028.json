    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal defines an agreement by a coalition in northern California to manage Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area for ecological and economic health. It includes a map dated June 1993. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to implement a pilot project for the forests mentioned in the Act. The Forest Service will conduct a pilot project on Federal lands in California to demonstrate resource management activities as recommended in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The project will take place in specific areas within Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of Tahoe National Forest. The pilot project area, designated in the Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal map, will exclude spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers from resource management activities and timber harvesting. The Regional Forester for region 5 will oversee resource management activities during the project term. During the pilot project, all road building and timber harvesting activities are prohibited on designated Federal lands in California. Riparian protection guidelines apply to resource management and timber harvesting activities in the project area. During the pilot project, timber harvesting activities in the project area must comply with guidelines from a Forest Service research document co-authored by Dr. Jack Ward Thomas. Resource management activities must adhere to applicable Federal law and conservation standards for the California spotted owl. During the pilot project, resource management activities on Federal lands must adhere to guidelines for the conservation of the California spotted owl and include fuelbreak construction using various vegetation management methods. The pilot project involves vegetation management methods like group selection and individual tree selection on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year, aiming for all-age, multistory, fire resilient forests. Group selection covers .57 percent of the area annually, with the option of individual tree selection within the project area. Individual tree selection may be used within the pilot project area, with a total acreage limit of 70,000 acres per year. Riparian management, including wide protection zones and restoration projects, must adhere to guidelines. The Secretary must prioritize cost-effective methods for resource management activities. Funding for the pilot project will come from relevant reprogramming sources. The Secretary will use specific funds for the pilot project, including those allocated for resource management activities and excess funds for forest administration. Funds from other National Forest units are prohibited for use in the project. The Secretary may not use funds from other National Forest units for the pilot project. Forest supervisors can allocate excess funds for resource management activities in specific forests. The Secretary and forest supervisors are restricted from using funds outside of designated accounts. The Secretary and forest supervisors are restricted from using funds outside of designated accounts for the pilot project. Not more than 12 percent of available funds can be used for general administration, with at least 88 percent allocated for project activities. Authorized supplemental funds are available as necessary. The pilot project will be funded with necessary sums and baseline funds must include existing funding levels. The project will run until the completion of land and resource management plan revisions for specific forests or up to five years. Consultation with the Quincy Library Group is required for project statements. The pilot project, funded with necessary sums, will run until land and resource management plan revisions are completed for specific forests or up to five years. Consultation with the Quincy Library Group is required for project statements. The Forest Service may use private contracts to fulfill requirements, and forest plan amendments must be initiated within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The pilot project, funded until land and resource management plan revisions are completed for specific forests or up to five years, includes resource management activities and changes based on analyses conducted in compliance with environmental laws. Reporting requirements mandate the Secretary to submit an annual report on the project's status to Congress, including a complete accounting of fund usage. The Congress requires a report on the pilot project's status, including a complete account of fund usage and descriptions of resource management activities such as forest health improvements and fire risk reductions. The report on the pilot project's status must include details on forest health improvements, fire risk reductions, water yield increases, and other natural resources-related benefits. It should also describe the economic benefits to local communities and compare revenues and costs before and after the implementation of resource management activities on Federal lands. The final report for the pilot project will assess its effectiveness in meeting stated goals through a science-based evaluation. The report will analyze forest health improvements, fire risk reductions, water yield increases, economic benefits to local communities, and compare revenues and costs before and after resource management activities on Federal lands. The Federal funds expended on each annual report under this subsection shall not exceed $50,000. The assessment and report on the pilot project's effectiveness must include watershed monitoring, analysis of environmental impacts, consultation with the Quincy Library Group, and submission to Congress by July 1, 2002. The assessment and report on the pilot project's effectiveness, including watershed monitoring and analysis of environmental impacts, must be submitted to Congress by July 1, 2002. Federal funds for the assessment and report should not exceed $150,000, with an additional $75,000 allocated for watershed monitoring in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. The pilot project is not exempt from any Federal environmental laws."
