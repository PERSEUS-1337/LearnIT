This paper discusses novel observations about dropout in DNNs with ReLU activations, leading to the proposed method \"Jumpout\" which samples the dropout rate using a monotone decreasing distribution. Jumpout is a new method that improves dropout by sampling the dropout rate using a decreasing distribution, normalizing the rate at each layer and training sample, and rescaling outputs for better consistency between training and test phases. It shows significantly enhanced performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Fashion datasets compared to traditional dropout. Jumpout is a new method that improves dropout by sampling the dropout rate using a decreasing distribution, normalizing the rate at each layer and training sample, and rescaling outputs for better consistency between training and test phases. Compared to the original dropout, jumpout shows significantly improved performance on various datasets, while introducing negligible additional memory and computation costs. Dropout in DNNs requires tuning dropout rates for optimal performance, which can slow convergence if too high or yield no improvements if too low. Ideally, rates should be tuned separately for each layer and training stage, but in practice, a single rate is often used for all layers. Dropout acts as perturbation on training samples to generalize the DNN to noisy data. The fixed dropout rate in DNNs perturbs samples with a specific expected amount of noise, affecting generalization. However, this fixed rate may cause too much or too little perturbation for different layers and samples. Dropout is also incompatible with batch normalization, requiring rescaling of undropped neurons. The drawbacks of dropout in DNNs, such as inconsistency with batch normalization, have led to its decreased popularity. To address this, three modifications have been proposed to create an improved version called \"jumpout,\" aiming to enhance generalization performance. The improved version of dropout, called \"jumpout,\" is motivated by observations on how dropout enhances generalization performance for DNNs with ReLU activations. Dropout randomly changes ReLU activation patterns during training, leading to improved performance by training linear models to work for data points in nearby polyhedra. Jumpout, a variation of dropout, addresses the limitation of fixed dropout rates by sampling p from a decreasing distribution, ensuring local smoothness for DNNs with ReLU activations. The effective dropout rate in jumpout varies for different layers and training samples, adapting to normalize the neural deactivation rate. In jumpout, the dropout rate is adaptively normalized for each layer and training sample, ensuring consistent neural deactivation rates. The outputs are rescaled to address incompatibility with BN, allowing for direct application of BN layers in the test phase. Jumpout randomly generates a mask over hidden neurons, similar to dropout, without requiring extra training. Jumpout is a method that adaptively normalizes the dropout rate for each layer and training sample, ensuring consistent neural deactivation rates. It can be easily implemented into existing architectures with only a minor modification to dropout code. Jumpout outperforms dropout on various tasks and shows almost the same memory and computation costs. Other approaches like \"standout\" and BID24 have also been proposed to address the fixed dropout rate problem. BID23 introduced adaptive dropout rates based on Rademacher complexity, while BID19 proposed Gaussian dropout optimization for faster convergence. In contrast, jumpout adjusts dropout rates solely based on ReLU activation patterns, with minimal computational overhead. In contrast to previous methods like adaptive dropout rates based on Rademacher complexity and Gaussian dropout optimization for faster convergence, recent variants of dropout include Gaussian dropout optimization for faster convergence, variational dropout for adaptive dropout rates, Swapout combining dropout with random skipping connections, and Fraternal Dropout training two identical DNNs using different dropout masks. Jumpout is a modification of the original dropout method that aims to reduce the gap between training and test phases without additional training costs or parameters. It can be used in conjunction with other dropout variants and is applied in feed-forward deep neural networks. The DNN formalization discussed in the curr_chunk can represent various DNN architectures, including fully-connected networks and convolutional networks. The convolution operator is essentially a sparse matrix multiplication, and average-pooling is a linear operator. The resulting weight matrix is sparse with tied parameters and a large number of rows compared to the input size. Average-pooling is a linear operator represented as matrix multiplication, and max-pooling is treated as an activation function. The residual network block can be represented by appending an identity matrix to retain input values. DNN with short-cut connections can be written as a piecewise linear function for ReLU activation functions. The linear model x is formed by combining activation patterns with weight matrices. ReLU activation sets units to 0 or preserves values. By eliminating ReLU functions, a linear model can be produced. The gradient \u2202x is the weight vector of the linear model associated with activation patterns on all layers for a data input x. The linear model in Eqn. 2 is associated with activation patterns on all layers for a data input x, defining a convex polyhedron. We focus on DNNs with ReLU activations for simplicity and efficiency. Dropout improves generalization by considering local linear models and nearby convex polyhedra. This analysis inspires modifications to the original dropout technique. The analysis of dropout in DNNs focuses on local linear models and nearby convex polyhedra, leading to modifications to the original technique. Dropout improves generalization by promoting neuron independence and training ensemble-like networks. Dropout in DNNs improves generalization by smoothing local linear models within convex polyhedra, promoting neuron independence and ensemble-like behavior. Large DNNs with ReLUs divide the input space into polyhedra, leading to distinct linear models for each training data point. This dispersion among polyhedra enhances variance reduction and generalization performance. The text discusses how different linear models within polyhedra in DNNs can lead to instability and lack of smoothness, affecting generalization ability. The proposal is to address these issues by sampling a. The proposal suggests sampling a dropout rate from a truncated half-normal distribution to address the instability and lack of smoothness in DNNs, ensuring a monotone decreasing probability of dropout rate. The proposal suggests using a Gaussian-based dropout rate distribution to encourage smoothness in generalization performance of local linear models in DNNs. The standard deviation \u03c3 is used as a hyper-parameter to control generalization enforcement, with smaller dropout rates sampled more frequently. This approach aims to improve performance on points in closer polyhedra while diminishing effectiveness on points farther away. The dropout rate for each layer is a hyper-parameter that promotes smoothness among nearby local linear models. The dropout rates of different layers should ideally be tuned separately to improve network performance, but it is often computationally expensive to do so. One common approach is to set the same dropout rate for all layers and tune one global dropout rate. However, using a single global dropout rate can be suboptimal as the proportion of active neurons in each layer can vary significantly. To better control dropout behavior across different layers and training stages, the dropout rate is normalized by the fraction of active neurons in each layer. This allows for more consistent activation patterns and precise tuning of the dropout rate as a single hyper-parameter. In standard dropout, neurons are scaled by 1/p during training, but with this approach, the dropout rate is adjusted to achieve a desirable level of smoothing encouragement. In standard dropout, the dropout rate is adjusted to achieve consistent activation patterns by normalizing it with the fraction of active neurons in each layer. This allows for precise tuning of the dropout rate as a single hyper-parameter, addressing the incompatibility between dropout and batch normalization.

This allows for precise tuning of the dropout rate as a single hyper-parameter, addressing the incompatibility between dropout and batch normalization. A layer is followed by a BN layer, ReLU activation layer, and dropout layer, affecting the mean and variance of neurons during training. During training, dropout changes the scales of mean and variance of neurons. This inconsistency with batch normalization during testing can be fixed by rescaling the output to counteract dropout's effects. Rescaling dropped neurons by (1 - p)^-1 recovers the mean scale, while rescaling by (1 - p)^-0.5 recovers the variance scale. Taking into account the value of E[w], undropped neurons can be scaled accordingly. During training, dropout affects the mean and variance scales of neurons. Rescaling dropped neurons by (1 - p)^-1 recovers the mean scale, while rescaling by (1 - p)^-0.5 recovers the variance scale. Taking into account the value of E[w], undropped neurons can be scaled accordingly. The variance of y j can be corrected by using (1 - p j )^-1 as the dropout rescaling factor. The network is \"CIFAR10(s)\" and empirical mean and variance ratios with dropout are shown in plots. During training, dropout affects the mean and variance scales of neurons. Rescaling dropped neurons by (1 - p)^-1 recovers the mean scale, while rescaling by (1 - p)^-0.5 recovers the variance scale. The rescaling factor (1 - p)^-0.75 provides a trade-off between mean and variance rescaling, ensuring efficient training without the need to compute E(y j) during training. During training, a trade-off point of (1 - p)^-0.75 is proposed for efficient computation of E(y j). This rescaling factor balances mean and variance consistency when using dropout in convolutional networks with or without BN. The study compares the performance of dropout with and without batch normalization in convolutional networks. It is found that using dropout with batch normalization can improve performance, with larger dropout rates leading to more improvement. However, using original dropout with batch normalization results in decreased accuracy when dropout rate exceeds 0.15. In contrast, a new method called \"Jumpout\" is proposed, which shows improved performance with increasing dropout rate until 0.25. Jumpout generates a 0/1 mask for input neurons and randomly drops a portion of neurons based on the mask, overcoming drawbacks of original dropout. Jumpout introduces a novel approach to dropout by sampling from a decreasing distribution for random dropout rates. It adapts the dropout rate based on active neurons for consistent regularization effects. Additionally, it scales outputs differently during training to balance mean and variance shifts. Jumpout requires a main hyper-parameter \u03c3 and auxiliary truncation hyperparameters (p min , p max) for control.

It adapts the dropout rate based on active neurons for consistent regularization effects and requires a main hyper-parameter \u03c3 to control the standard deviation. Additionally, it uses two auxiliary truncation hyperparameters (p min, p max) to bound the samples from the distribution. The input h j is considered as the features of layer j for one data point, and for a mini-batch, the average q + j is used as the estimate. Jumpout has almost the same memory cost as the original dropout. Jumpout introduces a novel dropout approach by sampling from a decreasing distribution for random dropout rates.

The study applied different versions of ResNet to various datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, STL10, and ImageNet. Standard settings, data preprocessing, and hyperparameters were followed for CIFAR and Fashion-MNIST experiments. For ImageNet, pre-trained ResNet18 models were used with dropout and jumpout techniques to address overfitting. Training DNNs on ImageNet typically does not face overfitting issues with standard data augmentation methods, but dropout and jumpout are effective in such cases.

Pre-trained ResNet18 models were used with dropout and jumpout techniques to address overfitting. Jumpout consistently outperformed dropout on all datasets and DNNs tested, showing significant improvements even on datasets with high test accuracy. Jumpout also achieved improvements on CIFAR100 and ImageNet, surpassing the need for increasing model size. These results validate the effectiveness of jumpout over dropout. The effectiveness of jumpout over dropout was verified by significantly increasing model size in the past. A thorough ablation study of proposed modifications showed that each modification improved vanilla dropout, with applying all three modifications together achieving the best performance. Jumpout exhibited substantial advantages over dropout in early learning stages and reached good accuracy faster.
