Offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct audits, investigations, and in some cases, have law enforcement authority. This authority includes carrying a firearm, making arrests without a warrant, and executing warrants for arrest, search, or seizure of evidence. Some OIGs view these authorities as essential for certain missions, especially when investigations pose safety risks. The report provides a list of statutes and regulations that vest OIGs with law enforcement authority, along with resources supporting the need for this authority. Federal agencies, including OIGs, have unique missions that justify their law enforcement powers. Public concern over agencies' weapons procurement may lead to public statements explaining the need for law enforcement authority, as seen in the Social Security Administration's OIG blog post about an ammunition purchase in August 2012. In August 2012, the Social Security Administration's OIG explained an ammunition purchase that raised public concerns. The ammunition is standard issue for law enforcement agencies and used for agent safety during training. The USDA's OIG also received inquiries about replacing automatic firearms with semi-automatic ones. The USDA's OIG is authorized to pursue criminal activity, fraud, and abuses impairing USDA's program and operations. OIG investigations have resulted in over 2,000 indictments, 1,350 convictions, and over $460 million in monetary results. OIG Special Agents can make arrests, execute warrants, and carry firearms for their investigations. The Investigations division conducts hundreds of criminal investigations each year involving OIG agents, USDA employees, and the public. The USDA OIG's Investigations division conducts criminal investigations involving OIG agents, USDA employees, and the public, including undercover operations and surveillance. Investigations cover fraud, theft, bribery, smuggling, assaults, and threats against USDA employees. OIG can be vested with law enforcement authority through the IG Act. The IG Act of 1978 allows for OIGs to be vested with law enforcement authority by the Attorney General or through statute. The Act provides direct law enforcement authority to 25 federal entities, and the Attorney General can delegate such authority when necessary. The Attorney General has vested OIGs in 10 agencies with law enforcement authority, as authorized by the IG Act of 1978. The Act allows for the delegation of law enforcement powers to federal entities when needed. The Attorney General has authorized OIGs in 10 agencies with law enforcement powers under the IG Act of 1978. Guidelines issued by then-Attorney General John Ashcroft in 2003 detail the training requirements for OIG employees with law enforcement authority, including completion of specific programs and adherence to DOJ's deadly force policy. Periodic refresher training in various legal and investigative areas is also mandated for OIGs. The OIGs with law enforcement authority must undergo periodic refresher training in trial processes, legal updates, interviewing techniques, and physical conditioning. They are also required to follow DOJ policies, consult before using electronic surveillance, and obtain approval for undercover investigations. Additionally, 33 OIGs had a total of 3,501 agents authorized to carry firearms in September 2008. In September 2008, 33 OIGs had 3,501 agents authorized to carry firearms, with no reported assaults or injuries to law enforcement officers within an OIG that year."
