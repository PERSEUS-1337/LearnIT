    "title": "SB 1179",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to include definitions for terms such as \"active militia,\" \"armed services,\" \"board of trustees,\" \"district,\" and \"domestic partner.\" These definitions are in accordance with specific sections of the Military and Veterans Code, Government Code, and Family Code. In Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code, definitions are provided for terms like \"family member,\" \"firefighter,\" and \"interment right.\" These definitions clarify relationships and rights related to cemetery plots and memorial markers. Chapter 5.5 (commencing with Section 9069.10) of the Health and Safety Code governs interment rights, defining terms like \"nonresident,\" \"peace officer,\" \"principal county,\" and \"voter.\" Interment rights are transferable property interests controlled by cemetery districts. Chapter 5.5 of the Health and Safety Code addresses interment rights, specifying that disinterment of human remains requires consent from the cemetery district and specific family members. The chapter also allows for the removal of remains within the same cemetery under certain circumstances, with proper documentation required by the cemetery district. The cemetery district must maintain a duplicate copy of an order for the removal of remains, along with detailed records including the date of removal, the name and age of the deceased, the original cemetery and plot, and information on reinterment or alternate disposition. An interment right grants a transferable property interest to the listed owner in the cemetery district records, with the option for a written designation or transfer to a successor. It does not confer title to the property. The owner of an interment right can designate others for interment in the plot and must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase. The transfer of an interment right must comply with state and local laws and district policies. If the owner of an interment right dies without a valid disposition, the right passes according to intestate succession laws. A surviving spouse, registered domestic partner, child, parent, or heir can waive their interment right for another relative. When a public cemetery district transfers ownership rights or makes an interment based on a sworn affidavit, they are not liable for any claims unless they knew the information was false. The person claiming to be the successor owner must sign an affidavit declaring their entitlement, efforts to find other claimants, and lack of opposition. Upon the sale of a cemetery plot, the district must inform the buyer about interment rights, succession of ownership, and district policies. The successor owner must sign an affidavit declaring their entitlement and lack of opposition. This act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement may be made for other mandated costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
