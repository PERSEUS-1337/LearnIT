The Congress acknowledges the rapid increase in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in the U.S., with rates rising from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 150. The epidemic of autism continues to grow, with a new case diagnosed every 20 minutes. The financial burden of autism on the nation exceeds $35 billion annually. More children will be diagnosed with autism this year than with AIDS, diabetes, and cancer combined. Autism costs the Nation over $35 billion per year, a figure expected to significantly increase in the next decade. Autism is a life-changing condition that our Nation's communities are ill-equipped to handle. The long-term impact of this autism epidemic could potentially deprive our Nation of future talent. Autism spectrum disorders are an urgent societal concern, yet receive less than 5 percent of Federal funding for research. The Combating Autism Act of 2006 allocated nearly $1 billion for autism research, focusing on environmental factors, treatments, and early identification. A White House Conference on Autism aims to advance scientific study and analysis of cutting-edge treatments and services for autism.
