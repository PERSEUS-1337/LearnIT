    "content": "The child nutrition programs, overseen by the USDA-FNS, include the NSLP, SBP, Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, Special Milk Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, and Summer Food Service Program. These programs provide meals and snacks to children in schools, child care, and after-school settings. The programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The child nutrition programs, including NSLP, SBP, and Summer Food Service Program, were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Some authorities expired in 2015 but had minimal impact as funding continued. In the 114th Congress, reauthorization legislation was started but not completed by the Senate and House committees. In the 114th Congress, reauthorization legislation for child nutrition programs was started but not completed by the Senate and House committees. Legislation died at the end of the 114th Congress, with no significant efforts in the 115th Congress. However, 2018 farm bill proposals included provisions related to child nutrition programs. Issues raised during these efforts may be relevant for future reauthorization or policymaking opportunities, particularly regarding the content and type of foods served in schools. Issues related to child nutrition programs are important for Congress in future reauthorization efforts or policymaking opportunities. These issues include the nutritional quality and sourcing of foods served in schools, access to meals during summer, and the implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision. Stakeholders involved in these issues include school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry groups. This report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, highlighting recent concerns raised by Congress and program stakeholders. The current issues in child nutrition programs are highlighted, drawing examples from legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses. References to CRS reports for more detailed information are provided. School meals must meet specific requirements for federal reimbursement, including nutritional standards. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) updated nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, providing increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the new requirements. The HHFKA updated nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, with increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the requirements. The regulations were largely written in subsequent rules by USDA-FNS, based on Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine recommendations. The updated standards increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting calories, sodium, and whole. The updated standards for school meals increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting calories, sodium, and fat. They also included restrictions on milk varieties and required senior high school students to choose a half-serving of fruits or vegetables with their meal. The nutrition standards for competitive foods set limits on calories, sodium, and fat for foods sold outside of meals during the school day. These standards began phasing in during school year 2012-2013 for meals and 2014-2015 for competitive foods. The meal standards and competitive foods standards were implemented in school years 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 respectively. Schools faced challenges with whole grain and low-sodium product availability, student acceptance, participation, costs, and food waste. The School Nutrition Association and studies by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and USDA confirmed these issues. SNA advocated for changes to the standards while others argued for maintaining them. In SY2012-2013 and SY2013-2014, the first two years of implementation, there were calls for changes to school meal standards. USDA made adjustments to weekly limits on grains and protein in January 2014. Congress enacted provisions loosening milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements from SY2015-2016 through SY2017-2018. In December 2018, USDA published a final rule allowing flavored, low-fat milk in school meals starting in SY2019-2020. The 2018 final rule requires all SFAs to offer flavored, low-fat (1%) milk in school meals and beverages sold in schools, along with unflavored milk. SFAs must adhere to a 50% whole grain-rich requirement and maintain Target 1 sodium limits until SY2023-2024, with Target 2 limits starting in SY2024-2025. The nutrition standards for school meals remain largely unchanged, with modifications to milk requirements also impacting other beverages sold in schools. The nutrition standards for school meals remain largely intact, with changes to milk requirements also affecting other beverages sold in schools. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aimed to revise these standards but were not included in the enacted bill. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to alter school meal standards, with the House proposing USDA reviews every three years and allowing fundraisers to bypass competitive food standards. The Senate proposed revising whole grain and sodium requirements within 90 days of enactment. The Senate proposed revising whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals, reducing the whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delaying the Target 2 sodium requirement for two years. Stakeholders have debated including frozen, dried, and canned fruits and vegetables in the FFVP program, funded by the 2014 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill funded a pilot project that included canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the FFVP program. Schools in four states faced challenges with fresh produce and opted for CDF options. The final evaluation showed that 56% of pilot schools incorporated CDF items, leading to decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings. However, there was no significant impact on vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption declined on snack days. During the pilot project, fruit consumption declined on FFVP snack days, possibly due to students consuming less fruit when it was dried or canned. Student satisfaction with FFVP slightly decreased, while parents' responses were mixed. School administrators who participated in the pilot generally favored the changes. Legislative proposals have been considered to allow CDF and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables in FFVP, removing \"fresh\" from the program name. The House (H.R. 5003) and Senate committee's proposal (S. 3136) aimed to allow schools to serve various forms of fruits and vegetables, including tree nuts. Schools in the National School Lunch Program must comply with federal requirements to source foods domestically. Buy American requirements mandate schools to purchase domestic products whenever possible. To comply with Buy American requirements, schools in the NSLP and/or SBP must purchase domestic commodities or products to the maximum extent practicable. This means products must be produced and processed substantially in the United States, with over 51% domestically grown ingredients. USDA has issued guidance on implementing these requirements, with the most recent guidance from June 2017. The USDA guidance from June 2017 emphasizes the Buy American requirements for foods purchased with funds from the nonprofit school food service account. Schools are encouraged to integrate Buy American into their procurement processes and can make exceptions when U.S. products are not available or significantly more expensive. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce Buy American requirements for school food purchases, ensuring full compliance and understanding of responsibilities by SFAs and states. USDA must report to Congress on actions taken within 180 days of enactment. The 2018 farm bill mandates USDA to enforce Buy American rules for school food purchases, defining domestic products as those processed in the U.S. and containing American meats, vegetables, fruits, and agricultural commodities. A report to Congress is required within 180 days on compliance actions. Proponents argue for stricter requirements due to economic and food safety concerns, particularly regarding sourcing from China. Some argue for domestic sourcing for safety reasons, especially concerning China. Others advocate for school discretion in food procurement. Summer meals are typically provided in group settings through programs like SFSP and SSO. Policymakers are exploring alternatives to congregate meals, particularly in rural areas where access is challenging. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act provided $85 million for demonstration projects to improve access to food for children in urban and rural areas during the summer. One project, SEBTC, gives electronic food benefits to households with eligible children. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act allocated $85 million for projects like SEBTC, which provides electronic food benefits to households with eligible children. Participants receive $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for WIC or SNAP. A study from FY2011 to FY2013 found that Summer EBT led to a decrease in very low food security and improved children's consumption of healthy foods. The Summer EBT program has shown improvements in children's consumption of healthy foods, with greater increases seen at sites operating the WIC model. Congress has provided funding for Summer EBT projects, with recent funding of $28 million in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Awardees for the program include various states and tribal nations, with USDA prioritizing new states for grants in FY2019. In October 2018, USDA-FNS announced a new strategy for determining grant recipients in FY2019, prioritizing new states, statewide projects, and projects operating in summers 2019-2021. There were proposals in Congress to expand Summer EBT, including funding recommendations from the Obama Administration and freestanding bills in the 114th and 115th Congresses. Funding from the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act was also used for demonstration projects. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act funded demonstration projects, including the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) in eight states from 2010 to 2012. eSFSP initiatives included incentives for longer operations, recreational/educational activities, meal delivery in rural areas, and food backpacks for children. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity levels for children in meal delivery and backpack programs. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act funded demonstration projects, including the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) in eight states from 2010 to 2012. eSFSP initiatives included incentives for longer operations, recreational/educational activities, meal delivery in rural areas, and food backpacks for children. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity levels for children in meal delivery and backpack programs. Another demonstration project provided exemptions from the congregate feeding requirement to SFSP and SSO outdoor meal sites experiencing excessive heat each summer since 2015. Exempted sites must continue to serve children in congregate settings on days when heat is not excessive, and provide meals in another form on days of excessive heat. USDA also offers exemptions on a case-by-case basis for other extreme weather conditions. In the 114th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the Senate and the House would have allowed rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for offsite consumption in certain conditions like extreme weather or public safety concerns. The bills also permitted congregate feeding sites to provide meals to be consumed offsite episodically. The HHFKA created the Community Eligibility Provision. The HHFKA established the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to offer free meals to students in schools with high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased since its introduction in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools involved as of SY2016-2017. Supporters believe CEP enhances meal access, reduces stigma, and lowers administrative costs, while some seek modifications to the program. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) offers free meals to students in schools with high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased since its introduction in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools involved as of SY2016-2017. One secondary effect of CEP is data issues for other non-nutrition federal and state programs, such as the federal Title I-A program. The free and reduced-price lunch data is used to determine eligibility and funding allocations, collected through school meal applications. Students may qualify for free, reduced-price, or full-price meals. Schools may charge unpaid meal costs, leading to student debts or implement \"lunch shaming\" practices. Some schools practice \"lunch shaming\" by taking away hot meals from students with unpaid debts, leading to financial burdens on meal programs. Limited national data is available on the prevalence of these practices, with many districts struggling to collect unpaid meal costs. Federal funds and student payments are crucial for school food programs' revenue. Schools rely on revenue from federal funds and student payments for meal programs. Unpaid meal costs can result in \"bad debt\" for schools, requiring them to use nonfederal funding sources. Congress and USDA have taken steps since 2010 to address unpaid meal charges, including examining state and school district policies. USDA's 2016 report to Congress focused on establishing national standards for meal charges and alternate meals. The USDA's 2016 Report to Congress did not recommend national standards for meal charges but suggested updating policy guidance and distributing best practices to support decision-making by states and localities. SFAs were required to implement a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, with instructions on handling situations where a child does not pay for a meal. USDA-FNS provided clarification through webinars, memoranda, and a best practice guide based on findings from a study published in March 2014. The USDA's 2016 Report to Congress recommended updating policy guidance and distributing best practices for meal charges. Findings from a study and a Request for Information showed that meal charge policies were mainly determined at the school and district levels. Responses indicated a preference for local control, while national advocacy groups favored national standards. Lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs were also discussed in the 115th Congress. Advocacy groups supported national standards for meal charges. The 115th Congress addressed lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs, with legislative proposals like the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017. States have also enacted laws to tackle these issues, such as Illinois in 2018. In recent years, states have enacted legislation to address meal charge issues, such as Illinois in 2018. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) implemented requirements for schools' pricing of paid lunches, aiming to ensure children receive the full value of federal benefits. SFAs were mandated to review and potentially increase lunch prices, with the option to use nonfederal funding sources to meet the requirements. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) implemented requirements for schools' pricing of paid lunches to ensure children receive the full value of federal funds. Federal reimbursements for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs. Schools must increase prices over time to match or exceed the difference between federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. The HHFKA implemented requirements for schools to adjust prices of paid lunches to match federal reimbursements. Schools must gradually increase prices if they fall below the reimbursement amount, with a maximum annual increase of 10 cents. Additionally, revenue from nonprogram foods must go to the school food authority, preventing it from being used for other purposes. The law requires revenue from nonprogram foods to equal or exceed the costs of obtaining them. USDA provided exemptions for SFAs in strong financial standing for SY2013-2014 through SY2017-2018. For SY2018-2019, SFAs with a negative balance may have to raise prices for paid meals. Other legislative proposals related to paid lunch equity requirements were considered recently. The NSFSA balance as of January 31, 2018 may lead to price increases for paid meals. Legislative proposals in Congress have considered changes to paid lunch equity requirements, such as replacing them with a \"non-federal revenue target.\" Various programs and acts related to school food service are also mentioned. The curr_chunk mentions various programs and acts related to school food service, including NSFSA, NSLP, SBP, SFA, SFSP, SMP, SSO, Summer EBT, SY, and USDA-FNS."
