    "content": "The \"After School Education and Safety Act of 1997\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students by providing productive activities during after school hours. Congress finds that today's youth face greater social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are at higher risk of violence during after school hours. The goals of the Act include increasing academic success, improving students' skills, promoting safe environments, preparing for workforce participation, and providing alternatives to negative activities. Definitions in the Act include \"school\" and \"Secretary.\" The Act authorizes a program. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to schools for carrying out activities described in section 7(a) of the program. Each school receiving a grant under this Act must conduct mentoring programs, academic assistance, recreational activities, and technology training. Additionally, schools may also choose to offer drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation activities. These activities should take place after regular school hours during the school year. Each school receiving a grant under this Act must conduct activities tailored to the specific needs of the population served. These activities should take place in designated school buildings or public facilities. Schools are encouraged to seek volunteers, donations of computer equipment, and collaborate with state and local park and recreation agencies to avoid duplication of activities. SEC. 8. APPLICATIONS. Each school seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary, detailing how they will meet the goals of the Act, show collaboration among stakeholders, describe administration of activities, avoid duplication with other programs, and outline funding sources. The application for the grant must describe funding sources, in-kind contributions, and a plan for obtaining non-Federal funding for the activities. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1998 to 2002."
