Amendments to Title 18 include Section 3144, which pertains to the release or detention of a material witness in criminal cases before a court of the United States. A judicial officer may order the arrest of a material witness if there is probable cause to believe their testimony is material and they have failed to appear after being served with a summons or subpoena. A judicial officer may waive the summons or subpoena requirement if clear and convincing evidence shows that it may result in the person fleeing or not securing their appearance. A warrant for a material witness must contain their name or a description for identification and specify that their testimony is needed in a criminal case or grand jury proceeding. A warrant for a material witness must specify the need for their testimony in a criminal case or grand jury proceeding, command their arrest, inform them of their right to counsel, and be signed by a judicial officer for execution. Upon arrest, an officer must show the warrant to the material witness. If the officer does not have the warrant, they must inform the witness of its existence and purpose, and provide it upon request. After executing a warrant, an officer must return it to the judicial officer before the material witness is brought in. An unexecuted warrant can be canceled by a judicial officer at the request of the US attorney. A material witness arrested under a warrant must be brought before a judicial officer promptly. Upon arrest under a warrant, a material witness must be promptly brought before a judicial officer for an initial appearance in the district of arrest or an adjacent district if more convenient.

The judicial officer shall order the release or detention of the witness based on conditions under section 3142(c), unless clear and convincing evidence shows that release will not assure the witness's appearance. Testimony can be secured by deposition if the witness cannot comply with release conditions. If no reasonable assurance of appearance is found after a hearing, detention may be necessary. If a judicial officer determines by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions will ensure a material witness's appearance, the witness can be detained for up to 5 days or until their testimony is secured. Extension of detention can be granted upon motion of a party.

The United States Government can detain a material witness for up to 30 days in a criminal case or 10 days in other cases, with possible extensions of up to 5 days each until their testimony is secured. A motion must demonstrate good cause for why the witness's testimony could not be obtained through deposition or appearance before the court or grand jury in the previous 5-day period. Factors such as the witness's history and characteristics are considered when determining whether they should be released or detained. The detention order for a material witness must comply with specific requirements, including considering the witness's history and characteristics. A release order must also meet certain criteria, and a material witness should be held separately from individuals charged with criminal offenses. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to Congress on the use of detaining material witnesses, including the number of warrants sought and granted, and the number of witnesses arrested. The witnesses should be held separately from individuals charged with criminal offenses under the least restrictive conditions possible. The Attorney General must report annually to Congress on detaining material witnesses, including warrants sought and granted, witnesses arrested, and average detention days. Rule 46(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is amended to supervise defendants and material witnesses' detention pending trial within the district."
