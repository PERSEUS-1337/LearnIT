    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $76.2 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, proposing significant cuts in funding for various programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT, an increase over the Administration's request. The Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion for DOT in FY2019. The Senate passed H.R. 6147, providing $86.6 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) in FY2019, slightly above the FY2018 amount and significantly higher than the Administration's request. The funding for DOT is unique as most of it comes from trust funds and is allocated as grants to states and local governments. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives most of its funding from trust funds, with around two-thirds to three-fourths being mandatory budget authority. The Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund typically provide around 90% of DOT's annual funding. In FY2018, there was a significant increase in discretionary funding for DOT. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak in the form of grants. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for the air traffic control system, has a budget primarily focused on operations. Funding for DOT comes from trust funds, supported by taxes, with periodic reauthorizations necessary. The reauthorization of taxes supporting trust funds and the apportionment of budget authority to DOT programs are crucial for DOT funding. While highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020, federal aviation programs face expiration in September 2018. DOT's nonemergency annual funding has increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018 in nominal terms, but inflation-adjusted funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015 before rising again in FY2016. In FY2016 and FY2017, DOT's real funding remained similar to FY2006 levels, but from FY2012-FY2017, inflation-adjusted funding was lower than in FY2007-FY2011. Most federal highway and transit funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund, funded by the gas tax. Annual expenditures from the fund have consistently exceeded revenues, leading to a projected shortfall. Congress has transferred funds from the Treasury to cover the gap. The Highway Trust Fund faces a projected shortfall of approximately $54 billion, with Congress transferring $143 billion from the Treasury to keep it solvent. The fund's shortfall is due to the stagnant federal gas tax since 1993, which is not adjusted for inflation or increasing fuel efficiency. This has led to a decrease in purchasing power and revenue growth, as vehicles can travel farther on a gallon of fuel. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts flat gasoline consumption through 2024 due to increased fuel efficiency offsetting more miles driven. Highway Trust Fund revenues are projected at $39-41 billion annually, falling short of expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for national infrastructure grants in FY2018, with the Senate proposing $1 billion and the House recommending $750 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1 billion for the TIGER grant program, while the House suggested $750 million. The committee report prohibits the Department of Transportation (DOT) from using an applicant's willingness to create new nonfederal revenue sources as a selection criterion, directing DOT to use the criteria from the FY2016 grant process. The TIGER grant program, originally known as \"national infrastructure investment,\" was established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The TIGER grant program, originating from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding by allowing projects with national or regional impacts to receive funding. An example is the Amtrak's Gateway Program in the Northeast Corridor. The Gateway Program focuses on projects along the Northeast Corridor rail line, including the replacement of a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River. The $13 billion project benefits Amtrak passengers but is funded by New York and New Jersey. The BUILD program provides grants for projects of national significance in various modes, with recipients selected by DOT. The BUILD/TIGER program funds projects of national, regional, and metropolitan-area significance, with recipients selected by DOT. Congress has directed funds to be distributed equitably across geographic areas and transportation modes, with low minimum grant thresholds. The program is oversubscribed, receiving many more applications than available funding. Critics have argued that TIGER grants disproportionately benefit urban areas. In the past, critics argued that TIGER grants favored urban areas. Congress has directed that a portion of funding should go to rural areas, increasing from 20% to 30% in FY2018. The House Appropriations Committee recommends 33% for rural projects in FY2019, while the Senate bill sticks to 30%. Funding is also allocated for projects near major seaports and urban areas over 200,000 in population. The BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process has followed a pattern in recent years where the Obama Administration requested funding, the House proposed cuts, the Senate proposed a similar amount to previous appropriations, and Congress agreed on a final amount. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested no funding, but Congress funded the program. This pattern seems to be repeating in the FY2019 appropriations bills. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with an estimated $140 million for FY2019. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with an estimated $140 million for FY2019. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for the EAS program in FY2019, $62 million less than the program received in FY2018. The House committee bill recommended a $175 million discretionary appropriation, $20 million more than the FY2018 level. The Senate-passed bill likewise recommends a $175 million discretionary appropriation, combined with the estimated mandatory funding of $140 million. The EAS program is seeking a $175 million discretionary appropriation for FY2019, which would result in a 10% increase over the FY2018 total funding level. The program aims to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The cost of the program has doubled since FY2008 due to route reductions by airlines. Congress made changes to the program in 2012 to limit subsidies and allow smaller planes for communities with few daily passengers. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program aims to preserve airline service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. Supporters argue that it promotes economic development in rural areas, while critics point out high subsidy costs and proximity to major airports. In 2008, Congress mandated positive train control (PTC) installation on certain rail segments by 2015. In 2008, Congress mandated positive train control (PTC) installation on certain rail segments by 2015. Freight railroads have spent billions to meet this requirement, but most tracks were not compliant by the end of 2015. Congress extended the deadline to 2018, with an option for further extension to 2020 with approval. Funding has been provided by Congress to help with PTC installation costs. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not include funding for PTC implementation. The House-reported bill allocated $150 million for PTC projects, while the Senate-passed bill did not specify an amount but directed DOT to prioritize PTC projects. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 restructured Amtrak's federal grants, authorizing separate grants for the Northeast Corridor and the national network. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 restructured Amtrak's federal grants, authorizing separate grants for the Northeast Corridor and the national network. It also introduced three new grant programs for intercity passenger rail development. The Administration's FY2019 budget requested $738 million for intercity passenger rail funding, all for grants to Amtrak. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak, along with funding for two of the new grant programs and the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. The Senate bill would provide $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for three new grant programs, prioritizing PTC projects. Congress historically provided little funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for PTC implementation. In FY2009 and FY2010, $10.5 billion was allocated for high-speed and intercity passenger rail grants, but from FY2011 to FY2016, no funding was provided except for PTC implementation. In FY2011, Congress rescinded $400 million allocated in FY2010 for intercity passenger rail development. Funding for intercity passenger rail increased to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration distributes roughly $13 billion to state and local transit agencies through various programs, with the Capital Investment Grants program being the largest discretionary grant program. The Capital Investment Grants program, also known as the New Starts program, funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. It has three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million in federal funding, and Core Capacity grants for projects increasing capacity by at least 10%. There is also an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot for eligible projects with a 25% federal share and public-private partnership support. The Capital Investment Grants program funds new transit lines and extensions with three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million, and Core Capacity grants. Grant funds for large projects are disbursed over years, with a 25% federal share and public-private partnership support. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for FY2019, less than the $2.645 billion provided in FY2018. Congress has expressed concern over the Administration's stance on project funding. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for FY2019 for the Capital Investment Grants program, slightly less than the FY2018 amount. Congress has not supported the Administration's policy proposal to end federal assistance for new transit projects. The Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for FY2019 for the Capital Investment Grants program, but Congress provided more than twice the amount requested by FTA for the CIG program in both FY2018 and FY2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee report expressed concern about FTA's failure to comply with congressional directives regarding improvements to the CIG program. Transportation for America criticizes FTA for delays in transit project funding, citing concerns over the slow review process and increased costs for project sponsors. Only $533 million of the $2.3 billion allocated for new transit projects has been issued by FTA, leading to expired construction bids. The FTA is facing criticism for delays in transit project funding, leading to increased costs for project sponsors. Bids for construction have expired before FTA completed its review, forcing agencies to rebid projects. Legislation has limited the federal share for New Starts projects, with the House proposing a limit of 50% in FY2019. Critics argue that this is lower than the federal share for highway projects, typically at 80%. Critics argue that the federal share for New Starts projects should not be limited to 50% in FY2019, as it is lower than the typical 80% federal share for highway projects. Advocates believe a higher local match requirement would allow the FTA to support more projects and encourage communities to carefully assess proposed transit projects to avoid cost overruns and low ridership. The challenges of funding transportation infrastructure include cost overruns and falling ridership expectations. Most federal transportation funding is distributed by mode, making it difficult for projects involving multiple modes to amass significant federal funding. The majority of the $55 billion annual surface transportation funding is automatically divided among states, posing challenges for states to accumulate funding for major projects like Amtrak's Gateway Program. Amtrak's Gateway Program aims to improve rail service between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost of the program is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. The existing tunnel is over a century old, deteriorating, and was flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The estimated cost of the new Hudson River Tunnel is $11.1 billion. Funding for the project is available from the intercity rail program and the Capital Investment Grants program, with competition for the latter being intense. In FY2018, the largest grant awarded to a single project was $2.6 billion. The largest grant awarded to a single project in the past 10 years was $2.6 billion for the new Hudson Tunnel. The Trump Administration does not feel bound by the previous agreement to share costs. Congress would need to provide the funding, with significant funding recommended for rail and transit grant programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not mention the Gateway Program or Hudson Tunnel project in their FY2019 reports. The Senate Appropriation Committee recommended $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account than Amtrak requested for FY2019. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion over 10 years in grants to WMATA for preventive maintenance and capital grants, to be matched by funding from DC, Maryland, and Virginia. The Administration requested $120 million for this grant to WMATA for FY2019. The Administration requested $120 million for a grant to WMATA for FY2019, with the House Appropriations Committee and Senate-passed bill recommending $150 million. Both committees directed WMATA to work on extending the authorization for the grant and implementing wireless service throughout the rail system. WMATA is facing maintenance backlog and safety concerns following fatal incidents. Several fatal incidents, including one in January 2015, have raised questions about WMATA's safety culture. An investigation revealed mismanagement of federal funding, leading to restrictions on WMATA's use of federal funds. FTA assumed oversight of WMATA's safety compliance practices in October 2015, conducting inspections and directing funds to improve safety. In February 2017, FTA notified leaders of the three jurisdictions that it would withhold 5% of their FY2017 transit funds until safety requirements are met. In February 2017, FTA informed leaders of three jurisdictions that 5% of their FY2017 transit funds would be withheld until they establish a new State Safety Oversight Program. The new Metrorail Safety Commission was created, but it must be operational before FTA releases the funding. FTA outlined steps for the Commission's transition of oversight responsibility on September 6, 2018. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations instead of FTA, but Congress would need to grant FRA authority for this change.
