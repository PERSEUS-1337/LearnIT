    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Covering People With Pre-Existing Conditions Act of 2014\" and establishes universal access programs to improve high-risk pools and reinsurance markets for individuals with pre-existing conditions. Each State must operate a qualified State reinsurance program or a qualifying State high-risk pool by January 1, 2015, funded by State premium assessments not used on State health care programs. States not operating a qualified high risk pool must establish a qualified State reinsurance program by January 1, 2015, funded by State premium assessments. States operating a current qualified high risk pool must transition to a qualifying State high risk pool by January 1, 2015, using premium assessment funds. States must transition from operating a current qualified high-risk pool to a qualified State reinsurance program by using premium assessment funds. If the current program is financially healthy, the transition requirement will be considered met. A qualified State reinsurance program provides reinsurance for health insurance in the small group market. A qualified State reinsurance program operates to provide reinsurance for health insurance coverage in the small group market, meeting HIPAA requirements by acting as a high-risk pool. A qualifying State high risk pool must offer two coverage options, including a high deductible health plan with a health savings account. It should have stable funding, no waiting lists, and cover all eligible residents seeking coverage. The high risk pool must provide coverage for individuals who would be eligible for Medicare but for the disability waiting period, limit premiums to 150% of the average standard risk rates, conduct education and outreach initiatives, and offer preventive services and disease management. The high risk pool must provide coverage for preventive services and disease management for chronic diseases. Only citizens and nationals of the United States are eligible to participate in a qualifying State high risk pool receiving funds under the Public Health Service Act. States receiving funds must certify that all applicants for coverage in the high risk pool meet citizenship requirements. The Secretary requires all applicants in the State high risk pool to provide citizenship documentation. Records must be kept for citizenship determination. A pool must be a qualifying State high risk pool to qualify under the Public Health Service Act. Waivers may be granted for new programs. The Secretary may waive requirements for qualified State reinsurance programs and high risk pools. Funding of $15 billion for fiscal years 2015-2024 and an additional $10 billion for fiscal years 2020-2024 is appropriated for section 2745 of the Public Health Service Act. Definitions for health insurance coverage and issuer are provided in this section. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as health insurance coverage, health insurance issuer, current section 2745 qualified high risk pool, Secretary, and standard risk rate. These definitions are crucial for understanding the provisions outlined in the Public Health Service Act. The term \"State\" refers to any of the 50 States or the District of Columbia. The standard risk rate is determined by considering premium rates charged by other health insurance issuers, using actuarial techniques, and reflecting anticipated claims and expenses."
