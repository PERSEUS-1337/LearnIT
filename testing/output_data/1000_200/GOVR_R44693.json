    "content": "The FMLA requires covered employers to grant up to 12 workweeks of leave for various reasons including the birth or care of a child, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or the employee's own health condition. It also allows up to 26 workweeks of leave to care for a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness. The FMLA provides up to 26 workweeks of leave for eligible employees to care for a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness sustained in the line of duty. To be eligible, employees must work for a covered employer, have 1,250 hours of service in the previous 12 months, work at a location with 50 or more employees within 75 miles, and have worked for the employer for 12 months. Private-sector employers with 50 or more employees for 20 weeks in the current or last calendar year are covered by the act, as well as public agencies regardless of staffing levels. The FMLA has been amended multiple times since its passage in 1993 to cover certain employees, create military family leave entitlement, and modify eligibility requirements. Bills in the 114th Congress aimed to expand leave entitlements and permissible uses of leave under the FMLA. Some proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to expand FMLA leave entitlements, create new qualifying uses of leave, and modify employee eligibility requirements. One bill proposed Parental Involvement and Family Wellness Leave, allowing eligible employees up to four hours of leave during any 30-day period for school conferences or family needs. H.R. 5535 proposed Parental Involvement Leave, allowing eligible employees up to eight hours of leave in a 30-day period for school conferences or activities attended by their child or grandchild. Employees must notify employers seven days in advance. The 114th Congress considered proposals to expand qualifying uses of FMLA leave, including creating new leave categories and broadening circumstances for its use. The 114th Congress considered proposals to expand FMLA leave by creating new categories and broadening existing ones, such as bereavement, domestic violence, family involvement, and medical needs for veterans. Bills introduced would allow FMLA leave for the death of a close family member, including a son or daughter, parent, or sibling. S. 473 proposed expanding FMLA leave to include bereavement for the death of a son or daughter, parent, or sibling. It also allowed leave for domestic violence situations and family involvement activities like school-related events or medical appointments. Employees could use family involvement leave for up to 24 hours in a 12-month period to care for family members or attend medical appointments. H.R. 5165 proposed allowing FMLA leave for hospital care or medical services for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 30% or higher. Various proposals aimed to expand FMLA-qualifying uses of leave for employees. Several proposals aimed to expand FMLA-qualifying uses of leave by broadening the set of relationships for which an employee may use family leave or amending definitions related to the current entitlement. Employees can currently use FMLA leave to assist or provide care to family members such as a new son or daughter, a spouse, son or daughter with a serious health condition, or for military exigency leave. FMLA leave can be used for caregiving purposes for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition, or for military exigency or caregiver leave. Proposed legislative changes would expand FMLA eligibility to include a domestic partner's child and adult children for caregiving purposes. Proposed legislative changes would expand FMLA eligibility to include a domestic partner's child, adult children, grandchild, parent-in-law, grandparent, and sibling for caregiving purposes. Proposed legislative changes aim to expand FMLA eligibility to include a wider range of family members for caregiving purposes, such as domestic partners, adult children, grandchildren, parent-in-laws, grandparents, and siblings. The 114th Congress considered legislation to broaden FMLA eligibility by adding adult children, grandchildren, and grandparents as qualifying family members for military caregiver leave. Other proposed changes included adding domestic partners, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, parent-in-law, and siblings for caregiving purposes. The FMLA definition of son or daughter may be expanded to include children of any age, including adult children, and children of domestic partners. The act defines a serious health condition as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition requiring inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. The FMLA defines a serious health condition as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition requiring inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. S. 2584 and H.R. 4616 proposed amending the act to include recovery from surgery related to organ donation as a serious health condition, but inpatient care or continuing treatment would still need to be met. The 114th Congress considered proposals to amend FMLA eligibility requirements, including reducing the minimum number of employees within 75 miles of an employee's worksite from 50 to 15. The 114th Congress considered bills to amend FMLA eligibility requirements, including reducing the minimum number of employees within 75 miles of an employee's worksite from 50 to 15. Additionally, H.R. 5496 proposed changes to the general hours-of-service requirement, expanding eligibility to include part-time and full-time employees. Other bills aimed to establish new eligibility requirements for veterans with service-connected disabilities and education support professionals. The bill proposed separate eligibility requirements for veterans with service-connected disabilities, allowing them to access FMLA-protected leave with reduced employment duration and hours worked. Veterans with a disability rated at 30%-50% would need 8 months of employment and 833 hours worked, while those with a disability rated at 60% or higher would need 6 months of employment and 625 hours worked to use leave for medical care related to their disability. Employees with a service-connected disability rated at 30% or higher must provide certification from a VA medical provider to use leave for medical needs. Veterans with a disability rated at 30%-50% at the time of retirement can also use leave for medical care related to their service-connected disability. A veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30%-50% at retirement can use leave for medical care after 8 months of employment and 833 hours worked. Those with a disability rated at 60% or higher can use leave after 6 months and 625 hours worked. Certification from the Department of Defense is required for disabilities rated at 30% or higher. S. 3444 proposed separate eligibility requirements for veterans and educational support professionals (ESP) to access FMLA leave sooner based on adjusted hours-of-service criteria. An ESP is defined as an employee of a public school or institution of higher education providing instructional or non-instructional support. The proposal under S. 3444 would allow educational support professionals (ESP) to meet FMLA eligibility by working an average of 60 hours per month or 60% of expected monthly hours for their job description in the previous 12 months. The Secretary of Labor could establish separate rules for calculating leave entitlement for ESPs without changing the entitlement size."
