    "content": "The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" establishes a grant program for gifted and talented students under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. This program includes authorized activities to support these students. The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" recognizes the need for specialized services for gifted students from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities or English as a second language. It acknowledges that these students have already mastered a significant portion of the school curriculum before the school year begins. Many teachers receive training to meet the needs of diverse students, but often lack training for gifted and talented students. High-ability students, especially those from inner cities, may not have access to private programs to supplement their education. Gifted education programs in public schools are essential for providing equal opportunities to high-ability students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Parents and families play a crucial role in supporting the educational needs of gifted students. There is currently no federal requirement for identifying gifted students. To address the disparity in resources and services for gifted students, it is crucial to establish federal requirements and consistent support at the state and local levels. This will ensure that all gifted and talented students have access to appropriate education to meet future economic and national security needs.
