It protects U.S. shipyards and sailors but is debated for increasing costs and limiting ship availability. Recent issues involving the Jones Act include debates on Puerto Rico's economy, the El Faro ship sinking, and domestic oil transportation. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates that vessels transporting cargo domestically must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. Recent discussions have focused on its impact on national security goals, short sea shipping, and U.S. shipbuilding capability. In 2018, public comments were requested to modify or repeal federal requirements in the maritime sector. The Jones Act of 1920 was not the first law requiring U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport. Laws favoring a U.S.-flag fleet over foreign vessels date back to the First Congress in 1789. Prohibitions on foreign-owned vessels transporting domestic cargo were enacted in 1817 and extended to passenger vessels in 1886. In the late 1800s, the United States lost its advantage in shipbuilding to Scotland and England as wooden sailing ships were replaced by iron steamships. Congress debated how to address the decline in U.S. vessels' share of foreign trade and competition from railroads in domestic coastwise transport. The \"free ship\" movement proposed allowing foreign-built vessels under the U.S. flag, but opponents argued that the higher cost of U.S. crews would hinder a resurgence of trade carried by U.S. vessels. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels for domestic voyages. In the late 1800s, Congress considered bills allowing foreign-built ships in domestic trade but tightened coastwise transport regulations instead. For example, in 1891, a shipper loaded merchandise at the Port of New York destined for Los Angeles (Redondo). In 1891, a shipper loaded merchandise at the Port of New York destined for Los Angeles (Redondo) on foreign-flag ships to avoid high freight charges of U.S. vessels. Shipments from Seattle to Alaska also used foreign-flag ships via Vancouver to bypass coastwise laws. Congress later amended laws to prohibit routing cargo through foreign ports to evade coastwise regulations. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, was passed to prevent U.S. shippers from using foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by requiring Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle. This was done by amending coastwise laws to cover shipments \"by land and water\" and replacing shipments between \"U.S. ports\" with shipments between \"U.S. points.\" The debate leading up to the passage of the Jones Act included discussions on the relative cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries. The Jones Act of 1920 aimed to promote American merchant marine by restricting foreign-built ships. The minority report expressed concerns about the cost of domestically built ships and advocated for removing restrictions on American merchants acquiring ships at the lowest price to compete globally. The Jones Act of 1920 aimed to promote American merchant marine by restricting foreign-built ships. A 1922 government report on shipbuilding indicated that U.S.-built ships cost 20% more than those built in foreign yards, increasing to 50% in the 1930s, doubling in the 1950s, and tripling by the 1990s. The cost differential between U.S.-built ships and foreign-built ships has continued to increase over the years. Today, a U.S.-built tanker may cost four times the global price of a similar vessel, while a U.S.-built container ship could cost five times the global price. This cost difference has led the Department of Defense to reconsider building sealift ships domestically due to affordability concerns. U.S. shipyards do not compete with foreign shipyards on price or vessel characteristics, and U.S. crewing costs also play a role in the overall cost factor. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed the sale of surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined maritime policy goals. U.S.-flag ships have higher operating costs compared to foreign-flag ships, primarily due to crewing costs, insurance, and maintenance. A 2011 study by MARAD found that the average operating cost of a U.S.-flag ship was 2.7 times greater than a foreign-flag ship, with the cost differential increasing since then. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed the sale of surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined maritime policy goals, emphasizing the need for a strong merchant marine for national defense and commerce. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the importance of developing and maintaining a strong merchant marine for national defense and commerce. The Jones Act, which applies to domestic waterborne shipments, requires U.S. citizen crewing on ships, with specific requirements for crew composition and ownership. The Jones Act requires U.S. citizen crewing on ships, with specific requirements for crew composition and ownership. U.S. territories like the U.S. Virgin Islands, America Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are exempt from the Jones Act. Puerto Rico is exempt for passengers but not for cargo. The Coast Guard enforces the U.S.-build requirement, ownership of carriers, and crewing for vessels traveling between U.S. points. The Jones Act enforces licensing requirements for operators seeking a \"coastwise endorsement\" from the agency. Customs and Border Protection determines maritime activity under the act, including defining \"transportation\" and identifying \"U.S. points\" for voyages. The act mandates the use of only \"U.S.-built\" vessels, a determination left to the Coast Guard by Congress. The Jones Act mandates the use of only \"U.S.-built\" vessels, with the Coast Guard determining what constitutes a U.S.-built vessel based on specific criteria. The Coast Guard defines a vessel as U.S.-built if its hull and superstructure components are fabricated in the United States and the vessel is assembled in the U.S. Engines are considered components that can be imported from foreign manufacturers for oceangoing ships. U.S. shipyards can import engines from foreign manufacturers as long as they are attached to the vessel in a U.S. shipyard. The Coast Guard allows components that are self-supporting and do not compromise the vessel's integrity to be manufactured abroad. The weight limit for foreign-manufactured hull and superstructure components is 1.5% of the steel weight. Propellers, stern bulbs, bulbous bows, some rudders, and watertight closures used in U.S.-built vessels are often imported as long as they stay within the weight limit. The Coast Guard permits certain foreign components to be imported for U.S.-built vessels, as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Shipyards seek confirmation from the Coast Guard on incorporating foreign-built components, with determination letters detailing permissible components. Shipyard unions refer to vessels built with foreign components as \"kit ships.\" In 2018, Congress directed the Coast Guard to publish these determination letters. In 2018, Congress directed the Coast Guard to publish determination letters regarding the incorporation of foreign components in U.S.-built vessels. Shipyard unions, who refer to these vessels as \"kit ships,\" sued the Coast Guard in 2007 over its interpretation of the statute, but the U.S. District Court sided with the Coast Guard citing historical interpretations dating back to the late 1800s. This legal dispute stemmed from a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder to build Jones Act tankers using the Korean builder's designs and procurement services. Since 2004, a South Korean shipbuilder has partnered with U.S. shipyards to build Jones Act tankers and container ships. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego also collaborated with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea for vessel designs and materials. This partnership raises concerns about undermining the Jones Act's goal of domestic shipbuilding independence. The shipyards argued that using foreign components would lower ship costs and benefit the domestic fleet. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships due to a regulatory loophole. Cruise ships serving a U.S. port do not have to be Jones Act-compliant if they have visited a distant foreign port. This rule was established in a 1910 Attorney General's opinion and a 1985 rulemaking. The 1985 rule by the U.S. Customs Service allows foreign cruise ships to visit U.S. ports as long as they also visit a nearby foreign port. Passengers must stay on the cruise until it returns to the same U.S. port. This exemption from the Jones Act applies if the main purpose of the voyage is not domestic transportation. Another type of passenger vessel excursion involves visits to no other ports for activities like whale watching or deep-sea fishing. Passenger vessel excursions known as \"voyages to nowhere\" involve activities like whale watching or deep-sea fishing. If these vessels stay within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters, they must be Jones Act-compliant. However, if they venture beyond 3 miles into international waters, they do not need to comply with the Jones Act. Charter fishing boats have different regulations when it comes to international waters. The Jones Act applies to charter fishing boats in international waters, as determined by a 1936 ruling. CBP's interpretation includes defining a passenger as anyone aboard who is not crew or owner, requiring compliance even for yacht owners entertaining guests. The Jones Act applies to various scenarios, including yacht owners entertaining business clients and construction companies transporting workers. CBP's interpretations impact lightering operations in U.S. territorial waters, requiring Jones Act compliance for vessels within 3 nautical miles of shore. Within the 3-mile zone in the Delaware Bay and other areas, lightering vessels must be Jones Act-compliant. For offshore oil rigs, only those attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points\" within the 200-mile offshore zone. MODUs not attached to the seabed are not considered \"U.S. points.\" In 2008, Congress required that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. The Jones Act compliance for OSVs depends on whether they are transporting supplies/workers to oil rigs or installing equipment. Vessels laying cable/pipeline in U.S. waters are exempt from Jones Act requirements. In 2017, CBP proposed that most activities performed by OSVs fall under the Jones Act, but withdrew the proposal after reviewing comments. Some question whether the Jones Act applies to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore. Wind farm developers are guided by CBP's interpretations of the Jones Act for OSVs and oil. The Jones Act applies to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore. The nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) hinders offshore wind farm development, especially in deeper water. U.S. wind developers either transport equipment from foreign countries or use Jones Act-compliant vessels alongside non-Jones Act-compliant TIVs for installation. A third CBP interpretation of the Jones Act has shaped coastal maritime activity. The Jones Act allows for the use of foreign-flag tankers if merchandise is transformed into a new product at an intermediate foreign port, even if a portion of the cargo is being shipped between two U.S. points. This interpretation has been significant in shaping coastal maritime activity. Since 1920, Congress has enacted provisions tightening Jones Act requirements and exempting certain maritime activities. In 1935, vessels sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign flag were forbidden from requalifying as Jones Act-eligible, ensuring they could never be used in U.S. domestic trade. In 1940, Congress expanded the Jones Act to cover towing vessels and salvage vessels operating in U.S. waters. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires use of a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions and exceptions to the Jones Act, which can be found in the Appendix. In 1984, Congress exempted passenger travel between Puerto Rico and any other U.S. port as long as no Jones Act-qualified operator was able to provide comparable service. This exemption remains in force, allowing foreign-flag cruise ships to carry passengers between the U.S. mainland and the island. Congress has also permitted certain foreign-flagged liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers to provide domestic service on two occasions, in 1996 and 2011, due to a lack of Jones Act fleet availability. No ship owners have utilized these exemptions. Congress has enacted exemptions for Jones Act-qualified vessels due to spikes in demand, such as for iron ore during the 1940s and a bumper grain harvest in 1951. In 1996, an exemption was made for vessels in oil spill cleanup operations when there weren't enough Jones Act-qualified vessels available. Waivers have also been granted for innovative vessel designs used in foreign trade but with domestic operations, like the Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) technology in 1971. In 1971, Congress exempted Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) barges from the Jones Act, which is no longer relevant as this technology is not in use. In 1965, Congress exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports from the Jones Act for international shipments. This exemption allows foreign-flagged container carriers to reposition their empty equipment along U.S. coastlines, while Jones Act-compliant ships are needed for transshipment of loaded international containers. This distinction has implications for the development of marine highways or short sea shipping routes. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships for transshipment of international containerized cargo. Lack of transshipment services increases demand for rail and road connections to ports. Congress has enacted exemptions for specific vessels identified by name and registration number. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers to at least 133 specific vessels in 16 separate legislative acts. These waivers are typically found in maritime-related legislation and often involve vessels that are not commercially significant, such as small cargo or passenger vessels owned by nonprofit entities. One exception was the 2011 waivers granted to three LNG tankers built in the United States in the late 1970s. In many cases, vessels need waivers due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements, such as missing U.S.-citizen ownership history records. Waivers have been granted during World War I, World War II, and the Korean War, with specific conditions placed on vessel usage. Congress has granted Jones Act waivers to at least 133 vessels since 1989, often involving small cargo or passenger vessels owned by nonprofit entities. Waivers have been granted for national defense reasons, allowing expedited oil shipments and fuel resupply after military conflicts and natural disasters. The executive branch has used this authority for waivers following major hurricanes, with MARAD checking vessel availability before granting waivers. In response to national defense needs, waivers have been granted for Jones Act-qualified vessels, including heavy-lift vessels. Examples include waivers for transporting radar systems and oil rigs. However, a waiver request to transport replicas of Christopher Columbus's ships was denied in 1992. CBP has denied Jones Act waivers for heavy-lift vessels used in offshore oil rig construction, despite safety concerns raised by Coast Guard and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Waivers are not granted for economic reasons, only for national defense purposes. In 1976, some Members of Congress sought to extend the Jones Act due to concerns about the vulnerability of offshore supply lines. In 2014, northeast refineries considered seeking a Jones Act waiver to ship crude oil from Texas, as they import much of their crude oil. In 2018, the United States exported between 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers, imported about 150 million barrels per month from overseas sources on foreign-flag tankers, and shipped about 15 million barrels per month domestically on Jones Act tankers. Similar issues are arising with liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the United States. The Jones Act fleet ships about 15 million barrels per month domestically on tankers. The United States is exporting LNG by ship while still importing it, with no domestic shipments. Puerto Rico seeks a Jones Act waiver for LNG imports. Recent controversies involve oceangoing ships and offshore vessels. The Jones Act also covers ships on the Great Lakes, river barges, harbor tugs, and passenger vessels. The Jones Act fleet has shortcomings compared to the desired merchant fleet. As of March 2018, the Jones Act-compliant fleet consists of 99 oceangoing ships, primarily tankers carrying Alaskan crude oil and refined products. The fleet also includes dry cargo vessels such as container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, and dry bulk carriers. The Jones Act-compliant fleet consists of 99 oceangoing ships, including tankers for Alaskan crude oil and dry cargo vessels like container ships and dry bulk carriers. The fleet also has smaller general-cargo vessels serving Alaska's coast. The fleet size has decreased significantly since 1950, with a notable drop in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Alan Boyd, Secretary of Transportation in the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration, criticized the U.S. merchant marine as \"too small, too old, and too unproductive\" in a 1967 congressional hearing. The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration called for the repeal of the Jones Act, stating that flooding the industry with Federal dollars and protection is not the way to revitalize it. Domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines despite their economic advantages. Ships can move more cargo per trip and per gallon of fuel compared to trucks and railroads, offering lower costs for shippers willing to sacrifice transit time for reliable delivery schedules. The Jones Act fleet operates mainly in domestic trade routes. The Jones Act fleet operates in domestic trade routes where shippers have few alternatives, serving Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Despite preserving a nucleus of the U.S. maritime industry, it has not met the goal of sustaining a growing merchant marine. Congress amended the policy goals in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to include providing shipping service on essential routes and having the safest vessels. The Jones Act fleet does not meet the policy goals of having the best equipped and most suitable vessels. Certain ship designs, like \"project cargo\" vessels, are not represented in the fleet. The Department of Defense has used waivers to move certain cargo on foreign-flag vessels. The Jones Act fleet lacks modern vessels and certain ship designs, such as \"project cargo\" vessels. The Department of Defense has used waivers to move radar systems and newly built vessels on foreign-flag heavy-lift vessels due to the higher cost structure of Jones Act operators hindering international competitiveness. The oceangoing Jones Act fleet has two mostly inactive dry bulk ships that are nearly 40 years old, and the sole Jones Act-qualified chemical tanker was built in 1968. Despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom, there are no LNG tankers in the Jones Act fleet, leading to a lack of sufficient tanker capacity. The lack of LNG tankers in the Jones Act fleet, built in response to the shale gas boom, has led to a need for more tanker capacity. The U.S. market has developed articulated tug barges (ATBs) as a unique vessel design, with over 150 operating in Jones Act trades. While ATBs are more capable than flatwater barges, they are still less efficient and reliable than tanker ships due to their slower speed and smaller size. ATBs, or articulated tug barges, are slower and smaller than tanker ships, creating more resistance through the water. They pose a higher risk of grounding and carry predominantly oil on coastal voyages. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship that sank in 2015, had open lifeboats due to being built in 1975. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet after the incident. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet after the El Faro incident. Congressional testimony revealed worries about the fleet's aging vessels and substandard conditions, with a recent crack found in the hull of a 46-year-old Jones Act containership. The Jones Act fleet has become younger due to new shipbuilding following the increase in shale oil production. Just over one-third of oceangoing fleet is 21 years old or older, down from two-thirds in 2007. The Great Lakes fleet consists of older dry bulk ships and large barges carrying iron ore, limestone, coal, and cement. The U.S. fleet of 1,000-foot freighters on the Great Lakes was built between 1972 and 1981. The U.S. fleet of 1,000-foot freighters on the Great Lakes, built between 1972 and 1981, primarily carries iron ore, limestone, coal, and cement for steelmaking. The second-largest class of ships, around 700 feet in length, is older, with some vessels dating back to the 1940s or 1950s. Ships operating in freshwater, like the Great Lakes, have longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet reflects the impact of vessel import policies on domestic fleets. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet was affected by vessel import policies. Canada imposed a 25% tariff on imported ships, halting new additions to the fleet until the tariff was repealed in 2010. Since then, over 35 new dry bulk ships have been constructed in other countries for service on the Great Lakes. Thousands of tugs and barges transport dry and liquid bulk commodities on inland rivers, with tonnage dominated by corn, soybeans, and coal movements. The U.S. inland river system includes thousands of tugs and barges carrying dry and liquid bulk cargoes, with tonnage dominated by corn, soybeans, and coal. Overall tonnage has been flat or slightly declining since 1990. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. Congress amended the Jones Act in 1988 to include valueless material as \"merchandise\" for domestic vessel transportation. The Jones Act amendment in 1988 required dredge spoil to be transported in Jones Act-qualified vessels, increasing the cost of dredging U.S. harbors. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a larger volume of material dredged due to factors like limited supply of dredging vessels, cost increases in fuel, steel, and labor, and more stringent environmental requirements. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading countries. The U.S. privately owned fleet is much older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms. European firms have larger hopper dredges, while the U.S. fleet is mostly over 20 years old. When the Army Corps bids for harbor work, U.S. firms are often the sole bidders. Insufficient dredges can cause delays in dredging projects. The U.S. fleet schedules dredging projects but faces periods with insufficient dredges. Mobilization costs can be high, with foreign firms using heavy-lift vessels. The OSV fleet size fluctuates with the oil market. Foreign-built vessels are crucial for deepwater rig construction. The Jones Act fleet lacks vessels with dynamic positioning propulsion systems for deepwater rig construction. Concerns exist about the fleet's ability to serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war. Congress has designated other fleets for sealift support, but the shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises doubts about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. The Jones Act crew of oceangoing ships, consisting of about 3,380 merchant mariners, could be called upon to crew a reserve fleet of government-owned cargo ships for military sealift purposes. This raises concerns about the shrinking U.S. mariner pool's ability to crew a reserve sealift fleet. Congress directed the development of a national sealift strategy in 2014, but it has yet to be issued. The crew of oceangoing ships, consisting of about 3,380 merchant mariners, could be used to crew a government-owned reserve fleet for military sealift purposes. There are concerns about the shortage of mariners in the U.S. to sustain a prolonged sealift effort. MARAD estimates a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners for crew rotations in a prolonged sealift effort. The mariner pool is barely sufficient for an immediate surge and has been a consistent concern for decades, even when the pool was larger in the past. Previous findings by TRANSCOM in 2004 and MARAD in 1991 also highlighted the insufficient mariner pool for crewing the reserve sealift fleet. The Jones Act's maritime policy aimed for a commercial fleet capable of providing sealift during wartime, but additional fleets have since been established. The Jones Act's maritime policy aimed for a commercial fleet that could provide sealift during wartime. Three other fleets - RRF, MSC, and MSP - have been established for military sealift purposes. The RRF consists of 46 ships on standby with a skeleton crew of 600 mariners, needing an additional 1,200 mariners when activated. MSC ships are controlled by TRANSCOM and mostly crewed by civilian mariners. MSP ships, established in 1996, receive an operating subsidy of about $5 million. The MSP ships, established by Congress in 1996, receive a $5 million operating subsidy per vessel per year to cover the cost of American crews. These ships rely on government cargoes reserved for them by law. The military is required to use MSP ships before utilizing MSC ship capacity. The sealift fleet, unlike Jones Act operators, is largely composed of more economical foreign-built ships and does not compete in the commercial marketplace. The sealift fleet could be required to be built domestically, sharing the higher cost nationally. This would increase repair work for U.S. shipyards and enlarge the mariner pool for sealift support. The ships could be designed to military specifications for flexible capabilities. The military sealift fleet consists of ships with ramps or cranes for unloading cargo at damaged ports, including product tankers, Ro/Ro ships, and container ships. The preference for versatile ships conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger vessels. Commercial mariners may lack experience with general cargo and break-bulk ships that have been largely replaced by container ships. The trend in the commercial shipping industry has led to the replacement of versatile ships with specialized and larger vessels, such as container ships without onboard cranes. This shift has resulted in commercial mariners potentially lacking experience operating cargo cranes, which may be necessary in foreign ports where shore-based cranes are unavailable. Additionally, cost pressures have led to the installation of engines in commercial carriers that prioritize fuel efficiency over speed, making them less suitable for military purposes. The implementation of stricter sulfur emission regulations has also prompted the adoption of LNG-fueled engines, which are not universally available. The commercial shipping industry trend towards specialized and larger vessels, like container ships without onboard cranes, has led to potential challenges for commercial mariners lacking experience with cargo cranes. Cost pressures have also resulted in engines prioritizing fuel efficiency over speed in commercial carriers, making them less suitable for military purposes. Stricter sulfur emission regulations have prompted the adoption of LNG-fueled engines, not globally available. The military faces a growing disparity in vessel designs and crew skill sets compared to commercial carriers. The Jones Act aims to preserve a shipyard industrial base capable of building and repairing ships, but U.S. shipyards only produce a few oceangoing ships annually, none for export. U.S. shipyards typically build only two or three oceangoing ships per year, with gaps between orders. One shipyard builds only commercial ships but had employment below 100 people with no vessels under construction as of March 31, 2019. Another shipyard relies heavily on Navy orders. Smaller vessels like tour boats, ferries, and barges are also built, with around 1,000 barges constructed in a typical year. These vessels fall under the Jones Act domestic build requirement and are rarely built for export. The government-owned sealift fleet, with vessels averaging 44 years old, lacks sufficient large dry docks for repairs. Some ships in the reserve fleet have failed safety inspections and are not seaworthy. The Navy plans to recapitalize by building new vessels, extending service life of current ships, and purchasing used foreign-built ships. The Navy is considering accelerating the purchase of used, foreign-built ships due to the high cost and long duration of repairing current vessels. Building new ships in U.S. yards is deemed unaffordable. The Tariff Act of 1930 imposes a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards, but many U.S.-flag international trading ships opt for foreign repairs due to lower costs. In 2018, U.S.-flag operators still opt for repairs in foreign yards despite the 50% duty, as it is cheaper than domestic shipyard repairs."
