    "content": "In a well-studied approach for machine learning on relational data, entities and relations are represented in an embedding space. Our approach proposes a multimodal embedding using different neural encoders to incorporate various data types like text, images, and numerical values. We introduce two new benchmarks, YAGO-10-plus and MovieLens-100k-plus, with additional relations such as textual descriptions and images. Our model effectively utilizes this extra information to improve accuracy and predict missing multimodal attributes. Knowledge bases (KB) play a crucial role in this process. The text discusses the importance of knowledge bases (KB) in computational systems and the challenges they face, such as incompleteness and noise. Various approaches aim to improve relational knowledge representation by estimating low-dimensional representations for entities and relations. These representations help encode uncertainty and infer missing facts accurately and efficiently. The text discusses the challenges of knowledge bases in computational systems, emphasizing the importance of accurate and efficient inference. Knowledge bases contain various data types, including textual descriptions and images, which provide crucial evidence for completing the knowledge base. These additional types of relations cannot be directly represented as links in a graph but are essential for knowledge base completion. In this paper, a multimodal embedding approach is introduced for modeling knowledge bases that include textual descriptions, images, numerical, and categorical values. The approach aims to go beyond traditional link-based modeling, utilizing all observed information and representing uncertainty in relational evidence. The method is applied to the DistMult approach, extending it to learn a more comprehensive knowledge base. In this study, a multimodal embedding approach is introduced to enhance existing relational modeling methods, specifically applied to the DistMult approach. The method incorporates neural encoders for different types of evidence data, such as images and textual attributes, to improve the accuracy of relational data modeling. The scoring module remains consistent, producing a score indicating the likelihood of a triple being correct. The unified model facilitates information flow across various relation types, leading to more precise relational data modeling. Evaluation of the proposed approach is conducted on two relational databases. The proposed approach introduces novel relation types for more accurate modeling of relational data. Evaluation is done on two databases with extended benchmarks. The model effectively utilizes additional information for improved link-prediction accuracy and predicts object entities based on similarity. The curr_chunk discusses relational modeling in knowledge bases, focusing on training a model to score the truth value of factual statements represented as triplets. The goal is to learn a scoring function for link prediction in a multimodal setting, incorporating various types of information about entities. The link prediction problem involves learning a scoring function for knowledge bases using observed triples. Models like DistMult map entities to dense vectors and relations to diagonal matrices for accurate predictions. DistMult maps entities to dense vectors and relations to diagonal matrices for accurate predictions using a pairwise ranking loss to score existing triples higher than non-existing ones. Negative samples are generated for training triplets, allowing DistMult to learn representations for completion, queries, or cleaning in knowledge bases. The proposed work aims to enhance existing relational models like DistMult by learning embeddings for various data types such as numerical, categorical, images, and text. This allows for the incorporation of diverse object types in knowledge bases, enabling the scoring of truth values based on subject entity, relation, and object value embeddings. The model enhances relational models like DistMult by learning embeddings for different data types (numerical, categorical, images, text) to score truth values based on subject entity, relation, and object value embeddings. The embeddings are used to score the truth value of the triple by the Scorer using the DistMult operation. The model enhances relational models like DistMult by learning embeddings for different data types to compute scores for triples. Encoders are used for each data type, such as CNNs for images and LSTMs for text. Training the model involves replacing the object entity with a random entity from the same domain for negative sampling. Structured knowledge is represented using embedding vectors for subject entity and relation, with categorical object entities embedded through a dense layer. The model enhances relational models by learning embeddings for different data types to compute scores for triples. For categorical object entities, a dense layer with selu activation is used. Numerical objects are embedded into a higher-dimensional space using a feed forward layer after basic normalization. Text can store various types of information. The model enhances relational models by learning embeddings for different data types to compute scores for triples. For numbers 39 and 40, data is used to learn that these values are similar. Text can store a wide variety of information, with different encoders used based on string lengths. Character-based stacked, bidirectional LSTM is used for short attributes like names, while a CNN over word embeddings is used for longer strings like detailed descriptions. These encoders provide a fixed length encoding that accurately represents the strings. Images can also provide information. Encoders provide fixed length encoding that accurately represents strings. Images can also provide useful information for modeling entities, with various models successfully applied to tasks like image classification and captioning. To embed images with semantic information, the last hidden layer of VGG pretrained network on Imagenet is used, followed by compact bilinear pooling. Other data types are also considered in the paper. The paper discusses using various models for encoding different data types such as speech/audio, time series, and geospatial coordinates. Different scoring functions like matrix multiplication, euclidean distance, and circular correlation are used in knowledge base representation modeling. In knowledge base representation modeling, various scoring functions like matrix multiplication and euclidean distance are used. Different types of information such as text, numerical values, and images are encoded as relational triples. Methods incorporate extra features like numerical values, images, and text to compute entity embeddings. BID31 addresses multilingual relation extraction by considering raw text as an extra feature. BID31 focuses on multilingual relation extraction by incorporating raw text as an additional feature in a universal schema. The model differs from other approaches by integrating various types of information (numerical, text, image) as relational triples, representing uncertainty and supporting missing values for more accurate embedding.

Two new benchmarks are provided by extending existing datasets, including MovieLens 100k with posters and YAGO-10 with image, textual, and numerical information. MovieLens-100k dataset contains rich relational data about users and movies. The MovieLens dataset contains data on 1000 users and 1700 movies, including information on occupation, gender, zip code, age, genre, release date, and titles. Movie genres are represented as binary vectors. Movie posters are collected from TMDB. Ratings are treated as relations in KB triple format. 10% of ratings are used for validation. Another dataset, YAGO3-10, is more suitable for knowledge graph completion and link prediction. The YAGO3-10 knowledge graph dataset consists of 120,000 entities and 37 relations, making it suitable for knowledge graph completion and link prediction tasks. Additional relations like wasBornOnDate and happenedOnDate with date values are identified.
