    "content": "The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) administers programs under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994, providing financial and technical assistance to improve criminal justice responses to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The Obama Administration's FY2017 request for OVW was $489 million, with proposed increases for grants related to domestic violence cases, civil legal assistance, violence on college campuses, and abuse prevention. The Obama Administration proposed increased funding for various programs under the Violence Against Women Act, including grants for domestic violence cases, civil legal assistance, violence on college campuses, abuse prevention, and tribal justice systems. They also suggested funding new initiatives to reduce firearm lethality in domestic violence cases and enhance responses to campus sexual assault. Additionally, there was a proposal to reduce funding for the STOP Formula Grant program. Congress later approved a $326 million transfer from the Crime Victims Fund to supplement direct appropriations for OVW. In 2017, Congress approved a $326 million transfer from the Crime Victims Fund to supplement direct appropriations for the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW). While funding for grants to encourage arrests in domestic violence cases and strengthen tribal justice systems was increased, Congress did not fully support the Obama Administration's proposals. STOP grants were funded at the same level as the previous year, and the Office of Justice Programs manages various justice-related agencies. The Obama Administration requested a $154 million budget for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account in FY2017, a 32.8% increase from the previous year. This account funds the Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Institute of Justice, and forensic sciences improvement program. Additionally, funding was requested for a clearinghouse for evidence-based programs. The Administration requested funding for two new initiatives: a clearinghouse for evidence-based programs ($3 million) and an incident-based crime statistics program ($10 million). Congress provided $89 million for the Research, Evaluation, and Statistics account for FY2017, with a decrease in funding largely due to moving funds for the Regional Information Sharing System. The State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account includes funding for various grant programs to improve criminal justice systems. The Obama Administration's FY2017 request for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account was $1.098 billion, 22.1% less than FY2016. Proposed cuts included State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, Paul Coverdell Forensic Sciences Improvement Program, grants for trafficking victims, John R. Justice program, and tribal assistance program. New initiatives included a clearinghouse for evidence-based programs and incident-based crime statistics program. The Obama Administration proposed funding cuts for various programs under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account, including the JAG program, National Criminal History Improvement program, and DNA backlog reduction initiatives. They also suggested using a portion of the funding to support tribal justice programs and grants for trafficking victims. The Obama Administration proposed funding cuts for various programs under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account, including the JAG program, National Criminal History Improvement program, and DNA backlog reduction initiatives (-$20 million). They also proposed increasing funding for reentry initiatives, programs for children exposed to violence, grants for residential substance abuse treatment, and programs to assist people with mental illness in the criminal justice system. Additionally, new programs were requested, such as $10 million for the Byrne Incentive Grant program. The Obama Administration proposed funding cuts for various programs under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account, including the JAG program, National Criminal History Improvement program, and DNA backlog reduction initiatives. Grantees can use JAG funding for evidence-based programs, Byrne Competitive Grant program receives $15 million, $20 million for grants to improve fairness in justice systems, $5 million for Violence Reduction Network, and $6 million for grants to counter violent extremism. Congress reduced funding for the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account by 9.1%, or $128 million, for FY2017. Funding for the JAG program decreased from $347 million for FY2016 to $335 million for FY2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act eliminated funding for tribal assistance programs (-$30 million). Congress reduced funding for tribal assistance programs by $30 million in FY2017. However, DOJ was authorized to allocate up to 7% of funding from various accounts for tribal justice assistance programs. Additionally, $103 million was allocated for an opioid initiative, with funding coming from existing programs such as Drug Courts, Veterans Treatment Courts, and Residential Substance Abuse Treatment. In FY2016, Congress funded programs for Prescription Drug Monitoring, mental illness in the criminal justice system, and opioid initiatives under the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. The Juvenile Justice Programs account received funding for grant programs to reduce juvenile delinquency. The Obama Administration's proposed new programs were not funded. The Obama Administration requested a $334 million budget for Juvenile Justice Programs in FY2017, a 23.8% increase from the previous year. The proposal included funding increases for various programs such as JJDPA Part B formula grants, Title V grants, and the Community-based Violence Prevention Initiative. Additionally, funding was requested for the restoration of Juvenile Accountability Block Grants and a Smart on Juvenile Justice Initiative aimed at improving outcomes for system-involved youth. The Obama Administration proposed a $334 million budget for Juvenile Justice Programs in FY2017, with funding increases for various programs. However, Congress appropriated $247 million for the Juvenile Justice Programs account, resulting in reductions for some programs such as JJDPA Part B state formula grants, youth mentoring grants, and Title V grants. Congress also chose to fund the Community-based Violence Prevention Initiative as a set-aside from the Title V grant program. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget proposal included a $74 million increase for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office, aiming to fund new programs and initiatives. This included a $42 million increase for the COPS hiring program and the establishment of the Tribal Resources Grant program. Congress appropriated $222 million for the COPS account for FY2017, with a 4.5% increase in funding compared to FY2016. Funding for the COPS hiring program remained unchanged at $137 million after set-asides. Congress also increased funding for the Anti-heroin Task Forces program by $3 million and set aside $8 million for the POLICE Act of 2016. Funding for the Regional Information Sharing System (RISS) was transferred to OJP as required by P.L. 115-31. The POLICE Act of 2016 allocated $8 million from the COPS hiring program for active shooter training. The Administration requested $500 million for the 21st Century Justice Initiative in FY2017, aiming to invest $5 billion over 10 years in criminal justice reform efforts. This initiative would focus on reducing crime, reversing unnecessary incarceration practices, and building community trust. States could use the funding for adult and juvenile systems. The 21st Century Justice Initiative aimed to invest $5 billion over 10 years in criminal justice reform efforts, focusing on reducing crime, reversing unnecessary incarceration, and building community trust. States could use the funding for adult and juvenile systems, including examining state laws, promoting community-oriented policing, and providing diversion and reentry services. 10% of the funding would have been dedicated to reform efforts in the federal criminal justice system, but Congress declined to provide funding for this program."
