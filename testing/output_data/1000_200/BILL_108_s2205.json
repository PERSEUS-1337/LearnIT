FINDINGS.\" \"Ukraine allows its citizens the right to emigrate with minimal taxes since 1997. It has made progress in establishing democratic institutions and a free-market economy.\" Ukraine, as a participating state of the OSCE, is committed to developing governance in line with human rights principles. Despite progress in recent elections, there are still significant shortcomings in the implementation of election laws, interference by authorities, and allegations of intimidation against opposition figures and voters. Ukraine, as an OSCE member, is dedicated to addressing issues related to national and religious minorities, protecting against incitement to violence based on discrimination, and combating ethnic and religious intolerance. Ukraine is combating ethnic and religious intolerance by cooperating with US organizations, restoring religious properties confiscated during the Soviet era, and progressing towards accession to normal trade relations with the US. Ukraine is making progress towards joining the World Trade Organization, addressing issues such as access for US agricultural products, intellectual property rights, tariff reductions, and labor rights protections. Ukraine has committed to respecting labor rights and freedom of the press as an OSCE member. It aims for European integration, positive relations with neighbors, and cooperation in peacekeeping and counterterrorism efforts with the US. The President may determine that Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 should no longer apply to Ukraine and proclaim the extension of permanent normal trade relations treatment to Ukrainian products. This would cease the application of Title IV to Ukraine. The Congress urges Ukraine to fulfill its commitments as an OSCE member, including promoting free emigration, safeguarding religious liberty, combating discrimination and violence, expanding property restitution, and respecting media freedoms. The Congress urges Ukraine to work on improving various areas, including intellectual property rights protection, trade dispute resolution, and human rights monitoring with support from the United States. The Congress is providing assistance to NGOs and human rights groups in Ukraine for activities related to human rights, democracy, and rule of law. They are also working on establishing annual discussions with Ukraine on these issues, involving both US and Ukrainian NGOs. SEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. The reports required by sections 102(b) and 203 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 shall include an assessment of certain issues. SEC. 5. CONTINUED ENJOYMENT OF RIGHTS UNDER THE JUNE 23, 1992, BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT. SEC. 5. The trade agreement between the United States and Ukraine from June 23, 1992, remains in force, granting the U.S. rights to use safeguard rules against import surges from Ukraine. Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974 applies to Ukraine as it does to China as long as the agreement is in force. The President must notify Congress within 5 days of a bilateral agreement with Ukraine on WTO accession. A report on the agreement must be transmitted to Congress within 15 days. If a resolution of disapproval is introduced within 30 days of notification, it will be considered. Congress must consider a resolution of disapproval regarding the agreement between the United States and Ukraine on Ukraine's accession to the World Trade Organization. The resolution must state that the agreement does not adequately serve the interests of the United States. Procedures for considering resolutions of disapproval include introduction by any Member of the House or Senate, referral to specific committees, and no amendments allowed by the committees. Procedures for resolutions of disapproval: Introduced by any Senate Member, referred to Committee on Finance, no amendments allowed. Committee discharge and floor consideration follow Trade Act of 1974 rules. The Congress enacts subsection (b) as part of the rules of the House of Representatives and the Senate, superseding other rules if inconsistent. Each House has the constitutional right to change its rules regarding procedures at any time."
