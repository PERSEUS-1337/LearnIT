The Act titled \"Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013\" highlights the high number of musculoskeletal disorders among nurses and nursing assistants due to patient lifting and transferring, leading to chronic back pain and work leave. Many nurses suffer from chronic back pain, with 38 percent requiring leave from work. Patient safety is compromised during manual lifting, transferring, or repositioning. Assistive patient handling technology has made manual patient handling outdated in nursing care. The use of patient handling technology in healthcare facilities has led to a significant decrease in injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers. This technology has also reduced lost work days due to injury, staff turnover, and workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Several states have implemented standards for safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention. Several states have implemented safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards, demonstrating their success at the facility and state levels. Establishing these standards for healthcare workers is crucial for protecting their health and safety, addressing the nursing shortage, and improving patient safety. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard is established to protect healthcare workers' health and safety, address the nursing shortage, and improve patient safety in facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Secretary of Labor must create an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within 1 year of this Act, with a final standard to follow within 2 years. This standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers, including registered nurses, by implementing engineering and safety controls for patient handling. The prevention standard requires the use of engineering and safety controls for handling patients to eliminate injuries from manual handling. It includes the use of mechanical technology and devices where feasible, and alternative controls when not feasible. The standard applies to all healthcare employers and aligns with national safe patient handling standards. The interprofessional national safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards mandate health care employers to develop and implement a program within 6 months. This program includes hazard identification, risk assessments, and control measures related to patient care duties. Employers must also purchase, use, maintain, and provide access to safe patient handling equipment and technology within 2 years. The health care employer must involve health care workers in developing and implementing a safe patient handling program, including purchasing necessary equipment. Additionally, employers are required to establish a data tracking and review program for their safe patient handling initiatives. The health care employer must analyze data on safe patient handling programs and consider incorporating technology into facilities. They should make findings available to health care workers and relevant parties upon request. The feasibility of integrating safe patient handling technology into new facility design or remodeling includes training health care workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, equipment, and devices. Training should cover identifying and controlling musculoskeletal hazards and be conducted by knowledgeable individuals using interactive simulated point-of-care training. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for health care employers to post a notice about safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, training, reporting procedures, and health care workers' rights under the Act. The curr_chunk explains the annual evaluation requirement for health care employers regarding safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention programs. It involves assessing procedures, technology, equipment, injuries, and new technology with input from nurses and other healthcare workers. Corrective actions must be taken based on the evaluation. Health care employers must document input in evaluations and take corrective action as recommended. Employees have the right to refuse unsafe assignments if they believe it violates safety standards and could result in harm, after communicating concerns to the employer. The Secretary of Labor conducts unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards when employees report safety concerns to their health care employer. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD TO FACILITIES RECEIVING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDS. The Social Security Act is amended to include safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards in health care facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The amendments will apply one year after the issuance date. The amendments made by subsection (a) will apply to health care facilities one year after the final safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard is issued under section 2. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. This Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with this Act. It also does not diminish the rights of health care workers under federal or state laws. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms such as \"direct-care registered nurse,\" \"employee,\" \"employment,\" and \"handling\" in relation to healthcare workers and services. The term \"health care worker\" refers to individuals assigned by a health care employer to engage in patient handling, which includes actions like lifting, transferring, and mobilizing patients. Health care employers include various facilities such as hospitals, nursing homes, and home health care agencies. A \"health care worker\" is an individual assigned by a health care employer to handle patients, including direct-care registered nurses, independent contractors, or those performing health care duties. A \"lift team\" consists of health care workers trained in safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention practices."
