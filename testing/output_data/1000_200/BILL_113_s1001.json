    "content": "The \"Iran Export Embargo Act\" is cited as the short title. The Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 is amended to impose sanctions on the government of Iran. Congress finds that the Government of Iran violates human rights and sponsors terrorism worldwide, including recent attacks in Bulgaria, Washington, DC, and other countries. The Government of Iran violates UN Security Council Resolutions by refusing to suspend nuclear activities and developing ballistic missiles. They also transfer arms to terrorist groups in Lebanon. The Government of Iran continues to support terrorist groups in Lebanon and Gaza, as well as the Syrian government in committing human rights abuses. The President is required to block all transactions involving individuals described in the Act and impose restrictions on certain transactions. The President must prohibit foreign financial institutions from opening or maintaining accounts in the US if they have knowingly conducted significant transactions with Iran after a specified date. Sanctions will be imposed on individuals who import, purchase, or transfer goods from Iran after the same date under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President will impose sanctions on individuals who knowingly import, purchase, or transfer goods or services from specified persons after a certain date. Sanctions will also be imposed on those who provide underwriting services, insurance, or reinsurance to these persons. Sanctions may be imposed on individuals providing underwriting services or insurance if they do not ensure they are not dealing with entities related to the Government of Iran. Sanctions can be imposed on individuals acting directly or indirectly for the Government of Iran. The President can also designate other persons for sanctions. The rule of construction states that sanctions apply regardless of public listing. Sanctions also apply to the export of crude oil from Iran."
