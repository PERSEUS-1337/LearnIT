    "content": "The House and Senate approved conference agreements on defense bills in FY1999, with additional funding of $8.3 billion for various defense-related purposes. The President signed both bills into law on October 17, and an omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 was approved on October 20 and 21. The annual defense appropriations bill, signed into law on October 21 (P.L. 105-277), allocated funds for various defense-related purposes including intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The majority of the funding is for programs administered by the Department of Defense. The defense appropriations bill allocates funds for defense-related purposes, including intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The bill also provides funds for national defense activities of various agencies, with the Department of Defense receiving the majority of the funding. The Administration's FY1999 budget included $270.6 billion for the national defense budget function, of which $250.8 billion was requested in the defense appropriations bill. Congress also acts on a national defense authorization bill annually, which addresses defense programs in detail. The authorization bill addresses defense programs in detail, similar to the defense appropriations bill. Congressional debate on major defense policy and funding issues mainly occurs during action on the authorization bill. Congress completed action on the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills on October 1. House and Senate 302(b) allocations were approved in May. The House Appropriations Committee approved initial allocations of funds to its subcommittees, with final allocations determining budget authority for defense and other programs. The Senate allocated $250.290 billion for defense, slightly below the Administration's request, while the House allocated $250.499 billion for national security. Military construction allocations were above the request. The House allocations provide $250.499 billion in budget authority and $244.965 billion in outlays for the national security subcommittee. The House approved the FY1999 defense authorization bill, H.R. 3616, on May 21, while the Senate passed its version, S. 2057, on June 25. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization. The Senate passed the FY1999 defense authorization bill on June 25 (P.L. 105-261) after floor action in May and June. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization bill on September 17, with the House and Senate approving it in late September and early October. The House passed the FY1999 national security appropriations bill on June 24, while the Senate marked up its version in early June. The Senate passed the FY1999 defense authorization bill on June 25 (P.L. 105-261) after floor action in May and June. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization bill on September 17, with the House and Senate approving it in late September and early October. The House passed the FY1999 national security appropriations bill on June 24, while the Senate marked up its version in early June. The Senate marked up its version of the FY1999 defense appropriations bill, and the full committee completed its markup and ordered the bill, S. 2132, to be reported on June 4. The full Senate considered the bill, substituted its text into the text of H.R. 4103, and passed H.R. 4103, as amended, on July 30. FY1999 defense appropriations conference report: Conferees announced agreement on the FY1999 defense appropriations bill on September 22. The House approved the conference report on September 28, and the Senate on September 29. The President signed the bill into law (P.L. 105-262) on October 17. FY1999 congressional budget resolution: On April 2, the Senate approved S.Con.Res. 86, its version of the annual congressional budget resolution, which sets targets for budget authority and outlays for the overall national defense budget function. The House approved its version, H.Con.Res. 284, on June 5. A conference agreement on the resolution was never completed. Supplemental defense. The House and Senate approved a conference agreement on H.R. 3579 for supplemental defense appropriations for FY1998, providing funding for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, disaster relief, and other defense programs. The bill, signed into law as P.L. 105-174, allocates $2.7 billion for the Defense Department, including specific amounts for Bosnia, Southwest Asia, disaster relief, and other defense programs. Defense-related supplemental appropriations for FY1999 were approved by the House and Senate, providing $8.3 billion in additional funding. This includes allocations for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, defense health program, purchase of fissile materials from Russia, defense antiterrorism activities, and other defense programs. The FY1999 defense-related supplemental appropriations approved by the House and Senate include $8.3 billion for various defense programs, such as Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, health program, purchase of fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism activities, and other programs. The bill also includes rescissions of $67 million and addresses issues like relations with China regarding satellite and missile technology exports. The House approved amendments to limit satellite and missile technology exports to China, despite objections from the White House. The Senate-passed bill included statements on China but dropped contentious amendments. The authorization conference agreed to remove a ban on satellite exports to China but included provisions transferring technology export review to the State Department and requiring congressional notification for satellite sales to China. The conference agreement includes provisions on satellite sales to China, prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certain conditions are met, and banning the transfer of port facilities to a Chinese shipping company. The Senate's amendment condemning forced abortions in China was not included in the final appropriations agreement. The appropriations conference agreement does not include measures to deny visas to individuals involved in forced sterilization or genital mutilation. It includes a prohibition on DOD doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies and requires a report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. Base closures were not approved in the House or Senate authorization bills, and an amendment to make it harder for the Defense Department to realign military bases was dropped in the conference agreement. The House-passed authorization bill required the Army, Navy, and Air Force to address social issues. Sen. Inhofe agreed to drop the provision regarding COSCO in exchange for the House-passed provision. The Senate and House had differing views on separating men and women in basic training, with the Senate ultimately endorsing a substitute that allows current integrated training practices to continue with additional steps for separating sleeping quarters. The conference adopted the Senate language but included a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate policies. The House-Senate authorization conference adopted Senate language on social issues, including a requirement for commanders to display exemplary behavior. Both chambers rejected amendments to lift the ban on abortions in military medical facilities. The House bill included a measure to prohibit the DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors, potentially requiring new facilities in South Carolina. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would cost about $3 billion over the next forty years to buy tritium from commercial sources and $10 billion to buy it from new facilities. The Senate-passed authorization bill included a provision allowing DOE to choose the long-term option, but implementation is prohibited for a year to allow Congress to review the decision. The authorization conference report agrees to the Administration's proposed reductions in active duty end-strength levels. The Senate versions of the appropriations bill agreed to the Administration's proposed reductions in end-strength. The authorization conference report also agreed. There was a debate over the military pay raise, with the House initially proposing 3.6% and the Senate proposing 3.1%. Eventually, a 3.6% raise was agreed upon. Additionally, $1.9 billion was requested for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide a 3.6% raise. The Administration requested $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding. The Senate approved the funding, while the House included a provision to cap Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion. Both houses rejected measures to require the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Bosnia by a specific date. The authorization conference agreement authorizes $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, with the possibility of larger expenditures if deemed necessary for national security. The appropriations conference agreement did not include emergency funding for Bosnia, but it was later provided in a supplemental appropriations measure. Contentious weapons issues were minimal, with the Administration requesting one C-130J aircraft. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill included contentious weapons issues, such as funding for additional C-130J aircraft and the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provided funds for more aircraft than requested, while reducing funding for THAAD due to a recent test failure. The Administration wanted to maintain funding for THAAD but agreed to restructure the program. The Senate bills also reduced or eliminated funding for other weapons programs. The Senate authorization and appropriations bills cut funding for Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system MEADS and Airborne Laser (ABL) program, while increasing funding for Space-Based Laser (SBL) R&D. The authorization conference agreement follows the Senate's decisions, with the appropriations conference agreement providing slightly more funding for ABL. The appropriations conference agreement provides funding for ABL and new aircraft carrier development, with the Navy opting for progressive changes in current design. The authorization conference agreement allocates funds for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship, despite criticism of pork barrel politics. The authorization conference agreement provides funding for new aircraft procurement, including 30 F-18s and one F-16. The Administration objected to certain requirements in the Senate bill, but the authorization conference included them with the option to waive. Some cuts in Department of Energy weapons programs were made to finance increases in other areas. The authorization conference agreement includes funding for new aircraft procurement, with cuts in Department of Energy weapons programs. Long-term weapons issues have been resolved, including the battle over B-2 bomber procurement and the design competition in the New Attack Submarine program. Both House and Senate bills took steps to ensure military retirees have access to the defense health care system. The authorization conference agreement includes pilot projects to test FEHBP for retirees, using TRICARE as a supplement for Medicare and providing access to TRICARE pharmacy benefits. Key matters discussed in the defense debate include military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology export controls, military readiness, defense modernization funding, personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, and major weapons programs. The defense debate in Congress for FY1999 was constrained by budget agreements, with key issues including defense modernization funding, military personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues like sexual harassment, and military health care policy. The debate was described as a \"zero-sum game\" due to budget constraints. The defense debate in Congress for FY1999 was constrained by budget agreements, with key issues including defense modernization funding, military personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues like sexual harassment, and military health care policy. Congress provided an additional $8.3 billion for defense programs as part of the omnibus appropriations bill, representing a sharp break with past practices. The FY1999 defense debate in Congress focused on adding funds for neglected programs and cutting high priority ones. Senior Administration officials aimed to meet Congress halfway on ongoing interests, fully funding missile defense and increasing funding for National Guard and Reserve equipment. The debate did not result in major conflicts in the House and Senate actions on defense authorization and appropriations bills. Some money was allocated for unrequested weapons programs and other priorities. The FY1999 defense debate in Congress did not result in major conflicts in House and Senate actions on defense authorization and appropriations bills. Some money was allocated for unrequested weapons programs and other priorities, with $1 billion added for ballistic missile defense. The debate was influenced by the Quadrennial Defense Review, Defense Reform Initiative report, and National Defense Panel report from the previous year. The Defense Reform Initiative and National Defense Panel reports highlighted key themes for ongoing discussion in Congress, including a revised U.S. defense strategy, the need to prevail in two major theater wars, and measures to address challenges from smaller-scale contingency operations. Both reports emphasized the importance of efficiency to save money for weapons modernization. The QDR, Defense Reform Initiative, and National Defense Panel reports all emphasized the need for increased efficiency to save money for weapons modernization. They endorsed two more rounds of military base closures and called for a greater emphasis on homeland defense and preparing for future threats. The Panel suggested less focus on preparing for two major theater wars and more on future readiness, recommending an additional $5 to $10 billion annually for experimental force exercises and new technology. The Defense Department recommended two more rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs. Congress was initially unreceptive but Secretary Cohen made it a priority. Previous base closure rounds are projected to save $5.6 billion annually starting in FY2000. The Defense Department projects annual savings of $2.8 billion from two future base closure rounds, crucial for funding weapons programs. Resistance in Congress stems from objections to the 1995 base closure round actions. The White House proposed privatizing two Air Force aircraft depot maintenance facilities instead of closing them. The White House developed a plan to \"privatize in place\" at two Air Force maintenance facilities, allowing private contractors to bid for contracts. This plan has been implemented, leading to competition for contracts and better prices. However, many Members of Congress believe the plan politicized the base closure process, causing disputes and complaints about ensuring public facilities receive adequate work. Secretary Cohen and other officials faced criticism in congressional hearings. In response to concerns about privatization eroding support for base closures, Secretary Cohen suggested Congress could include a prohibition on privatization in future legislation. He also urged Congress to approve more base closures to prepare for the long-term defense plan. However, neither the House nor the Senate agreed to additional closures in the FY1999 defense authorization. The SASC rejected a proposal by Senators McCain and Levin to approve one. The Senate rejected a proposal for additional base closures in the FY1999 defense authorization. Senator Inhofe's amendment to make it harder for DOD to realign facilities without a base closure process was dropped. The Administration requested $1.8 billion for extending the U.S. mission in Bosnia. The Administration requested $1.8 billion for extending the U.S. mission in Bosnia in FY1998 and an additional $1.9 billion for FY1999. Congress approved the FY1998 funding in H.R. 3579 and the FY1999 funding in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328). The funding for Bosnia was designated as \"emergency\" appropriations to raise caps on defense discretionary spending. The FY1998 and FY1999 funding for Bosnia was designated as \"emergency\" appropriations to raise caps on defense discretionary spending. This proposal was contentious as it broke the precedent of including anticipated costs of ongoing military operations within regular defense appropriations measures. The Administration argued that Bosnia costs were not assumed in defense plans at the time the 1997 budget agreement was reached. If Congress did not agree to designate the Bosnia funding as emergency appropriations, the costs would have to be offset by cuts in other programs. In FY1999, Congress approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia as emergency appropriations, with an additional $100 million available for emergencies to protect U.S. troops. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia operations. In FY1999, Congress approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia as emergency appropriations, with an additional $100 million available for emergencies to protect U.S. troops. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia operations. The Senate approved an amendment urging the President to reduce U.S. troop levels in Bosnia, but rejected an amendment to cut off funds without Congressional approval. Senator Stevens proposed an amendment to provide $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations for Bosnia. The Senate added an amendment proposed by Senator Stevens to provide $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations for Bosnia. The House-passed appropriations bill included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval. The White House threatened a veto if this provision was included. The authorization conference agreement approves the funding but requires certification from the President for additional expenditures. The appropriations conference agreement allows expenditure of more than provided if certified by the President for national security without reducing readiness. Emergency funding for Bosnia was not included, leaving it for later consideration. The Skaggs amendment was dropped. $1.9 billion emergency funding for Bosnia was in the FY1999 Omnibus appropriations bill. Congressional focus on relations with China, technology exports controls, and nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. House approved amendments to defense authorization. The House approved amendments to the defense authorization bill to restrict technology exports to China and other countries, including limitations on missile and satellite technology exports. The White House strongly objected to these measures, which also included provisions on nuclear technology exports and the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. The Senate rejected a motion to table China-related amendments by Senator Hutchinson, leading to a delay in debate on China policy. Senator Stevens delayed floor action on the defense appropriations bill due to concerns about contentious amendments. Ultimately, the Senate considered various China-related issues, with Senator Hutchinson offering a revised amendment requiring the State Department to deny visas to foreign individuals. The Senate considered various China-related issues, with Senator Hutchinson offering a revised amendment requiring the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions, sterilization, or genital mutilation. The authorization conference agreement includes provisions on technology exports to China, requiring advanced congressional notification of satellite sales and prohibiting export of missile equipment unless certain conditions are met. The conference agreement includes provisions on technology exports to China, requiring advanced congressional notification of satellite sales and prohibiting export of missile equipment unless certain conditions are met. Other efficiency measures recommended include staff reductions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military service headquarters, cuts in civilian and military personnel, and pursuit of public-private competitions for activities carried out by civilian DOD employees. The Defense Department has faced pressure from Congress to reduce overhead activities and civilian personnel levels. Congress is debating whether cuts in OSD and headquarters personnel are substantial, if deeper cuts are necessary, and how to respond to privatization measures. The House has pushed for significant reductions in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration have sought to moderate these measures. The House and Senate are in disagreement over acquisition personnel cuts and privatization measures in the Defense Department. The House proposed significant reductions, while the Senate and Administration aim to moderate these measures. Congressional action includes urging the Defense Department to comply with personnel cuts and imposing a $500 million cut in funding for consultants. The White House objected to these cuts, citing restrictions on DOD's efficiency pursuits. The House-passed authorization bill includes measures to withhold funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, cut acquisition personnel, reduce consultant spending, and decrease Assistant Secretary of Defense positions. Congressional focus on military readiness highlights issues such as shortages in spare aircraft engines, lowered Army recruitment standards, personnel skill gaps, and declining pilot retention rates in the Air Force and Navy. The House-passed authorization bill addresses military readiness concerns, including shortages in spare aircraft engines, lowered Army recruitment standards, personnel skill gaps, and declining pilot retention rates in the Air Force and Navy. Administration officials deny an imminent readiness crisis, attributing reported problems to anecdotes that do not accurately reflect the overall state of the force. They maintain that early deploying units remain fully ready, while some later deploying units may require more time to prepare. Officials deny an imminent readiness crisis, attributing reported problems to anecdotes. Overall readiness reports show a highly qualified and capable force. Efforts are underway to fix issues such as Air Force engine spares shortage and pilot retention. Concerns about personnel recruitment and retention have been expressed by senior military officers. On September 15, the President met with senior military officers who identified serious readiness problems and called for higher defense spending. The Joint Chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on September 28, highlighting a need for over $17 billion annually in additional defense spending. Congressional actions included restructuring funding for maintenance and making changes to readiness reporting, with the Senate approving an amendment on the defense appropriations bill. The Senate approved amendments on the defense appropriations bill to require reports on food stamp use by military families and to address declining budgets affecting readiness. The authorization conference agreement includes measures for improved readiness reporting, increased troop benefits, and funding for quality of life measures like day care centers and housing. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill allocates $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness and does not make changes to military retirement benefits. There are concerns about long-term funding for defense modernization, as funding for weapons procurement has been reallocated to operation and maintenance accounts. The requested level of procurement funding in the FY1999 budget is $48.7 billion, which is similar to the previous year. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001, but achieving this goal without increasing overall defense spending is challenging. Efficiency savings, like base closure, are expected to help reach the target. Defense officials acknowledge the challenge of meeting the $60 billion procurement target by applying efficiency savings. Under Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler stated that reaching the target is becoming harder. Congressional bills do not include substantial increases in modernization funding. The QDR mandated cuts in military personnel levels. The QDR mandated a cut of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions by 2003, mainly from support activities. Congress has shown resistance to personnel cuts, citing strains on active duty forces from contingency operations and forward presence abroad. The Army faces shortages in certain skills, relying on reservists for major conflicts but facing burdens in smaller-scale operations. The Administration requested a reduction of over 35,000 active duty personnel from the authorized FY1998 level, but Congress rejected repealing statutory floors on end-strength. HNSC agreed to reduce authorized end-strength by 11,000 fewer positions than requested. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) approved the requested end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. The House and Senate versions of the defense appropriations bill assumed the cuts in end-strength for FY1999. The National Guard and reserve issues arose after a dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of combat units. Congress approved a measure requiring the appointment of Guard combat units in war plans. The Defense Department has requested more money for Guard and reserve weapons procurement, while the Army Chief of Staff is working to ease disputes with ARNG leaders. Congress has consistently added funds for Guard and reserve weapons programs and has tried to protect Guard units. Congress has added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces, with disputes over major weapons programs, including Missile defense programs for NMD and TMD. The Administration increased funding for NMD programs, but major policy disputes remain unresolved. The Administration is pursuing NMD technology development while deferring deployment decisions. Missile defense advocates in Congress push for early nationwide defense deployment, viewing the ABM Treaty as outdated. Disputes over TMD systems like THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS persist. THAAD and Navy Theater-Wide face delays, with the Administration prioritizing THAAD development. MEADS is a cooperative program with Europe. MEADS, a cooperative program with European allies, aims to improve air/missile defense for troops. Congressional action includes consideration of separate legislation for missile defense policy, with the Senate failing to invoke cloture on a bill for nationwide defense deployment. On May 13 and September 9, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on a bill for defense funding. Congress approved additional funding for TMD programs in March and included funding in the FY1998 supplemental bill. The House-passed FY1999 authorization included extra funds for Navy Area Defense and other TMD systems. The Senate approved a cut of $253.9 million for the THAAD program due to delays in engineering development after its fifth test failure. The Senate approved an amendment to cut $253.9 million from the THAAD program due to delays in engineering development. The House also restructured the program, requiring DOD to select a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting $142.7 million from engineering to technology development. MEADS funding was reduced to $10 million, and funding for NMD was not added. SASC criticized the Air Force ABL program and cut funding by $97 million, while increasing funding for Space-Based Laser R&D by $94 million. The Senate appropriations bill cut funding for the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program by $97 million and increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D by $94 million. Additionally, the Senate added $10 million to the TMD budget for boost phase intercept technology and endorsed accelerated development of the Navy Theater Wide TMD system as an alternative to THAAD. The authorization conference reduced funding for THAAD by $294 million and MEADS by $19 million to $24 million, prohibiting further MEADS expenditures until included in long-term defense budget plans. The agreement also followed Senate increases in the Space Based Laser program and cut funding for the Airborne Laser by $57 million. The appropriations conference agreement cuts funding for THAAD by $376 million, reduces MEADS to $10 million, and cuts the Airborne Laser by $25 million. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes an additional $1 billion for missile defense with no specific allocation of funds indicated. An independent commission mandated by Congress recommended against producing more B-2 bombers due to cost concerns. The independent commission recommended against producing more B-2 bombers due to cost concerns. Congress did not add money for more B-2 bombers in this year's defense bills, potentially marking the end of the B-2 battle. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development and production: the Navy F/A-18E/F, the Air Force F-22, and the Joint Strike Fighter program. Funding has been requested for these programs in FY1999. The QDR recommended continuing all three fighter aircraft programs, albeit with reductions. Congress debated the affordability of purchasing all three programs, with concerns about the cost of the F-22 in the Senate. Congressional actions included reducing F/A-18E/F procurement and imposing requirements on the F-22's flight testing before further funding. The authorization bill included funds for 30 F-18s and allowed a waiver for the F-22 flight test requirement. Congress has added funds to shipbuilding programs in recent years to avoid production gaps and ensure shipyards have enough work. The procurement of the CVN-77 aircraft carrier has been moved up to the FY2001 budget. The Navy has moved up the planned procurement of CVN-77 to the FY2001 budget, avoiding a big bill in FY1999 and FY2000. Newport News Shipbuilding had proposed the \"Smart Buy\" approach to save the Navy $600 million on the ship's price. The development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer involves a teaming arrangement between Ingalls Shipbuilding Company and Bath Iron Works. The Navy has reached agreements with shipbuilders and combat system integrators to form two teams for competition in combat systems and design. Plans for a new-design aircraft carrier, known as the \"CVX,\" have been abandoned in favor of incremental improvements to the next three Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval has been granted for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for one New Attack Submarine (NSSN). This marks the end of a debate over mandating competition between shipbuilders. The Administration's shipbuilding program has been approved, including funding for one New Attack Submarine (NSSN). The debate over mandating competition between shipbuilders has ended. Additionally, there is a new issue regarding the allocation of money for carrier R&D. Following reports that the Navy will not pursue a new design for the CVX, there is a debate on how to allocate money for carrier R&D. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $130 million reduction in CVX R&D funding and a $50 million increase for CVN-77 upgrades. The House Appropriations bill cut $100 million for the CVX. The authorization conference agreement provides $110 million for CVX R&D, while the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million. Additionally, there were no funds requested in the FY1999 budget for additional F-16 purchases. The House authorization added $66 million for 2 F-16s and advance procurement funds for 2 additional JSTARS aircraft. The House authorization added $66 million for 2 F-16s, advance procurement funds for 2 additional JSTARS aircraft, $300 million for National Guard and Reserve equipment, $60 million for two F-16s, $120 million for Guard and Reserve equipment, $461 million for 8 C-130s. SASC provided $72 million for JSTARS, funded 4 additional C-130s, and added $60 million for Guard and Reserve procurement. SAC funded 3 additional C-130s and provided $247 million for Guard and Reserve procurement. The authorization conference agreement provides funds for 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, advance procurement funds for JSTARS, and $60 million for miscellaneous Guard and Reserve equipment in addition to regular line items for equipment supplied to the Guard and Reserve. Rep. Obey's amendment in the HAC markup aimed to eliminate funds for 4 C-130s to restore F/A-18E/F procurement and upgrade existing C-130s. He criticized the increase in C-130J program funding, stating it came at the expense of more valuable programs like the F/A-18E/F. The National Defense Panel criticized planned procurement of weapons that may not be effective against future threats. They recommended reducing or terminating \"legacy\" programs and focusing on advanced technologies like lighter land equipment, longer-range fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility. Specific programs criticized include the Army M1A2 tank upgrade, Crusader artillery, Comanche helicopter, Navy and Air Force F/A-18E/F. The National Defense Panel criticized various military programs, including the Army M1A2 tank upgrade, Crusader artillery, Comanche helicopter, Navy and Air Force F/A-18E/F, and the Navy CVN-77 aircraft carrier. Some Members of Congress have raised questions about legacy systems, but few have proposed specific changes. Congressional action includes requiring a Quadrennial Defense Review at the start of each new administration and ordering a review of the Army's Crusader artillery program. Social issues like sexual harassment and gender-integrated training are also debated in annual defense funding bills. The report on Crusader addresses social issues such as sexual harassment and gender-integrated training in the military. The focus is on the outcome of sexual harassment cases and recommendations for improvement, including separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training. The Marine Corps has followed recommendations for greater gender separation in training, while the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services disagreed. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on changes, with no alterations made. The HNSC version of the authorization bill included a provision for separate units and barracks for men and women in basic training, but no floor action was taken on the issue. The House did not allow floor amendments to reverse HNSC requirements, leading to no floor action. SASC prohibited changes to current service practices until a commission report. The Senate approved a substitute allowing current practices, leading to a disagreement with the House on gender-integrated training. The authorization conference agreement allows current unit training practices to continue but requires separation of sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. The House and Senate are discussing defense health care issues, including Tricare effectiveness and health care benefits for military retirees. Congress is evaluating Tricare and testing a Medicare subvention program. HNSC and SASC are ensuring military retirees have access to health care. The House and Senate are discussing defense health care issues, including Tricare effectiveness and health care benefits for military retirees. Congressional action includes establishing demonstration projects to test alternative means of providing healthcare to retirees, allowing retirees to enroll in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP), providing Tricare benefits as a supplement to Medicare, and offering Tricare pharmacy benefits. Defense appropriations bills have earmarked funds for various medical programs. Defense appropriations bills have earmarked funds for various medical programs, including bone marrow transplants, breast cancer and prostate cancer research. The Senate version of the bill set aside $250 million for medical R&D earmarks, while the House bill included separate amounts for medical earmarks. The appropriations conference agreement provides separate funds for medical programs, following the Senate approach on some programs. The House Appropriations Committee added $1.6 billion in emergency appropriations to help the Defense Department and the Treasury Department fix their computers for the Year 2000 computer problems. Rep. Obey criticized this as an increase in the defense budget, but the funding was not removed. The House Republican caucus later decided not to provide emergency funding for the \"Y2K\" problem. The Neumann amendment to remove $1.6 billion in emergency funding for Y2K was rejected. The House Republican caucus decided not to provide emergency funding for the Y2K problem, and the defense appropriations bill removed the $1.6 billion in emergency funding. The issue of emergency funding for Bosnia and Y2K was left to be addressed in a separate supplemental appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill provides $1.1 billion for the Defense Department for Y2K conversion and $2.4 billion for other agencies. The defense authorization bill approves funding for Department of Energy weapons-related activities. The defense appropriations bill does not provide funds for DOE, instead, all DOE funding is in the energy and water development appropriations bill. A key issue in the defense authorization bill concerns tritium production for DOE nuclear weapons programs. The House-passed bill prohibits DOE from buying tritium from commercial sources, leading to the need for new facilities in South Carolina. The cost estimates for tritium acquisition range from $3 billion from commercial sources to $10 billion from new facilities. The Senate bill allows DOE to choose its preferred long-term option. The Senate-passed authorization bill allows DOE to choose its preferred long-term option for tritium production, costing up to $10 billion for new facilities. Senator Kyl has objected to a provision delaying implementation for a year, citing the urgency for DOE to pursue a new tritium source. The Senate and House approved resolutions revising the congressional budget for fiscal years 1998-2003. Additionally, an emergency bill for natural disaster recovery and peacekeeping efforts was reported by the Committee on Appropriations. The Senate and House approved resolutions revising the congressional budget for fiscal years 1998-2003.
