    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Medicare Reimbursement Demonstration Act of 1997\" establishes a demonstration project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will jointly conduct a three-year demonstration project starting on January 1, 1998. The project involves providing reimbursement from the Medicare program for health care services to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in VA facilities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to waive certain Medicare requirements for this project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs designates geographic service areas for facilities to participate in a demonstration project. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, establishes a plan for facility selection within designated service areas. The Secretary designates geographic service areas for facilities to participate in a project. The selection plan favors facilities suited to serve targeted medicare-eligible individuals based on demand, capability, quality of care, and other relevant factors. The demonstration project allows voluntary participation of targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in selected facilities near closed military medical bases. These facilities must meet specific criteria outlined in the plan. The demonstration project allows voluntary participation of targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in selected facilities near closed military medical bases. Participation is subject to facility capacity and funding limitations. Cost-sharing requirements for veterans will be the same as those for Medicare-eligible patients at non-governmental facilities. Payments received will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. The determination of reimbursement amounts for the demonstration project involving Medicare-eligible veterans in selected facilities near closed military medical bases will be based on cost-sharing requirements similar to those for Medicare-eligible patients at non-governmental facilities. Payments received will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services provided under the demonstration project at a rate equal to 95 percent of regular Medicare payment rates. Payments will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Department of Veterans Affairs for services provided under the demonstration project at a rate equal to 95 percent of regular Medicare payment rates. Payments will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds, with an annual limit of $50,000,000. Failure to maintain VA effort may result in a reduction in payment. The payment amounts under this section for the project may be reduced if the actual VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans are less than the maintenance of effort level for the fiscal year. Maintenance of effort levels is determined annually. The maintenance of effort level for VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans is determined annually and may be adjusted based on the percentage change in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The maintenance of effort level for VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans is determined annually and may be adjusted based on changes in medical care appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs. This adjustment considers decreases in VA medical expenditures resulting from a lower rate of increase in health care costs and reduced priority in service delivery to targeted medicare-eligible veterans. The VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans are determined annually and may be adjusted based on changes in medical care appropriations. This includes expenditures for hospital care and medical services provided to targeted medicare-eligible veterans under chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code. The VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans under chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code do not include expenditures for medical examinations or services reimbursed under a demonstration project. The Secretaries will monitor the impact on costs to the Medicare program for targeted medicare-eligible veterans during a demonstration project period. The Comptroller General will audit the costs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Medicare program to determine any increase during the fiscal year as a result of the demonstration project. If costs increase, the Secretaries must respond accordingly. If Medicare program costs increase due to a demonstration project, the Secretaries must recoup the amount and prevent future increases. The Secretary must recoup increased Medicare program costs by using funds from the Department of Veterans Affairs and may suspend or terminate demonstration projects. SEC. 4. EVALUATION AND REPORTS. An independent entity will evaluate the health services demonstration project annually and submit reports to the Secretaries and Congress by March 1 each year. The reports will assess the cost to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the quality of care provided by participating facilities. The evaluation of the health services demonstration project includes assessing compliance with quality measures, comparing costs and reimbursements, determining savings or costs to the Medicare program, evaluating changes in access to care and quality of care for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans, and examining the project's impact on access to care for veterans not participating in the project. The Secretaries will submit a report to Congress regarding the extension and expansion of the demonstration project, including recommendations on whether to make it permanent, expand to additional sites, and modify terms if extended. Additionally, a recommendation concerning a new demonstration project for payment to managed health-care plans is due by March 1, 1999. The Secretaries will submit a report to Congress by March 1, 1999, on the feasibility of a new demonstration project to reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care services provided to targeted medicare-eligible veterans in managed health-care plans.
