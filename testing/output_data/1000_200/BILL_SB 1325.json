    "title": "SB 1325",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 25247 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require the department to review and approve plans submitted under Section 25246 if they comply with regulations and state/federal laws. Approval may be delayed until certain conditions are met, including approval under the Water Code or if immediate approval is necessary for public health or safety. The director may approve a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan if it is necessary for public health, safety, or the environment. The department can impose plan requirements through enforcement orders, agreements, or permits, in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. Before approving or modifying a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan, the department must allow public involvement, including notice and comment opportunities. The department determines a \"significant modification\" as a class 3 permit modification based on similarity to Appendix I of Chapter 20 of the California Code of Regulations. Public concern and complexity also influence this determination. The department can order necessary actions at a facility to protect public health or safety, regardless of any limitations in place. If the department issues a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan through an enforcement order or agreement instead of a permit, the owner must pay a specified fee or enter a cost reimbursement agreement. The fee must be paid at the start of the postclosure period. The department may enforce a postclosure plan through various actions, including filing an injunction, requiring corrective actions, and assessing civil penalties for violations. This does not apply to plans with permits issued before December 31, 2003, unless mutually replaced with an enforcement order or agreement. The department must adopt regulations by January 1, 2018, for postclosure plan requirements. If needed, a postclosure permit can replace an enforcement order or agreement. The department retains authority to order actions for public health or safety. The department reviews and approves plans submitted under Section 25246 if they comply with regulations and state/federal laws. Approval is delayed until certain conditions are met, such as approval under Water Code Section 13227 or if immediate approval is necessary for public health or safety. The director may approve a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan immediately if it is necessary to protect public health, safety, or the environment. Any department action taken is subject to Section 25204.5 and must comply with the California Environmental Quality Act. Before approving or modifying a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan, the department must allow public involvement, including notice and comment opportunities. A \"significant modification\" for a hazardous waste facility permit is determined by the department based on criteria outlined in regulations. This includes considering the similarity to class 3 modifications and assessing public concern and complexity of the proposed change. The department has the authority to order actions to protect public health or safety at a facility. If a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan is imposed as an enforcement order, the owner must enter into a cost reimbursement agreement and pay the required fee at the commencement of the postclosure period. The department has the authority to enforce postclosure plans through various actions, including injunctions, corrective measures, and penalties for violations. This does not apply to plans with permits issued before December 31, 2003, unless mutually replaced with an enforcement order or agreement. The department must adopt regulations by January 1, 2018, for postclosure plan requirements. If needed, a postclosure permit can replace an enforcement order or agreement. The department retains authority to order actions for public health or environmental protection. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to Section 25247 of the Health and Safety Code, contingent on the enactment of Assembly Bill 1611 or Senate Bill 839 by January 1, 2017. The amended section will only be operative after this bill is enacted last among the bills amending Section 25247."
