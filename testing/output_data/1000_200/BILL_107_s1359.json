    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act.\" Congress finds that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets to deploy advanced technologies nationwide. The Act recognized the unique position of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, enabling them to accelerate the deployment of advanced services in less populated regions. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will enable them to deploy advanced services and compete in less populated regions, benefiting consumers. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and promote competition in the telecommunications industry for the benefit of consumers nationwide. It reduces regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to respond to market conditions and redirect resources to initiatives. The Act aims to reduce regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers to improve flexibility and redirect resources to initiatives. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a 'two percent carrier' as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Regulatory relief is provided for these carriers in Title II of the Act. SEC. 4. REGULATORY RELIEF FOR TWO PERCENT CARRIERS. Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to provide reduced regulatory requirements for 'two percent carriers'. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. If the Commission fails to do so, the rule cannot be enforced on two percent carriers until a separate evaluation is conducted. This does not apply if the rules adopted do not pertain to two percent carriers. The Commission is not required to conduct a separate evaluation if rules adopted do not apply to two percent carriers. Differentiation based on carrier size is allowed by law. These provisions apply to rules adopted after the enactment of this section. SEC. 282 limits reporting requirements for two percent carriers, exempting them from filing cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports, except for section 224 compliance. SEC. 283 addresses the integrated operation of two percent carriers. SEC. 283 states that the Commission cannot require a two percent carrier to have a separate affiliate for various services. This includes local and long-distance services, mobile radio, internet, and other enhanced services. Additionally, the Commission cannot mandate separate operations for two percent carriers and their affiliates. The text discusses the participation of a two percent carrier in a common line tariff administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. It states that the carrier can choose to participate or withdraw from the tariff for specific study areas, with a binding election for one year. Additionally, the carrier can elect to be regulated under price cap rate regulation for its study areas. The Commission allows a two percent carrier to participate in or withdraw from a common line tariff for specific study areas. The carrier can also choose to be regulated under price cap rate regulation for its study areas, with the election being binding for one year. The Commission permits two percent carriers to deploy new interstate telecommunications services with one day's notice, without needing approval for rate structures. These services must be previously unavailable options for ratepayers. Additionally, competing carriers can enter the market under specific regulations. Two percent carriers can adjust interstate rates quickly and file tariffs with one day's notice if a competitor enters their service area. They must compute their rate of return based on the nondiscounted rate for the service. Additionally, streamlined pricing regulation allows carriers to introduce new interstate services without prior approval, as long as they were not previously available to customers. The Commission will regulate a two percent carrier as non-dominant and not require tariffing of their interstate service offerings if a local exchange carrier is engaged in facilities-based entry within the two percent carrier's service area. Additionally, the two percent carrier can participate in the common line tariff without meeting certain requirements. The two percent carrier can participate in the common line tariff by including its study areas in the tariff. Definitions for facilities-based entry and contract-based tariff are provided in this section. A tariff is a service contract between a carrier and customers, including contract terms, service descriptions, volume commitments, prices, discounts, and regulations. The curr_chunk provides a general description of classifications, practices, and regulations affecting the contract rate, including the definition of 'service area' as in section 214(e)(5). SEC. 287. SAVINGS PROVISIONS. This section clarifies that the Commission's authority, rural telephone company rights, and state authority are not restricted or diminished by the provisions in this part. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON MERGER REVIEW. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 sets a deadline of 60 days for the Commission to make public interest determinations for mergers involving two percent carriers. The Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 establishes a 60-day deadline for the Commission to approve or deny applications for mergers or acquisitions involving two percent carriers. If no action is taken within the specified period, the application is automatically approved without conditions. Additionally, two percent carriers can elect to apply certain provisions to local exchange facilities acquired through mergers or acquisitions subject to the review deadline. The provisions of this section apply to applications submitted to the Commission after the date of enactment. Pending applications will be subject to these requirements as if filed on the enactment date. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in relief being deemed granted. The Commission must issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days, with relief deemed granted if no action is taken within this period. Any order issued or grant of a petition for waiver is final and can be appealed. These provisions apply to petitions submitted on or after the enactment of this Act. Petitions for waiver submitted to the Commission after the enactment of this Act must adhere to the requirements of this section. Pending petitions for reconsideration or waiver will also be subject to these requirements as if filed on the enactment date. SEC. 7. NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONS. Executive Branch agencies can request an extension on the 60-day or 90-day time period for petitions or applications under sections 310 or 405 of the Communications Act if national security, law enforcement, or public safety concerns are involved."
