    "title": "SB 1480",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to be filed by February 15 each year with the assessor. The assessor cannot approve a property tax exemption claim without a valid organizational clearance certificate. Financial statements are only required if requested in writing. The assessor must review all claims to ensure they meet the requirements of Sections 214 and 215.1 for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions, respectively. Any capital investment for plant expansion must be justified by expected returns and serve community interests. Property claimed for exemption must be used for exempt activities and not exceed what is necessary. The assessor can audit to verify compliance with requirements. A welfare exemption claim can be denied even with an organizational clearance certificate. The assessor may deny a claim for the welfare exemption on a property, even if the claimant has an organizational clearance certificate. If the assessor determines the property is ineligible for the exemption, the claimant will be notified in writing and can seek a refund of property taxes through the county or file a refund action in superior court. If the claimant's refund claim with the county is denied, they can file a refund action in superior court. An applicant granted a welfare exemption does not need to reapply in subsequent years if there are no changes to the exempted property and it is used exclusively by a governmental entity or nonprofit corporation. The applicant must notify the assessor by February 15 if they become ineligible for the exemption or if the property no longer meets the requirements. The assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application, detailing circumstances that may make the property ineligible for exemption. The notice also explains the process to maintain eligibility for the welfare exemption and warns of potential verification by the assessor if eligibility is not reaffirmed. If a welfare exemption or veterans\u2019 organization exemption on the property is found to be incorrectly granted, the assessor will reassess eligibility and cancel the exemption if necessary. Any incorrectly allowed exemption will result in an escape assessment with interest and a penalty for failure to notify the assessor. The board reviews the assessor's administration of welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Counties can request a review, equalization, or adjustment of property assessments by applying in writing to the board before November 30. If an exemption is incorrectly granted, the assessor will reassess eligibility and cancel it, leading to an escape assessment with interest and penalties. Every application for relief must be filed with the assessor and the board will provide notice and a hearing. Failure to file timely will result in the applicant being barred from relief under Section 11 of Article XIII. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow for the retention of excess proceeds in the delinquent tax sale trust fund. Unclaimed excess proceeds may be transferred to the county general fund after a specified period, with deductions for certain costs."
