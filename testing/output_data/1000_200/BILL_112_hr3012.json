    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2011\" imposes a numerical limitation on visas from any single foreign state. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to make changes to visa allocation and numerical limitations for foreign states. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to change visa allocation and numerical limitations for foreign states under section 203(a). If the total number of immigrant visas for natives of a single foreign state exceeds the limit in subsection (a)(2), visa numbers will be allocated in a manner to ensure equal distribution among different categories. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to change visa allocation and numerical limitations for foreign states under section 203(a). The amendments include country-specific offsets and transition rules for employment-based immigrants, with an effective date of September 30, 2011, applying to fiscal years starting in 2012. For fiscal years 2012 and 2013, a percentage of immigrant visas under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act will be allotted to immigrants from foreign states not among the top two states in terms of visa recipients in 2010. For fiscal years 2013 and 2014, 10 percent of immigrant visas under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act will be allocated to immigrants from foreign states not among the top two states in terms of visa recipients in the previous fiscal year. In fiscal year 2012, immigrant visas were allocated to natives of foreign states based on per-country levels, with limits on the number of visas per state or dependent area. Unreserved visas under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act were also distributed accordingly. In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, 85 percent of immigrant visas allotted to natives of any single foreign state under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Unused visas may be issued without restrictions to prevent visa wastage. Chargeability rules from section 202(b) apply in determining the foreign state for visa allocation. In determining the foreign state for visa allocation, chargeability rules from section 202(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act apply. The House of Representatives passed the bill on November 29, 2011. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
