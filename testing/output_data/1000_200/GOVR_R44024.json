    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options. Congress has added titles and amended TSCA, but the core program remains unchanged. Bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process. Since its enactment in 1976, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) has seen few amendments to its core program under Title I. Bills introduced since 2005 aimed to revise the chemical evaluation process, but none were enacted due to ongoing legislative debate. With an increasing number of chemicals entering the market and evolving scientific understanding of chemical risks, proponents argue that the current regulatory framework is not adequately protective of public health and the environment. Proponents argue that the current regulatory framework under TSCA is not sufficiently protective of public health and the environment. States have enacted statutes to address chemical concerns not covered by EPA, leading to potential differences in regulations among states for the same chemicals. Manufacturers argue that compliance with varying state regulations is inefficient for interstate commerce. Supporters of state regulations believe states can pioneer alternative approaches to protect citizens. States can lead the way in trying alternative approaches to protect their citizens, including non-governmental programs like labeling products as \"sustainable\" or \"non-toxic.\" Bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress to amend Title I of TSCA, such as the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697). This report tracks the legislative status of these bills and discusses selected issues without providing a comprehensive analysis of all provisions. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725) were introduced in the 114th Congress. Senate EPW held hearings and marked up amendments for S. 697, which was reported out of the committee for Senate floor consideration. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced a discussion draft called the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015. The House discussion draft of the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015 was forwarded to the full House Committee on Energy and Commerce for consideration after being approved by the subcommittee. H.R. 2576, based on the House discussion draft, was introduced and approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce with technical amendments. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce approved bill H.R. 2576 with technical amendments on a 47-0 vote. The House passed the bill on a 398-1 vote. Key debated issues include prioritizing chemical substances for risk evaluation, EPA's authority to restrict substances, preemption of state laws, and disclosure of information to EPA. This report compares approaches among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 in amending Title I of TSCA to address key issues such as the preemption of state laws, disclosure of information to EPA, and available resources for EPA. EPA has discretion in evaluating chemical risks under the current TSCA, with no mandate to review or evaluate chemicals. The selection criteria for evaluating chemicals is a perennial issue due to limited resources. The EPA evaluates risks of chemical substances reported under TSCA, with over 83,000 substances in total. In 2012, 1,200 substances were identified for evaluation based on prioritization criteria, leading to 90 substances prioritized for risk assessment. Of these, five have been assessed, with three found to present risks. Manufacturers must submit PMNs for new chemicals under Section 5 of TSCA. EPA assesses risks of chemical substances under TSCA, with 90 prioritized for evaluation. Manufacturers submit PMNs for new chemicals, allowing EPA to evaluate risks and determine regulation. Over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 exemption applications were received from 1979 to 2010. Proposed bills would prioritize existing chemicals for risk evaluation. EPA has discretion to evaluate identified chemicals under H.R. 2576. H.R. 2576 and Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725 propose different criteria for evaluating chemicals, prioritizing substances based on various factors, conducting risk-based safety evaluations, and taking regulatory action. All bills address the prioritization of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances. The bills S. 697 and H.R. 2576 propose a process for manufacturers to request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation, with varying deadlines for evaluation and regulatory actions. EPA would have discretion under S. 697, while H.R. 2576 requires evaluation for substances where costs are paid. The bills S. 697 and H.R. 2576 propose a process for manufacturers to request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation, with varying deadlines for regulatory actions. Under S. 697, EPA would be required to designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and begin safety assessment within five years. Safety assessments must be completed within three years after designation as high priority, with a rule promulgated within two years after a negative safety determination. The procedures proposed by S. 725 are comparable to S. 697, with tighter deadlines and differing conditions for prioritization and assessment. H.R. 2576 sets tighter deadlines for risk evaluations compared to S. 697 and S. 725. It requires EPA to initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year and does not limit manufacturer requests, as long as they pay for the evaluation. Unlike S. 697 and S. 725, H.R. 2576 does not amend TSCA Section 5 for new chemical substances and significant new uses. H.R. 2576 establishes a process for EPA to review notices and information from manufacturers and processors regarding new chemicals. EPA must make a determination within 90 days of receiving a PMN on whether regulatory action is needed for new chemicals. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it will undergo prioritization, safety assessment, and safety measures. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it will be subject to prioritization, safety assessment, and safety determination procedures as proposed by S. 697 and S. 725. The current TSCA regulation is based on whether the chemical poses an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment, which some argue is difficult for the EPA to prove. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA is challenging for the EPA to demonstrate and is open to interpretation. The criteria for determining regulatory control over certain substances under TSCA are unclear, leading to debates on amending the regulatory threshold. The standard has been interpreted as a multi-factor balancing test by the Fifth Circuit in the Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA case, emphasizing the consideration of costs in regulatory actions. The Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs adequately under the \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA, questioning the $200-$300 million cost to save seven lives over thirteen years. This standard requires a balance of costs and benefits in regulatory decisions. S. 697 would establish a statutory definition for the term \"safety standard\" under TSCA, focusing on the \"conditions of use\" of a chemical substance to attain the safety standard and including \"potentially exposed or susceptible populations\" in risk evaluation. It would also prohibit the consideration of \"cost and other nonrisk factors\" in assessing chemical risks. S. 697 and S. 725 would establish safety standards for evaluating chemical risks, with a focus on potential harm to human health and the environment without considering cost or non-risk factors. In contrast, H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard. H.R. 2576 does not define a safety standard for evaluating chemical risks but retains the language of regulatory thresholds based on unreasonable risk in current TSCA. It adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting the consideration of costs or non-risk factors in decision-making. Title I of TSCA acknowledges the balance between costs and benefits in regulatory controls for chemical risks. EPA is directed to implement the least burdensome requirement to protect against unreasonable risks, considering factors like costs and availability of alternatives. Regulatory requirements can range from bans to notifications of risks to distributors. Some argue that EPA's choice must adequately protect from risks while being the least burdensome. In Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, the Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA must show that each less burdensome requirement would not adequately protect against unreasonable risks to reject it in favor of a more burdensome one. This imposes an additional standard on EPA beyond cost-benefit analysis. The Fifth Circuit ruled in Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA that EPA must demonstrate that a less burdensome requirement would not sufficiently protect against unreasonable risks before imposing a more stringent one. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 propose to remove the least burdensome regulatory option requirement for restricting chemical substances. Instead, they suggest choosing a regulatory option deemed \"necessary\" to meet safety standards, considering factors like costs and alternative regulations. H.R. 2576 specifically aims to ensure rules adequately protect against risks, including those to potentially exposed subpopulations, and be cost-effective as determined by EPA. The bills S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 propose to remove the least burdensome regulatory option requirement for restricting chemical substances. They would require EPA to consider cost-effectiveness in promulgating restrictions, with provisions for exemptions based on national security, economic disruption, or critical use without feasible alternatives. EPA could grant \"critical use exemptions\" if a requirement is not cost-effective and the specific use is deemed critical. EPA may grant \"critical use exemptions\" for specific uses of a chemical if it's not cost-effective and is critical for national security or economy. Exemptions are initially for five years and can be renewed if requirements are met. EPA relies on scientific information to evaluate risks of chemical substances. Section 8 of TSCA allows EPA to require reporting and record-keeping of information on chemicals by manufacturers, processors, and distributors to evaluate risks. If risks are unknown, Section 4 mandates EPA to require testing if the chemical may present unreasonable risks or if substantial quantities are produced that may enter the environment or lead to significant human exposures. EPA has mandated additional testing for over 200 chemicals. EPA has required additional testing for over 200 chemical substances to assess risks of chemicals. There are concerns about limits on EPA's authority under TSCA to require new information on health and environmental effects, leading to delays and costs for developing necessary information. The development of new information on chemical substances can be time-consuming and costly. Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725 would give EPA discretion to require testing if deemed necessary, while H.R. 2576 would still require certain findings for testing under TSCA Section 4. All three bills authorize EPA to require new information through rulemaking, orders, or testing consent agreements. The Senate bills aim to amend procedures for requiring the development of new information on chemical substances, emphasizing EPA's role in minimizing animal testing. TSCA preemption remains a complex issue, with conflicting state laws needing to yield to Congress's powers. EPA has a primary role in managing chemicals, but states still have some regulatory authority. The TSCA preemption gives EPA a primary role in managing chemicals but allows states some regulatory authority under certain circumstances. States may be preempted from taking action if EPA has already addressed a similar risk, but exceptions exist for state requirements that are not duplicative of federal laws. States can enforce identical federal requirements, regulate disposal, and prohibit the use of chemicals within their borders. Advocates for broader federal preemption in TSCA amendments argue that a national regulatory framework can protect against chemical risks by preventing conflicting state regulations, reducing compliance costs, and avoiding economic impacts on industry supply chains. Opponents believe states should have the flexibility to implement more stringent regulations to ensure safety. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption and the state-federal relationship in chemical management, allowing states to implement stricter regulations to protect citizens. States could act without preemption if EPA had not taken action on a chemical, but the bill would change the criteria for preemption, scope of state laws affected, and waiver provisions. States would be prohibited from restricting chemicals that meet EPA safety standards. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption, allowing states to implement stricter regulations to protect citizens. States could act without preemption if EPA had not taken action on a chemical. States would be prohibited from restricting chemicals that meet EPA safety standards. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption, allowing states to implement stricter regulations to protect citizens. States could act without preemption if EPA had not taken action on a chemical. Certain state actions taken before August 1, 2015, and past or future state actions under the authority of state laws that were in effect as of August 31, 2003, would not be subject to preemption. S. 697 would modify TSCA preemption, allowing states to implement stricter regulations to protect citizens. States could act without preemption if EPA had not taken action on a chemical. Certain state actions taken before August 1, 2015, and past or future state actions under the authority of state laws that were in effect as of August 31, 2003, would not be subject to preemption. S. 697 would also add savings clauses clarifying that common law or statutory causes of action, private remedies, or evidentiary or other authorities of courts would not be affected. States could apply for waivers based on concerns about a chemical supported by peer-reviewed science, and EPA would have to grant such waivers if requirements were met. Waivers would also be automatically granted if EPA failed to make a decision within 90 days or missed the deadline for a safety determination on the chemical. H.R. 2576 would make smaller changes to TSCA preemption compared to S. 725. States could enforce different regulations for chemicals unless EPA had deemed a chemical safe. Preemption would apply to state laws protecting against exposure to chemicals deemed safe by EPA. TSCA's preemption of state requirements for chemicals would generally be maintained based on EPA risk management actions. H.R. 2576 would maintain TSCA's preemption of state requirements for chemicals based on EPA risk management actions, aligning preemption with the risk evaluation process under amended Section 6. State prohibitions on chemical use would not be exempt from preemption. The bill also includes language allowing states to enforce identical requirements to EPA with penalties and sanctions. Past state actions before August 2015 and actions under state laws in effect as of 2003 would not be preempted. Additionally, savings clauses would preserve common law causes of action in civil actions. The bills aim to add savings clauses for common law causes of action in civil cases under tort or contract law. TSCA mandates chemical companies to provide EPA with information on their chemicals, including structures and safety data. Balancing public access to chemical information with protecting competitive data is a key concern in amending TSCA. Section 14 of TSCA prohibits disclosure of information considered trade secrets or confidential under FOIA. Under TSCA, certain information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA as trade secrets or confidential data. Wrongful disclosure is a criminal act, with exceptions for health and safety studies. EPA can disclose protected information if necessary to protect health or the environment. Under TSCA, EPA can disclose protected information if necessary to protect health or the environment against an unreasonable risk of injury. To obtain CBI protection, the submitter only needs to designate the information as CBI. EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims since 2010. The EPA has increased its review of confidentiality claims since 2010, particularly regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has initiated the \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" to encourage industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims and enhance public access to non-confidential information. The three proposed bills aim to maintain TSCA's framework for protecting information under the FOIA trade secrets exemption but would also allow EPA to disclose CBI in additional circumstances, such as in response to requests from state, local, or tribal officials for enforcement purposes, environmental releases, or healthcare professionals for patient diagnoses and treatments. The Senate bills propose extensive revisions to Section 14 of TSCA, with detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and more review requirements for EPA. They outline categories of information presumed protected from disclosure, including chemical identity before commercial distribution. H.R. 2576 would protect chemical identities in health and safety studies. All bills require submitters to substantiate and resubstantiate their claims every 10 years. The bills aim to protect the confidentiality of chemicals' identities in health and safety studies by requiring submitters to substantiate and resubstantiate their claims every 10 years. H.R. 2576 specifically limits substantiation requirements to claims made after enactment and requires EPA to notify submitters before the expiration date of their confidentiality claims. Congress faces the decision of funding EPA's activities under TSCA through discretionary appropriations or establishing dedicated sources of funding. Under Section 29 of TSCA, appropriations for Title I were authorized through FY1983, and Congress has continued to fund EPA's implementation of TSCA through annual appropriations. Section 26(b) of TSCA authorizes EPA to assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors, with a maximum fee of $2,500 for certain actions. EPA's authority to collect fees does not have a sunset date. Section 26(b) of TSCA allows EPA to assess fees on manufacturers, importers, or processors for new chemical uses, with a maximum fee of $100 for small businesses. These fees are deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury and are subject to annual appropriations. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under TSCA Section 29. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 address the authorization of appropriations under TSCA. S. 697 proposes collecting fees for submissions to EPA, with a cap of $18 million, contingent on discretionary appropriations. The bill S. 697 proposes capping the total amount collected for fees at $18 million, with the funds being used to evaluate submissions of information to the EPA. Additionally, H.R. 2576 would authorize the EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for risk evaluations of chemical substances, without a statutory limit on the amount collected per submission. The EPA may collect fees to defray costs in administering TSCA. Bills like S. 697, H.R. 2576, and S. 725 propose eliminating the current limit on fees per notice submission. They would establish a fund for fee receipts, with fees set at a level to enable the agency to perform its responsibilities. S. 725 does not establish a dedicated account for fee collection, with funds deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. The Congressional Budget Office has provided cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576."
