The \"Close the Revolving Door Act of 2014\" may impose a lifetime ban on former members of Congress from lobbying after leaving office. The \"Close the Revolving Door Act of 2014\" imposes a lifetime ban on former members of Congress from lobbying. Any employee of Congress who violates this ban will be punished according to section 216 of the title. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to section 207(e)(2) of title 18, United States Code. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL STAFF amended to increase from \"1 year\" to \"6 years\". SEC. 4. IMPROVED REPORTING OF LOBBYISTS' ACTIVITIES by creating a joint lobbyist disclosure Internet database. SEC. 5. LOBBYIST REVOLVING DOOR TO CONGRESS. Any person who is a registered lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal cannot be hired by a Member or committee of Congress within 6 years of leaving that position if substantial lobbying contact occurred. A waiver can be granted by the Committee on Ethics or the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct based on a compelling national need. Lobbying contacts related to pending legislative business are considered substantial. When considering hiring a former lobbyist, it is important to assess if their lobbying activities were related to pending legislative matters or solicitation of federal funding, especially if they involved coordinating meetings, making presentations, or participating in fundraising beyond personal contributions. Social interactions alone with members of Congress or their staff do not qualify as substantial lobbying contacts. SEC. 6A. REPORTING BY SUBSTANTIAL LOBBYING ENTITIES. Substantial lobbying entities must annually report to the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the United States Senate any employees or individuals under contract who are former members of Congress or congressional staff with specific criteria. The filing required by this section mandates a brief job description and work experience explanation for employees, contractors, or consultants in specific roles. The Joint Web site lobbyists.gov will have a searchable database for 'Substantial Lobbying Entities' including qualifying individuals. Entities' that qualify as substantial lobbying entities must provide filings to the District of Columbia United States Attorney for oversight of their lobbying activities. A substantial lobbying entity is defined as an incorporated entity with more than 3 federally registered lobbyists. SEC. 7 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 is amended to increase penalties from $200,000 to $500,000."
