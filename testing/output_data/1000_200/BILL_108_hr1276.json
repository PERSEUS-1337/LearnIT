The Secretary may grant assistance to low-income families for homeownership through downpayment assistance for single-family housing. Eligible families must be low-income and first-time homebuyers or include a uniformed employee. The Secretary provides downpayment assistance for low-income families, including uniformed employees or teachers, with income not exceeding 115% of the limit set in section 215(b)(2). The Secretary provides downpayment assistance for low-income families, with income limits not exceeding 115% of the median income of the area, or 150% in high-cost areas. To be eligible for a grant, participating jurisdictions must include a housing affordability strategy in their comprehensive plan. For a fiscal year, participating jurisdictions must include in their housing affordability strategy a description of grant use, a plan for outreach to residents of public housing, trailer parks, and manufactured housing for downpayment assistance, and actions to ensure suitability for homeownership.

The formula may include minimum allocation amounts and factors like funding from various programs and State/local governments. The funding allocation for homeownership assistance is based on uniform, verifiable, and accurate data by State and local governments.
