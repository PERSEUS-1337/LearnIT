The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms Congress's goal for NASA to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with international partners, as outlined in the 2010 Authorization Act. The National Academy of Sciences reviewed human spaceflight goals and capabilities, publishing findings in a 2014 report. The Committee on Human Spaceflight reviewed goals and capabilities of human space flight, publishing findings in a 2014 report titled \"Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration\". Key rationales for human space exploration include economic benefits, national security, national prestige, inspiring students, scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared destiny. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended Mars as the long-term goal for human space flight, urging NASA to define sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and technology development to place humans on the surface of Mars. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended Mars as the long-term goal for human space flight, urging NASA to define sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and technology development to place humans on the surface of Mars. SEC. 3. HUMAN EXPLORATION STRATEGY. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include human exploration of Mars as a goal, with a strategy to achieve this objective. The strategy outlined involves utilizing cis-lunar space for missions to various destinations, including Mars, with the use of specific capabilities provided under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of lunar orbits, asteroids, Mars, moons of Mars, and other destinations for future human exploration. It also highlights the benefits of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space for economic, scientific, and technological advances, as well as opportunities for collaboration with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies. Additionally, it mentions the opportunities provided by the International Space Station for supporting high priority scientific research and technological advancements. The curr_chunk discusses exploration mission architectures for missions in cis-lunar space and beyond, including capabilities for the Orion crew capsule and the Space Launch System. It compares architectures based on factors like cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, and international collaboration opportunities. The curr_chunk focuses on the importance of exploring mission architectures that enable new markets, scientific discovery, technological excellence, competitiveness, and national security considerations. It emphasizes the need for flexibility to adapt to evolving technologies, partners, priorities, and budget constraints. The curr_chunk discusses measures for crew health and safety, including radiation exposure limits, urgent medical care, and crew training needs for missions. The curr_chunk outlines the necessary capabilities, prioritization plan, assessment of recommendations, and technical information needed for missions identified in the previous paragraph regarding crew health and safety measures. The Administrator will arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to review and comment on each interim report of the strategy, identifying agreed-upon matters and issues raised in the report. The Administrator will ensure timely review and comment by the National Academy of Sciences on interim reports, including raising concerns and making recommendations as appropriate. The Administrator will submit interim and final reports to the National Academy of Sciences for review and comment on the strategy required by the Act. The Administrator must submit final reports to Congress on the strategy required by the Act, incorporating the response of the National Academy of Sciences. Reports are due one year after the enactment of the Act and every five years thereafter."
