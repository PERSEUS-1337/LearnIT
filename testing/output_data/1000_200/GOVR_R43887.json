    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA), enacted in 1965, provides social services for individuals aged 60 and older, including nutrition services, caregiver support, employment programs, and abuse prevention. Most programs are administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) in the Department of Health and Human Services, except for Title V which is overseen by the Department of Labor. The Older Americans Act (OAA) provides social services for individuals aged 60 and older. Title V is overseen by the Department of Labor, while other programs are administered by the Administration on Aging in the Department of Health and Human Services. OAA has been reauthorized and amended multiple times, with the last reauthorization in 2006. Funding for OAA programs is provided through annual appropriations from HHS and DOL. The report discusses funding for OAA-authorized programs and activities, including an overview of FY2015 funding, a breakdown of current-year funding, funding history since FY2001, legislative activity in FY2015, and funding decisions for selected programs. Appendixes provide detailed funding information and history. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, a slight increase from FY2014. Title III programs received the largest proportion of funding, with 70.7% allocated to nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion activities. Title V, the CSEOA Program, received 23.1% of the funding. In FY2015, OAA funding was allocated to various programs, with Title V receiving the largest share. Two exceptions were Aging Network Support Activities and Elder Rights Support Activities, which received new funding for specific initiatives. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002, and remained relatively flat through FY2006. Annual increases in OAA program funding occurred from FY2006 to FY2010, with funding levels remaining below FY2010 levels since then. OAA funding increased steadily from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010, an overall increase of 31% over this time period. Additional funding was provided in FY2009 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Funding declined in FY2011 through FY2013. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs declined from FY2011 to FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. The reduction in funding from FY2012 to FY2013 is mainly due to sequestration. However, funding for FY2014 and FY2015 was slightly above the FY2013 level but below the FY2012 level. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, providing $1.878 billion in FY2015 funding for OAA programs. The FY2015 appropriations law reflected the new consolidated ACL account structure, providing funding for aging and disability services programs administered by ACL. Prior to P.L. 113-235, FY2015 discretionary funding for OAA programs was provided through three continuing resolutions. The FY2015 appropriations law funded aging and disability services programs through ACL. Continuing resolutions provided temporary funding for Labor-HHS-Education programs, including OAA programs, at FY2014 levels with a slight reduction. H.R. 5464 proposed increased funding for OAA Title V (CSEOA) in FY2015. The Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 proposed funding increases for OAA Title V (CSEOA) and OAA Title III senior nutrition programs. The bill did not specify funding for other OAA programs. The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill with funding for OAA programs at $1.871 billion, similar to FY2014 levels, except for increases in family caregiver funding under Title III. The bill proposed funding increases for OAA programs relative to FY2014 levels, with exceptions for family caregiver funding and the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. A new Elder Justice Initiative was also proposed with $10.0 million in funding. President Obama's FY2015 budget request suggested $1.819 billion for OAA programs, with most programs funded at FY2014 levels except for new mandatory funding for Aging and Disability Resource Centers. The FY2015 budget proposed funding increases for OAA programs, with exceptions for family caregiver funding and the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. It included new mandatory funding for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, discretionary funding for the CSEOA Program, a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and the White House Conference on Aging. Additionally, it requested funding for an Elder Justice Initiative and proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL. The FY2015 budget proposed funding increases for OAA programs, including new mandatory funding for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, discretionary funding for the CSEOA Program, a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and the White House Conference on Aging. It also suggested transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL, citing benefits of integration with other aging services programs. The proposed funding for FY2015 was $380.0 million, 13% less than FY2014, with 56 state and territorial grantees operating CSEOA programs. Of these, 17 are in state labor departments, while the rest are in aging, senior services, or health and human services departments. The transfer to ACL aimed to consolidate Federal oversight and align with ACL's mission of helping older Americans maintain independence and active community participation. The transfer of the CSEOA program to ACL would consolidate Federal oversight and align with ACL's mission of helping older Americans maintain independence and active community participation. This transfer would require legislation from Congress to take effect. ACL aims to target the program to those with the greatest need, consider all sources of income for eligibility, and allocate funds to areas with the potential for the largest impact. ACL proposed restructuring CSEOA as a community service program, stating that it did not fit well in the Workforce Investment Act framework. The Senate bill would have funded CSEOA at the FY2014 level, while H.R. 5464 would have funded it under the DOL account at $448.3 million. Final FY2015-enacted funding made no changes to the CSEOA program. The CSEOA program remains funded and administered under DOL for FY2015 with the same appropriations as in FY2014. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund to provide supportive services for survivors. The Senate and H.R. 5464 bills did not allocate funding for the Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund due to budget constraints. However, FY2015 included $2.5 million in new discretionary funding to support aging Holocaust survivors. Aging and Disability Resource Centers aim to provide a one-stop shop for information on long-term services and supports. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) offer counseling on LTSS options, access to Medicaid and VA programs, discharge planning, and care transition services. There are over 500 ADRC sites nationwide with 5.2 million client contacts in FY2012. ADRCs received $10 million in mandatory funding under ACA and $6.1 million in discretionary funding in FY2014. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no discretionary funding for ADRCs. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no FY2015 discretionary funding for ADRCs, but suggested $20.0 million each year for five years in renewed mandatory funding. The Senate bill would have provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs and urged ACL to improve coordination among ADRCs, Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), and Centers for Independent Living (CILs). The White House Conferences on Aging have historically focused on concerns of older individuals and provided guidance to policymakers. The first conference was held in 1961, with subsequent conferences in 1971, 1981, 1995, and 2005. The FY2015 funding for ADRCs remained at $6.1 million, not meeting the President's request for additional mandatory funding. The White House Conference on Aging has been held periodically since 1961, with the next one planned for 2015 in Washington, DC. Funding for the conference was not specified in the FY2015 budget, leading to potential limitations on its scale and scope. The 2015 White House Conference on Aging in Washington, DC will utilize technology to engage more people. It will commemorate the anniversaries of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act, focusing on retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services, and elder justice. Regional forums and listening sessions will gather input for the conference. For more information, visit http://www.whitehouseconferenceonaging.gov.
