    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes federal funding for children with disabilities, requiring the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and detailed due process provisions. The act, enacted in 1975, was a response to the need to educate children with disabilities. Attorneys' fees provisions were added in 1986 and amended in 1997 under P.L. 105-17, allowing for fee reduction if specific information is not provided to the LEA in a timely manner. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization made changes to attorneys' fees provisions, aligning more closely with the Senate bill which kept the general framework of previous laws. The amendments allowed attorneys' fees for state educational matters and made additions to the previous provisions. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization aligned with the Senate bill on attorneys' fees provisions, allowing fees for state educational matters and adding provisions for complaints, appeals, and due process hearings. Attorneys' fees may be awarded to prevailing parties, including parents of children with disabilities. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows for the award of reasonable attorneys' fees to prevailing parties, including parents of children with disabilities. Attorneys' fees can also be awarded against a parent's attorney in certain situations, such as filing a frivolous complaint or litigating for an improper purpose. Senator Grassley highlighted the importance of the attorneys' fees amendment during the Senate debate. Senator Grassley and Senator Gregg emphasized the need for the attorneys' fee amendment in the Senate debate, stating that it would prevent unnecessary delays and costs in litigation, ensuring taxpayer dollars go towards educating children rather than lining the pockets of unscrupulous trial lawyers. They highlighted the importance of allowing defendants to obtain attorneys' fees when a plaintiff's actions are deemed frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. The Supreme Court's decision in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC established that prevailing defendants can recover attorneys' fees if a plaintiff's actions are frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. Senator Gregg noted that this standard is rarely met, and courts consider the plaintiff's financial resources when awarding fees to defendants. The provision also allows for fee recovery if lawsuits are brought for an improper purpose, drawing from Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The provision allows defendants to recover attorneys' fees if lawsuits are brought for an improper purpose, based on Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fees are based on prevailing community rates, with specific prohibitions and restrictions on fee awards. Fees may not be awarded for services performed after a written settlement offer under certain circumstances. The 2004 reauthorization added a requirement for a \"resolution session\" prior to a due process hearing, involving parents, IEP team members, and LEA representatives. Attorneys' fees are not allowable for the resolution session. An award of attorneys' fees may be made to a prevailing parent if substantially justified. The previous law, P.L. 108-446, allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded to a prevailing parent if they were substantially justified in rejecting a settlement offer. Fees may be reduced if the parent unreasonably prolonged the resolution, exceeded prevailing hourly rates, provided excessive legal services, or failed to provide necessary information in the due process complaint. The final regulations for P.L. 108-446, issued on August 14, 2006, state that attorneys' fees may be reduced if the SEA or LEA unreasonably delayed the resolution of the action or violated the section. The Department of Education declined to provide further guidance on the interpretation of the statutory language. The Department of Education declined to provide further guidance on the interpretation of statutory language regarding attorneys' fees, stating that judicial interpretations will vary based on case-by-case factual determinations. They also noted that non-attorney advocates are not entitled to compensation as attorneys, and explicit language authorizing recovery of experts' fees by prevailing parents was not included in the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA did not include explicit language authorizing recovery of experts' fees by prevailing parents, as noted by the Department of Education. The Supreme Court's rationale on fees of non-attorney experts was found to be controlling, and the Department of Education declined to add a regulatory provision on the subject."
