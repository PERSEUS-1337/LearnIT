SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. Section 56(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include an exception for certain medical research stock transfers regarding the treatment of incentive stock options. The term 'medical research stock transfer' refers to the transfer of stock traded on an established securities market or acquired through the exercise of an incentive stock option in the same taxable year, and is a medical research contribution. The amendment allows for the transfer of medical research stock to be treated as meeting certain requirements for nonrecognition of incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code. This applies to transfers made after the enactment of the Act."
