    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Engineering Biology Research and Development Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that cellular and molecular processes can be utilized to develop new products, improve societal well-being, and strengthen national security. Engineering biology requires diverse skills and long-term research for breakthroughs, necessitating government investment. The Federal Government can support the advancement of engineering biology through the development of tools and technologies. The United States risks losing its competitive edge in engineering biology without necessary investment and a national strategy. A National Engineering Biology Initiative can drive research, technology goals, coordination, and technology transfer for optimal returns on Federal investment. The Act defines key terms such as \"Advisory Committee,\" \"biomanufacturing,\" \"engineering biology,\" \"Interagency Committee,\" and \"Program\" for the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program is established under SEC. 4. The President will implement a National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity. This includes advancing research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences, supporting social science research, expanding the number of researchers with engineering biology training, accelerating commercialization of research by the private sector, and improving interagency coordination of Federal activities related to engineering biology. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity by supporting engineering biology research and development. This includes grants to investigators, joint projects by multiple agencies, and interdisciplinary research centers. Education and training for undergraduate and graduate students are also key components of the Program. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program focuses on technology development, education, tracking economic benefits, and accelerating commercialization through research opportunities and partnerships. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to connect researchers, students, and postdocs with entrepreneurship education, support proof of concept activities, and promote startup formation. It also focuses on expanding participation by reaching out to undergraduate and minority-serving institutions and encouraging research collaborations. Additionally, the program addresses ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues. The program aims to address ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology by supporting research in these areas and ensuring wide dissemination of results. The program aims to address ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology by supporting research and ensuring public input through mechanisms like citizen panels and consensus conferences. The President will designate an interagency committee on engineering biology, including representatives from various agencies. The Interagency Committee, chaired by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, oversees federal engineering biology research, sets goals, and updates a strategic plan every 5 years to guide the Program's activities. The Program's strategic plan includes support for interdisciplinary engineering biology research, education, outreach, societal issues, and moving results into application for societal benefit and competitiveness. An interagency budget proposal is also required for the Program's maintenance. The Program's strategic plan includes interdisciplinary engineering biology research, education, outreach, societal issues, and application for societal benefit and competitiveness. An interagency budget proposal is required for maintenance, along with utilizing Federal programs for support. Advisory Committee recommendations, workshop results, existing reports, and views are considered in carrying out responsibilities. The Interagency Committee prepares an annual report for Congress, detailing the Program budget, spending breakdown for agencies, and assessment of Federal agencies' implementation. The annual report for Congress includes details on the Program budget, spending breakdown for agencies, assessment of Federal agencies' implementation, and Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer awards. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The President shall designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development with at least 12 members from various sectors to assess the progress, balance of activities and funding, Program priorities, and societal issues. The Advisory Committee on engineering biology research and development will assess the Program's activities, address ethical and societal issues, and report findings and recommendations every 3 years to the President and relevant committees. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to this Committee. SEC. 6. EXTERNAL REVIEW OF ETHICAL, LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIETAL ISSUES. The Director of the National Science Foundation will convene a workshop with the National Academies to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research. A report summarizing the findings will be transmitted to Congress within 2 years. The National Science Foundation will convene a workshop with the National Academies to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research. A summary report containing the findings will be transmitted to Congress. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITIES. The National Science Foundation supports basic research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences, research on environmental and social effects of engineering biology, provides instrumentation support, and awards grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The Department of Commerce establishes a bioscience research program as part of the Program. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish a bioscience research program to develop standard reference materials, provide access to advanced facilities, and offer technical expertise for engineering biology. The Department of Energy, as part of the Program, will conduct and support basic research and development. The Department of Energy will conduct research in engineering biology disciplines such as synthetic biology and biofuel development. They will also provide access to advanced facilities for research and testing. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct basic and applied research as part of the Program. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct basic and applied research in engineering biology fields, including synthetic biology, related to Earth and space sciences, aeronautics, space technology, and space exploration. They will also award grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to conduct research in an industry setting. The Environmental Protection Agency will support research on how engineering biology products, processes, and systems will impact the environment."
