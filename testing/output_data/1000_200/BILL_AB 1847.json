The Legislature amended Section 19851 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to address the low participation rate in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit program. In 2015, California authorized a state EITC to help the poorest working Californians. In 2015, California authorized a state EITC to amplify the poverty-reducing effects of the federal EITC for the poorest working Californians. The state aims to alleviate the tax burden on working poor individuals and families, enhance their wages and income, ensure access to federal and state EITC, and inject additional federal money into the California economy. The intent is to provide cost-effective assistance to eligible taxpayers. The act aims to provide cost-effective assistance to eligible taxpayers by ensuring notices from employers and state agencies, and promoting the claiming of federal and state EITC. Definitions for terms like \"employer,\" \"employee,\" and \"Federal EITC\" are clarified in the Revenue and Taxation Code. The act defines terms like \"Federal EITC\" and \"California EITC\" as specific tax credits. It also outlines state departments and agencies that serve those eligible for these credits, such as the State Department of Education and the Employment Development Department. Amendments to this section apply to notices required under Section 19853. Section 19853 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require employers to notify employees about eligibility for Federal and California EITC when providing annual wage summaries like Form W-2 or Form 1099. State departments and agencies must notify program recipients annually about potential eligibility for federal and California EITC, either between January and April or during regular contact. Communication can be done through various means, including telephone, mail, electronic communication, or in-person. Indirect communication through other entities serving eligible individuals is also encouraged. Effective methods for notifying recipients should be developed. State departments and agencies are encouraged to develop effective methods to notify recipients of federal and California EITC eligibility, ensuring the notice contains the same language as specified in Section 19854. The employer must provide notification directly to the employee or by mail, including instructions on obtaining IRS and Franchise Tax Board notices. Posting on a bulletin board or sending through office mail does not satisfy the notification requirement, but is encouraged for informing all employees about federal and California EITC. The amendments to Section 19854 of the Revenue and Taxation Code apply to notices provided after the effective date of the act. The notice to employees must include information on the availability of federal and California EITC. Based on your annual earnings, you may be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) from the federal government. The EITC is a refundable federal income tax credit for low-income working individuals and families. It does not affect certain welfare benefits. You must file a federal tax return to receive the EITC, even if you do not owe federal taxes. Contact the Internal Revenue Service for more information on eligibility and how to obtain necessary forms. The California Earned Income Tax Credit (California EITC) is available starting from the 2015 tax year for low-income working individuals and families. To claim the California EITC, you must file a California income tax return and complete the California EITC form (FTB 3514). Contact the Franchise Tax Board for more information on eligibility and how to obtain the necessary forms. Amendments to this section apply to notices furnished after the effective date of the act."
