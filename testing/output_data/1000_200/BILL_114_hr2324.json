The term \"land\" refers to land within the National Forest System, excluding land managed by the Forest Service in certain designated areas. The term \"public lands\" includes various designated areas such as national scenic areas, research natural areas, national landmarks, wilderness areas, and more, as defined in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.

The selection of parcels for conveyance is also discussed. The Regional Forester with jurisdiction over National Forest System land in a specific Forest Service Region selects eligible Federal lands parcels for conveyance either in response to a request from an adjacent landholder or upon recommendation from the Bureau of Land Management or National Forest System. Adjacent landholders can request conveyance through a process created by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior will establish a process for adjacent landholders to request purchasing eligible Federal lands parcels. The process must align with existing public purchase request procedures of the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. It will be accessible to the public online within 90 days of the Act's enactment.

If a parcel of National Forest System land or public lands covered by an adjacent landholder request fails to meet the criteria for eligible Federal lands parcel, the concerned Director or Regional Forester must provide the landowner with a written explanation detailing the reasons for rejection, including which elements of the definition the parcel fails to satisfy and the potential impact of continued administration by the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service on the parcel and surrounding economy. The Federal Government may reject a request for an eligible Federal lands parcel if it does not meet the criteria, with reasons for rejection provided. The parcel size is limited to 160 acres unless approved for more by the Director or Regional Forester. Each adjacent landholder can only acquire one parcel.

Offers that do not meet the minimum consideration required can be rejected, with the opportunity for appeal. Compliance with local planning and zoning is a condition for conveyance of these parcels. When selling eligible public lands parcels that border non-Federal land, compliance with local land use ordinances and zoning plans is required.

An appeals process is available if a request for selection of a parcel is rejected by the Director or Regional Forester. The Regional Forester or Director shall provide an appeals process for reconsideration of rejected requests or offers for conveyance of National Forest System land or public lands.
