    "content": "The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" is cited as the short title. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is made regarding a credit for biodiesel used as fuel. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 is determined as the biodiesel mixture credit, which is the sum of the biodiesel mixture rate for each blend of qualified biodiesel mixture and the number of gallons of the blend for the taxable year. The biodiesel mixture rate varies depending on the blend, such as 3.0 cents for a B-2 blend. The biodiesel fuels credit rates vary for different blends: 3.0 cents for a B-2 blend, 20.0 cents for a B-20 blend, and 0.5-2.0 percent for a B-1 blend. The term 'B-20 blend' refers to a qualified biodiesel mixture with at least 20 percent biodiesel content. An 'applicable amount' is defined based on the percentage of biodiesel in a B-1 blend. A 'qualified biodiesel mixture' is a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold for use as fuel by the taxpayer producing it. The tax credit for biodiesel mixtures applies to biodiesel sold for use as fuel by the taxpayer producing it, only in a trade or business, and for the taxable year of sale or use. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for the credit. The tax credit for biodiesel mixtures applies to biodiesel sold for use in a trade or business for the taxable year of sale or use. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for the credit. Coordination with exemption from excise tax is also considered in determining the credit amount for biodiesel. The term \"biodiesel\" refers to monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids from vegetable oils used in diesel engines. It includes esters from various vegetable oils and must meet EPA registration requirements. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for the biodiesel tax credit. If biodiesel is used in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture and then separated from the mixture or used for purposes other than fuel, a tax is imposed on the person equal to the biodiesel mixture rate multiplied by the number of gallons of the mixture. The tax imposed on biodiesel used in a qualified mixture is calculated based on the mixture rate and the number of gallons. Applicable laws and penalties apply to this tax as if imposed under a different section. Regulations for estates and trusts are similar to those for other tax rules. Taxpayers can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit for a taxable year. Taxpayers can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit for any taxable year by making or revoking the election within a 3-year period. The manner of making this election is determined by the Secretary's regulations. The biodiesel fuels credit is treated as part of the general business credit under Section 38(b). The biodiesel fuels credit can be elected not to be applied for any taxable year within a 3-year period. This credit is part of the general business credit under Section 38(b). Amendments have been made to sections 39(d) and 196(c) regarding the carryback of the biodiesel fuels credit before January 1, 2003. The biodiesel fuels credit can be elected not to be applied for any taxable year within a 3-year period. This credit is part of the general business credit under Section 38(b). Amendments have been made to sections 39(d) and 196(c) regarding the carryback of the biodiesel fuels credit before January 1, 2003. Additionally, a new item is added to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 related to the biodiesel fuels credit determined under section 40A. The amendments made by Section 40A regarding biodiesel fuel will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001. Additionally, Section 3 reduces motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures. The amendment to Section 4081 introduces a new subsection (f) regarding biodiesel mixtures. It states that the tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures will be reduced by the biodiesel mixture rate. Additionally, the tax rate for diesel fuel used in producing biodiesel mixtures will also be reduced. The tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures will be reduced by the biodiesel mixture rate, which is determined based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. Definitions for terms used in this subsection are aligned with section 40A, and certain rules from subsection (c) also apply. The tax rates for qualified biodiesel mixtures will be reduced based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture, as defined in section 40A. Rules from subsection (c) also apply. The new subsection (p) allows for a refund on diesel fuel used to produce qualified biodiesel mixtures. The effective date for these amendments is January 1, 2002. SEC. 4.
