    "content": "The level of pay for congressional staff is determined by Senate committees, with job titles, pay rates, and resources set by the chair and ranking Member. Congressional pay data is sought for various reasons, such as assessing costs, setting pay levels, and comparing with other federal government systems. Publicly available sources do not provide aggregated pay data, but official Senate reports offer consistently collected data. The report provides aggregated congressional staff pay data based on official Senate reports, collected and organized by LegiStorm. It includes pay information for 13 staff position titles used in Senate committees since FY2001. Position titles and years for data availability since FY2001 are listed in Table 1. A two-step process identified 302 job titles in Senate committees in FY2014, with 25 titles remaining after exclusions. Pay data was collected for 13 positions with data available from at least five committees. Staff holding the same job title in Senate committees were included in the analysis. The pay data for Senate committee staff is collected based on specific criteria, including holding the same job title in the same committee for the entire fiscal year examined. The data includes all payments received by the staff, which may differ from their stated annual salary due to additional payments like overtime or bonuses. Pay data for House committee staff and congressional staff working in personal offices are available in separate reports. Data on congressional staff pay in Senators' and House Members' personal offices from 2001-2014 is available in CRS reports. The data may not fully represent all positions due to the large number of titles held by one employee. The way staff titles are assigned could impact data representativeness. Two main categories of positions were identified in the collected data. The data collected on congressional staff pay from 2001-2014 may not fully represent all positions due to the variety of titles held by one employee. Two main categories of positions were identified: one staff member per committee positions and positions where committees might hire multiple staff members. Pay data may not be fully representative of all staff in those positions. No insight is provided into factors such as education, work experience, or full- or part-time status that could explain compensation differences. The data collected on congressional staff pay from 2001-2014 may not fully represent all positions due to the variety of titles held by one employee. Differences in job duties for similarly titled staff could impact pay levels. Congressional job titles are imprecise, with individuals performing vastly different duties.

Tables in this section provide background information on Senate pay practices, comparative data for each position, and detailed data and visualizations.
