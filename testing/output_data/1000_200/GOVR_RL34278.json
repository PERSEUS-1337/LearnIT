    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $189.3 billion for military operations and $6.9 billion for international affairs. Congress had approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs are still pending approval. The Administration's initial request for emergency funding was made in February 2007, with an additional request for $5.3 billion for MRAP. Congress is expected to address the remaining requests in a spring 2008 supplemental appropriations bill. In 2007, the Administration requested emergency funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including $5.3 billion for MRAP vehicles. Congress approved $86.8 billion for defense in November, but additional funding for Army and Marine Corps operations was needed due to the high pace of operations in Iraq draining their budgets quickly. The high pace of operations in Iraq quickly drained the base budget for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance. Without supplemental funding, the Army would run out of money by February and the Marine Corps by early April. A $70 billion \"bridge fund\" approved by Congress temporarily resolved the issue, providing about 37% of the total amount requested by the Administration. The bill provided a \"bridge fund\" for military operations, resolving the issue temporarily. It included most of what the Defense Department had requested for Army and Marine Corps operations and maintenance. Funding from the consolidated FY2008 appropriations act, P.L. 110-161, and the regular FY2008 defense appropriations act, P.L. 110-116, will last until mid-June for personnel and end of June or early July for maintenance. Defense Department could extend operations by slowing obligations, transferring funds, or invoking transfer authority of up to $11.4 billion. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department, and $325 million for other agencies for FY2008. This request complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, complying with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act. This included a request for estimated full year costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department estimated the full-year costs of continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, acknowledging it was a rough projection. An additional $5.3 billion was requested for the Department of Defense to procure Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. The White House requested an additional $45.9 billion for military operations, economic assistance, and embassy security in an amendment to the FY2008 budget. This included $42.3 billion for the Department of Defense and $3.6 billion for international affairs programs. Overall, the Administration sought $195.6 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2008, mainly for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other conflict zones. In early 2007, congressional debate focused on supplemental appropriations for FY2007, with a revised request submitted in March. The President vetoed an initial bill in May due to Iraq policy provisions, but a compromise bill was approved providing funding for defense, foreign affairs, and domestic programs. In FY2008, Congress provided emergency funding for defense, including $5.2 billion for MRAP vehicles in September. The funding process began in September and was finalized shortly before Christmas. In FY2008, Congress approved a defense appropriations bill providing $460 billion for Defense Department activities, including $27.4 billion for Army and $4.8 billion for Marine Corps operations. An additional $11.6 billion was allocated for MRAP vehicles. However, no extra funding was included for ongoing military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. On November 14, 2007, the House approved a bill providing $50 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. The bill required the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days and limited the mission of remaining forces. It also extended prohibitions on torture to all U.S. government agencies. On November 16, 2007, the Senate rejected a motion to proceed with a bill that would have provided $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned of potential limitations on Army and Marine Corps operations. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned that without additional funding, the Army would have to cease operations at all bases by mid-February 2008, leading to furloughs of government employees and contractors. The Defense Department transferred $4.5 billion to extend Army operations until February 23, but senior officials continued to caution that essential operations could soon be halted without Congressional approval. The House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for programs covered by all annual appropriations bills except defense. Another amendment provided $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations. The House approved $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), excluding Iraq. The Senate later adopted an amendment to provide $70 billion for Department of Defense overseas operations without limits on usage or requiring a withdrawal from Iraq. The House approved $70 billion for overseas military operations without restrictions on usage or withdrawing forces from Iraq. The President signed the appropriations bill into law on December 26, 2007, resolving a funding dispute that had threatened Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008. The Defense Department faced a funding crisis that threatened Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008. Secretary of Defense Gates warned of potential furloughs for civilian and contractor personnel. However, the $70 billion in the consolidated appropriations act provided enough funding to sustain Army operations until June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until August 2008. The Defense Department had a funding crisis in early 2008, but the $70 billion in consolidated appropriations sustained Army operations until June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until August 2008. The Army may exhaust funds by mid-June, prompting potential transfers from other accounts or slowing operations. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion in transfer authority to address funding issues. The Defense Department had a funding crisis in early 2008, but the $70 billion in consolidated appropriations sustained Army operations until June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until August 2008. The Army may exhaust funds by mid-June, prompting potential transfers from other accounts or slowing operations. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion in transfer authority to address funding issues, including transfers from various accounts and the possibility of extending operations using different financing mechanisms. In early 2008, the Defense Department faced a funding crisis, but a $70 billion bridge fund sustained Army operations until June and Marine Corps operations until August. Congress debates the Defense Department's flexibility in delaying or avoiding shutdowns without full-year appropriations. The Department proposed a $4.1 billion transfer to extend Army operations for a few more weeks after funds were projected to run out in February for the Army and early April for the Marine Corps. The Defense Department proposed a $4.1 billion transfer to extend Army operations for a few more weeks after funds were projected to run out in early April for the Marine Corps. Without supplemental appropriations, operations could have been extended for about another month through limited transfers and slowed spending. Alternative measures like invoking the Feed and Forage Act or using Navy and Air Force funds for Army support operations abroad could have sustained operations longer, but with limitations and disadvantages. The Defense Department proposed a $4.1 billion transfer to extend Army operations. Use of the Feed and Forage Act or Navy and Air Force funds for Army support operations could sustain operations longer but with disadvantages. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill provides regular FY2008 appropriations for international affairs and emergency supplemental funds. The consolidated appropriations act, H.R. 2764, P.L. 110-161, provides regular FY2008 appropriations for international affairs and emergency supplemental funds totaling $1,473.8 million. This includes $965 million for the State Department and $508.8 million for foreign operations. Additional funds in the act cover Diplomatic and Consular Programs, Contributions to International Peacekeeping, and International Broadcasting. The State Department received $12.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping and $12.0 million for International Broadcasting in Darfur. Supplemental funds for Foreign Operations accounts include $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses in Iraq, $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $100 million for Foreign Military Financing, and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. The House bill includes funding for various programs such as Global Health & Child Survival, International Disaster Assistance, USAID Operating Expenses in Iraq, Economic Support Fund, Migration and Refugee Assistance, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. The House also passed a $31 billion Operation Enduring Freedom supplemental in the FY2008 consolidated appropriations bill. The House passed a $70 billion emergency funding legislation on December 19, signed into law on December 26. The bill did not change Iraq policy but included reporting requirements. The original House-passed bill required withdrawal of most U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008. The $50 billion bridge fund approved earlier set a goal of completing troop withdrawal by December 15, 2008, allowing a residual force for specific purposes. Various Iraq policy amendments were proposed during congressional debate. The House passed a $70 billion emergency funding legislation on December 19, signed into law on December 26. It set a goal of completing troop withdrawal from Iraq by December 15, 2008, with a residual force for specific purposes. The legislation included prohibitions on torture and required units to be fully ready before deployment. H.R. 4156 stated the sense of Congress for a quick and safe end to the war in Iraq, extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies, and required immediate redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. The legislation required an immediate redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, with a goal of completing the transition by December 15, 2008. It outlined restricted missions after the transition and mandated quarterly reports on plans for the U.S. mission in Iraq. Congressional consideration of additional funding was tied to the submission of the first quarterly report. On February 1, 2008, plans were discussed for the transition of the U.S. mission in Iraq. Congressional funding considerations were linked to quarterly reports on the transition. A comprehensive regional stability plan for the Middle East was required by February 15, 2008. Additional quarterly reports with performance measures for military and political stability in Iraq were mandated throughout the fiscal year. Senators proposed an amendment to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq to training, equipping, and supporting Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008. The Senate proposed an amendment to transition the U.S. mission in Iraq to focus on training, equipping, and supporting Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008. Despite majority support, the measure failed to pass with a vote of 50-45, reflecting ongoing Senate opposition to the war in Iraq. The Senate rejected an amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding after nine months. The approved $70 billion \"bridge fund\" for FY2008 did not include language for troop withdrawal but required a report on progress in Iraq within 60 days. The Senate rejected an amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding after nine months. Instead, Section 609 of the measure required the Secretary of Defense to provide a report on \"Progress Toward Stability in Iraq\" every 60 days. The Administration requested $196.5 billion for military operations and other activities in FY2008. The Administration requested $189.3 billion in FY2008 for military operations abroad and international affairs programs, including $5.3 billion for MRAP vehicles and an additional $45.9 billion for military operations and international affairs. The Administration requested $189.3 billion in FY2008 for military operations and international affairs programs, with $6.9 billion in supplemental funding for various programs. Table 3 outlines the supplemental requests in February, July, and October, designated as \"emergency\" spending to bypass spending caps. The House and Senate are considering a bill that exempts emergency spending from caps on discretionary spending. However, there are concerns about the definition of emergency spending and the possibility of raising a point of order in the Senate. The budget resolution allows for adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities, which may be used instead of emergency appropriations to avoid exceeding budget limits. Supplemental appropriations bills, rather than \"emergency\" appropriations, may allow for spending without exceeding budget limits in the Senate. The FY2007 supplemental bill included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, energy assistance, and the SCHIP children's health insurance program, along with a measure to increase the minimum wage. Additional \"emergency\" funds for Hurricane Katrina recovery were expected in the FY2008 supplemental bill for the war. However, with the war supplemental potentially delayed until January or later, appropriators decided not to wait. In the second FY2008 continuing resolution, non-defense programs were funded before the war supplemental bill. The resolution included funds for veterans health programs, community development in Louisiana, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and wildfire management. In the FY2008 defense appropriations bill, Congress allocated $16.8 billion for MRAPs, with $5.2 billion provided in the first continuing resolution and $11.6 billion in the defense appropriations bill. Additionally, the omnibus appropriations bill included a $70 billion bridge fund, with $39 billion designated for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance. The omnibus appropriations bill signed by the President on December 26 includes $39 billion for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance, $11 billion for Navy, Air Force, and other components, $1.35 billion for Afghan security forces, $1.5 billion for Iraqi forces, $3.7 billion for the Iraqi Freedom Fund, $4.3 billion for joint IED defense, and $6.1 billion for weapons procurement. Up to $4 billion can be transferred between accounts in the bridge fund for future Defense Department operations. The $189.3 billion requested for military operations in FY2008 continues the trend of increasing funding through supplemental appropriations. The requested military operations funding in FY2008 continues the trend of increasing supplemental appropriations for the Defense Department, with amounts growing significantly since FY2003. The increases are not solely due to military operations pace but also investments in repair and other factors. The increase in military funding in recent years has been primarily for weapons procurement, equipment repair, and training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi military forces. Additionally, funds have been used to reorganize the Army and increase troop levels by 92,000 by 2011. The Defense Department has allocated funds for force protection, support to foreign security forces, and reconstitution of the Army. Initially, there was uncertainty about the funding needed for reconstitution, but Congress insisted on adding funds for new equipment to restore the force to its pre-war condition. The term \"reconstitution\" refers to repairing and replacing equipment lost in combat to restore the force. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld preferred the term \"reset\" to return the force to its planned condition without adding to funding requirements. The Defense Department now uses \"reconstitution\" to encompass more than just restoring the force. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass substantial upgrades to the force, including fixing equipment shortfalls, adding transportation and communications equipment, and fully equipping deploying units with theater-used equipment. Guard and reserve units are also being more fully equipped with newer weapons and support systems for overseas operations. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass substantial upgrades to the force, including fixing equipment shortfalls and fully equipping deploying units with newer weapons and support systems for overseas operations. Congress has generally supported steps to upgrade ground forces, with questions raised about specific equipment funding requests. Funding for MRAPs is the largest single item in the amended defense request. The amended defense request realigned funding for the troop surge, with MRAPs being the largest item funded. Costs of maintaining additional Army and Marine units in Iraq were covered, with plans to return to pre-surge levels. Additional funds were allocated for Iraqi security forces, factory reopening programs, and emergency commanders' needs. The budget amendment includes additional funds for Iraqi security forces, factory reopening programs, and emergency commanders' needs in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also allocates money for constructing facilities and roads in both countries, as well as repairing and replenishing equipment and supplies. Additionally, there is funding to improve Navy P-3 aircraft radar detection equipment and restock equipment inventories of combat support units. The October budget amendment includes $5.4 billion to restock equipment inventories of combat support and combat service support units. Other initiatives in the budget amendment include funds for fuel price increases, accelerating construction of facilities to replace the Walter Reed Army hospital, improving Army medical facilities and services, and supporting soldier and family programs. The Administration's FY2008 budget included $35.1 billion for international affairs, with an additional emergency supplemental request of $6.897 billion. This funding was allocated for State Department operations, foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as programs in Mexico, the West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. The State Department requested $3.220 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq and Afghanistan, with additional funding for programs in Mexico, the West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. Foreign Operations comprised $3.678 billion, including $350 million for P.L. 480 food assistance, with nearly half allocated for Iraq and Afghanistan. The Bush Administration has increasingly requested emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets. The Bush Administration has requested emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets, with some critics arguing that certain expenses for Iraq and Afghanistan should be part of regular appropriations. In February 2007, the State Department requested $1.882 billion for operations in Iraq and $53 million for Contributions to International Organizations. The Bush Administration requested emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets, including $1.3 billion for operations in Iraq, $401.4 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, $160 million for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance, and $723.6 million for Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities. The total emergency funds requested for FY2008 for the State Department's Administration of Foreign Affairs equal $3.220 billion in addition to the regular budget request of $7.317 billion. The Mission in Iraq consists of about 1,000 direct-hire Americans representing 12 U.S. government agencies. The Department requested $2.523 billion for emergency needs in Iraq, with $978.7 million allocated for security needs and $907.1 million for Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). This includes funding for various security measures, equipment, support, and salaries for PRTs. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for the Department of State includes $110.0 million for bolstering rooftops, $907.1 million for Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), and $162.4 million for worldwide security upgrades in Afghanistan. This funding covers salaries, operations, living accommodations, medical support, information technology, vehicles, security, leases of space in Baghdad, and other security costs. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for the Department of State included funding for U.S. staff housing in Afghanistan, assessments for U.N. activities combatting terrorism, and contributions for international peacekeeping activities in Darfur. Congress provided $1.262 billion in supplemental funds, with $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs and $468.0 million for International Peacekeeping, which was less than the Administration's request. The $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs includes $575.0 million for Iraq operations and $206.6 million for worldwide security protection. $550.4 million is designated for a new United Nations/African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur, with $390 million allocated for Darfur specifically. $78 million is for FY2008 U.N. Peacekeeping funds, and $333.6 million is still pending for Darfur. $12.0 million in emergency supplemental funds is allocated for the BBG in the consolidated appropriation. No specific allocation requirements are mentioned for the general funding allocations for BBG. The Foreign Operations portion of the supplemental request totals $3.678 billion, with $1.367 billion requested in February 2007 and an amended request for $2.311 billion in October 2007, including P.L. 480 food aid. Approximately one-third of the request consists of $2.217 billion in Economic Support Funds for Iraq and Afghanistan. Approximately one-third of the $3.678 billion Foreign Operations supplemental request included $2.217 billion in Economic Support Funds for Iraq, Afghanistan, West Bank, Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. Anti-narcotics emergency funding totaled $734 million, with a significant portion allocated for Mexico and Central America. Migration and Refugee Assistance totaled $230 million, mainly for Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. International Disaster and Famine Assistance amounted to $80 million for programs in Iraq to aid internally displaced persons. Additionally, $5 million was requested for the Afghanistan Presidential Protection Service. In addition to regular FY2008 funding, Congress approved $1.123 billion in emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations, including $5 million for the Afghanistan Presidential Protection Service and a $350 million request for P.L. 480 food aid supporting programs in the Horn of Africa, Kenya, and Sudan. A $30 million contingency fund was also approved to anticipate future needs elsewhere. The legislation does not specify where all the requested funds should be directed, leaving some discretion to the Administration. Supplemental funds approved by Congress include $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses, $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $100 million for Foreign Military Financing, and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. No funds were provided for counter-narcotics programs. For Iraq reconstruction in FY2008, almost all funding came from annual supplemental legislation, totaling nearly $42 billion. The Administration did not request security assistance in its regular Defense budget proposal but asked for roughly $392 million under State and Foreign Operations appropriations. Congress rejected the Administration's request for Iraq funding in both the House and Senate versions of the FY2008 State and Foreign Operations legislation. In FY2008, funding for Iraq reconstruction was expected to come from an emergency supplemental measure as Congress rejected the Administration's request. The Administration's revised emergency supplemental appropriations request included $4.9 billion for Iraq reconstruction, with $3.7 billion allocated for security aid and the rest for political/economic/social sector assistance. The funding would primarily support training Iraqi troops and local economic activities through the Commander's Emergency Response Program. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) provides reconstruction grants for various local economic activities, including infrastructure projects like health clinics and wells. It also supports efforts such as salary payments to the Sons of Iraq for security. Additionally, there was a $100 million request added to the DOD-funded Iraq Freedom Fund for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq. The Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq has requested $100 million from the DOD-funded Iraq Freedom Fund to stimulate the economy by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. Challenges include lack of electricity, security issues, and low interest from U.S. companies. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for Iraq includes $1.2 billion in funding from various sources. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for Iraq includes $1.2 billion in funding from various sources, with $797 million allocated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF), $159 million to the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE), $195 million to Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA), and $80 million to International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA). The funding will support Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and embedded PRTs in stabilizing areas secured by U.S. and Iraqi forces through economic projects and capacity-building for local government officials. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) in Iraq supports development grants, job training, and micro-loan programs. It also enhances the capacities of local government officials to utilize Iraqi-owned capital funds for infrastructure projects. Additionally, ESF aids in Ministerial capacity development, agriculture, private sector reform, and democratization efforts. The October budget revision added $25 million to the ESF supplemental request and proposed establishing a new Iraq enterprise fund modeled after those in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Enterprise funds provide loans or equity investments to small and medium businesses, promoting private sector growth. The Polish Fund, an example of successful enterprise funds in former communist countries, made profitable investments to help companies grow post-communism. Some funds have been less successful due to poor investment risks or competition from other funding sources. Critics question the funds' usefulness as their development purpose may conflict with economic profit pressures. The INCLE account focuses on supporting rule of law and corrections programs, including funding for prison construction. The Administration's request for funding in Iraq included support for rule of law, corrections programs, prison construction, judicial reform, and anticorruption efforts. Additionally, funds were requested for addressing the refugee crisis in the region, providing medical care, food, shelter, and relief to refugees and displaced people. Congress considered regular and supplemental requests for Iraq reconstruction, including emergency funds for operational costs. Congress provided $1.9 billion for security reconstruction aid in Iraq but rejected most economic assistance, only approving about $250 million for humanitarian programs. Congress approved $250 million for humanitarian programs in Iraq, including funding for demining, refugees, disaster relief, the Marla Ruzicka War Victims Fund, and Iraqi scholars. This brings total funding for Iraq reconstruction since 2003 to $44.8 billion. The U.S. funding for PRT operations and programs, along with other support programs for Iraq, will rely on available FY2007 funds. The Administration is seeking additional emergency Iraq reconstruction aid in the 2nd tranche deliberated in Spring 2008. Afghanistan completed its political transition in 2005, but faced escalating insurgent threats in 2006. Successful elections were held in Afghanistan in 2004 and 2005. In Afghanistan, a new constitution was adopted in 2004, leading to successful presidential and parliamentary elections in 2004 and 2005. The parliament has become a platform for factions to peacefully resolve differences. Afghan citizens have gained new personal freedoms, especially in the northern and western regions, previously forbidden under the Taliban. Women are increasingly participating in economic and political roles. The insurgency by remnants of the Taliban regime escalated in 2006, despite recent successes in counter-insurgency operations by U.S. and NATO forces. The next elections are scheduled for 2009. The Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan poses a significant threat to peace and security, despite recent successes in counter-insurgency operations. Slow reconstruction, corruption, and the failure to extend government authority into rural areas have contributed to the Taliban's strength. Political leaders in the north have raised concerns about reconstruction funding distribution. Narcotics trafficking, independent militias, and Taliban commanders operating from Pakistan remain challenges for U.S. and NATO forces. The United States and partner stabilization measures focus on strengthening the central government and security forces in Afghanistan, combating insurgent challenges. Weak provincial governance remains a key obstacle to reconstruction efforts. The Administration requested $339 million in ESF for Afghanistan reconstruction assistance in FY2008. The Administration requested $339 million in ESF for Afghanistan reconstruction assistance in FY2008 to support stabilization efforts. An amended request in October 2007 totaled $839 million for reconstruction, including provisions for economic reconstruction and stabilization efforts. However, the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act did not appropriate the $839 million supplemental request for reconstruction. The FY2008 emergency supplemental requests included funding for the ESF, with additional allocations for democratic governance and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. This included $275 million for provincial governance, $40 million for the National Solidarity Program, $25 million for the Afghanistan Reconstruction Fund, and $50 million for the Provincial Governance Fund. Another $50 million was designated for basic social services like health and education. The FY2008 emergency supplemental requests included funding for the ESF, with additional allocations for democratic governance and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. This included $275 million for provincial governance, $40 million for the National Solidarity Program, $25 million for the Afghanistan Reconstruction Fund, $50 million for the Provincial Governance Fund, $50 million for basic social services, and $170 million for economic growth and infrastructure projects. The US is supporting the Afghan leadership through the Presidential Protection Service and has pledged $750 million over five years for development assistance in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) to improve economic and social conditions and combat terrorism. The US is providing support in the FATA to combat terrorism and improve economic and social conditions. President Musharraf imposed emergency rule in 2007, leading to a review of US assistance. After a national election in 2008, Secretary of State Rice lifted coup-related sanctions on Pakistan. The US lifted coup-related sanctions on Pakistan and resumed assistance. The FY2008 amended supplemental request includes $60 million for governance, health, education, and economic development in Pakistan. No funding was requested for Sudan in the original FY2008 emergency supplemental. The FY2008 amended emergency supplemental included $868.6 million for Sudan, mainly for humanitarian and peacekeeping support in Darfur. This funding also supported upcoming national elections as per the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The United Nations estimates that the upcoming elections in Sudan could cost nearly $400 million due to logistical challenges in a post-conflict environment. Funding includes $70 million from the FY2008 emergency supplemental, $723.6 million for the African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, and $468 million in the Consolidated Appropriations. Additionally, there is a pending request for $550 million for anti-narcotics efforts in Mexico and Central America. The Mexico and Central America Security Initiative involves a $1 billion-plus anti-narcotics package funded by the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Account. Mexico would receive $500 million for border security technology and transport, while Central American countries would get $50 million for border security and justice sector improvements. Regular funding for Mexico and Central America has increased over the years, with Congress not including the FY2008 request in the omnibus act. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request included $375 million to support the Palestinian Authority government, focusing on rule of law, economic growth, and governance issues. The request consisted of ESF funds for various purposes such as governance, health care, job creation, infrastructure, trade, investment, agriculture programs, and budget support. Additionally, $25 million in INCLE funds would be used to train and equip the Presidential Guards and National Security Force. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request included $375 million to support the Palestinian Authority government, with ESF funds for governance, health care, job creation, infrastructure, trade, investment, agriculture programs, and budget support. An additional $25 million in INCLE funds would be used to train and equip the Presidential Guards and National Security Force. $35 million in MRA funds would be for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Gaza, and refugee camps in Lebanon. Congress allocated $155 million of emergency ESF funds to the West Bank and Gaza, with no emergency INCLE funds provided. $200 million in emergency MRA funds were provided, with the Administration proposing $106 million in ESF funds for North Korea as part of the Six Party Talks. North Korea agreed to abandon the Yongbyon nuclear facility, allow IAEA monitors, and disable nuclear facilities in exchange for 1 million metric tons of heavy fuel oil from the US and other Six Party Talks members. The US committed $131 million, with $25 million from FY2007 and $106 million from FY2008 supplemental funding. The omnibus bill provided $53 million in ESF funds for North Korea. The Administration seeks funding for unmet humanitarian needs, including $350 million for emergency food in Darfur and eastern Chad, southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, and Kenya. Additionally, $230 million is requested for Migration and Refugee Assistance, with $195 million for Iraqi refugees and $35 million for Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the West Bank. In the FY2008 emergency supplemental request, $35 million was allocated for Palestinian refugees in Gaza, West Bank, and Lebanon. $200 million was appropriated for Migration and Refugee Assistance, with $195 million designated for Iraqi refugees. $30 million from the original $230 million request remains pending for Iraqi refugee assistance."
