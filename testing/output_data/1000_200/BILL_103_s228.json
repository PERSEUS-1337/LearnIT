    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that 90 million Americans ride bicycles, with 20 million riding more than once a week. Between 1984 and 1988, 2,985 bicyclists in the United States died from head injuries, costing society $7.6 billion annually. Universal use of bicycle helmets would have prevented 2,600 deaths and 757,000 injuries. Universal use of bicycle helmets could have prevented 2,600 deaths from head injuries and 757,000 injuries. Only 5 percent of children in the Nation who ride bicycles wear helmets. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration can provide grants to promote bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16. Grantees have flexibility in designing effective programs. Grants under section 3 can be used to enforce laws on bicycle helmet use, assist in acquiring helmets, educate on helmet importance for safety, or a combination of these activities. Bicycle helmets manufactured after the enactment of this Act must conform to interim standards like the ANSI standard \"Z90.4-1984\" and the Snell Memorial Foundation standard \"B-90\", until a final standard is established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 60 days. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a final standard for bicycle helmet safety, including provisions to prevent helmets from coming off and address injury risks to children. The standard will not be subject to certain sections of the Consumer Product Safety Act and will take effect one year after issuance. The final standard for bicycle helmet safety, established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, will not be subject to certain sections of the Consumer Product Safety Act. A bicycle helmet that does not meet the interim standard will be considered in violation of a consumer product safety standard until the final standard takes effect. The final standard will be treated as a consumer product safety standard under the Act. Authorization of appropriations for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration grant program: $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996. Definition of \"approved bicycle helmet\" includes meeting interim and final safety standards."
