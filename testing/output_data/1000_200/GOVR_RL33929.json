    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. The vouchers cover the difference between rent and the tenant's expected contribution (30% of adjusted income), and are administered by local public housing authorities. The Section 8 voucher program provides rental subsidies for low-income families, covering the difference between rent and tenant contributions. Recent changes in funding distribution have caused uncertainty for public housing authorities, prompting calls for permanent funding reform legislation. Congress has enacted changes in voucher renewal funding since FY2003, leading to pressure for a permanent funding formula. Prior to FY2003, PHAs administering the voucher program were funded based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted by an inflation factor and multiplied by the number of vouchers that the PHA was authorized to lease. Despite receiving full funding, few PHAs were able to lease 100% of their authorized vouchers, leading to low utilization rates which were a major concern for Congress. National voucher utilization rates in FY2000 and FY2001 were just over 91%, below the expected 95%. PHAs had low budget utilization due to not using all vouchers, resulting in excess funds. HUD reconciled budgets yearly, recapturing excess funds. Funding for Section 8 vouchers was determined based on actual costs and inflation. Unused funds were returned to Congress. PHAs' funding increased with costs, allowing use of excess funds if costs dropped. The funding system for PHAs allowed for increased funding if costs dropped, leading to the creation of new vouchers through maximized leasing. Congress provided more funds for voucher renewals than needed, recapturing unused funds the following year. In FY2003, Congress changed funding to limit recaptures and better reflect actual use, reducing the amount of appropriations needed for the program. HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, increased by the inflation factor. The program directed HUD to fund PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, increased by the inflation factor, and multiplied by the number of vouchers the PHA could reasonably be expected to lease in that year. HUD implemented a provision to base PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs reported on year-end statements or recent data. Renewal calculations for the Federal Fiscal Year 2003 Appropriation will consider total unit months under lease and actual cost data. Voucher funding increments will generally be renewed for three-month terms. The Central Reserve fund created by Congress allows the Secretary to replenish PHA reserves in case of increased costs or utilization. The fund can be used for contract amendments due to rising per-unit costs or total unit months under lease. (P.L. 108-7, Title II) The bill imposed restrictions on maximized leasing, prohibiting funds from supporting more vouchers than a PHA was authorized to lease in a year. This caused issues for over-leased PHAs, leading them to stop reissuing vouchers to align with their authorized leasing levels. The FY2004 appropriations law continued this trend by funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and limiting funds for maximized leasing. The FY2004 appropriations law restricted funds for maximized leasing in the voucher program, aiming to control spiraling cost increases. The Secretary was expected to utilize administrative authority to control costs by renewing expiring annual contributions contracts based on actual voucher utilization. The FY2004 appropriations law restricted funds for maximized leasing in the voucher program, aiming to control cost increases by renewing expiring annual contributions contracts based on actual voucher utilization. The language in FY2004 varied from FY2003 in terms of how the Central Reserve fund could be used, with funds only allowed to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization rates, not increased costs. In FY2004, the Secretary could use Central Reserve funds to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. HUD issued a notice implementing the appropriations law, basing PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs from end-of-the-year statements as of August 1, 2003, adjusted by the annual adjustment factor. PHAs could appeal if rental costs in their areas had risen higher than the inflation factor. The notice issued by HUD in FY2004 allowed PHAs to appeal if rental costs in their areas had risen higher than the inflation factor. HUD granted appeals requests of 380 agencies out of approximately 400 that applied, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The final FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act moved the program towards budget-based funding. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447) shifted the program towards budget-based funding. It directed the Secretary to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004, adjusted for new tenant protection vouchers. If data was unavailable, funding would be based on February-April 2004 data or the most recent year-end financial statement. If funding was insufficient, budgets would be prorated. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act required PHAs to manage voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005. It also changed the funding cycle to a calendar year basis, resulting in budget adjustments for PHAs. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act required PHAs to manage voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, resulting in budget adjustments. HUD published guidance on December 8, 2004, with agencies receiving preliminary budget levels on December 17, 2004. Appeals were limited to data errors, with final calculations published on January 21, 2005, funding agencies generally at 4.03% less than their actual cost levels. In May-July 2004, actual cost and utilization levels were analyzed along with the 2005 AAF. A proration factor of just under 96% was implemented due to insufficient funding from Congress for voucher renewals. HUD's analysis showed a median increase of 0.17% in PHA renewal budgets from FY2004 to FY2005, with a wide variance ranging from a 12% decrease to a 14% increase. HUD provided administrative options in Notice PIH 2005-9 on February 25, 2005, for PHAs to manage costs in 2005, including lowering payment standards and reviewing rents for reasonableness. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-115) distributed renewal funding to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) based on their eligibility in CY2005, adjusted for inflation and prorated to fit within the allocated amount. The Act also provided $45 million for the Secretary to adjust agency budgets, with measures such as lowering payment standards, reviewing rents, and monitoring income eligibility more strictly. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act provided $45 million for the Secretary to adjust agency budgets based on low leasing costs or unforeseen circumstances. PHAs were funded at about 94% of their eligibility, incentivizing cost reduction efforts in partnership with a cooled rental housing market. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act provided incentives for PHAs to reduce costs in a cooled rental housing market. Average annual per voucher costs remained flat from 2004 to 2005 and declined by 1.5% from 2005 to 2006. Utilization dropped, leading to 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004. PHAs accumulated reserve funds, with unspent balances averaging 10% of their budget authority from 2005 to 2006. In 2005-2006, PHAs had unspent balances averaging 10% of their budget authority. Budget utilization dropped nationally from over 98% in 2003-2004 to under 92% in 2006. The debate in FY2007 was between a \"budget-based\" and \"unit-based\" funding formula for PHAs. President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula similar to FY2005-2006. He also asked to lift the prohibition on maximized leasing due to some PHAs receiving more funding than allowed. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's proposal for a budget-based funding formula for PHAs. Instead, they adopted a formula based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months. This change aimed to address the issue of some PHAs having excess funding they were not permitted to use. The law in FY2007 adjusted cost data for PHAs based on their leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months. It included a central reserve fund for adjustments due to unforeseen circumstances or formula shifts, and continued the prohibition on over-leasing. P.L. 110-28 later amended the formula to provide exceptions for certain Hurricane Katrina-affected agencies. Certain exceptions were made for three categories of PHAs under the FY2007 formula change. Agencies affected by Hurricane Katrina were funded based on the higher of FY2007 or FY2006 amounts. Agencies at risk of losing funding or with higher costs in FY2006 were also funded based on FY2006 amounts. Overall, PHAs with higher costs and utilization rates in FY2006 did better under the FY2007 formula. The FY2007 formula for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) provided sufficient funding for all agencies to serve at least the same number of families as in FY2006. The formula combined unit-based and budget-based elements, with funding allocations based on voucher usage and caps on the number of vouchers. PHAs with higher costs and utilization rates in FY2006 benefited more from the FY2007 formula, while those with lower costs did worse. The funding allocations for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) in FY2008 were based on voucher usage and subject to caps. President Bush's budget proposal included a \"budget-based\" voucher funding formula, adjusting for costs like Family Self Sufficiency program deposits. Future reforms may involve re-benchmarking the formula with more recent data. The President planned to re-benchmark the funding formula for Public Housing Authorities in the future, possibly in FY2009, as part of a larger reform proposal. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula similar to FY2007, with adjustments for various costs. Unlike FY2007, the FY2008 Act included a rescission that affected agencies' total funding. The FY2008 Act included a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level by the amount of their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their total received in FY2007, freeing up unusable NRA. This rescinded $723 million in FY2008 renewal funding, allowing Congress to reduce new appropriations for voucher renewals without affecting agencies under receivership or overspending. In FY2008, Congress reduced new appropriations for voucher renewals by rescinding funds from PHAs with reserves over 7% of their total received in FY2007. This freed up unusable NRA and allowed for a reduction in new appropriations without impacting agencies under receivership or overspending. In FY2008, Congress reduced new appropriations for voucher renewals by rescinding funds from PHAs with reserves over 7% of their total received in FY2007. This freed up unusable NRA and allowed for a reduction in new appropriations without impacting agencies under receivership or overspending. PHAs were expected to supplement their allocations with unused NRA, and there was a $100 million renewal set-aside for adjustments in certain circumstances. HUD based CY2009 allocations on utilization and cost data from FY2008, estimating PHAs' NRA using the same data. HUD allocated CY2009 funds for the voucher program based on PHAs' utilization and cost data from FY2008. However, inaccuracies in estimating costs, utilization, and NRA balances led to funding shortfalls for some PHAs, affecting up to 15% of agencies. HUD worked with affected agencies to address the shortfall issue. HUD worked with agencies to address funding shortfalls in the voucher program, with up to 15% of PHAs facing such issues. Additional funding was provided from FY2009 renewal set-asides and administrative fees. HUD advised agencies on cost-cutting measures to prevent voucher issuance stoppages and potential loss of assistance for families. Congress enacted legislation allowing HUD access to extra funding (up to $200 million) to support PHAs at risk of terminating assistance. Congress enacted legislation allowing HUD to access up to $200 million in additional funding to support PHAs at risk of terminating assistance to families due to insufficient funding in CY2009. This policy change increased the set-aside renewal funding provided to HUD in FY2009 and expanded its purposes to prevent assistance termination. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget requested a funding formula similar to previous years, with the authority to offset agencies' budgets for excess reserves at the Secretary's discretion. The Administration requested the authority to offset agencies' budgets for excess reserves and reallocate funding to high-performing or needy agencies in the FY2010 budget. The final funding law adopted a similar formula but did not grant the Secretary the authority to offset budgets or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. Unlike previous years, the FY2010 allocation formula did not include an offset for unspent agency reserves. Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing funds in FY2011 and FY2012. In FY2010, the allocation formula did not include an offset for unspent agency reserves. Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization in FY2011 and FY2012. The FY2011 law (P.L. 112-10) had no offset from PHA reserves, while the FY2012 law (P.L. 112-55) included a $650 million rescission to be offset from PHAs with reserves above a certain level determined by HUD. PHAs saw changes in serving families and spending federal funding following formula changes enacted between FY2003 and FY2006. Following formula changes between FY2003 and FY2006, PHAs served fewer families and spent less federal funding. Low utilization persisted when the voucher funding formula changed in FY2007. Transitioning to a hybrid cost and utilization-based model led to increased funding utilization, rising from 91% in 2006 to 95% by the end of 2009. PHAs served over 150,000 more families by 2009 compared to 2006, surpassing the 2003 peak. Reserves accumulated during the budget-based formula days were depleted by the end of FY2009 due to rescissions. By the end of FY2009, PHAs had spent down reserves accumulated during budget-based formula days of 2005 and 2006. Per voucher costs began rising in CY2007 and were expected to continue increasing in CY2012. Congressional members have introduced voucher reform legislation, but Appropriations Committees can override any new funding formula. The Appropriations Committees have the power to change the allocation formula for the Section 8 voucher program, which was previously funded like an entitlement program. Changes were made starting in FY2003 to control costs and make the program more similar to other discretionary programs. The Section 8 voucher program underwent funding changes starting in FY2003, converting to a fixed sum funding structure. This gave Congress more budget control but made administration more challenging for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). PHAs have limited cost control, with subsidies set by statute. Some PHAs adjusted payment standards and selection processes in response. Many PHAs adjusted payment standards and selection processes in response to funding changes in the Section 8 voucher program. Some lowered payment standards to 100% or less of local fair market rents, leading to rent reductions for landlords and decreased utilization rates. PHAs also had the option to select higher-income families from waiting lists, but were still required to target 75% of vouchers to low-income families. Agencies that intentionally lowered utilization rates to save money in FY2004 faced budget constraints in FY2005. Some PHAs faced budget constraints in FY2005 after intentionally lowering utilization rates to save money in FY2004. Voucher costs and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006, with some agencies receiving more funds than allowed. Average voucher costs decreased by 1.5% and average utilization declined by over 2% during that period. Some Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) had unused funds due to budget constraints in FY2005, leading to decreased voucher costs and utilization rates in FY2006. Low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups criticized the budget-based funding formula changes enacted through FY2006. The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by implementing a voucher renewal funding formula similar to the original one. The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula similar to the original one. PHAs were funded based on their previous year's usage rather than the amount received, leading to reduced funding for agencies with surpluses. Funding was sufficient to serve all families and additional ones, with reductions for agencies exceeding reserve limits in FY2008 and FY2009. Rescissions and offsets made unused funding usable and decreased overall funding amounts. In FY2010 and FY2011, agencies with excess reserves had their funding reduced. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. The funding model has shifted to a cost-based approach, incentivizing PHAs to increase utilization. Rising costs and utilization may pressure policymakers to contain program costs. Policy makers may face pressure to contain rising costs in the Section 8 voucher program. Past cost containment strategies have reduced costs but also decreased the number of families served and led to unspent funds. Future strategies should aim to maintain services while minimizing unspent funds. Proposed legislation focuses on serving more families without capping cost growth, but it could be overridden by future appropriations."
