The method achieves lower root-mean-squared prediction errors compared to previous models, enabling real-time multi-horizon forecasts. The proposed method allows for multi-horizon forecasts with real-time inputs in the evolving smart grid, addressing challenges such as uncertainty and fluctuations due to higher renewable penetration and active loads. Independent system operators are facing challenges with short-term forecasting uncertainties. The increased grid penetration levels of solar pose challenges with grid reliability and operating costs. California ISO doubled its frequency regulation service requirements in 2016 to manage short-term forecasting errors in renewable generation. Integrating wind and solar forecasts into unit commitment could save the Western Electricity Coordinating Council $5 billion per year. Solar forecast accuracy is crucial for the effectiveness of unit commitment. Solar power generation forecast accuracy is crucial for grid reliability and cost efficiency. Improving solar forecast accuracy is essential for integrating solar energy resources effectively at all time scales. It is a low-cost method for efficiently incorporating solar energy into the grid.

The paper concludes with future research avenues in solar forecasting methods, including regressive methods, artificial intelligence techniques, numerical weather prediction, sensing, and hybrid models. Numerical Weather Prediction models are based on physical laws governing the weather. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, such as BID20, ANN, and satellite-derived cloud indices like BID21, are powerful tools for forecasting solar radiation in areas without ground data. However, they have limitations in predicting precise cloud positions and extents due to coarse spatial resolution and inability to resolve micro-scale physics. Regional NWP models are used to improve site-specific forecasts by downscaling. NWP models also have limitations in temporal resolution, with output variables typically ranging from 3 to 6 hours globally. NWP models have limitations in temporal resolution, with output variables typically ranging from 3 to 6 hours globally. Satellite-based irradiance measurement is useful in areas without ground-based data, but has limitations in determining accurate radiance values under different sky conditions. The limitations of solar irradiance forecasting using satellite remote sensing include the need for ground-based solar data for statistical algorithms. Short-term solar forecasting research has shifted towards timeseries analysis and AI techniques due to limitations in NWP and sensing models. Statistical models and AI techniques, including Linear stationary models, Nonlinear stationary models, and Linear nonstationary models, are used for solar forecasting. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can handle complex non-linear behaviors and exogenous variables like humidity, temperature, and pressure. These techniques overcome limitations of NWP and sensing methods but are constrained by assumptions of normality, linearity, and variable independence. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are effective in modeling complex relationships between exogenous variables like humidity, temperature, and pressure with Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI). Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with multiple hidden layers have shown efficiency in various fields. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have not been explored for solar forecasting yet, but they capture sequence dynamics using cyclic feedback connections. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) capture sequence dynamics using cyclic feedback connections and exhibit dynamic temporal behavior by using internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Recent advances in parallelism, network architectures, optimization techniques, and GPUs have enabled successful large-scale learning with RNNs, overcoming traditional limitations. Several methods have been proposed for solar forecasting in the past. This paper proposes two approaches using RNNs for solar forecasting, addressing the limitations of traditional methods. The first approach involves a single algorithm that can be trained to forecast solar data for different time horizons. The second approach introduces a unified architecture capable of predicting solar irradiance values for multiple time horizons. The proposed method utilizes RNN architecture to predict solar irradiance values for multiple time horizons, enabling real-time forecasts based on live data. The RNN incorporates directed edges spanning adjacent time steps, allowing the model to utilize past information in sequential data. The RNN input is a sequence with target as sequence or single value. Input sequence denoted by (x BID0 , x BID1 ,...x (T) ), each x (t) is a real valued vector. Target sequence denoted by (y BID0 , y BID1 ,...y (T) ) and predicted target by (y BID0 , y BID1 ,...y (T) ). RNN input has three dimensions: Mini-batch Size, Number of columns in vector per time-step, Number of time-steps. Mini-batch size is sample length, number of columns are input features, and number of time-steps unfolds input vector over time. In a feedforward neural network, the input vector is processed through layers of neurons using activation functions and weights. The architecture includes bias parameters and Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) as the activation function. The network unfolds input over time using conventional weight matrices and recurrent weight matrices. The proposed architecture utilizes Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) as the activation function and bias parameters bh and by. It unfolds the input over time and is trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. The loss function employed is Mean Squared Loss (MSE) to minimize the error between target and predicted outputs. Gradients are computed using back-propagation-through time and stochastic gradient descent optimizer updates weights. RNN is chosen to learn complex relationships between sequences of exogenous variables impacting solar irradiance. RMSE is calculated for benchmarking. The algorithm in the proposed approach recognizes non-linear factors like atmospheric conditions affecting solar irradiance, leading to lower prediction RMSE compared to other methods. The algorithm was trained and tested on data from NOAA's SURFRAD BID30 sites, using various input features related to solar radiation. The algorithm in the proposed approach considers atmospheric conditions affecting solar irradiance, resulting in lower prediction RMSE. It was trained and tested on data from NOAA's SURFRAD BID30 sites, using input features related to solar radiation. Infrared, downwelling and upwelling thermal infrared, UVB, photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and station pressure are among the variables measured at the SURFRAD sites. Global downwelling solar measurements best represent Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) at these sites. Clear Sky GHI and global downwelling solar show a positive correlation. The algorithm uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the difference between target and output values in the training process. Root Mean Squared Error is then calculated as the square root of MSE values for benchmarking. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural network model considers atmospheric conditions affecting solar irradiance, resulting in lower prediction RMSE. The Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm incorporates site-specific data and clear sky global horizontal irradiance values from the Bird Model. The dataset is split into train and testing sets, with missing values replaced by the mean or neighborhood values. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to normalize the data and identify outliers. The Recurrent Neural Network model is defined with specified architectural parameters. The Recurrent Neural Network model is instantiated with architectural parameters such as input dimension, hidden dimension, layer dimension, and output dimension. Sequence length and batch size are also defined. The model is trained and tested on the dataset for the years 2010 and 2011 from SURFRAD observations sites. If RMSE is not satisfactory, hyperparameters are tuned and the model is retrained until a satisfactory RMSE is achieved. The algorithm is trained on data from SURFRAD observation sites for the years 2010 and 2011. The test year is 2009 for benchmarking. Results show that the proposed RNN architecture has lower RMSE values for forecasting horizons at all seven sites compared to other methods. The proposed RNN architecture has lower RMSE values for forecasting horizons at all seven SURFRAD sites compared to other machine learning algorithms. The architecture predicts for all four forecasting time horizons in parallel, making it a multitime-horizon implementation. None of the methods discussed in the literature have shown the capability of producing multi-time-horizon predictions. The proposed RNN architecture achieves significantly lower RMSE values for short-term forecasting across all time horizons (1 to 4 hours), making it relevant for industry applications. Its capability to predict for multi-time horizons is beneficial for optimizing smart grid operational efficiencies. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture utilizes AI for high-fidelity solar forecasting, addressing the limitations of current methods with its adaptability to various temporal and spatial resolutions. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture leverages AI for accurate solar forecasting across different time scales, outperforming traditional Machine Learning methods. Despite the potential of deeper neural networks, the proposed algorithm focuses on reducing variance for improved generalization. Further enhancements can be made through hyper-parameter tuning. The proposed method aims to improve performance through hyper-parameter tuning and architectural changes. Future research directions include extending the architecture with LSTM cells and exploring intra-hour forecasting horizons."
