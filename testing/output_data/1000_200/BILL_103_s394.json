    "content": "Credit for payments or contributions to certain cooperative research organizations. The amendment allows for a 50 percent credit on qualified cooperative research expenditures. Qualified cooperative research expenditures are defined as the total amount of qualified expenses for collaborative research activities. The term 'qualified cooperative research expenditures' refers to contributions to research consortia for qualified research activities, with limitations on private funding. The private source funding ratio for qualified contributions of a taxpayer is determined based on the organization's gross receipts, excluding governmental support, from the previous taxable year. The ratio cannot exceed the private source funding ratio, which is calculated as 50 percent of the organization's gross receipts ratio to total gross receipts. The private source funding ratio for qualified contributions is calculated based on the organization's gross receipts for the current taxable year, with additional percentages from the two preceding years. Certain contributions are not considered in determining qualified contributions, such as costs allocated to services exceeding cash contributions and overhead contributions. Employees exceeding cash contributions, overhead exceeding 25% of salary and benefits, contributions to cooperative research consortium exceeding one-third of total support. If a qualified cooperative research consortium has fewer than 5 participants, the contributions of each person will be reduced by 20% if there are 4 participants, or by 40% if there are 3 participants. A qualified cooperative research consortium is an organization registered under the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984. The Cooperative Research Act of 1984 allows organizations with at least 5 contributors to qualify as a cooperative research consortium, with specific contribution limits for members. The Cooperative Research Act of 1984 allows organizations with 3 or 4 contributors to qualify as a cooperative research consortium, with specific contribution limits for members, including noncash contributions taken into account at their cost. The cost of services provided by a taxpayer's employees, including overhead, shall be taken into account at their cost. Amounts for qualified cooperative research expenditures shall not be double-counted. Contributions to qualified research consortia for research conducted after the taxable year are treated as paid or incurred during the research period. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of this Act. Qualified cooperative research consortia must provide a report to the Secretary with certification, private source funding ratio, and other required information. Each consortium must also share the report with contributors."
