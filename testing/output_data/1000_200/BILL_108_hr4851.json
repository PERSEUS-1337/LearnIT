Employee Contribution: Section 3101 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to reduce the tax rate on employees for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance in years following a reduction year. The reduction percentage applies when the OASDI rate ratio exceeds 125 percent after the transition year. The reduction percentage is defined as the difference between the rate in effect for the reduction year and the rate that would result in an OASDI rate ratio of 125 percent. This calculation is based on specific conditions outlined in the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act of 2004. The OASDI rate ratio is the combined balance in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund divided by the amount paid from the Trust Funds for authorized purposes in a calendar year. The OASDI rate ratio is calculated based on the combined balance in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. A reduction in the tax rate imposed on employers under subsection (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is proposed, following a reduction year, to be in effect for subsequent years. The tax rate imposed on employers will be reduced each year following a reduction year, with a limitation to ensure it does not fall below 4.95 percent. Additionally, a reduction in the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance tax rate is proposed for subsequent years. The tax rate imposed on employers will be reduced each year following a reduction year, with a limitation to ensure it does not fall below 4.95 percent. In any year after a reduction year, the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance tax rate will be reduced by a certain percentage, with a minimum limit of 9.9 percent."
