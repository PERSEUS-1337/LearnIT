The Sterling Forest covers 17,500 acres on the New Jersey border, serving as a vital watershed area providing clean drinking water for 25% of the state. It supports various habitats, rare species, and enhances the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, offering recreational opportunities in a densely populated region. The protection of Sterling Forest through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve minimal Federal funds due to stewardship costs being covered by New York and New Jersey.

The Sterling Forest is of clear Federal interest for permanent protection of the watershed, outdoor recreational activities, flora and fauna, and open space. Acquiring the forest is a cost-effective investment compared to the expenses of protecting the region's drinking water if the forest is developed.

Federal funding is authorized for acquisition costs, and the management will be overseen by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
