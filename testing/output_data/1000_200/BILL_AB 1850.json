    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to establish the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act, aimed at educating the public about the historical events of Japanese American exclusion, forced removal, and internment. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was created by Congress in 1980 to review Executive Order 9066's impact on American citizens and recommend remedies. The CWRIC issued reports in 1983 based on 20 days of hearings with over 750 witnesses, including evacuees, government officials, and historians. The CWRIC concluded that the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II was not justified by military necessity, but rather driven by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. This led to a grave personal injustice for American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry. President Ronald Reagan signed the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988, declaring it a great day for America. Congress also declared their support for the act. \"The Congress acknowledges the grave injustice done to citizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry during World War II, apologizing for the violations of civil liberties and constitutional rights. The actions were motivated by racial prejudice and wartime hysteria, resulting in significant human suffering for which appropriate compensation has not been made.\" \"The Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation for the fundamental violations of civil liberties and constitutional rights of individuals of Japanese ancestry during World War II, as appropriate compensation has not been made.\" The Legislature aims to establish a state test for eligible aliens to demonstrate their understanding of English, history, and government to meet federal requirements under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Legislature intends to create a state test for eligible undocumented foreign nationals to prove their English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and government, in line with federal immigration laws. The Superintendent, in consultation with the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, will develop a test to measure the English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and government for eligible foreign nationals, in accordance with federal immigration laws. The Governor, Superintendent, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, President pro Tempore of the Senate, and Speaker of the Assembly will seek approval from the US Immigration and Naturalization Service and Attorney General to use a test for eligible foreign nationals to meet requirements under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Superintendent will distribute a test to educational agencies for eligible foreign nationals to demonstrate English proficiency and knowledge of US history and government for legal status purposes. Test results will be confidential. Eligible agencies will administer a test to assess English proficiency and knowledge of US history and government for eligible foreign nationals seeking legal status. Test results will be kept confidential and can only be released with written consent for educational purposes or to the US Immigration and Naturalization Service upon request. Section 52613 of the Education Code is amended to ensure proper administration of English proficiency and US history and government tests for eligible foreign nationals seeking legal status. Section 52613 of the Education Code requires school districts offering classes for adult nonimmigrant foreign nationals to charge a fee to cover the full costs of instruction, with the fee not exceeding the actual cost. The fee must be adopted at least 90 days before the classes begin. Section 52651 of the Education Code defines key terms for the chapter, including \"Board of Governors,\" \"Chancellor,\" \"Community-based organizations,\" \"Department,\" and \"Educational outreach activities.\" It also specifies that school districts cannot include F-1 visa students in certain adult classes for apportionment purposes. Educational outreach activities for temporary resident foreign nationals involve providing information on federal immigration laws, assistance with adjustment of resident status, rights and responsibilities, access to services, and the importance of identifying oneself as a temporary resident. It excludes client counseling or assuming responsibility for residency status applications. The curr_chunk discusses educational opportunities for immigrants, defining \"immigrant\" and \"newly legalized person\" as per California law. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to educational services for immigrants, including \"Services provider,\" \"SLIAG,\" and \"Superintendent.\" It also amends Section 68062 of the Education Code regarding residency rules. Section 68062 of the Education Code is amended to clarify residency rules, stating that a residence is where one stays when not elsewhere for work or special purposes, and can only be changed by a deliberate act and intent. It emphasizes that a person's residence cannot be derived from their spouse's. The residence can only be changed by deliberate act and intent. A person can establish their own residence, not derived from their spouse's. The residence of an unmarried minor is where they live with a parent, or the last place of abode with a parent. An unmarried minor's residence cannot be changed if a parent is living. An unmarried minor's residence cannot be changed by their own act, appointment of a legal guardian, or relinquishment of a parent's right of control. A foreign national, including an unmarried minor, can establish their residence unless prohibited by federal law. The residence of an unmarried minor foreign national is derived from their parents. Section 68130.5 of the Education Code is amended to exempt certain students from paying nonresident tuition at California State University and California Community Colleges if they meet specific requirements related to high school attendance in California. Students can be exempt from paying nonresident tuition at California State University and California Community Colleges if they meet specific requirements, including graduating from a California high school or equivalent, being registered at an accredited institution in California since 2001, and filing an affidavit if they have unlawful immigration status. The Board of Governors and Trustees will establish rules for implementation. The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges and the Trustees of the California State University will set rules for implementing the exemption of nonresident tuition for eligible students. Student information collected for this purpose is confidential. Reparation payments for Japanese internment survivors after October 1, 1990, will not be considered in determining financial need for applicants. The exemption of nonresident tuition for eligible students will not consider reparation payments for Japanese internment survivors after October 1, 1990, in determining financial need. The federal financial analysis methodology will not include income from reparation payments by the Canadian government for Japanese internment during World War II in assessing financial need. The implementation of Sections 3 to 8 of the act is contingent on the enactment of specific federal legislation by January 20, 2017. The term \"alien\" is replaced with \"foreign national\" for individuals not US citizens. \"Illegal alien\" is replaced with \"undocumented foreign national\" for those unlawfully present. If the Superintendent certifies, Section 2 of the act becomes inoperative."
