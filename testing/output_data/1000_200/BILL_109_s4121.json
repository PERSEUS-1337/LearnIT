    "content": "There is no information provided in the prev_chunk to assist with summarizing the curr_chunk. If an eligible employer elects, within 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, to have this subsection apply, the applicable pension plan shall be treated as having spun off the employer's portion of assets and liabilities to an eligible spunoff plan. The allocation of assets and liabilities from an applicable pension plan to an eligible spunoff plan is determined by the employer. This liability, once determined, replaces any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The ongoing funding liability for an eligible spunoff plan is not subject to certain provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 if elected by the employer within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 exemptions do not apply to plan years before the plan ceases to be an eligible spunoff plan. The employer is responsible for ongoing contributions to the spunoff plan as per pre-amendment laws. The liability under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 exemptions is in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. Interest rates are determined based on pre-amendment laws. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 exemptions apply to eligible spunoff plans, using specific interest rates for plan years before the amendments made by the Act. If a plan terminates, it falls under title IV of ERISA. If an applicable pension plan terminates under title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 on or before December 31, 2010, the employer's liability resulting from the termination shall be determined according to specific assumptions and methods. This liability will replace any other obligations to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the pension plan. If an applicable pension plan is terminated under ERISA, an eligible employer not electing spinoff will be liable to the corporation for the plan's unfunded benefit liabilities as of December 31, 2005. The adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities are the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities with a specific interest assumption for the most recent plan year. The term \"fractional portion\" refers to a fraction representing the contributions made to a pension plan by an employer compared to all employers who did not make a specific election. The term \"applicable pension plan\" refers to a single employer plan. The term \"applicable pension plan\" refers to a single employer plan established in Alaska on March 18, 1967, with 2 or more contributing sponsors, at least 2 of which were not under common control. The \"allocable portion\" is the portion of the plan's liabilities and assets that corresponds to an eligible employer's share of the excess. An eligible employer in an eligible multiple employer plan is determined by the excess of plan liabilities over assets, divided by the total excess amount. Eligible employers are those who participated in the plan after January 1, 2000."
