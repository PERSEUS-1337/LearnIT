It relies on federal government data sources for employment, wage, and unemployment information. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides employment and wage data for the 2012-2016 period, covering over 800 occupations. BLS defines \"employees\" as part-time and full-time workers paid a wage or salary, excluding self-employed individuals. The survey calculates the occupational \"mean wage\" by averaging the wages of all employees in a given occupation. Unemployment data is sourced from the Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census. BLS's Employment Projections supplement CPS data for future employment trends. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses CPS data to supplement OES data in employment projections. BLS's Employment Projections provide occupational and industry employment data for 10-year periods. The latest projections cover the 2016-2026 period and include wage and salary employment patterns. OES data only cover wage and salary, nonfarm employment, while projections also include agricultural industry employment and self-employed data from CPS. The \"Recent Trends in Employment, Wages, and Unemployment\" section analyzes changes in employment, wages, and unemployment from 2012 to 2016. The \"Employment Projections, 2016-2026\" section is based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' biennial projections for this time frame. Various factors impact the size and composition of the U.S. S&E workforce, including economic conditions, technology advancements, funding for research, and labor force skills. The report discusses factors influencing the U.S. S&E workforce, such as research, technology, labor force skills, and business practices. Challenges in comparing OES data over time include changes in classification systems and data collection methods. The report examines challenges in using OES data as a time series, including changes in classification systems and data collection methods. The 2012-2016 time period was chosen for analysis to enhance data comparability and provide a current perspective on trends in S&E occupations. The OES survey maintained consistent occupational categories based on the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification throughout this period. The Bureau of Labor Statistics makes various estimates for employment projections, considering factors like population size and composition. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses various estimates for employment projections, considering factors like population size, labor force participation rates, economic growth, and technological innovation. For its 2016-2026 projections, BLS introduced a new methodology for estimating occupational separations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) introduced a new methodology for estimating occupational separations in its 2016-2026 projections, replacing the previous methodology for estimating occupational replacement needs. BLS identified issues with the accuracy and validity of the old method. Various factors such as immigration laws, technological advances, and consumer preferences can also impact occupational projections. BLS regularly evaluates the accuracy of its projections and publishes these evaluations in its Monthly Labor Review.

These occupations include fields like life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics, which are crucial for U.S. technological leadership and economic strength. The U.S. science and engineering workforce has been a concern for Congress for over 60 years. Efforts have been made to support education and development in STEM fields, including increasing the number of students pursuing S&E degrees. Some policymakers aim to attract more foreign scientists and engineers through visa and immigration policy changes. Various stakeholders have diverse views on the role of scientists and engineers in the United States. Various stakeholders in the United States have differing views on the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce. There are debates on whether there is a shortage of scientists and engineers, the nature of this shortage, and whether government intervention is necessary to address it. The debate over the shortage of scientists and engineers in the United States is ongoing. While some argue that there is a looming shortage that could impact various sectors, others believe that the data does not support this claim. Regardless, increasing the number of scientists and engineers in the country is seen as beneficial for innovation, economic growth, and job creation. Increasing the number of U.S. scientists and engineers is crucial for innovation, economic growth, and job creation. S&E degrees provide valuable skills for various occupations, but government interventions to address shortages may lead to inefficiencies. Government interventions to address shortages in the science and engineering (S&E) labor market, such as incentivizing degree pursuit or increasing immigration quotas, may lead to inefficiencies. Long-term projections for S&E occupations are unreliable due to various factors like technological changes, labor market demographics, and government policies. This unpredictability can result in mismatches between the number of students with S&E degrees and market needs. Shortages in science and engineering (S&E) labor market can be influenced by various factors like changes in prices, retirement behavior, foreign labor availability, demographics, and government policies. Shortages may occur in specific industries or occupations, such as new S&E fields, cyclical industries, and fields restricted to U.S. citizens. Market forces will resolve these shortages through wage adjustments, increased labor supply, or alternative inputs. The labor market for science and engineering (S&E) can experience shortages due to factors like changes in prices, demographics, and government policies. Industry claims of shortages are often driven by a desire to lower labor costs by increasing the supply of young, lower-cost workers. The real issue is a skills mismatch, not a lack of people. Government intervention may be necessary to address these shortages to prevent negative consequences like loss of technological leadership and diminished national security. Expanding immigration can help address the skills mismatch in the science and engineering workforce by bringing in foreign scientists and engineers to meet the specific skills needed by employers. This can benefit the U.S. economy and reduce the loss of U.S.-educated foreign nationals with S&E degrees. Expanding immigration to bring in foreign scientists and engineers may depress wages, increase unemployment, and reduce career opportunities for U.S. students in science and engineering. This could discourage American students from pursuing S&E degrees and careers, as they already lag behind foreign students in STEM knowledge. Federal efforts to improve STEM education are necessary to address this issue. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education in the U.S. as students lag behind their foreign counterparts. This disparity may lead to a shortage of skilled scientists and engineers, impacting economic growth and competitiveness. Federal policies can help strengthen K-12 STEM education, but international assessments may not accurately reflect U.S. student STEM knowledge. Standardized tests comparing U.S. students to other nations may not fully capture their preparedness for STEM degrees and careers. This discrepancy fuels debates on the federal government's role in promoting the S&E workforce. The federal government should play a role in fostering the development of the S&E workforce by increasing the number of students pursuing S&E degrees, admitting more foreign scientists and engineers, promoting diversity in science and engineering, improving K-12 STEM education, and enhancing career information for high school students. Congress should consider these perspectives to bolster U.S. competitiveness and leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry. BLS provides data on the educational composition of S&E occupations to support employment projections. BLS publishes data on the educational composition of occupations using the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS includes a compressed version of the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. The occupational composition of S&E occupations is illustrated in charts, with educational levels below associate's degrees aggregated into a category called \"Less than an Associate's degree.\" This category includes various education levels such as \"less than high school diploma,\" \"high school diploma or equivalent,\" and \"some college, no degree.\" A crosswalk of SOC codes to ACS codes is provided for reference."
