    "title": "AB 1303",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 65961 of the Government Code in California is amended. Section 65961 of the Government Code in California is amended to state that within five years of final map approval for a residential subdivision, a city or county cannot impose new conditions for building permits beyond those previously approved. The amended Section 65961 of the Government Code in California prohibits a city or county from withholding a building permit for failure to meet new conditions imposed beyond those previously approved within five years of final map approval for a residential subdivision. The local agency can impose conditions on building permits for health and safety reasons, to comply with state or federal law, or to ensure compliance with zoning ordinances. The section applies to new city incorporations after 1985 that include areas from a previous map. Conditions imposed by the city must comply with zoning ordinances. Subdivision maps can be extended for three years under certain circumstances. Section 66452.25 allows cities to levy fees or conditions for tentative subdivision maps or parcel maps extended under specific sections. The fee amount can be based on the building permit issuance, including fees not in zoning ordinances. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for the extension of tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps approved within specific counties. The expiration date of these maps can be extended by 24 months if approved between January 1, 2002, and July 11, 2013. If a map was approved within specific counties, the expiration date can be extended by 24 months upon application filed at least 90 days before expiration. The extension is granted if the map is consistent with zoning and general plan requirements in effect when the application is filed. If the zoning and general plan requirements are met, an extension of 24 months can be granted for a tentative map upon application. The map is automatically extended for 60 days or until the extension application is approved, conditionally approved, or denied. If denied, the subdivider can appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, the conditions for applying this section include annual mean household income below 80% of the statewide average and an unemployment rate at least 2.75% higher than the statewide rate. The population for whom poverty status is determined must be at least 4 percent higher than the statewide median poverty rate, based on the American Community Survey. Any approval by a state agency for a development project included in a map extended by this section shall be extended by 24 months. The provisions of Section 65961 regarding conditions for building permits for residential subdivisions are modified for tentative maps extended under this section. No reimbursement is required for this act, as local agencies can cover the costs. This act is an urgency statute for public safety and will take immediate effect. To address expiring development applications in cities and counties due to economic conditions, this act must take immediate effect."
