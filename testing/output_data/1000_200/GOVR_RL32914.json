    "content": "Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a concern for Navy officials and Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates higher funding levels are needed for the Navy's shipbuilding plan. This has led to reduced ship procurement rates and concerns about the future size of the Navy and shipyards. Congress must decide how to address these rising costs, which could impact Navy capabilities and the shipbuilding industry. Options for addressing rising Navy ship procurement costs include increasing funding, changing funding methods, utilizing multiyear procurement, adjusting acquisition strategies, reducing overhead costs, improving yard efficiency, building ships without certain equipment, and considering construction in foreign shipyards. These decisions by Congress could impact Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. One option to reduce Navy ship procurement costs is to shift to designs with lower unit procurement costs, such as lower-cost attack submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface combatants. This report focuses on this option and discusses the potential advantages and disadvantages of making this shift. Recent legislative activity related to this issue is also reviewed. The report reviews recent legislative activity on rising Navy ship procurement costs and proposes lower-cost designs for attack submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface combatants. Options for lower-cost designs include reducing ship size to decrease procurement costs. The Navy can reduce ship procurement costs by implementing changes such as reducing ship size, shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion, and using hulls built to commercial-ship survivability standards. These strategies can save hundreds of millions of dollars in procurement costs. The Navy is considering building ships with commercial-like hulls to reduce costs and improve production economies of scale. This strategy can be applied more widely, such as using a common hull design for multiple ship classes. The Navy plans to use the hull design for its DDG-1000 destroyer as the hull for its CG(X) cruiser. The Navy plans to use a common hull design for its DDG-1000 destroyer and CG(X) cruiser, with the strategy applicable to other ship classes. Reports suggest building various large surface ships using a common merchant-like hull or the LPD-17 class amphibious ship design for cost savings. Lower-cost ship options derived from these approaches may be less capable but offer cost-effective alternatives. The Navy is currently procuring one Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered attack submarine per year at a cost of $2.6 billion each. Potential lower-cost options include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and reduced-cost \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The discussions in the report outline these options for cost savings in ship designs. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs. To support this, they may need to procure 35 boats by FY2022. Options for lower-cost attack submarines include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines and \"Tango Bravo\" nuclear-powered submarines. The Navy is considering procuring reduced-cost SSNs using new \"Tango Bravo\" technologies developed by DARPA as a successor to the Virginia-class design. AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines are being proposed as part of a future Navy fleet, offering extended submerged endurance. These submarines could be acquired alongside Virginia-class boats. The Navy is considering acquiring AIP-equipped submarines to complement the Virginia-class boats. The possibility of procuring one Virginia-class boat plus one or more AIP submarines each year has been suggested. The OFT report recommended substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in each carrier strike group, with an estimated unit procurement cost of $600 million to $750 million for an AIP submarine. The Navy is exploring the option of acquiring AIP-equipped submarines to complement the Virginia-class boats. The cost of procuring one Virginia-class submarine plus one or more AIP submarines annually may be equal to or less than procuring two Virginia-class boats per year. New technologies under development through the Tango Bravo program could potentially allow for the design of a new, more cost-effective SSN with similar capabilities to the Virginia class. TANGO BRAVO, a technology demonstration program by DARPA and the Navy, aims to reduce platform infrastructure and cost for a smaller submarine with similar capabilities as the VIRGINIA Class. The program focuses on overcoming technology barriers in shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal array alternatives, and simplifying existing submarine systems. The TANGO BRAVO program, a collaboration between DARPA and the Navy, aims to develop a smaller submarine with capabilities similar to the VIRGINIA Class. This includes advancements in shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal array alternatives, and simplifying submarine systems. The goal is to design a new submarine with equivalent capabilities to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost, making it more feasible to procure at a rate of two per year. This alternative option is being considered instead of procuring AIP submarines. The Navy and industry officials are discussing a lower-cost option for a new submarine, the Tango Bravo, which could replace the Virginia-class procurement. Design work on the Tango Bravo submarine is underway, with potential options including a medium-sized conventionally powered carrier based on different hull designs. The Navy is currently building large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (CVNs) with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is part of the CVN-21 class and is estimated to cost $10.5 billion. The George H. W. Bush (CVN-77) was the last Nimitz class carrier, procured in FY2001 for $4.975 billion but construction costs rose to $6.1 billion. The Navy is planning to build a new carrier class called the CVN-21 class, with CVN-78 estimated to cost $10.5 billion. Advance procurement funding has been provided since FY2001, with the ship expected to enter service in 2015 if procured in FY2008. CVN-79 is planned for procurement in FY2012, entering service around 2019, while CVN-80 is planned for procurement in FY2016. A lower-cost option involves designing a medium-sized, conventionally powered aircraft carrier based on the design for the LHA Replacement ship currently being developed by the Navy. The Navy is considering different options for new aircraft carriers, including a medium-sized carrier based on the LHA Replacement ship design. The CSBA report recommends procuring CVN-21-class carriers to maintain a force of 10 large carriers and acquiring four medium-sized carriers costing around $3 billion each. The Navy is considering a medium-sized carrier with a notional air wing of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, and UAVs. The carrier would have a full load displacement of 57,000 tons and cost roughly $3 billion. The Navy is considering a new aircraft carrier design based on a medium-sized carrier with a displacement of 57,000 tons. The design includes a notional air wing of 10 manned aircraft and 8 UAVs, with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. This carrier would be slightly larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton aircraft carrier. The Navy is considering a new aircraft carrier design with a displacement of 57,000 tons, including 10 manned aircraft, 8 UAVs, and a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. The proposed ship would be larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton carrier and faster than existing carriers. The design is recommended to replace current large carriers to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. Other potential carrier designs have been discussed, including a large conventionally powered carrier. The Navy is considering a new aircraft carrier design with a displacement of 57,000 tons, including 10 manned aircraft, 8 UAVs, and a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. Other potential designs discussed include a large conventionally powered carrier displacing about 100,000 tons and a medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull. Based on the LHA(R) design, a new aircraft carrier might displace around 40,000 tons and carry about two dozen VSTOL JSFs. The cost of a conventionally powered carrier is estimated at $3 billion, while a nuclear-powered version would exceed $3 billion. This ship is comparable to France's Charles de Gaulle, a nuclear-powered carrier with a displacement of 42,000 tons and an air wing of 34 CTOL airplanes and two helicopters. Additionally, a conceptual design for a small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of 4,000 tons and an air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters was developed by the Naval War College in 2000. Table 1 below outlines the various options for notional aircraft carriers based on ship size, propulsion type, and hull type. Medium-sized carriers of 40,000 to 70,000 tons could operate VSTOL or CTOL aircraft, with larger ships more suited for CTOL operations. Small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft. The Navy has previously procured nuclear-powered cruisers between 9,000 to 17,500 tons, indicating the feasibility of a small nuclear-powered carrier. The Navy procured nine nuclear-powered cruisers between FY1957 and FY1975 with displacements ranging from 9,000 to 17,500 tons. The current design includes the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser, with potential lower-cost options such as an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD) and a 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)). The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers starting in FY2011. The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the CG(X) being larger and more expensive than the DDG-1000. The first two DDG-1000s will have a full-load displacement of about 14,500 tons, costing around $3.3 billion each. The following ships are estimated to cost about $2.5 billion each. The Navy originally planned to procure 16 to 24 DDG-1000 destroyers, but now intends to only acquire 7 as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet. The procurement costs for DDG-1000 ships may be higher than Navy estimates, with the first two ships costing $3.3 billion each and the following ships estimated at $2.5 billion each. The FY2006-FY2011 FYDP reduced planned DDG-1000 procurement to one per year for FY2007-FY2011, totaling five ships through FY2009. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer and a 6,000-ton frigate. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, and a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. Another option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, smaller than the DDG-1000 but incorporating similar technologies and costing less to procure. The new-design ship, known as the SCD, would incorporate technologies from the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs, cost less to procure, have a reduced crew size for lower operation costs, and carry a payload smaller than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but larger than current Ticonderoga cruisers or DDG-51 destroyers. It could be configured for land-attack with two Advanced Gun Systems or for air and missile defense with CG(X) radar capabilities. A smaller, less expensive new-design ship called the FFG(X) has been suggested as an alternative to the SCD. The FFG(X) could displace about 6,000 tons and have a unit procurement cost of around $800 million. It may not be equipped with the AGS for naval gunfire capability like the DDG-1000, but could perform non-gunfire missions similar to the DDG-1000 and LCS. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) is proposed as a replacement for the Navy's FFG-7 class frigates and DD-963 class destroyers, capable of carrying modern mission equipment. Another option is a smaller, less expensive gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship design. The LPD-17 hull design can be equipped with one or two AGSs, with estimated costs of $1.9 billion for the initial ship and $1.5 billion for subsequent ones. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its fleet, which are small, fast surface combatants using modular weapon systems. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as fast surface combatants with modular weapon systems. The procurement cost of each LCS sea frame is aimed to be $220 million, with an estimated total acquisition cost of about $22.1 billion for a program of 55 ships. An alternative recommendation in the OFT report suggests procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant with similar capabilities to the LCS. The OFT report recommends procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for mission packages. These ships would be transported by a \"mother ship\" based on a 57,000-ton hull used for a proposed medium-sized aircraft carrier. The 100-ton surface combatants would be supported in theater by the mother ship and possibly another larger ship recommended by OFT. The lower-cost ship designs can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, and homeporting arrangements. The potential lower-cost ship designs recommended by OFT can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. Developing and designing a large Navy ship can cost billions of dollars, so stopping a currently planned ship program in favor of a new, lower-cost design could incur substantial additional costs but might save money in the long run. Stopping a current ship program for a new, lower-cost design could save money in the long run if the new design is procured in large numbers to offset upfront costs. Using existing technologies can reduce development costs significantly. The cost of developing a new ship design can be reduced by building more ships to that design, as shipyard labor hours decrease with increased familiarity. Procuring a lower-cost design in large numbers can save money in the long run, especially if it can be done at a greater annual rate. The cost of developing a new ship design can be reduced by building more ships to that design, as shipyard labor hours decrease with increased familiarity. Procuring a lower-cost design in large numbers can save money in the long run, especially if it can be done at a greater annual rate. Navy ships are expensive to operate and support, with life-cycle O&S costs potentially exceeding procurement costs in long-term Navy expenditures. Reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S costs can involve design features that increase procurement costs. Personnel costs, including crew size reduction through automation, are a significant component. Maintenance costs may require more durable but expensive parts. Reducing maintenance costs in ship operations may involve using more durable materials or increasing space for easier maintenance access. Alternative ship designs with lower procurement costs may actually have higher life-cycle O&S costs. Nuclear-powered ships have different cost considerations compared to conventionally powered ships. The procurement cost of a nuclear-powered ship includes the cost of the nuclear fuel core, which can power the ship for its entire expected life without additional fuel-related O&S costs. The procurement cost of a nuclear-powered ship includes the cost of the nuclear fuel core, which can power the ship for its entire expected life without additional fuel-related O&S costs. This difference in accounting for fuel costs means that when procurement and life-cycle O&S costs are added together, the difference in cost between a nuclear-powered submarine and a conventionally powered submarine will be smaller than the difference in procurement cost alone. The same can be true in comparing a nuclear-powered carrier to a conventionally-powered carrier, if the cost of the nuclear-powered carrier's second core is less than the cost of the conventionally powered carrier's fuel over its entire life. The higher the price of oil during the conventionally powered carrier's life, the more likely this is to be the case. In theory, higher oil costs in the future could make nuclear power more cost-effective for powering ships compared to conventional power. Nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs due to the need to defuel and transport the reactor compartment. This process could cost around $30-35 million for a nuclear-powered submarine. The cost of decommissioning a nuclear-powered ship at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington state varies depending on the type of vessel. For a nuclear-powered submarine, the cost is around $30-35 million, while for a nuclear-powered carrier with a larger propulsion plant, it could be approximately $570 million. Lower-cost ship designs are generally less capable than higher-cost ones, with the exception of the Tango Bravo SSN, which may match the capabilities of the Virginia-class design. Factors affecting ship capability include payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and the value of ship numbers in naval operations. As Navy combat ships decrease in size, their total payload also decreases due to factors like ship design and propulsion. Smaller ships become proportionately less capable than larger ones, with reduced capacity for sensors, weapons, aircraft, and fuel. For example, as the size of an aircraft carrier is reduced, the weight of embarked aircraft can decline even more quickly. Reducing the size of an aircraft carrier can significantly impact the total weight of embarked aircraft. A medium-sized carrier may only be able to accommodate a smaller air wing compared to a larger carrier, resulting in fewer sorties per day. Transferring the air wing to a larger carrier can increase sortie generation due to its larger flight deck and fuel capacities. Reducing ship size can limit equipment capabilities, such as operating certain aircraft or large radars on smaller carriers or surface combatants. As ship size decreases, total cost to deploy combat-related equipment may increase if fleet payload remains constant. Additionally, shifting to smaller ships to reduce unit procurement costs can result in a fleet design with a higher total procurement cost. The OFT report argues that new technologies can increase payload fraction for recommended smaller surface combatants. Precision-guidance technology allows for smaller warheads to be as effective as larger ones, reducing payload related to weapons without compromising damage capability. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them as undetectable as smaller ships to enemy sensors. They also claim that larger ships are better equipped to withstand hits from weapons compared to smaller ships. Supporters of smaller ships or ships built with commercial-like hulls argue that larger ships being less detectable adds to their cost. They believe a fleet of small ships can overwhelm the enemy's target-tracking capabilities by presenting numerous targets. They also point out that even large ships built to military standards can be sunk or put out of operation, concentrating too much risk in a small number of ships. Supporters of smaller ships argue that a fleet of smaller ships can have superior overall fleet survivability compared to larger ships. They believe that concentrating too much risk in a small number of large ships could reduce their effective utility in high-threat situations. Additionally, equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant fundamentally changes ship mobility. Equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant fundamentally changes ship mobility, creating a true submarine with primary operation below the surface. AIP systems like fuel cells extend submerged endurance for non-nuclear-powered submarines. A conventional diesel-electric submarine has limited submerged endurance of a few days, while an AIP-equipped submarine can last up to two or three weeks submerged. However, high-speed submerged endurance remains low for non-nuclear-powered submarines, limited by battery capacity. In contrast, nuclear-powered submarines can stay submerged for weeks or months, with endurance limited by food supply. A nuclear-powered submarine can stay submerged for weeks or months, limited by food supply. Non-nuclear-powered submarines have limited high-speed submerged endurance, making them unsuitable for long stealthy missions. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines to overseas theaters of operation aboard a transport ship. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines to overseas theaters of operation aboard a transport ship. This allows for the submarines to be detached and redirected to different theaters for various missions, maintaining a level of surprise and effectiveness in multiple areas simultaneously. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in a carrier strike group's theater of operations depends on the submarine's daily tasks and combat capabilities. Nuclear-powered carriers have significant advantages, such as high-speed transits without refueling stops, immediate combat readiness upon arrival, and more internal space for aircraft fuel and ammunition storage. Advocates of higher-speed ships like the LCS argue that their increased speed allows for rapid location shifts and makes them harder to track. Skeptics question the benefits of speeds exceeding 30 knots. Supporters of a larger fleet argue for lower-cost ship designs to increase the number of ships available for deployment. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that shifting to lower-cost ship designs could facilitate a fleet with a larger number of ships, allowing for better day-to-day presence in multiple locations and improved response to simultaneous crises. They suggest that a fleet with more, less-capable ships could offer flexibility in deploying naval capability as needed, rather than deploying high-capability forces at a high daily cost. Additionally, they argue that the force's capability grows with the number of nodes in network-centric warfare. The theory of network-centric warfare states that the force's capability increases with the number of nodes in the network, such as ships, aircraft, and sensors. Advocates argue that a larger fleet with lower-cost ship designs could provide better presence in multiple locations and improved crisis response. However, defenders of a smaller fleet of more expensive ships argue that deploying ships to more locations may be limited if they are less capable designs. They also point out that the Navy has increased the fraction of the fleet ready for deployment in recent years. Advocates of a smaller fleet argue that current ship designs offer flexibility for creating naval formations with sufficient capability. They believe that even with fewer, more expensive ships, the Navy could still engage in network-centric warfare effectively. However, some lower-cost options, like AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, may pose technical risks for the Navy. Some potential technical risks for the Navy include the AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarine, Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarine, 13,500-ton high-speed carrier, and smaller surface combatants due to new technologies. Smaller ships offer more homeporting options, especially for ports with limited berthing spaces. Homeporting nuclear-powered ships is more complex due to unique requirements. Homeporting a nuclear-powered ship or submarine can be challenging due to unique requirements, such as access to a nuclear-certified maintenance shop. Forward-homeporting in a foreign country can be politically difficult if there are anti-nuclear sentiments. Lower-cost ship designs may impact the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work. The total volume of shipbuilding work depends on the funding available for Navy ship procurement. The shift to lower-cost ship designs may impact the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work, depending on how it affects funding for Navy ship procurement. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding leading to no substantial change in shipbuilding work, using lower-cost designs to reduce costs and build fewer ships, or making Navy ships more cost-effective compared to other programs, potentially affecting funding for ship procurement. The shift to lower-cost ship designs may impact Navy shipbuilding work by potentially increasing funding for ship procurement, enabling more shipbuilding work. This could affect the distribution of work among shipyards, particularly for building Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarines. The division of work between shipyards for building submarines could change, potentially impacting U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. NGNN is the only yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers. Ingalls shipyard has been involved in proposals for non-nuclear submarines. If AIP submarines are procured instead of nuclear-powered ones, it could reduce work for nuclear propulsion manufacturers. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers. Other shipyards like Ingalls could build medium-sized conventionally powered carriers. Avondale shipyard and GD/NASSCO could also build conventionally powered carriers. Small, high-speed carriers using SES/catamaran hull design could be built at various yards with experience in building such hulls. NGNN is the only U.S. yard capable of building large nuclear-powered carriers, while other shipyards like Ingalls could build medium-sized conventionally powered carriers. Avondale shipyard and GD/NASSCO could also build conventionally powered carriers. Small, high-speed carriers using SES/catamaran hull design could be built at various yards with experience in building such hulls. If conventionally powered carriers were procured instead of nuclear-powered carriers, it could reduce the workload for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS (particularly Ingalls) and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works (GD/BIW) of Bath, ME. A 11,000-ton SCD, a 6,000-ton FFG(X), or a low-cost gunfire support ship would likely be built at one or both of the same yards, but could also be built at other yards, such as Avondale or NGNN. A low-cost gunfire support ship could be built at NGSS and GD/BIW, or other yards like Avondale or NGNN. Smaller surface combatants, including the LCS, will be built at Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards, and Austal USA. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of H.R. 5122 would limit procurement costs for CVN-21, LHA(R), and LPD-17 class ships. Section 1014 of H.R. 5122 aims to establish a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program to address rising costs and production delays in defense acquisition programs. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about the increasing expenses and longer timelines for developing complex weapons systems, leading to a \"high demand, low density\" situation with fewer platforms being purchased. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about rising costs and development time in defense acquisition programs, leading to a \"high demand, low density\" situation with fewer platforms purchased. This situation increases operational tempos, stresses military personnel, and limits strategic depth in responding to multiple contingencies. The Navy's shipbuilding plan is praised for providing a long-term view for the industry but is criticized for unrealistic assumptions. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's shipbuilding plan, which lacks a view into the future and is criticized for unrealistic assumptions, particularly regarding affordability and cost growth. The plan requires a significant increase in funds and assumes that ship acquisition programs can avoid cost growth. This raises uncertainty about the future of naval shipbuilding. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about the Navy's shipbuilding plan, criticized for unrealistic assumptions and lack of future insight. The committee questions the excess capacity in the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base and directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing capacity for affordability. Additionally, the committee expresses deep concern about the Navy's cost estimates for ships. The House Armed Services Committee is deeply concerned about the Navy's ship cost estimates, noting inaccuracies and exclusions in the process. They recommend revising the process to ensure all major known elements of ship cost are included. The committee recommends revising the ship cost estimate process to include all major elements. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of the bill impose cost limitations on three ship classes based on Navy's latest estimates. Revalidation of cost estimates for CVN-21, LHA Replacement program, and San Antonio class ships is directed for review and approval by the Under Secretary of Defense. The committee directs revalidated cost estimates for ship classes to be reviewed and approved by the Under Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of the Navy must submit a report with cost estimates by July 1, 2006. The committee finds the DD(X) program unaffordable and the Navy had to reduce the number of next-generation destroyers to 7 to make it feasible. The Navy's budget for next-generation destroyers has been reduced from 32 to 7 to make the program affordable. The committee doubts that the original requirements for the destroyer can be met and suggests procuring a smaller, less expensive option in greater numbers. They support building up to two DD(X)s to showcase future technologies for more affordable combatants. The report addresses measures to improve Navy shipbuilding efficiency. The report discusses measures to enhance Navy shipbuilding efficiency, including the maritime technology program aimed at reducing costs and improving competitiveness in ship construction and repair industries. Incentive clauses in recent contracts have allowed for improvements in sequencing and build processes. The committee encourages expanding incentive clauses to all ship procurements, including the Lewis and Clark (T-AKE) class program. A provision creates a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program for grants and loan guarantees to qualified shipyards. This will help lower construction costs and improve productivity in Navy ship procurement. The committee recommends funds for shipbuilding industrial base improvement program and maritime technology program to lower Navy ship procurement costs and enhance competitiveness of U.S. shipyards. They also support the national shipbuilding research program for collaboration on improving efficiency in the shipbuilding industry. The committee recommends $20.0 million in PE 78730N for the national shipbuilding research program, which operates on a 50-50 cost share between government and industry. They also propose providing grants to U.S. shipyards for innovative design and production technologies to improve efficiency in naval vessel construction. The committee recommends grants and loan guarantees to U.S. shipyards for developing innovative technologies and infrastructure in naval vessel construction. They propose $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants and loan guarantees to enhance efficiency and competitiveness in the industry. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees to enhance efficiency and competitiveness in the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industries. Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes funding for long-lead components for aircraft carriers, while Section 123 increases the cost limit on CVN-77 to $6,057 million. The Senate Armed Services Committee notes that low shipbuilding rates drive up costs, creating a downward spiral. The committee recommends increased funding and stable ship requirements to reverse the downward spiral of high shipbuilding costs. Concerns were raised about cost growth on the CVN-77 program, with recommendations to improve affordability for future aircraft carriers through procurement efficiency. The shipbuilder aims to achieve savings for the CVN-21 class program by implementing a stable procurement plan and ordering economic order quantity material for upcoming carriers. The committee recommends increased funding and stable ship requirements to address high shipbuilding costs. To achieve savings for the CVN-21 class program, the Secretary of the Navy is directed to review economic order quantity procurement and submit a report outlining advance procurement requirements for the first three vessels. None of the funds for CVN-79 and CVN-80 advance procurement can be obligated before 30 days following receipt of the report. The report states that the procurement cost for CVN-77 has increased to $6.057 billion due to various factors. The Navy has implemented cost containment measures for CVN-77, including deferring upgrades and minimizing contract change orders. Additional funding for CVN-77 cost growth will be included in future budget requests. The Navy has implemented cost containment measures for CVN-77, including deferral of upgrades not required for safe operation, minimizing contract change orders, and implementing a Lean Six-Sigma program. Despite these actions, the Navy projects CVN-77 costs to exceed the contract ceiling by over 30%. Visibility into cost performance is necessary to assess the effectiveness of these measures and improve affordability for future naval vessel construction. The Navy has implemented cost containment measures for CVN-77, including deferral of upgrades not required for safe operation, minimizing contract change orders, and implementing a Lean Six-Sigma program. Improved visibility into completion cost performance will assist in determining further actions necessary to improve affordability of the future force. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit a quarterly report to provide specific information regarding the CVN-77 ship construction contract. Regarding the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program, the construction of lead LCS vessels at two shipyards adds cost risk until completion in 2007. The report highlights cost risks in the construction of lead LCS vessels at two shipyards until completion in 2007 and 2008. The Navy is advised to prioritize cost control through competition, commonality, and learning curves for the 55 ship class. The committee supports the rapid fielding of LCS for the global war on terror but emphasizes the need for heightened program risk management to ensure affordability and full mission capability. Concerns are raised about apparent cost growth and the rapid ramp-up in LCS procurement compounding the issue. The affordability appeal of the LCS program is overshadowed by cost growth and rapid procurement ramp-up. The Navy lacks a clear acquisition strategy, making it difficult to assess additional costs for training, maintenance, and supply support. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report outlining the acquisition strategy for the LCS program by December 1, 2006. The Navy is directed to submit a report outlining the acquisition strategy for the LCS program by December 1, 2006. The report should include the competition plan, flight strategy, cost containment strategy, R&D and procurement costs, and assess life cycle costs for two dissimilar LCS designs. The National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP-ASE) has helped reduce shipyard costs through collaboration between the Navy and industry. The committee recommends increasing funding by $10.0 million in PE 78730N to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain to reduce material costs in ship construction, and exploring secondary initiatives. The committee recommends increasing funding to support NSRP-ASE efforts, including developing a skilled shipbuilding workforce, establishing a national supply chain to reduce material costs in ship construction, and exploring secondary initiatives. Authorization for funding and cost caps for various classes of aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships is detailed in sections 121-126 of H.R. 5122. Section 125 and 126 of H.R. 5122 establish unit procurement cost caps for LHA(R) amphibious assault ships and LPD-17 class amphibious ships. Section 215 authorizes $4 million for Navy shipbuilding technology proposals. Section 1016 directs the Navy to assess naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. The new procurement cost caps can be adjusted for inflation. Section 122 does not allow the Secretary to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program. The conferees direct the Secretary to assess any negative impact of congressional actions on program costs for the CVN-21 class budget, allowing adjustments for non-recurring design and engineering costs to reduce uncertainties in completing the future class of nuclear powered aircraft carriers. The amendment allows adjustments to the cost limitation for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risks in program execution. The Navy is expected to manage program execution within budget estimates, which may require procurement cost trade-offs affecting capabilities, system performance, safety, crew quality of life, and future growth margin. The Secretary must notify Congress 30 days before implementing any cost-driven reductions. The Secretary must notify Congress 30 days before implementing any cost-driven reductions that impact safety, crew quality of life, or program requirements. The amendment does not allow adjustments to cost limitation amounts for congressional actions affecting the shipbuilding program. The Secretary must notify Congress of any cost-driven reductions that impact safety, crew quality of life, or program requirements. The annual notice to congressional defense committees should include an assessment of any negative impact of congressional action on program costs. The LHA-6 budget represents the Navy's risk-balanced assessment for completing the future LHA Replacement ship. Adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering are allowed to reduce risk in the design effort. The Navy must manage program execution within budget estimates, making cost trade-offs that may impact design and construction of the LHA Replacement ship. The Secretary must notify Congress of any cost-driven reductions affecting safety or crew quality of life at least 30 days prior to implementation. The Secretary must notify Congress at least 30 days before implementing any cost-driven reduction that would impact safety, crew quality of life, or hinder the LHA Replacement program. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of cost control in the Navy's long-range shipbuilding plan, noting the lack of a plan or initiatives to meet cost targets. The Committee urges the Navy to set firm cost targets, develop cost control initiatives, and sign contracts to prevent cost growth in shipbuilding programs. The report recommended reducing $141.4 million from the Navy's FY2007 procurement funding to address cost growth on prior year's ships. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs. The Navy was required to submit a plan to address cost overruns in shipbuilding contracts, which was submitted late and lacked detail. Concerns were raised about the gap between the Navy's statements on cost controls and their actions. Programs like the CVN-77 aircraft carrier are facing cost overruns, with an estimated $867.9 million overrun in the next 3 years. Congressional legislation is needed to raise the cost cap on the program. The legislation aims to raise the cost cap on shipbuilding programs due to significant cost overruns. The Navy's cost performance on various projects is below expectations, jeopardizing future production rates. The Committee is hesitant to provide additional funding without a detailed plan for cost control. The recommended budget for shipbuilding programs is reduced by $141.4 million, with allocations specified for specific programs. The Navy's proposed FY2007 budget includes a reduction of $141.4 million for shipbuilding programs, with allocations specified for CVN-77, SSN-777, SSN-776, SSN-775, and the LPD-17 class. Increasing annual ship-procurement funding may be challenging due to finite defense funding, potentially requiring cuts to other Navy or DOD priorities. Increasing funding for Navy ship procurement may be difficult due to finite defense funding. The Navy has tried to operate more efficiently to save money for procurement, but rising costs in other areas offset these savings. One option is to change how new ships are funded, possibly using incremental funding or advance appropriations to potentially increase the number of ships procured. This could raise issues regarding Congress's power. One option to increase the number of ships procured is to use multiyear procurement (MYP) in Navy ship-procurement programs. However, not all programs may meet the legal requirements for MYP, and it could limit flexibility in adjusting ship-procurement plans in the future. Another option is to change the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships. Changing the acquisition strategy for building certain Navy ships, such as shifting to a single-yard approach, could potentially save $3 billion for building 10 DDG-1000 destroyers. However, this strategy may lead to the second yard exiting the business, leaving the Navy with a single source for that type of ship, limiting competition and innovation in design. Another option is to increase competition in Navy ship acquisition. Increasing competition in Navy ship acquisition could involve using competition between shipyards in awarding contracts for building follow-on ships in each class. This would represent a return to Navy practices in the 1980s and requires a high annual procurement rate or government willingness to ensure financial health of shipyards. The government could consider giving ships to shipyards without risking their financial health or leading to a yard permanently exiting the shipbuilding business. Another option is to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs by eliminating excess capacity or increasing other types of work to absorb these costs. The government could reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs by eliminating excess capacity or increasing other types of work to absorb these costs, such as construction of ships for other U.S. government agencies or improving operating efficiency through advanced design and production processes. The 2005 DOD report compares the operating efficiency of U.S. shipyards building Navy ships with foreign shipyards, suggesting building ships without some planned equipment to reduce costs, with the option to add it later at a higher cost. Installing equipment on an in-service ship may be more costly than building it into the ship during its original construction. This strategy could increase the total procurement cost of the ship in the long run. Another option is to build Navy ships in foreign shipyards to potentially lower construction costs. However, U.S. law restricts the construction of vessels for the armed forces in foreign shipyards, with exceptions allowed for national security reasons. The provision allows for exceptions to construct Navy ships in foreign shipyards if in the national security interest, with notification to Congress and a 30-day waiting period. It exempts inflatable boats and rigid inflatable boats. The annual DOD appropriations act prohibits using funds for constructing naval vessels in foreign facilities for major components. The RAND Corporation report discusses the increased cost of Navy ships today compared to the past and suggests ways to reduce these costs."
