    "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean reflects the diversity of countries in the region, with some still receiving aid for political, socioeconomic, and security challenges, while others have outgrown U.S. assistance but receive support for new security challenges. Despite progress, foreign aid continues to play a role in advancing U.S. policy in the region. Foreign aid in Latin America and the Caribbean is evolving, with less reliance on U.S. assistance. However, Congress still oversees aid programs and considers budget cuts. The Budget Control Act of 2011 may lead to reduced aid budgets. This report provides an overview of U.S. assistance in the region. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) may decrease aid budgets for Latin America and the Caribbean. This report outlines historical and recent trends in U.S. assistance to the region, including the Obama Administration's FY2013 request. It also discusses key funding provisions in foreign aid bills and potential congressional issues. The United States has been a significant contributor to foreign assistance in the region since the 1960s. U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean increased in the early 1960s with President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress to counter Soviet and Cuban influence. Aid spiked again in the 1970s to support the Contras and combat leftist insurgencies. Assistance declined in the mid-1990s but began to rise again in the late 1990s. U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean increased in the late 1990s and continued to rise in the past decade, with a focus on humanitarian and development aid. Initiatives like PEPFAR and MCC provided new sources of assistance, while the Obama Administration emphasized economic growth in the region. The United States has increased foreign aid to Latin America and the Caribbean, with a focus on economic growth and development. Aid was also provided to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. However, a significant portion of aid was directed towards counternarcotics and security programs in Colombia and its Andean neighbors. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, a U.S. counterdrug and anticrime assistance package for Mexico and Central America, was announced in FY2008. In FY2010, separate initiatives were created for Central America (CARSI) and the Caribbean (CBSI). U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has been declining since FY2010, with a decrease in assistance levels each year. Between FY2008 and FY2012, U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from $2.1 billion to $1.9 billion, reflecting a 10% decline. Aid to other regions also saw changes, with increases in South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. This shift in aid distribution aligns with changes in global conditions and U.S. foreign policy priorities. The United States has shifted resources towards development efforts in Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, leading to a decrease in U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean from 10% in FY2008 to under 8% in FY2012. The Obama Administration has focused on development and humanitarian assistance programs in the region to promote economic progress and social stability. The United States has shifted resources towards development efforts in Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, leading to a decrease in U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. Funding is used for long-term projects in economic reform, democracy promotion, basic education, human health, and environmental protection. Humanitarian assistance focuses on immediate alleviation of emergencies, including food assistance and aid for refugees. USAID manages most programs, while the State Department administers the Migration and Refugee Assistance account and a portion of the global health account for HIV/AIDS. Economic Support Fund is used for promoting U.S. economic, political, or security interests. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) account is a key component of U.S. assistance to the region, managed by USAID in conjunction with the State Department. It funds programs for political and economic stability, often overlapping with development and humanitarian assistance efforts. Security assistance programs in the region address security concerns, with funding from the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account supporting counternarcotics and law enforcement projects. The INCLE account supports counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts, while the NADR account focuses on countering global threats like terrorism and weapons proliferation. The U.S. also provides military support to Latin American and Caribbean countries through the FMF and IMET accounts. Aid levels to the region have decreased, leading to a shift towards development and humanitarian assistance over security. In recent years, U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean has shifted towards development and humanitarian assistance, with a decrease in security assistance. In FY2012, over $730 million was provided for development and humanitarian programs, representing 39% of total bilateral assistance. Another $466 million, or 25% of total assistance, supported U.S. strategic interests. Additionally, nearly $700 million was provided for security efforts through various aid accounts. In FY2012, the United States provided nearly $700 million in aid to Latin American and Caribbean countries for security efforts, representing 37% of total bilateral assistance. Haiti, Colombia, and Mexico were top recipients of U.S. foreign aid. Haiti received significant aid post-earthquake for long-term development, while Colombia has received aid through \"Plan Colombia\" since FY2000. In recent years, U.S. aid to Colombia and Mexico has decreased as the security situation improved. The focus has shifted towards economic and social development efforts rather than costly military equipment. In FY2012, the United States provided $357 million for Haiti, $379 million for Colombia, and $330 million for Mexico, with these countries receiving over 56% of all aid to the region. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean is approximately $1.7 billion, representing a decrease in assistance compared to previous years. The proposed cuts in funding are widespread, with every account except Development Assistance seeing a decrease in funding levels. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean is approximately $1.7 billion, with widespread cuts in funding for every account except Development Assistance. Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and Guyana would see significant cuts, while Colombia and Mexico would experience the largest declines in assistance. El Salvador is the only country receiving a substantial increase in aid as part of the \"Partnership for Growth Initiative.\" The emphasis of U.S. aid in the region is shifting towards development and humanitarian assistance, with over $698 million allocated for these purposes, representing a 4% decrease in total funding for development. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean is approximately $1.7 billion. Humanitarian assistance would receive over $698 million, representing a 4% decrease in total funding for development and humanitarian assistance compared to FY2012. The request also includes $434 million through the Economic Support Fund account, a 7% decline from FY2012. Security assistance would account for $567 million, a 33% of U.S. aid, with a decrease of about 19% compared to FY2012. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean is approximately $1.7 billion. Assistance within the Western Hemisphere is distributed with 36% going to Mexico and Central America, 29% to the Caribbean, 27% to the Andean nations of South America, and 1% to Brazil and the Southern Cone. The final 7% is dedicated to regional programs spanning multiple sub-regions. The United States provided Mexico and Central America with $27.5 billion in foreign assistance between FY1980 and FY2010, with over 91% in economic aid. El Salvador received the most assistance, followed by Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, and Belize. U.S. aid to the region has decreased each decade since the 1980s, with Central America being a major focus during that time to counter Soviet influence. During the 1980s, the United States prioritized Central America for foreign aid to counter Soviet influence and support allied governments. Over the decade, $12.8 billion was provided, with 43% going to El Salvador. Aid decreased in the 1990s and further declined to $5.9 billion between FY2000 and FY2009. Despite the decrease, new aid initiatives benefited several countries in the region. Between FY2000 and FY2009, foreign aid to America and Mexico declined to $5.9 billion in 2010 U.S. dollars. Despite the decrease, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua received MCC compacts, while Mexico started receiving significant aid through the M\u00e9rida Initiative. In FY2010, Mexico and Central America received almost $1.3 billion in U.S. assistance, with 57% going to Mexico. In FY2011 and FY2012, Mexico and Central America received $532.4 million and $696.2 million, respectively, in U.S. assistance. In FY2011 and FY2012, Central America received $532.4 million and $696.2 million in U.S. assistance, with Mexico accounting for over 45% of aid. The FY2013 request for the sub-region is $619.8 million, with Mexico receiving $269.5 million, a decrease from the previous year. The decline in U.S. assistance to Mexico is due to a shift in the M\u00e9rida Initiative towards training and capacity building programs. The FY2013 U.S. assistance to Mexico under the M\u00e9rida Initiative focuses on providing technology, training, and equipment to strengthen law enforcement entities, combat criminal organizations, and support justice sector reform efforts. Aid also includes human rights training for the military, partnerships with universities, private sector competitiveness reforms, and climate change mitigation efforts. Congress has mandated withholding 15% of assistance until certain conditions are met. Since FY2008, Congress has required the State Department to withhold 15% of FMF and INCLE assistance for Mexico until certain human rights conditions are met. The countries of the \"Northern Triangle\" of Central America\u2014Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador\u2014face challenges in combating organized crime. Security assistance for these countries is provided through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI). Guatemala would receive about $93.6 million in U.S. assistance under the FY2013 request, with a focus on Development Assistance projects. The FY2013 U.S. assistance request for Guatemala includes funding for various projects such as trade capacity building, environmental conservation, education, combating trafficking, and improving food security and healthcare access. Additionally, there is a focus on training and equipping security forces to enhance border control. U.S. assistance to Guatemala has been conditioned since 2005, with support for the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). Honduras would receive $58.2 million in U.S. assistance. Honduras would receive $58.2 million in U.S. assistance under the FY2013 request, with the majority of aid allocated to decentralize governance, improve service delivery, ensure transparency in elections, enhance education quality, and implement a food security strategy. Health assistance would support the national HIV/AIDS strategy and health system reform. Security forces would receive training and equipment to improve civil-military relations and government control in remote areas. 20% of the assistance appropriated in FY2012 for security would be withheld by the State Department.

El Salvador would receive $41.8 million in U.S. assistance in FY2013, an increase of $12.6 million or 43% over the FY2012 estimate. El Salvador is one of four countries selected for the Partnership for Growth initiative to foster economic growth. Crime, insecurity, and lack of competitiveness are identified as constraints on growth in El Salvador. About 93% of U.S. assistance for El Salvador in FY2013 was requested through the DA account. In FY2013, U.S. assistance for El Salvador through the DA account would support security and justice sector reforms, anti-corruption efforts, education systems, public administration, and private sector competitiveness. Assistance would also strengthen Salvadoran security forces and border control. U.S. aid to Nicaragua would decrease by $390,000 under the FY2013 request. U.S. aid to Nicaragua has declined substantially in recent years due to difficult relations with President Daniel Ortega and concerns about democratic governance. Majority of the requested funds would be directed towards democracy promotion projects, market-oriented economic policies, and resource management. Some assistance would also be provided to the Nicaraguan military for counternarcotics efforts. The USAID Missions in Belize and Costa Rica closed in 1996, and the USAID Mission in Panama is expected to close in September 2012. Despite this, these countries still receive small amounts of U.S. assistance, with a $6.4 million allocation under the FY2013 request, a 56% increase over the FY2012 estimate. This assistance includes equipment and training for security forces to combat drug trafficking and other security threats. Additionally, Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama benefit from regional programs, with $29.7 million allocated for USAID's Central America Regional program in the FY2013 request. The FY2013 request includes $29.7 million for USAID's Central America Regional program, which supports Central American priorities such as HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, trade capacity building, environmental initiatives, and the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) with $107.5 million allocated.

Additionally, CARSI supports prevention efforts to reduce drug demand and provide educational opportunities for at-risk youth. CARSI supports prevention efforts to reduce drug demand and provide educational opportunities for at-risk youth in the region. Funding for CARSI comes from the State Department's Western Hemisphere Regional program, with assistance provided bilaterally to Central American nations and for regional projects. The breakdown of CARSI funding by country is not publicly available. From FY1980 to FY2010, the United States provided almost $14 billion in assistance to the Caribbean, with the majority being economic aid. In the 1980s, U.S. aid to the Caribbean totaled about $5.5 billion in 2010 dollars, with the majority going to Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. In the 1990s, aid declined to about $3 billion, with Haiti receiving the largest share at 46%, followed by Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

HIV/AIDS assistance also rose significantly, especially to Haiti and Guyana. Aid for hurricane recovery and reconstruction was provided to countries like Grenada, Haiti, and Jamaica. Assistance to the region surged in FY2010 to almost $1.7 billion, largely due to Haiti's earthquake. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was launched in FY2010 to support efforts to reduce illicit trafficking and enhance citizen security. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was initiated in FY2010 to increase assistance to Caribbean countries for reducing illicit trafficking, promoting citizen security, and social justice. U.S. aid to the Caribbean totaled $572 million in FY2011 and $522 million in FY2012, with a requested amount of $492 million for FY2013. Haiti received the majority of funding, followed by smaller programs for the Dominican Republic, Eastern Caribbean countries, and Cuba. For FY2013, Haiti would receive over two-thirds of U.S. assistance to the Caribbean, focusing on reconstruction after the earthquake. Efforts to alleviate poverty, promote stability, and strengthen democratic processes in Haiti are key congressional concerns. The U.S. government's post-earthquake strategy for Haiti includes pillars such as infrastructure, food security, health services, and governance. Thomas C. Adams manages the assistance program for Haiti. Thomas C. Adams manages the U.S. assistance program for Haiti, focusing on security, health, governance, and economic growth. USAID leads the efforts, coordinating with other agencies, the Haitian government, and NGOs. Over 1.5 million Haitians were in tent camps post-earthquake, with 36% remaining in early 2012. Efforts also address a cholera outbreak that began in 2010, affecting almost half a million people. The fall of 2010 earthquake in Haiti killed almost 7,000 people by early 2012, with half a million affected. U.S. assistance aims to stimulate economic growth outside Port-au-Prince. The FY2013 foreign aid request includes programs for various Caribbean countries to combat HIV/AIDS and support security forces. In the Eastern Caribbean, a $35.2 million program in Bridgetown, Barbados, supports assistance activities for Barbados and the six countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The aid focuses on HIV/AIDS programs. In the Dominican Republic, over half of the $29.8 million FY2013 request supports global health activities for HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health. In the Dominican Republic, the $29.8 million FY2013 request includes support for global health activities focused on HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health. For Cuba, the Administration is requesting $15 million for humanitarian assistance to political prisoners and their families, strengthening civil society, and promoting uncensored information flow. Congress had previously appropriated $20 million annually for such assistance from FY2009 to FY2012. In 2010 and 2011, congressional holds delayed assistance due to concerns about program effectiveness. Alan Gross, a USAID subcontractor in Cuba, has been imprisoned since 2009. In Guyana, the FY2013 request is nearly $7 million, reflecting decreased assistance as HIV/AIDS efforts have improved. USAID's Mission in Guyana is closing for budgetary reasons. In Guyana, the FY2013 program will be managed by USAID's Mission in Barbados due to budgetary reasons. In Jamaica, the FY2013 bilateral request is for $5.4 million to support basic education and climate change adaptation, along with regional HIV/AIDS assistance. Additionally, $59 million is requested for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative to combat illicit trafficking and promote security and social justice in the region. The Obama Administration developed the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) in 2009 and 2010 to promote safety, security, and social justice in the Caribbean region. Funding for the program has totaled $203 million since FY2010, with assistance in areas such as maritime security, law enforcement capacity building, border security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention for at-risk youth. However, the State Department does not provide a breakdown of CBSI assistance by country, making it challenging to determine the level of aid each Caribbean nation receives. The United States provided about $25 billion in assistance to Andean countries from FY1980 through FY2010, with Colombia receiving the highest percentage of aid. It is challenging to determine the level of aid Caribbean countries receive under the CBSI program. Since the 1980s, the United States has provided approximately $25 billion in assistance to Andean countries, with Colombia receiving the largest share. Assistance to the region has focused on development, food aid, and narcotics-related efforts to reduce illicit drug flow to the U.S. Aid to the Andean region more than doubled from FY2000 to FY2009, reaching about $14.3 billion in 2010 dollars, with Colombia receiving the majority of assistance. In the 2010s, the United States provided significant assistance to Andean countries, with Colombia receiving the largest share of almost $8.8 billion. The aid focused on drug eradication, alternative development, and support for the Colombian military. Peru and Bolivia also received substantial amounts of aid, with assistance declining annually in the second half of the decade. In FY2010, aid to the Andean region totaled $1.2 billion, with Colombia accounting for almost 70% of the aid. In FY2011 and FY2012, U.S. assistance to the Andean region totaled $621 million and $516 million respectively, with a requested amount of $452 million for FY2013. Colombia received 73% of the aid in those years. The FY2013 request shows a 12% decrease in assistance to the region, with Colombia accounting for most of the decline. Other Andean countries would see reductions in aid compared to FY2012 estimates - Bolivia (22%), Peru (11%), and Venezuela (50%). Colombia's $332 million request for FY2013 makes up 73% of U.S. assistance to the region. The FY2013 request of $332 million for Colombia represents 73% of U.S. assistance to the Andean region. The $47 million reduction in aid reflects Colombia's progress in improving security and funding its own programs. U.S. assistance now focuses on supporting Colombia's National Consolidation Plan to re-establish state control in areas previously controlled by armed groups. The National Consolidation Plan (NCP) aims to regain state control in areas once held by illegal armed groups in Colombia. The strategy includes security, counternarcotics, and economic and social development efforts, supported by the U.S. through the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI). This assistance encompasses drug eradication, capacity building for military and police units, land restitution reforms, human rights protection, and support for vulnerable populations. U.S. aid to the Colombian military is tied to human rights compliance and severing ties with paramilitaries. The proposed $73.7 million in assistance for Peru aims to strengthen democracy through social and economic inclusion, improved governance, and environmental stewardship. The aid includes funding for alternative development programs, health and education services, decentralization of social services, reforms in basic education, conservation of natural resources, and poverty alleviation activities targeting rural areas. Additionally, programs funded by the assistance seek to increase drug eradication and interdiction capabilities, improve anti-money laundering efforts, strengthen the judicial system, and reduce drug use. The $22.2 million FY2013 request for Bolivia aims to increase drug eradication and interdiction capabilities, improve anti-money laundering efforts, and strengthen the judicial system. U.S.-Bolivian relations have deteriorated since 2008, with the expulsion of the U.S. Ambassador and the DEA. Despite annual determinations of Bolivia's failure to meet narcotics agreements, U.S. bilateral assistance programs continue. The aid would also fund health sector activities to reduce maternal and child mortality and increase family planning services. For the FY2013 request, aid would fund health sector activities to reduce maternal and child mortality, support local government management capabilities, protect biodiversity, promote sustainable use of natural resources, and provide limited support for counternarcotics efforts in Bolivia. In Ecuador, the majority of the $21.3 million request would fund projects supporting alternative development programs, local governments, citizen participation in democratic processes, economic development, and biodiversity conservation. The United States provides aid for counternarcotics operations in Bolivia and democracy assistance in Ecuador and Venezuela. Assistance focuses on modernizing police and military capacity, supporting nongovernmental organizations, and promoting citizen participation in democratic processes. The United States provided Brazil and countries in the Southern Cone of South America with $1.6 billion in foreign assistance between FY1980 and FY2010, with most of it in economic aid. The FY2013 request is for $3 million in democracy assistance to promote good governance and citizen participation. Between FY1980 and FY2010, the United States provided $1.6 billion in foreign assistance to Brazil and countries in the Southern Cone, with most of it in economic aid. Assistance to the region increased in each decade, reaching $741 million between FY2000 and FY2009. In FY2010, Brazil and the Southern Cone countries received $109 million in U.S. aid. In FY2011 and FY2012, the United States provided Brazil and the Southern Cone countries with $33.3 million and $23.9 million, respectively. The FY2013 request for the sub-region is $14.4 million, a 40% decrease from the previous year. Brazil received over 70% of the funding in FY2011 and FY2012, with a proposed $6.2 million in assistance for FY2013. The FY2013 request for Brazil would provide $6.2 million in U.S. assistance, focusing on promoting development in third countries through projects in agriculture, food security, and school feeding programs. This assistance aims to strengthen the Brazilian Cooperation Agency and support HIV/AIDS programs. The FY2013 request for Brazil includes support for HIV/AIDS programs and counternarcotics efforts, as well as cooperation between Brazilian and U.S. military forces. Paraguay would receive $5.9 million to improve justice sector transparency, civil service oversight, and small farmer productivity. In FY2013, U.S. assistance to Paraguay would focus on improving small farmers' productivity and access to markets. The remaining aid would support security efforts through training and equipment for the military and counternarcotics operations. Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, with higher incomes than Paraguay, would receive a combined $2.3 million in U.S. aid for military modernization and peacekeeping efforts. The U.S. would provide military assistance to Argentina and Chile to modernize their forces, improve interoperability with U.S. forces, and enhance capacities for international peacekeeping missions. Additionally, both countries would receive $270,000 in NADR funds for port security, export controls, and anti-terrorism initiatives. Various regional programs, including CARSI and CBSI, provide assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean.

SPTF funding for IAF will decrease significantly in future years. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provides economic assistance to developing nations based on certain indicators. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 to provide economic assistance to developing nations based on specific indicators. MCC awards compacts and threshold programs to countries, with three Latin American and Caribbean countries receiving compacts and three others receiving threshold programs. In total, $886.7 million in assistance has been provided. El Salvador signed a $461 million compact with the MCC in November 2006 to develop its northern border region, focusing on improving infrastructure, human capital, and supporting small farmers and businesses. The compact was completed in September 2012. In December 2011, MCC announced that El Salvador is eligible for a second compact proposal, expected to be finalized in 2013. Honduras signed a $215 million economic growth compact in June 2005, focusing on rural development and transportation projects. MCC terminated $10 million in funding for Honduras in 2009, reducing the total funding to $205 million. Honduras completed the compact in September 2010, and MCC decided not to renew it in January 2011. Honduras completed a $215 million compact in September 2010, but MCC decided not to renew it due to poor performance on corruption. However, Honduras is eligible for a $20 million threshold program to address corruption. Nicaragua signed a $175 million compact in July 2005 focusing on economic growth in the western region with projects in transportation, rural development, and property regularization. MCC suspended and terminated $61.5 million in funding for Nicaragua. The MCC suspended and terminated $61.5 million in funding for Nicaragua after disputed elections in 2008, reducing the total funding for the compact to $113.5 million. The compact ended in May 2011. Additionally, MCC awarded threshold programs to Guyana and Paraguay to improve fiscal policy and reduce corruption. Paraguay and Peru received MCC funding for programs focusing on reducing corruption and improving various sectors. The Peace Corps has had almost 65,000 volunteers in Latin America and the Caribbean since 1961, with 2,600 volunteers in 22 countries working on development projects. The Peace Corps has had almost 65,000 volunteers in Latin America and the Caribbean since 1961, with 2,600 volunteers in 22 countries working on development projects. Program funding for Latin America and the Caribbean amounted to almost $65 million in FY2011 and an estimated $61 million in FY2012, with about $60 million slated for FY2013. Due to budget cuts, the number of volunteers in the region is expected to decline to 1,800 by the end of FY2013, leading to reductions in most countries except Colombia. The Peace Corps plans to close programs in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Suriname as a result of the Country Portfolio Review. The Peace Corps closed programs in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Suriname in FY2012 and FY2013 due to security concerns in upper-middle-income countries. Operations have been suspended in Latin American and Caribbean countries in the past, such as Haiti in 2005 and Bolivia in 2008. In January 2012, volunteers were pulled out of Honduras due to high levels of violence. In December 2011, a volunteer in San Pedro Sula was shot during a robbery attempt, leading to the suspension of the Honduras program in September 2012. Volunteer training classes were cancelled in El Salvador and Guatemala due to security concerns, but programs continue with plans to send new volunteers in 2013. The Obama Administration's priorities for U.S. policy in Latin America include promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. The US foreign aid budget request for Latin America prioritizes citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean, accounting for 45% of the total. The Administration emphasizes an integrated partnership to strengthen institutions, address crime root causes, and ensure long-term public security. Additionally, Haiti receives 20% of aid to support earthquake recovery efforts. The FY2013 US foreign aid budget request prioritizes assistance for Haiti, allocating 20% of aid to support earthquake recovery, sanitation, and health services. \"Peace and Security\" assistance accounts for 30% of aid, focusing on counternarcotics, counterterrorism, and security sector reform. \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" receives 24% of aid for rule of law and human rights projects, while \"Investing in People\" accounts for 23% for traditional aid programs. The FY2013 US foreign aid budget request prioritizes assistance for Haiti, allocating 20% of aid to support earthquake recovery, sanitation, and health services. The program area of \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" receives 24% of aid for rule of law, human rights, and good governance projects. The request is about 10% less than the amount provided in FY2012 and takes advantage of favorable development trends in the region. USAID plans to close its mission in Panama, manage programs for Guyana from Barbados, reduce aid to Colombia and Peru, and withdraw from sectors where progress has been made. Concerns have been raised about a proposed 10% decrease in aid for Latin America and the Caribbean. There is agreement on the importance of maintaining assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in Mexico. Some Members express concerns about declines in assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. Assistance for Haiti's recovery is a point of consensus, with calls for transparency and accountability in the aid program. Opposition exists towards portions of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding for Latin American and Caribbean countries, including the Global Climate Change Initiative and increases in funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Some Members opposed increases in funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua, citing concerns about their governments undermining U.S. interests and disregarding the rule of law. There were also objections to cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela, seen as crucial for democracy advocates. House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations measure, with reductions in worldwide foreign aid funding from the Administration's request. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations measure, proposing reductions in worldwide foreign aid funding. The House version could potentially lead to significant cuts in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. Members of Congress are urged to consider if the FY2013 request aligns with U.S. interests and objectives in the region, and if there are effective metrics in place to evaluate aid programs. The effectiveness of aid programs in Latin America and the potential impact of proposed aid cuts for FY2013 are key considerations for Congress. Resource coordination among U.S. government agencies and international donors is crucial to maximize the impact of foreign assistance funds in the region. U.S. foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is managed by various government agencies, including the State Department, USAID, and DOD. Lack of coordination among these agencies may lead to unnecessary overlap in aid efforts. Improved coordination could ensure complementary efforts and increase the impact of aid programs. Congress should consider the benefits of better coordination among agencies providing assistance. According to the OECD, Latin America and the Caribbean received $10.7 billion in development assistance in 2010. The United States contributed $2.7 billion (25%), other bilateral donors provided $5.1 billion (48%), and multilateral organizations gave $2.8 billion (26%). Studies show a lack of coordination among donors, leading to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could enhance the impact of aid programs. Donors in Latin America and the Caribbean face challenges in coordinating their efforts, leading to duplicated programs and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could improve efficiency and ensure complementary efforts, but disagreements on leadership and division of labor pose obstacles. Strategic interests also play a role, as focusing aid on specific sectors or countries may impact donors' strategic objectives. The United States has started collaborating with successful countries in the region to provide assistance to third countries. The United States is working with successful countries in Latin America to provide assistance to third countries. Trilateral cooperation agreements have been signed with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to access new solutions and expertise, combining best practices with financial resources. Assistance includes strengthening development agencies and implementing joint programs in agriculture, food security, and education. The House FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill recommends $18.6 million to support Colombian government efforts in counternarcotics and law enforcement. Critics raise oversight concerns about providing assistance through foreign governments. Members of Congress may need to clarify the roles of U.S. agencies providing foreign assistance. The need for clarifying roles of U.S. agencies providing foreign assistance and ensuring funds are used in accordance with U.S. law, along with examining political will and program sustainability in Latin American and Caribbean nations, are key considerations for Congress. When considering foreign assistance levels for Latin American and Caribbean nations, Congress may examine political will and program sustainability. The State Department's QDDR suggests assessing host nations' political will to implement reforms effectively using U.S. assistance. Without partner nations' commitment to reforms and program ownership, the impact of U.S. aid may be limited. Latin American and Caribbean nations vary in their demonstration of political will and program sustainability. The Colombian government has shown political will and program sustainability, allowing the United States to gradually reduce aid as Colombia takes over responsibility. USAID is also closing missions in Panama and ending family planning programs in other Latin American countries due to their improved capacity to manage and fund programs independently. However, GAO reports highlight a lack of political will in the region, particularly in raising sufficient government revenue to sustain efforts initiated with U.S. support. The region has often lacked sufficient government revenue to sustain efforts initiated with U.S. support, leading to problems with program sustainability. Studies have shown that U.S.-funded programs in Latin America have struggled due to a lack of resources, including fuel and maintenance for equipment provided. Even MCC-funded projects have faced challenges in partner nations lacking the resources for long-term maintenance. The lifespan of roads built to improve small farmers' access to markets may be limited due to municipalities lacking equipment, expertise, and funding for maintenance. Questions for Congress to consider regarding foreign aid appropriations for Latin American and Caribbean countries include assessing the host country's capacity for maintenance, financial responsibility, technical and financial assistance needed for sustainability, political will for reforms, and the use of public-private partnerships. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up FY2013 appropriations bills for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs in May 2012. The House bill totaled $48.3 billion, while the Senate bill totaled $52.3 billion. Total funding levels in FY2013 would have been lower than the FY2012 estimate and the Obama Administration's FY2013 request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up its FY2013 bill (S. 3241) totaling $52.3 billion, including $50 billion for the core State Department and Foreign Operations budget. The bill was 2.3% lower than the FY2012 estimate and 4.7% lower than the Administration's request. The Obama Administration criticized the House bill for exceeding agreed-upon cuts and potentially damaging national security. Funding levels for Latin America and the Caribbean were uncertain under both bills. The House and Senate bills for FY2013 did not specify foreign assistance levels for Latin America and the Caribbean, but expressed concerns over regional conditions and intentions to provide assistance above the Administration's request. The House report emphasized the need for robust support for counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts in key countries like Mexico and Colombia. The Senate report (S.Rept. 112-172) calls for continued robust support for counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean to combat drug trafficking and violent crime. Additional resources are recommended to strengthen democratic institutions and address poverty in the region. The committee reports recommend additional funds to strengthen democratic institutions and address poverty in the region, with specific funding levels for Colombia and Mexico. The House report suggests increased funding for ESF, FMF, and INCLE for Colombia, while the Senate report recommends funds for alternative development and institution building in Colombia. The Senate report recommended increased funding for alternative development and institution building in Colombia, as well as additional economic development activities along the U.S.-Mexican border. The House report suggested funding for anti-crime and counternarcotics efforts in Mexico, with a focus on democracy programs in Venezuela. The House report recommended funding levels above the Administration's request for democracy programs in Cuba, conservation programs in the Brazilian Amazon, and regional security programs in CARSI and CBSI. The Senate report supported the requested levels for regional security programs and capped funding for democracy programs in Cuba at the requested level. The Senate report recommended increased funding for conservation programs in the Brazilian Amazon and the Inter-American Foundation, while the House report did not mention these programs. Congress did not take action on H.R. 5857 or S. 3241, instead passing a six-month continuing resolution (P.L. 112-175) that expired in March 2013. New legislation (P.L. 113-6) was then approved to fund federal programs through the end of FY2013, maintaining funding levels similar to FY2012 with some exceptions. Funding for State Department and Foreign Operations accounts in FY2013 was maintained at FY2012 levels with some exceptions, but was subject to budget sequestration cuts. Sequestration reduced funding by about 5%, applied at the account level, leading to country-level allocations for FY2013 not being available yet."
