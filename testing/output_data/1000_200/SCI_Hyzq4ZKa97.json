    "content": "In this study, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to evaluate deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. NetScore aims to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity. This metric is part of a comparative analysis that includes the top-1 accuracy metric and the information density metric. In a comprehensive analysis of deep neural networks, the NetScore metric, top-1 accuracy, and information density were compared across 60 different networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The results serve as a reference for practitioners in the field amidst growing interest in deep learning. The design of deep neural networks that balance accuracy and complexity is a hot area of research focus. Assessing network architecture balance is a key challenge, with information density being a widely cited metric. However, information density does not consider computational requirements for network inference. In this study, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture. The goal is to improve network model search and design by considering these factors. The set of deep convolutional neural networks evaluated includes AlexNet BID22. The study introduces a new metric called NetScore to evaluate deep convolutional neural networks, including AlexNet BID22. It aims to improve network model search and design by considering accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture. The networks are shown in Fig. 1(right)."
