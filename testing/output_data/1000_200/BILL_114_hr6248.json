    "content": "The \"Spending Safeguard Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a spending limitation on direct spending programs. The Spending Safeguard Act establishes a spending limitation for direct spending programs, set by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget within 90 days of enactment. The limitation is determined based on the program's cost, ranging from 120 percent for certain programs within specific budget functions. The Spending Safeguard Act sets spending limitations for various programs based on their costs, with different percentages for different budget functions. The Director determines the cost of the program using scorecards or estimates under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. Additionally, the Director maintains and publicly shares spending safeguard limitation scorecards. The Director maintains spending safeguard limitation scorecards for direct spending programs, displaying spending levels and receiving monthly cost reports from the Treasury Secretary. Biannually, reports are submitted to the Budget Committees of the House and Senate. The Director submits reports to the Budget Committees on the total spending and relation to spending safeguard limitations for direct spending programs. Additionally, the President's budget submissions include information on spending levels and limitations for such programs. (d) Procedures in Case of Breach.-- If the Director determines a direct spending program will breach the spending safeguard limitation within six months, a report is sent to the Budget Committees and relevant program committees. The Director can impose an obligation limitation on a direct spending program if it reaches the spending safeguard limitation, leading to no funds being obligated for the program. The Director must report this to the Budget Committees and relevant program committees. Federal agencies implementing listed programs must follow agency procedures. Any Federal agency implementing a direct spending program listed on the scorecard must ensure that program participants are informed about a spending safeguard limitation that could affect future funding. Definitions in the Act include the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the meaning of direct spending, and direct spending programs funded after the Act's enactment. (g) Prohibition on New Authorization of Funding.--No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated for programs funded by direct spending enacted or reauthorized after this Act, without a specific level of authorization of appropriations in statute."
