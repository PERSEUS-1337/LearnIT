    "content": "In this work, a neural autoregressive topic model is combined with a LSTM-based language model to address challenges in probabilistic topic modeling. The LSTM-LM considers word order in local collocation patterns, while the TM learns a latent representation from the entire document. The LSTM-LM captures language characteristics like syntax and semantics, while the TM uncovers thematic structure in a collection of documents. The ctx-DocNADE model combines a topic model and a language model to learn the meaning of word occurrences. It addresses challenges in small text settings by incorporating external knowledge into neural autoregressive topic models via a language modeling approach. The proposed extension, ctx-DocNADEe, aims to improve the word-topic mapping on smaller and/or short-text corpora. The novel neural autoregressive topic model variants with neural language models and embeddings priors outperform state-of-the-art generative topic models in generalization, interpretability, and applicability over long-text. The curr_chunk discusses the use of probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants to extract topics from text collections. These models learn latent document representations for NLP tasks but ignore word order and semantic information. The motivation is to extend these models to incorporate word order and language structure. Probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants are used to extract topics from text collections. Traditional models do not consider word order and language structure, leading to limitations in topic analysis. Incorporating language structure can help determine the context in which words like \"bear\" are used, improving topic assignment accuracy. Recent studies have integrated latent topic and neural language models to improve language models. LSTM-LMs capture different language concepts in a layer-wise fashion but do not capture semantics at a document level. Recent studies have integrated latent topic and neural language models to improve language models by capturing different language concepts in a layer-wise fashion. LSTM-LMs do not capture semantics at a document level. Other models focus on improving LMs with global dependencies using latent topics, but struggle with long term dependencies and language concepts. DocNADE variants learn word occurrences across documents but ignore language structure. Recurrent neural networks have shown a significant reduction in perplexity over standard n-gram models. The proposed neural topic model, named ctx-DocNADE, integrates language structure into neural autoregressive models using LSTM-LM. It accurately predicts words by considering global and local contexts, combining joint word and latent topic learning. This model captures complementary topic and word semantics, as shown in FIG0. The proposed neural topic model, ctx-DocNADE, integrates language structure into neural autoregressive models using LSTM-LM to predict words accurately by considering global and local contexts. It captures complementary topic and word semantics, as shown in FIG0, demonstrating the power of incorporating language structure and word order in long texts and corpora. However, learning from contextual information remains challenging in settings with short texts and few documents due to limited word co-occurrences, significant word non-overlap, and a small training corpus of documents. Distributional word representations like word embeddings have shown impressive performance in NLP tasks by capturing semantic and syntactic relatedness in words. Word embeddings like BID22 capture semantic and syntactic relatedness in words, improving topic analysis in short texts. Previous work like BID26 used web search results to enhance short text information, while BID24 incorporated word similarity from thesauri and dictionaries into LDA. BID5 and BID20 integrated word embeddings into LDA and DMM models, and BID8 extended DocNADE with pre-trained word embeddings for topic learning. Incorporating distributed compositional priors in DocNADE, pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM are used to enhance topic learning on smaller corpora or short texts. By integrating complementary information through LSTM-LM, topic representations become more coherent and likely. This approach combines the benefits of external knowledge and complementary learning, improving the coupling of topic and language models with pre-trained word embeddings. Our approach, ctx-DocNADEe, combines complementary learning and external knowledge to model short and long text documents. It outperforms state-of-the-art generative topic models, showing improvements in topic coherence, precision at retrieval, and text classification. Our proposed modeling approaches, named textTOvec, show improvements in topic coherence, precision at retrieval, and text classification for short and long text documents. The code is available at https://github.com/pgcool/textTOvec. Generative models like RBM and RSM are used to model word counts, but estimating the complex probability distribution of high-dimensional observations is challenging. To address this, NADE decomposes the distribution. NADE BID13 decomposes the joint distribution of binary observations into autoregressive conditional distributions using feed-forward networks, allowing for tractable gradients of data negative log-likelihood. DocNADE BID12 models collections of documents as bags of words, focusing on word representations of underlying topics only. It disregards language structure and semantic features encoded in word embeddings. DocNADE BID15 DISPLAYFORM0 computes autoregressive conditional distributions for word observations using a neural network. The log-likelihood of a document is calculated based on word representations and hidden units. The orderless past word observations may not correspond to the words preceding the current word in the document. The DocNADE model computes conditional distributions for word observations using a neural network. Two extensions, ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe, incorporate language structure and external knowledge to model short and long texts. These models consider word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, dependencies, and external knowledge, overcoming BoW-based representation limitations. Each document is represented as a sequence of multinomial observations. The ctx-DocNADE model represents each document as a sequence of words, with context considered for each word. Unlike DocNADE, ctx-DocNADE uses LSTM-based components for conditional word probability, sharing topic information globally and locally. The embedding layer in the LSTM component of the unified network is randomly initialized, extending DocNADE to account for word ordering and language concepts. The second version adds distributional priors by initializing the LSTM embedding layer with a pre-trained matrix E and weight matrix W. Algorithm 1 and Table 1 compare log p(v) for a document v in Doc-NADE, ctx-DocNADE, and ctx-DocNADEe settings. In the DocNADE component, weights in matrix W are tied, reducing computational complexity to O(HD). LSTM is used in ctx-DocNADE or ctx-DocNADEe with complexity O(HD + N). Models can extract textTOvec representation. Deep version allows for multiple hidden layers for improved performance. The deep version of the model allows for improved performance by adding new hidden layers similar to a deep feed-forward neural network. The conditional probability is computed using the last layer, and state-of-the-art comparison metrics are used for evaluation on short and long-text datasets. We apply modeling approaches to short-text and long-text datasets, evaluating topic models using quantitative measures like perplexity and topic coherence. Baselines are compared for word and document representation. See appendices for data description and examples. The study compares various word and document representation models, including DocNADE, doc2vec, LDA based BoW TMs, neural BoW TMs, and jointly trained topic and language models. Experimental setup involves training DocNADE on reduced vocabulary (RV) and full vocabulary (FV) for different evaluation tasks. The FV setting allows fair comparison with LSTM-LM. The study compares various word and document representation models, including DocNADE, doc2vec, LDA based BoW TMs, neural BoW TMs, and jointly trained topic and language models. Experimental setup involves training models in the FV setting over 200 topics to quantify the quality of learned representations. Pre-training for 10 epochs with \u03bb set to 0 is done for better initialization in ctx-DocNADEs. The experimental setup and hyperparameters for tasks are detailed in the appendices. To evaluate the generative performance of topic models, log-probabilities for test documents are estimated to compute average held-out perplexity per word. The optimal mixture coefficient \u03bb is determined based on the validation set. Results show that complementary learning with \u03bb = 0.01 in ctx-DocNADE achieves lower perplexity than baseline DocNADE for both short and long texts. In the FV setting, complementary learning with \u03bb = 0.01 in ctx-DocNADE outperforms baseline DocNADE in terms of lower perplexity for short and long texts on AGnewstitle and 20NS 4 datasets. Topic coherence is assessed using the coherence measure proposed by BID25, with higher scores indicating more coherent topics. Gensim module is used to estimate coherence for 200 topics, showing higher average coherence in ctx-DocNADE compared to DocNADE (.772 vs .755), suggesting that contextual information and language structure aid in generating more coherent topics. The introduction of embeddings in ctx-DocNADEe boosts topic coherence, resulting in a 4.6% gain on average over 11 datasets. The proposed models also outperform baseline methods glove-DMM and glove-LDA. Comparison with other approaches combining topic and language models shows the focus of the study on improving topic models for textual representations. Our work focuses on enhancing topic models for textual representations by incorporating language concepts and external knowledge through neural language models. We compare the performance of our models, ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe, in terms of topic coherence on the BNC dataset. The sliding window size and mixture weight of the language model component are important hyper-parameters in the topic modeling process. The mixture weight of the LM component in topic modeling is denoted by \u03bb, with (s) and (l) representing small and large models. The top 5 words of seven learned topics from different models are compared for topic coherence. The inclusion of word embeddings results in more coherent topics, but in certain data settings, improvements are not observed. ctx-DocNADEe does not show improvements in topic coherence compared to ctx-DocNADE. The top 5 words of seven topics from TCNML and our models are qualitatively compared. Text retrieval is performed using short-text and long-text documents with label information, following a setup similar to BID15. The retrieval precision is computed for different fractions using cosine similarity measure between textTOvec representations. The retrieval precision scores for short-text and long-text datasets at fraction 0.02 show improved performance with the introduction of pre-trained embeddings and language/contextual information. Topic modeling without pre-processing and filtering certain words also enhances IR precision, as seen with DocNADE(FV) and glove(FV) compared to the baseline RV setting. The study explores topic modeling without pre-processing and filtering words, showing that using FV setting with DocNADE or glove improves IR precision. The proposed extensions, ctx-DocNADEe and ctx-DeepDNEe, demonstrate competitive performance on various datasets. Additionally, the models outperform TDLM and ProdLDA in text categorization tasks. Our proposed models, ctx-DocNADEe and ctx-DeepDNEe, outperform TDLM and ProdLDA in text categorization tasks. Using glove embeddings, ctx-DocNADEe shows a significant improvement in classification performance over DocNADE(RV) on short and long texts. The proposed models, ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe, outperform NTM and SCHOLAR in classification accuracy on the 20NS dataset. The ctx-DocNADEe extracts more coherent topics due to embedding priors, confirming the meaningful semantics captured in the topic extraction process. The ctx-DocNADEe model extracts more coherent topics with embedding priors, confirming meaningful semantics in topic extraction. Text retrieval for queries is analyzed using DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe models, showing top 3 texts with no unigram overlap. The curr_chunk discusses the quality of representations learned at different fractions of the training set from TMNtitle data, showing improvements due to the proposed models ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe over DocNADE. The top-3 retrievals for an input query are illustrated, along with the coherence of topics extracted by the ctx-DocNADEe model. The quality of representations learned at different fractions of the training data is quantified in FIG5, showing significant improvements with the proposed models ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe over DocNADE. The findings demonstrate enhanced precision and F1 scores, particularly in sparse data settings, by incorporating language concepts in neural autoregressive topic models. The combination of neural autoregressive topic models with neural language models aims to incorporate language concepts in each step of the topic model. This approach improves the estimation of word probabilities in context by learning latent representations from entire documents while considering local collocation patterns. Additionally, external knowledge in the form of word embeddings further enhances the model's performance, outperforming state-of-the-art generative topic models in terms of perplexity, coherence, and text retrieval.

Stations must be capable of \"Auto-Turnaround Operation\" for train routing independently of the ATS system. Perplexity scores for different \u03bb in Generalization task: Ablation over validation set labels are not used during training. Document retrieval is performed using the same train/development/test split of documents for all datasets. Doc2Vec models were trained with distributed bag of words for 1000 iterations using gensim. In the document retrieval task, Doc2Vec models were trained using gensim on 12 datasets with specific parameters. A logistic regression classifier was then trained on the document vectors to predict class labels. Multilabel datasets used a one-vs-all approach. Accuracy and F1 score were computed on the test set to evaluate predictive power. Additionally, glove-DMM and glove-LDA models were trained using LFTM with specific parameters for short and long texts. The glove-DMM and glove-LDA models were trained for 200 iterations with 2000 initial iterations using 200 topics. Hyperparameters were set differently for short and long texts. Classification tasks used relative topic proportions as input. Topic coherence was evaluated using 20 topics, with SCHOLAR BID3 generating more coherent topics than DocNADE. In information retrieval tasks, SCHOLAR BID3 without meta-data performed worse than the proposed models. The experimental results suggest that DocNADE outperforms SCHOLAR in generating representations for tasks like information retrieval and classification, but lags behind in interpretability. This opens up new avenues for future research."
