    "content": "The Act titled \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2010\" is cited in Section 1. Congressional findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress found that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, privately owned but publicly chartered government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to the deepest economic decline since World War II and the loss of 7,500,000 jobs. In 2008, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, and FHFA placed the two GSEs in conservatorship, a form of nationalization. The GSEs were put in conservatorship in 2008, with the government taking control of their daily operations. The Obama Administration committed to purchasing senior preferred stock in the enterprises, with the initial amount set at $200 billion and later raised to $400 billion. By Christmas Eve 2009, the Administration removed limits on using Federal funds to cover losses, resulting in taxpayers owning at least 80 percent of the two enterprises. The Government's actions have led to taxpayers owning 80% of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are now considered government entities. The GSEs are expected to be a long-term burden on taxpayers due to market conditions and political mandates. Compensation packages were approved by the Treasury Department and FHFA at the end of 2009. At the end of 2009, the Treasury Department and FHFA approved multi-million dollar compensation packages for top executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including $6,000,000 for each CEO, which is significantly higher than the President's and Cabinet Secretary's annual compensation. FHFA determined no executive officer of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac entitled to cash bonus or long-term incentive awards for 2008. Strategic Plan includes commitment for GSEs to operate safely and soundly. Director of FHFA permitted to withhold compensation to executive. The Director of FHFA can withhold executive compensation for review of reasonableness and comparability. SEC. 3. REASONABLE COMPENSATION. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and establish a new compensation system based on government pay rates. Additionally, there is a provision for the clawback of 2009 compensation for executive officers. The executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are required to return any excess compensation earned in 2009 to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary will transfer these amounts to a special account to reduce the national debt."
