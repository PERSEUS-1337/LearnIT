    "content": "Bankruptcy filings peaked in 1987 for businesses, while consumer filings continued to rise until 2005, surpassing 2 million before the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The new law caused a sharp drop in filings in 2006, but numbers rose again until 2010. Household debt figures are shown in Table 2. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with consumer credit including revolving credit (credit card debt) and non-revolving debt (auto and college loans). Mortgage debt is secured by real estate, with home equity lending as a subcategory. Federal Reserve estimates show the burden of debt service as a percentage of household disposable income. This measure increased steadily over the past decade before the recession and financial crisis. The debt burden, measured as the percentage of household disposable income used to repay loans, has fluctuated within a narrow range from 10.80% to 13.93%. Despite a gradual increase since the 1980s, it does not fully explain the rise in personal bankruptcy filings. The decline in debt service ratio since 2007 has not led to a significant reduction in bankruptcy rates, even with historically low interest rates. The debt burden has remained low since the 1950s, with the ratio of debt outstanding to income rising due to falling interest rates. This could lead to an increase in bankruptcy filings if interest rates rise suddenly. Household debt has increased since 1990, but declining interest rates have allowed households to take on more debt without a significant increase in interest payments. The data from Table 3 based on the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances shows the percentages of families at various income levels that devote more than 40% of their income to debt service. Lower-income families are the most likely to file for bankruptcy, while there is no sharply rising trend in personal bankruptcy filings. The percentage of all families in distress in 2007 was little changed from the 1998 level, with a notable increase among families in the upper income percentiles. The 2007 data shows a notable increase in distress among families in the upper income percentiles, possibly due to increased mortgage debt from the housing boom. The question remains why many low-income families end up in bankruptcy court, with explanations focusing on vulnerable populations like the sick, uninsured, divorced, or residents in states without mandatory uninsured motorist coverage. Supporters of the 2005 bankruptcy reform argued that the code was too debtor-friendly, while opponents blamed credit card issuers for marketing strategies leading to financial distress. In December 2007, the U.S. economy entered a recession amidst global financial panic. Household debt levels started to decrease, with declines in debt balances continuing for 11 quarters until a slight rise in the second quarter of 2011. Factors contributing to the fall in debt balances included home equity and credit card debt leading the decline, while mortgage debt accounted for most of the drop in dollar terms. In dollar terms, mortgage debt (other than home equity loans) accounted for most of the drop. Factors contributing to the fall in debt balances include households paying down debt, borrowing less, increased debt write-offs by lenders, and tighter credit standards for new loans. Mortgage balances have fallen due to modifications, negotiations reducing principal outstanding, and foreclosed homes being sold for less than the old mortgage amount. Causes and implications of deleveraging are discussed in CRS Report R41623, U.S. Household Debt Reduction."
