    "content": "The \"Grazing Improvement Act of 2012\" amends the terms of grazing permits and leases by extending the duration to 20 years and adding conditions for environmental analysis. It also addresses the renewal, transfer, and reissuance of grazing permits and leases. The \"Grazing Improvement Act of 2012\" extends grazing permits and leases to 20 years and adds environmental analysis conditions. It also addresses renewal, transfer, and reissuance of permits and leases under SEC. 405. In this section, \"current grazing management\" refers to grazing in accordance with existing permits or leases, including modifications consistent with resource management plans. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for Department of the Interior land. Grazing permits or leases issued by the Secretary of the Interior are subject to renewal, transfer, reissuance, and pending processing. Grazing permits or leases issued by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land can be renewed, transferred, or reissued under specific sections. The terms and conditions of an expired permit or lease will continue in effect, except for the termination date. The terms and conditions of an expired permit or lease for National Forest System land will continue under a renewed or reissued permit until processing is complete. The permit or lease can be cancelled, suspended, or modified as per applicable law. After processing, the permit or lease can be renewed or reissued for a 20-year term. The Secretary concerned may renew or reissue a grazing permit or lease for a 20-year term after processing. The renewal, reissuance, or transfer may be categorically excluded from environmental assessment if current grazing management meets objectives in the land use plan. The Secretary may renew grazing permits for 20 years if management meets land use plan objectives. Priority and timing for environmental analyses are determined based on significance and funding availability. NEPA exemptions include crossing and trailing authorizations. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 exempts certain activities from the National Environmental Policy Act, including crossing and trailing authorizations for domestic livestock and transfer of grazing preference. Sec. 405 addresses the renewal, transfer, and reissuance of grazing permits and leases."
