    "content": "Deconvolutional layers are commonly used in deep models for up-sampling, but they can lead to the checkerboard problem due to the lack of direct relationships among adjacent pixels. To address this, the PixelDCL is proposed to establish direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the up-sampled feature map. This method can replace deconvolutional layers without compromising the original model's trainable capabilities, although it may slightly decrease efficiency. The proposed PixelDCL addresses the checkerboard problem in deep models by establishing direct relationships among adjacent pixels on up-sampled feature maps. It may slightly decrease efficiency but can overcome this with an implementation trick. Experimental results show that PixelDCL considers spatial features like edges and shapes, leading to more accurate segmentation outputs compared to deconvolutional layers. In image generation tasks, PixelDCL can largely overcome limitations. Deep learning methods, including deconvolutional layers, are used in various artificial intelligence tasks. Deconvolutional layers are essential for up-sampling feature maps but suffer from checkerboard artifacts, limiting their capabilities in generating. The PixelDCL method addresses the checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution operations by reinterpreting the process as shuffling multiple intermediate feature maps. This approach aims to improve the generation of photo-realistic images and smooth outputs in semantic segmentation. The PixelDCL method proposes a pixel deconvolutional operation to address checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution. It generates intermediate feature maps sequentially to establish direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the output feature map, improving semantic segmentation results. This may slightly decrease computational efficiency but leads to smoother outputs. The proposed PixelDCL method addresses checkerboard artifacts in deconvolution by using pixel deconvolution. It improves semantic segmentation results by establishing direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the output feature map. Experimental results show that PixelDCL effectively overcomes the checkerboard problem and enhances predictive and generative performance. By using masked convolutions in training, PixelRNNs and PixelCNNs have comparable training time to other generative models like GANs and VAEs. However, the prediction time for PixelRNNs or PixelCNNs is slow due to generating images pixel by pixel. PixelDCL can replace deconvolutional layers with a slight decrease in efficiency, which can be overcome with an implementation trick. Deconvolutional layers are used in deep models for applications like semantic segmentation and generative models. Deconvolutional layers are widely used in deep models for tasks like semantic segmentation and generative models. These layers involve up-sampling the output feature map by shuffling intermediate feature maps obtained through convolutional operations on input feature maps. The deconvolution operation can be decomposed into multiple convolutional operations based on the up-sampling factor, with an illustration provided for 1D and 2D cases. Deconvolutional layers up-sample output feature maps using convolutional operations on input feature maps. Intermediate feature maps are shuffled and combined to generate the up-sampled output. There is no direct relationship among intermediate feature maps due to being generated by independent convolutional kernels. Adjacent pixels on the output feature map come from different intermediate feature maps. The pixel deconvolutional operation addresses the checkerboard artifacts in semantic segmentation by adding direct dependencies among intermediate feature maps, ensuring that adjacent pixels have similar values. This eliminates the need for post-processing like smoothing, which can complicate the network and hinder full trainability. The pixel deconvolutional layers address the checkerboard artifact problem in semantic segmentation by creating direct dependencies among intermediate feature maps, ensuring adjacent pixels have similar values. This eliminates the need for post-processing like smoothing and maintains full trainability. The iPixelDCL introduces dependencies among intermediate feature maps to address the checkerboard problem in semantic segmentation. This ensures that adjacent pixels on output feature maps are directly related to each other, utilizing information from input feature maps repeatedly. The iPixelDCL introduces dependencies among intermediate feature maps to address the checkerboard problem in semantic segmentation, ensuring adjacent pixels on output feature maps are directly related. This simplifies dependencies among pixels by having only the first intermediate feature map depend on the input feature map. The PixelDCL method simplifies dependencies among pixels in semantic segmentation by introducing a hierarchy of intermediate feature maps. The first feature map depends on the input, while subsequent maps are conditioned on previously generated maps to avoid repeated influence of the input. PixelDCL simplifies pixel dependencies in semantic segmentation by creating a hierarchy of feature maps. Each subsequent map relies on previously generated maps, reducing repeated influence of the input. This approach improves computational efficiency and model performance compared to complete connections. Pixel deconvolutional layers can replace deconvolutional layers in models like U-Net, VAEs, and GANs, improving performance. They are used for upsampling in semantic segmentation, image reconstruction, and generating large images. Experiments show their effectiveness in U-Net and VAEs. In experiments, pixel deconvolutional layers outperform deconvolutional layers in U-Net and VAEs by efficiently up-sampling feature maps. The implementation involves up-sampling a 4\u00d74 feature map to an 8\u00d78 feature map using convolutional operations. The purple and orange feature maps are generated through convolutional operations and combined to form a larger feature map. A masked 3\u00d73 convolutional operation is applied to reduce sequential dependencies. The final output feature map is generated by combining the two large feature maps. The proposed pixel deconvolutional method improves training efficiency in semantic segmentation and image generation tasks. The new pixel deconvolutional layers improve performance in semantic segmentation tasks on datasets like PASCAL 2012 and MSCOCO 2015. The models predict pixel labels directly without post-processing, using U-Net architecture for training from scratch or fine-tuning from DeepLab-ResNet. The U-Net architecture BID23 is used as the base model for image segmentation tasks, with four blocks in the encoder and decoder paths. The number of feature maps in each layer is adjusted based on the dataset's classes, with deconvolutional layers used for up-sampling. The proposed pixel deconvolutional layers replace the deconvolutional layers in the baseline U-Net model for improved segmentation results on datasets like PASCAL 2012 and MSCOCO 2015. The U-Net architecture uses deconvolutional layers for up-sampling feature maps. The proposed pixel deconvolutional layers (iPixelDCL and PixelDCL) are compared to regular deconvolutional layers, with different kernel sizes. This allows for evaluating the new pixel deconvolutional layers while controlling other factors in segmentation tasks. In fine-tuning experiments, the DeepLab-ResNet model is enhanced by using external data and finetuning from classic ResNet101, resulting in improved accuracy and mean IOU. The model's output is smaller than the input image, requiring up-sampling blocks with deconvolutional and convolutional layers to recover the original dimensions. PixelDCL and iPixelDCL are used in place of deconvolutional layers with the same kernel size. The U-Net model is enhanced by replacing deconvolutional layers with PixelDCL and iPixelDCL, resulting in better capture of local image information and smoother semantic segmentation outputs. The use of pixel deconvolutional layers considers more spatial features like edges and shapes, leading to improved segmentation results compared to regular deconvolutional layers. The models using PixelDCL produce smoother outputs than deconvolution. PixelDCL is more efficient with fewer parameters, outperforming iPixelDCL in most cases. U-Net models with PixelDCL and iPixelDCL show better performance than regular deconvolution. iPixelDCL performs the best among models fine-tuned from Deeplab-ResNet. In semantic segmentation, models using iPixelDCL and PixelDCL outperform the model using DCL, with iPixelDCL showing the best performance. Mean IOU is a more accurate evaluation measure than pixel accuracy. The dataset used for image generation is CelebFaces attributes (CelebA), with images preprocessed to retain only facial information. The image generation task is to reconstruct faces excluding backgrounds in training images using a standard VAE model with deconvolutional layers for up-sampling. The PixelDCL is used to replace deconvolutional layers in the decoder of the VAE model for image generation. It effectively eliminates checkerboard artifacts by establishing direct relationships among adjacent pixels on generated feature maps and images. This approach proves useful for generative models by considering local spatial information.

This approach enhances generative models by considering local spatial information, resulting in photo-realistic images without checkerboard artifacts. Additionally, U-Net models using iPixelDCL and PixelDCL for up-sampling show slightly longer training and prediction times compared to DCL, but PixelDCL proves more efficient due to reduced dependencies and improved implementation.
