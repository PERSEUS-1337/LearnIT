    "content": "The \"Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2001\" can be cited as the short title. Federal-State agreements are addressed in the act. The \"Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2001\" allows states to enter agreements with the Secretary of Labor to provide temporary emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted regular benefits. States can terminate the agreement with 30 days notice. For purposes of subsection (b)(1), an individual is deemed to have exhausted their rights to regular compensation under a State law when no more payments can be made due to receiving all available compensation based on employment or wages during the base period, or when their rights have been terminated due to the benefit year expiring. The amount of temporary emergency unemployment compensation payable to an individual for a week of total unemployment is equal to the regular compensation received during the benefit year under the State law. The terms and conditions of the State law apply to claims for temporary emergency unemployment compensation, except where inconsistent. The maximum amount of temporary emergency unemployment compensation payable to an individual shall not exceed the amount established in their account. States can elect to trigger off an extended compensation period to provide payment to individuals who have exhausted their regular benefits. Payment of temporary emergency unemployment compensation is provided to individuals who have exhausted their regular benefits under State law. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACCOUNT. Any agreement under this title establishes a temporary emergency unemployment compensation account for eligible individuals, with the amount in the account being 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. This amount is reduced by any extended compensation received under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. The Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 determines the weekly benefit amount for individuals based on regular compensation under State law for total unemployment. SEC. 4. PAYMENTS TO STATES WITH AGREEMENTS FOR TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. Payments to states with agreements for temporary emergency unemployment compensation shall be equal to 100 percent of the compensation paid to individuals under the agreement. States are not eligible for reimbursement under other federal laws if they receive reimbursement under this title. The amount payable to states with agreements shall be determined accordingly. Sums payable to states with agreements under this title shall be determined by the Secretary in advance or by reimbursement. The Secretary will estimate the amounts payable to each state monthly, adjusting for any over or underestimations from prior months. Estimates can be based on agreed-upon methods between the Secretary and the state agency. SEC. 5. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Funds from the extended unemployment compensation account in the Unemployment Trust Fund are used to make payments to States with agreements under this title. The Secretary certifies payments to each State, which are then transferred from the extended unemployment compensation account to the State's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Funds are appropriated to assist States in meeting administration costs under the Social Security Act. The Secretary estimates necessary sums for payments under this section for specific types of compensation. Compensation under chapter 85 of title 5, United States Code and services under section 3309(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are eligible for appropriated funds, which do not need to be repaid. SEC. 6. FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS. Individuals who knowingly make false statements or fail to disclose material facts to receive emergency unemployment compensation they are not entitled to will be ineligible for further benefits and may be prosecuted under federal law. Repayment is required for those who have received such benefits. Individuals who received emergency unemployment compensation they were not entitled to must repay the amounts to the State agency, unless the agency determines it was not their fault and repayment would be unfair. The State agency can recover the repayment by deducting from future emergency unemployment compensation payments. Individuals who received emergency unemployment compensation they were not entitled to must repay the amounts to the State agency. Repayment can be recovered by deductions from future emergency unemployment compensation payments, with a maximum deduction of 50 percent of the weekly benefit amount. No repayment or deduction will occur without a hearing. No repayment or deduction will occur without a hearing. Any determination by a State agency under this section shall be subject to review in the same manner and to the same extent as determinations under the State unemployment compensation law. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. This title defines key terms related to compensation and unemployment benefits. SEC. 8. APPLICABILITY. Agreements under this Act apply to specific periods of unemployment. SEC. 9. TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATE for repayments to State unemployment funds. SEC. 9. TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO REPAYMENTS OF ADVANCES TO STATE UNEMPLOYMENT FUNDS. The interest rate on advances to a State under the Social Security Act will be reduced from 10 percent to 5 percent for 18 months after the enactment of this Act."
