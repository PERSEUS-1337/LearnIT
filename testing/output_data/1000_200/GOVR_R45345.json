    "content": "Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) involves reporting violations of law, mismanagement, waste of resources, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. Protection for IC whistleblowers is crucial due to the sensitive nature of classified information involved. Whistleblowing can lead to cost savings, promote ethical work environments, and prompt corrective actions. Protections are only extended to those who make lawful disclosures. Whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) only cover lawful disclosures and do not apply to leaking classified information to the media or foreign governments. They also do not protect against personnel or security clearance decisions if the agency can prove it would have taken the same action without the disclosure. Procedures for IC whistleblowers to make protected disclosures are defined by Congress and the executive branch. The Intelligence Community (IC) whistleblower protections, defined by Congress and the executive branch, aim to provide security for classified information. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) whistleblowing policy addresses whistleblower process and protections for IC contractors, Armed Forces members, and federal employees. However, there are concerns about the transparency of IC's internal processes and the adequacy of protections for IC contractors. Whistleblower protections have evolved to address perceived gaps, with the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) being the first legislation specific to the IC. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) of 1998 was the first legislation specific to the IC, but it lacked specific protections for whistleblowers. Subsequent measures, such as the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 and Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19 in 2012, aimed to provide more comprehensive protections for IC whistleblowers. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 codified PPD-19 provisions, and 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 offers protections for Armed Forces members within the IC. In January 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118, amending the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to address gaps in protections for Intelligence Community (IC) contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) was created to assist IC whistleblowers excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, but does not mention Armed Forces members within the IC. The ICWPA, passed in 1998, amended previous acts to allow IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency. This ensures protection of classified information and requires prompt reporting to the CIA Director or agency head. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) requires the Inspector General (IG) to report credible complaints to the CIA Director or agency head within 14 days. If the IG fails to report accurately, employees or contractors can directly submit complaints to Congress after following certain procedures. However, the ICWPA does not provide specific protections against reprisal or punishment for whistleblowers. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 included the first general provisions for whistleblower protection. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 included provisions for protecting whistleblowers by establishing the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC). However, the Act lacked specific protections against reprisal or punishment for whistleblowers. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 established the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC) to protect whistleblowers. The Inspector General must keep the whistleblower's identity confidential unless necessary for the investigation or to the Department of Justice. No reprisal can be taken against the whistleblower for reporting violations or disclosing information. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 established the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC) to protect whistleblowers. The Inspector General must keep the whistleblower's identity confidential unless necessary for the investigation or to the Department of Justice. No reprisal can be taken against the whistleblower for reporting violations or disclosing information. Section 405 covers contractors and federal employees of IC elements, allowing the Inspector General access to any employee or contractor needed for their duties. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 established the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC) to protect whistleblowers. PPD-19, signed by President Obama in 2012, provides protections for IC whistleblowers with access to classified information. It defines a protected disclosure as a lawful disclosure of information by the employee to a supervisor. PPD-19 protects whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community from reprisals for making lawful disclosures of violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health or safety. It prohibits actions that could impact a whistleblower's access to classified information or result in personnel actions against the employee. PPD-19 protects whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community from reprisals for lawful disclosures. It requires IC elements to certify a process for employees to seek review of personnel actions believed to be in reprisal. The Inspector General determines if a personnel action was in reprisal and makes recommendations for corrective action. The agency head considers the IG's findings but is not obligated to accept recommendations. The agency head does not have to accept an IG's recommendation for corrective action. IC agencies also have to certify to the DNI that the agency has a review process that permits employees to appeal actions involving eligibility for access to classified information that are alleged to be in violation of prohibitions against retaliation for making lawful disclosures. PPD-19 allows for a whistleblower to request an external review by an IG panel chaired by the IGIC if the employee has exhausted the agency review process. If the panel decides in the employee's favor, the agency must consider but does not have to accept the panel's recommendation for corrective action. It requires the IGIC to report annually to the congressional intelligence committees the IG determinations and recommendations and IC element head responses to the determinations and recommendations. PDD-19 requires the. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA (P.L. 113-126) codified provisions of PPD-19, providing statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against retaliation for lawful disclosures. Section 601 protected whistleblowers from personnel actions in reprisal for disclosures to designated officials. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA (P.L. 113-126) codified provisions of PPD-19, providing statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against retaliation for lawful disclosures. It included protections for whistleblowers who disclose violations of federal law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health and safety. Additionally, it provided safeguards against retaliatory revocation of security clearances for government employee whistleblowers. Section 602 of Title VI of the FY2014 IAA provides protections for government employee whistleblowers against retaliatory revocation of security clearances for making lawful disclosures. It also requires the development of appeal policies and procedures for whistleblower cases. ICD-120, updated in 2016, offers implementing guidance for PPD-19, including protections against reprisal involving personnel actions. ICD-120 provisions include protections against reprisal for IC employees making protected disclosures, including contractors and members of the Armed Forces. It requires each IC element to have a review process for appeals related to security clearances. Employees can request an External Review Panel chaired by the IGIC if internal agency review is exhausted. The pending decision involves provisions for employees alleging reprisal after exhausting internal agency review, allowing them to request an External Review Panel chaired by the IGIC. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections for Armed Forces members against retaliation for protected communications. Unlike the ICWPA, Section 1034 does not specify protection for classified information when making a protected communication. Members of the Armed Forces under Section 1034 can communicate with Congress, Inspector General, DOD audit, inspection, investigation, or law enforcement organizations. The curr_chunk specifies prohibited personnel actions in reprisal for a member of the Armed Forces making a protected communication, enables the DOD to mitigate hardship for an Armed Forces member following an alleged reprisal, and requires periodic updates during an investigation into a protected communication. The inspector general is investigating protected communications and providing updates to Congress, the whistleblower, and the Secretary of Defense. The DOD Inspector General is required to set standards for investigations of prohibited personnel actions and training for Inspectors General. Existing whistleblower protection laws for contractors in the intelligence community are inconsistent, with efforts in Congress to address the gaps. Efforts in Congress to address gaps in protections for IC contractors culminated in the passage of P.L. 115-118 on January 19, 2018. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 on October 24, 2017, which aimed to protect IC employees from retaliation for making protected disclosures. Another bill, S. 794, introduced by Senator McCaskill on March 18, 2015, sought to amend whistleblower protection laws for contractors in the intelligence community. On March 18, 2015, Senator McCaskill introduced S. 794 to extend whistleblower protections to contractor employees on contracts with IC elements. No further action was taken. Congress later passed P.L. 115-118 on January 19, 2018, amending whistleblower protections for IC contractor employees. Section 110 of the legislation provides protections for IC contractors to make lawful disclosures to designated agency officials, inspectors general, the DNI, IGIC, and congressional intelligence committees. These protections are similar to those for IC employees under Title VI of the IAA for FY2014. The provisions cover complaints against retaliatory personnel actions and violations of federal laws or rules. The legislation provides protections for IC contractors to make lawful disclosures regarding violations of federal laws or rules, including unauthorized access to classified information. Contractors are safeguarded against retaliatory actions, such as revocation of security clearances. The H.Amdt. 894 to the DOD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2015 provided $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC, enhancing the ability to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse. This measure did not directly protect whistleblowers but aimed to address underfunded capabilities for responsive follow-up on complaints."
