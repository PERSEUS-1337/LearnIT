    "content": "The NTSB, established in 1967 under the DOT, investigates civil aviation and other transportation accidents to improve safety. In 1974, it became independent from DOT to conduct unbiased investigations and recommend safety improvements. The NTSB determines accident causes, makes safety recommendations, assists victims' families in disasters, and serves as a board of appeals. The NTSB, established in 1967 under the DOT, investigates transportation accidents to improve safety. It provides assistance to victims' families and serves as a board of appeals for regulatory actions. The agency consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff members. The NTSB has regional offices in Ashburn, VA; Denver, CO; Federal Way, WA; and Anchorage, AK, with a training center in Ashburn, VA. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires at least one full-time employee in states over 1,000 miles from an office, impacting Hawaii. The agency has one aviation safety investigator in Hawaii and staff in 25 states. Safety Board members serve five-year terms and may continue until replacements are appointed. The NTSB board members, appointed with Senate consent, serve five-year terms and may continue until replacements are appointed. Not more than three members can be from the same political party, and at least three must have technical qualifications. The NTSB also acts as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners facing administrative actions by the FAA or Coast Guard. The NTSB has an Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications that tracks responses to safety recommendations, coordinates communications with stakeholders, and investigates various transportation accidents and safety issues. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents involving passenger trains, pipelines, and marine casualties, as well as other catastrophic accidents. They rely on experts from various industries and regulatory agencies to assist in investigations through the \"party process.\" The NTSB investigates transportation accidents through the \"party process,\" where designated parties provide technical expertise but NTSB bases its conclusions strictly on its own analysis. Formal procedures allow parties to petition for reconsideration of investigative findings. The NTSB conducts investigations through the party process, where designated parties provide expertise but conclusions are based solely on NTSB analysis. Parties can be sanctioned for not fulfilling duties. The Safety Board must meet publicly on most accident investigation matters. Financial disclosures are required for board members and staff. Despite safeguards, there is still potential for outside influence on NTSB investigations, which could impact credibility. The NTSB faces challenges in maintaining impartiality during investigations, balancing the need for unique data from involved parties while preventing influence. Evaluating competing perspectives can prolong investigations. The NTSB follows international standards for aviation accident investigations and may assist in foreign cases involving U.S.-manufactured aircraft. The NTSB participates in foreign aviation accident investigations involving U.S.-manufactured aircraft, even when the U.S. has no specific right to be involved. They may be reimbursed for costs by foreign entities. The NTSB is reimbursed for costs related to activities of the NTSB Academy and foreign aviation accident investigations through the Safe Skies for Africa program. They issue safety recommendations to effect change in transportation safety regulations and practices. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety across various modes. Over 14,300 recommendations have been issued since 1967, with about 82% leading to implemented safety improvements. DOT agencies must respond within 90 days, detailing their plans to implement recommendations. While not mandatory, the NTSB advocates for the adoption of their safety recommendations. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety, advocating for their adoption. Implementation of recommendations may be delayed due to rulemaking processes and concerns about feasibility and costs. The NTSB does not consider cost-benefit analysis in developing recommendations and highlights key safety improvements on a \"Most Wanted\" list. The NTSB's \"Most Wanted\" safety improvements include actions to reduce fatigue-related accidents, improve rail transit safety oversight, promote collision avoidance technologies in vehicles, strengthen occupant protection, minimize operator distractions, prevent loss of control in flight, end substance impairment, and require operators to be medically fit for duty. These recommendations influence regulatory agendas and often require statutory and regulatory changes. The NTSB's safety recommendations and advocacy programs have influenced transportation agencies and congressional decision-making. This influence has led to legislation and regulations such as positive train control systems, airline pilot fatigue reduction, distracted driving laws, helicopter air ambulance safety standards, and pipeline safety improvements. For example, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 drew on NTSB investigations and recommendations for airline pilot records database implementation and airline modifications. Section 2102 of the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 mandates FAA to update airline pilot training to include monitoring automated systems and controlling aircraft flightpath without autopilot. Section 2103 directs FAA to evaluate mental health screening recommendations for pilots, following concerns raised by the NTSB after incidents like the Asiana Airlines crash in 2013 and the Germanwings suicide downing in 2015. The NTSB raised concerns about pilot mental health following previous aviation incidents, leading to international focus after the Germanwings suicide crash in 2015. Section 2105 mandates the FAA to update crash-resistant helicopter fuel system standards, aligning with NTSB recommendations. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 also addressed pipeline safety comprehensively. The Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pipeline Safety Act; P.L. 112-90) included provisions to enhance pipeline safety, such as increasing federal inspectors, requiring automatic shutoff valves, verifying operating pressure, raising penalties for violations, and reviewing diluted bitumen pipeline regulations. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA08; P.L. 110-432) mandated positive train control for railroads carrying passengers or hazardous materials. Positive train control is a communication and signaling system identified by the NTSB to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error, reducing incidents due to speed, conflicting movements, and failure to obey signals. The NTSB also prioritizes minimizing operator distractions to improve safety, with Congress establishing a distracted driving grant program in 2012 to discourage texting and cell-phone use for young drivers. The NTSB prioritizes minimizing operator distractions to improve safety, with Congress establishing a distracted driving grant program in 2012. States were required to prohibit texting by all drivers and cell-phone use for drivers under 18 to qualify for a grant. Only one state qualified in FY2014 and FY2015, but a provision in the FAST Act in December 2015 removed the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. The status of agency actions on transportation safety mandates may be of interest during NTSB reauthorization proceedings. Funding for the NTSB historically consists of a base authorization. During NTSB reauthorization proceedings, transportation safety mandates and funding for the NTSB are key topics. The NTSB's funding includes a base authorization, an emergency fund for unforeseen accident costs, and supplemental appropriations for large investigations. The emergency fund has a $2 million maintenance requirement and can be increased up to $4 million. Despite not using the emergency fund or seeking supplemental appropriations for over a decade, appropriations levels since FY2007 and the FY2017 funding request are available in Table 1. The NTSB has not needed to use its emergency fund or request additional funding for over a decade. The Government Accountability Office evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities, with the NTSB being responsive to GAO findings and implementing recommendations. In 2013, GAO revisited NTSB management practices, finding improvements needed in training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity. GAO recommended a specific strategy for maximizing the NTSB's cost accounting system. Current issues include staffing resources, NTSB Academy management, vehicle recorder recoverability, privacy of data collected in investigations. The NTSB is addressing issues such as vehicle recorder recoverability, data privacy, and potential use of recorder data. Legislation in Congress is focusing on NTSB funding for railroad accident investigations. Despite a 12% increase in staffing over the past decade, the NTSB has developed a strategic plan to address competency gaps and increase workforce diversity. The NTSB has a strategic human capital plan to address competency gaps, leadership succession, and workforce diversity. Limited resources have led to delays in accident investigations, including pipeline and railroad accidents. Congress may debate the need for additional staffing to investigate all fatal railroad accidents. The NTSB faces staffing challenges, especially in the Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The agency has concerns about potential shortages due to retirements and skill gaps. The NTSB has the authority to enter agreements for facilities and training in accident investigation. The NTSB awarded a 20-year contract to George Washington University for a training site in 2000. The NTSB Training Center was completed in August 2003 but has not achieved financial self-sufficiency as required by P.L. 109-443. The center trains NTSB staff and transportation industry personnel for accident investigation and disaster response. It also hosts forums and meetings. The NTSB Training Center was established to assist with accident investigations and support victims of transportation disasters. Despite efforts to generate revenue through training and meetings, the center has struggled to cover its costs. A 2006 GAO study raised concerns about the NTSB's financial practices and its ability to offset training center expenses. Additionally, the NTSB has faced challenges in complying with the Anti-Deficiency Act due to leasing arrangements for the NTSB Academy. The GAO report highlighted NTSB's violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act due to leasing the NTSB Academy facility as an operating lease instead of a capital lease. Remedies suggested include renegotiating the lease, obtaining deficiency appropriation, or vacating the space. The potential benefits of the facility were not fully considered in the analysis. The GAO found that the NTSB Academy had improved its utilization and cost recovery, but still falls short of recouping all operating costs. Congressional oversight may focus on the facility's utilization and costs during hearings. The NTSB Academy has improved its utilization and cost recovery but still falls short of recouping all operating costs. Congress may have limited ability to make changes before the lease agreement expires. Data recorders are crucial investigative tools in aviation, with challenges in prompt recovery after accidents and concerns about privacy and public disclosures. Recovery of recorders has been difficult in recent accidents, such as Air France flight 447. Recent aviation accidents have posed challenges in recovering flight data recorders. Air France flight 447 and EgyptAir flight 804 both experienced delays in retrieving their recorders, with Malaysia Airlines flight 370 still missing. The NTSB has recommended that aircraft be equipped to transmit data for easier recovery without the need for underwater retrieval. The NTSB recommended equipping aircraft with technology to transmit flight data for easier recovery, urging harmonization of regulations with ICAO and foreign aviation authorities. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 (H.R. 753) would require large passenger aircraft to have continuous tracking and deployable flight recorders for timely data retrieval. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 aims to improve the recovery of flight data and cockpit voice recorders, following NTSB recommendations. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in 2015 highlighted concerns over locating and recovering maritime voyage data recorders. Under SOLAS regulations, certain vessels are required to carry voyage data recorders, which can be fixed-mount or float-free units. New regulations implemented in 2014 specify the requirements for these recorders on ships. The NTSB has not made specific recommendations regarding the recovery or survivability characteristics of maritime voyage data recorders, but concerns over data recovery may prompt congressional interest in potential options to assist investigators in the recovery of data from vessels lost in deep water. Event recorders are aiding accident investigators in various modes of transportation. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to only the owner or lessee, unless authorized by a court or for specific purposes like diagnostics or investigations by NTSB or DOT. Privacy concerns arise as technology allows for more data collection in accident investigations across different transportation modes. The bill aims to limit access to event data recorder information in vehicles to owners or lessees, except for specific purposes like diagnostics, investigations by NTSB or DOT, emergency medical response to crashes, or traffic safety research. It also requires a study on the appropriate data capture time for crash investigations. The NTSB lacks resources to investigate all railroad accidents, prompting interest in railroad accident investigations. The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 specifies funding for NTSB railroad accident investigations and addresses safety recommendations. The bill allocates increasing funding for NTSB railroad safety recommendations, including plans for positive train control systems and grants for implementation. It also mandates a study on the effectiveness of these systems in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents."
