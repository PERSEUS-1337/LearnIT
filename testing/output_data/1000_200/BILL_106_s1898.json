While most prefer law enforcement officers, fiscal or logistical concerns may necessitate the use of specialized private transport companies.

The Act defines key terms such as \"crime of violence,\" \"private prisoner transport company,\" and \"violent prisoner.\" Federal regulation of prisoner transport companies. The Attorney General, in consultation with relevant organizations, will establish regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines. These regulations will cover background checks, drug testing, and training requirements for employees of prisoner transport companies. Minimum standards for training employees in transporting prisoners include up to 100 hours of preservice training covering restraints, searches, use of force, CPR, map reading, and defensive driving. Restrictions on employee duty hours must comply with federal regulations. Standards for supervising violent prisoners should allow for discretion by the transport entity.
