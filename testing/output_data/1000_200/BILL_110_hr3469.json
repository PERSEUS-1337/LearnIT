The \"America's Border Security Act of 2007\" aims to increase the availability of Department of Defense equipment, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and surveillance equipment, to assist in preventing illegal immigration at the international land borders of the United States. A report detailing the current use of this equipment must be submitted to Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Defense must submit a report to Congress detailing the current use of Department of Defense equipment for surveillance at the US international land borders, assessing risks, and outlining plans to increase equipment usage. Additionally, the report must describe the types of equipment and support to be provided by the Secretary of Defense for a 1-year period. During a 1-year pilot program, the Secretary of Homeland Security will test unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance along the Canada-US international border. No changes to the prohibition on using the Army or Air Force as a posse comitatus. Appropriations authorized for fiscal years 2008-2012 to carry out the program. SEC. 3. INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security will construct roads, acquire barriers, and facilities for border control. Quarterly progress reports to Congress required. Appropriations authorized for fiscal years 2008-2012.\n\nSEC. 4. PORTS OF ENTRY. SEC. 4. PORTS OF ENTRY. The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to construct additional ports of entry along the international land borders of the United States and make necessary improvements to existing ports of entry. SEC. 5. SECURE COMMUNICATION. The Secretary of Homeland Security will develop a plan to enhance satellite communication for Border Patrol agents and other agencies for clear and secure communication.
