    "content": "Prior to 1996, mental health insurance coverage was historically less generous than coverage for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer hospital days, and higher cost sharing. Mental health parity laws aim to address this disparity in insurance coverage. Mental health parity laws aim to ensure that health insurance coverage for mental health services is on par with medical and surgical benefits. Policymakers have developed approaches based on coverage mandates and parity requirements to achieve this goal. The ACA expands federal mental health parity laws by requiring full parity coverage for mental illnesses. Prior to the ACA, the law employed a mandated offering parity approach, which did not mandate coverage of specific mental health services but required compliance with parity requirements for insurers covering both mental health and medical/surgical benefits. The ACA expands federal mental health parity laws by requiring full parity coverage for mental illnesses in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level but mandates coverage for certain plans. The ACA does not modify the federal mental health parity requirements but expands their applicability to various financing arrangements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity laws by requiring full parity coverage for mental illnesses in specific financing arrangements. It does not mandate coverage for specific mental health conditions but requires compliance with parity requirements for insurers offering both mental health and medical/surgical benefits. Approximately one-third of employers with over 50 employees have adjusted their benefits in response to MHPAEA. The ACA expands federal mental health parity laws by requiring full parity coverage for mental illnesses in specific financing arrangements. Recent data shows that some employers have adjusted benefits in response to MHPAEA, with a small percentage dropping coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. The majority have instead removed limits on coverage or increased utilization management. The impact of ACA requirements on coverage decisions remains unclear as they go into full effect in 2014. MHPA was the first federal mental health parity law, employing a mandated offering parity approach without coverage mandates. The MHPA (P.L. 104-204) was the first federal mental health parity law, implementing a mandated offering parity approach without coverage mandates. It requires annual and lifetime dollar limits on mental health services to be no less than those for medical and surgical services. The law applies to all group health coverage arrangements governed by ERISA, PHSA, and IRC, with a small employer exemption for businesses with 2 to 50 employees. The MHPA (P.L. 104-204) established federal mental health parity requirements for group health plans, with a small employer exemption for businesses with 2 to 50 employees. The MHPAEA (P.L. 110-343) expanded these requirements to include substance use disorders and additional parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits. The MHPAEA expanded federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders and additional parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits for small employers with only one employee seeking group insurance. The federal mental health parity requirements do not apply to the individual market. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to various types of plans, including qualified health plans (QHPs), while Medicare is not required to comply with these requirements. The expansion mandates coverage of specified mental health services by specific plan types. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to QHPs, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Small employer exemption remains, but definition expanded. QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services in compliance with parity requirements. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Medicaid benchmark plans must comply with parity requirements for financial and treatment limitations. CHIP plans are also subject to federal mental health parity requirements. ACA mandates coverage of certain mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in the individual and small group markets. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets. It requires coverage parity with medical or surgical services, extending the mandate broadly. Federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA did not mandate coverage but required full parity when offered. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets, ensuring coverage parity with medical or surgical services. This coverage mandate extends to various plan types, including essential health benefits (EHB) required for QHPs, which encompass mental health and substance abuse services as defined by ACA Section 1302(b). The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the individual and small group markets. The scope of covered services under this mandate must be defined through the rulemaking process, ensuring coverage parity with medical or surgical services. The essential health benefits package (EHBP) must be equal to the scope of benefits provided under a typical employer plan, with required elements for consideration in determining the EHBP. ACA Section 2001(c) requires all Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans to offer at least. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health services for Medicaid benchmark plans and plans in the individual and small group markets. While not a comprehensive federal mandate, these requirements create a federal-level requirement for mental health benefits coverage by a significant portion of insurers. Some states also mandate coverage of certain mental health conditions through their parity laws. Questions may arise regarding state-mandated benefits and plans offered through Exchanges. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health services for certain plans, including those in the individual and small group markets. States can require additional benefits beyond the Essential Health Benefits (EHB), but they must cover the costs. Federal mental health parity requirements apply to all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) to ensure equal coverage for mental health and substance abuse services. The ACA Section 1311(j) mandates federal mental health parity requirements for all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) in the small group and individual markets offered through the Exchanges. Large group plans may have less incentive to participate due to risk pooling benefits for small group and individual plans. The exemption of small employers from federal mental health parity requirements could impact Exchange plans. The interaction between ACA Section 1311(j) and the small employer exemption in federal mental health parity law is discussed further. Federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA had a small employer exemption for businesses with 2 to 50 employees. This exemption applied to group health plans and not individual market coverage. ACA Section 1563(c)(4) extended the federal mental health parity requirements to the individual market by updating PHSA Section 2726. This change broadened the requirements to include plans in the individual market. The ACA extended federal mental health parity requirements to individual health plans, including those in the individual market. The small employer exemption under PHSA Section 2726(c)(1) remains, but now includes employers with 1 employee in states allowing single individuals to form small groups. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still apply to employers with 1 employee in states allowing single individuals to form small groups. The definition of \"small employer\" has been expanded to include employers with an average of at least 1, but not more than 100, employees, compared to the previous limit of 2 to 50 employees. This wider range of employers is now eligible for the exemption, but states have the option to use the previous definition until 2016 for plans offered through an Exchange. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still apply to employers with 1 employee in states allowing single individuals to form small groups. The option of using the previous definition of small employer for plans offered through an Exchange raises questions about compliance with federal mental health parity requirements for plans offered to individuals in the individual market. Additionally, there is a question of whether small employer QHPs might be exempt from federal mental health parity requirements under ACA Section 1311(j). Small employer QHPs, whether offered inside or outside of an Exchange, may be exempt from federal mental health parity requirements. Medicaid can be provided through traditional state plan benefits or benchmark coverage, including managed care plans. The ACA does not specify if the small employer exemption applies to QHPs under Section 1311(j). The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include certain Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, in addition to Medicaid managed care plans. These plans must comply with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. ACA Section 2001 requires Medicaid plans to comply with parity requirements for treatment limitations and financial requirements. Plans offering EPSDT services are deemed to meet the parity requirement, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans, not Medicaid managed care plans, may not be required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements for annual and lifetime limits and in- and out-of-network covered benefits, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. It is unclear if the parity requirements extend to plans offered under traditional Medicaid. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations, including those enrolled through benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. The CHIP statute already applies federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans, unaffected by the ACA. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans, aligning them with Medicaid non-managed care plans. Changes may be needed in SSA Title XXI to reflect ACA redesignations. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans, aligning them with Medicaid non-managed care plans. SSA Section 2103(c)(6)(B) deems CHIP plans offering EPSDT as satisfying the parity requirement, but it is unclear if this fulfills all federal mental health parity requirements. Compliance with full parity requirements is required under SSA Section 2103(f)(2). The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include CHIP plans, extending coverage to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It also mandates coverage of specific mental health services for certain plan types, although not a comprehensive federal-level mandate. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include CHIP plans, extending coverage to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It also mandates coverage of specific mental health services for certain plan types, although not a comprehensive federal-level mandate. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include CHIP plans, extending coverage to plans in the individual market, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plan types. It is unclear if federal mental health parity requirements apply to non-managed care plans under traditional Medicaid. The CHIP statute contains two separate parity provisions, with one having a limited reach and the other applying requirements to CHIP plans entirely."
