    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring tax provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. ATRA also temporarily extended provisions that had expired in 2011 or 2012 through 2013. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 retroactively extended provisions that expired in 2013 through 2014. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295) extended tax provisions through 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) made temporary tax provisions permanent or extended them. These provisions, known as \"tax extenders,\" have been repeatedly extended by Congress. Debate in the 114th Congress focused on whether to make expired tax provisions permanent or extend them temporarily. In the 114th Congress, the debate on tax extenders focused on making expired provisions permanent or extending them temporarily. P.L. 114-113 extended all expired tax provisions, reducing uncertainty in the tax code. However, some provisions are still set to expire at the end of 2016, leading to further debate. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which temporarily extended various expired tax provisions. These provisions are detailed in several CRS reports, such as business tax provisions, individual tax provisions, charitable tax provisions, community assistance-related tax provisions, and housing-related tax provisions. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent various tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014. This Act also included provisions such as enhanced tax credits for education and child care, a moratorium on the medical device excise tax, changes to employer-sponsored health coverage excise tax, and extensions of tax credits for renewable energy facilities. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year, retroactively through 2014. Other legislation in the 113th Congress proposed extensions and permanent provisions for tax credits, including wind and solar energy, independent oil refineries, and research and experimentation tax credits. Certain provisions in the tax extenders, such as the R&D tax credit and increased expensing allowances under IRC Section 179, were addressed in the 114th Congress. Legislation was passed to permanently extend certain expired provisions, while the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 aimed to extend temporary provisions for two years. S. 1946 aimed to extend temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 and one provision that expired in 2013. The tax code contains numerous temporary provisions, often referred to as \"tax extenders,\" which are regularly extended by Congress for short periods. Congress may choose temporary provisions for various reasons. The number of provisions considered \"tax extenders\" has increased. Congress enacts temporary tax provisions for reasons such as evaluating effectiveness, providing relief during economic weakness or disasters, and for budgetary reasons. Temporary provisions allow for evaluation before extension or expiration. Enacting temporary tax provisions allows for evaluation before extension or expiration, but the practice of regularly extending expiring provisions without systematic review undermines this rationale. Dr. Rosanne Altshuler highlighted the importance of expiration dates to force policymakers to assess costs and benefits, but in reality, there is no real systematic review. Instead, expiring tax provisions are typically passed as a package without individual analysis. Tax extenders are usually passed as a package of temporary tax benefits without individual analysis. Some provisions, like tax incentives for ethanol, have not been extended if their benefits do not outweigh the costs. Evaluations may determine whether certain provisions should be extended based on their cost-effectiveness. Tax policy can also be used for economic stimulus or disaster relief, such as bonus depreciation or generous expensing. Tax policy can be used for economic stimulus or disaster relief through measures like bonus depreciation or enhanced casualty loss deductions. Temporary provisions, like the exclusion of mortgage forgiveness from taxable income during the housing crisis, may be enacted to address special economic circumstances. These provisions should expire once the situation is resolved, and Congress may enact temporary tax policies for budgetary reasons. Temporary tax provisions are often enacted to address special economic circumstances and should expire once the situation is resolved. Congress may enact temporary tax policies for budgetary reasons, as it is easier to find resources to offset short-term extensions rather than long-term or permanent extensions. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled under the current law baseline, which may overstate projected revenues if temporary provisions are routinely extended. Making tax provisions temporary rather than permanent has a smaller effect on the long-term fiscal outlook. Temporary tax provisions, as federal subsidies, influence economic behavior and resource allocation. Evaluating extenders involves considering their impact on efficiency, equity, and simplicity. Extenders can be efficient but not equitable, or vice versa, requiring policymakers to prioritize economic objectives. These provisions often incentivize increased activity beyond market levels. Tax extenders aim to encourage more activity and satisfy wants and needs efficiently in an economy. Market failures may justify tax distortions for improved economic welfare. Extenders should address market failures to enhance economic efficiency. Direct spending programs can be more effective than indirect subsidies like tax extenders. Fair taxes contribute to socially desirable outcomes. Tax extenders, like tax benefits, can lead to unequal tax burdens based on participation in subsidized activities, deviating from horizontal equity standards. Vertical equity in taxation requires fair distribution of tax burdens based on ability to pay, making most extenders inequitable for benefiting higher-income individuals. The disproportionate benefit of tax expenditures to individuals with higher incomes reduces the progressivity of the tax system, impacting vertical equity. For example, two teachers claiming a deduction for classroom expenses will receive different benefits based on their income tax brackets. This disparity in benefits highlights the unequal tax burdens based on ability to pay. The complexity of the tax code and extenders like temporary tax provisions raise administration costs and burden individual taxpayers. Higher-income taxpayers benefit more from tax deductions, reducing the progressivity of the tax system. Expired tax provisions were extended in P.L. 114-113, adding to the complexity of the tax code. At the end of 2014, tax provisions were extended in P.L. 114-113, with details categorized into individual, business, charitable, or energy. The individual tax extender provisions that expired in 2014 were previously extended and include deductions for classroom expenses. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses was made permanent in P.L. 114-113, along with other individual provisions like state and local sales taxes, tuition deduction, mortgage insurance deduction, and employer-provided mass transit benefits. Business provisions like research tax credit and Work Opportunity Tax Credit also expired at the end of 2014. The research tax credit, rum excise tax cover-over, Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Qualified Zone Academy Bond allocation limitation, active financing exception under Subpart F, New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and enhanced expensing allowances expired at the end of 2014. Some business-related extender provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113, while others were given longer-term extensions through 2019. The New Markets Tax Credit and bonus depreciation were extended through 2019. Table 1 shows which business tax extenders were made permanent, extended through 2019, or extended through 2016. Four charitable provisions were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The renewable energy production tax credit was extended through 2016, with wind energy extended through 2019. The production tax credit (PTC) was extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113, with wind energy extended through 2019. Various energy-related tax provisions from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 were also extended through 2016. The alternative motor vehicle credit for qualified fuel cell vehicles and the credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. These provisions were part of EPACT05 and were originally set to expire in 2014. The tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 extended various provisions through 2016 and made some provisions permanent, increasing the cost to $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. The cost of extending tax extender provisions in P.L. 114-113 is estimated at $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. 89% of the total cost is associated with permanent extensions, totaling $559.5 billion. The permanent extension of provisions that expired in 2014 is estimated at $361.4 billion, with a small portion of $17.7 billion for a two-year extension of provisions that expired in 2014 through 2016. The cost of extending tax extenders in P.L. 114-113 is estimated at $426.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. Legislation in the 114th Congress considered making certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee proposed the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) to retroactively extend expired tax provisions through 2016, with an estimated revenue reduction of $97.1 billion. The proposal also included revenue-raising provisions, bringing the total cost to $96.9 billion. The cost of extending expired provisions, as proposed in S. 1946, is estimated at $86.6 billion over 10 years. Including macroeconomic effects, the cost is expected to be less than without them. However, the increase in federal debt may offset some economic growth gains from extending business-related provisions. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that extending all expiring tax provisions before 2025 would reduce revenues by $897.9 billion over the 2016-2025 budget window. This includes costs for bonus depreciation, Section 179 expensing, and expansions to tax credits. Extending expiring tax provisions before 2025 would cost billions, with provisions like bonus depreciation costing $223.6 billion, Section 179 expensing costing $60.8 billion, and extensions to various tax credits costing $202.8 billion. Most of these provisions were extended or made permanent in P.L. 114-113, leading to higher revenue projections by CBO than actual revenue levels. This results in smaller projected budget deficits under the current law baseline. The cost of providing a short-term extension for expiring tax provisions is less than extending them through the budget window. CBO scores provide a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact of temporary tax provisions. If provisions are temporarily extended, the 10-year revenue cost may be less than in 2015, as many are tax deferrals or timing provisions like bonus depreciation. The cost of extending tax provisions through the budget window is higher than providing short-term extensions. Bonus depreciation, a timing provision, incurs a higher short-term cost compared to the long-term cost. For example, a one-year extension in 2014 cost $1.2 billion over 10 years, while the one-year cost in 2015 was $45.3 billion. Extending bonus depreciation through 2019 cost $11.3 billion over 10 years, with a 2016 cost of $90.6 billion. The revenue losses are recovered in later years due to the shifting of cost recovery forward. The tax extenders legislation passed in December 2015 made certain temporary tax provisions permanent and extended others temporarily. Bonus depreciation shifts cost recovery forward, resulting in revenue losses in earlier years, with part of that loss recovered later. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over a 10-year budget window. Legislation in previous Congresses also considered making certain expired tax provisions permanent or temporarily extending them. During the 113th Congress, the House and Senate considered legislation to extend expired tax provisions. The Senate Finance Committee reported a bill to retroactively extend tax provisions through 2016. The House passed legislation to make certain tax provisions permanent, including enhanced expensing allowances and S corporation provisions. Several tax provisions were considered during the 113th Congress, including the Permanent S Corporation Built-in Gains Recognition Period Act of 2015, the Permanent S Corporation Charitable Contribution Act of 2015, and the America Gives More Act of 2015. These measures aimed to extend expired charitable provisions and make certain tax deductions permanent, costing a total of $317.5 billion over 10 years. During the 113th and 114th Congress, various bills were considered to extend or make permanent certain tax provisions, costing a total of $317.5 billion over 10 years. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 and the EXPIRE Act were among the legislation proposed during this time. During the 113th and 114th Congress, legislation was proposed to extend or make permanent certain tax provisions, costing $317.5 billion over 10 years. The EXPIRE Act suggested extending expiring provisions through 2015, while the House passed legislation to make nine provisions permanent, reducing revenues by $511.4 billion over 10 years. Several charitable-related provisions were passed as part of the America Gives More Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719) in the 113th Congress. Legislation proposed during the 113th Congress to make two international-related extender provisions permanent was not considered in the full House. Some provisions that expired in 2013 were not extended in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-295), including the health coverage tax credit and the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles. These provisions have since been extended in subsequent legislation. The health coverage tax credit, initially enacted in 2002, had expiration dates added in 2011 and 2014 but was extended through 2019 in 2015. Another provision not extended was the credit for electric-drive motorcycles and three-wheeled vehicles, despite incentives for alternative technology vehicles. Incentives for alternative technology vehicles have mostly expired, except for plug-in electric vehicles. Two-wheeled electric plug-in vehicles received an extension through 2016. Other energy-related provisions and disaster-related provisions expired and were not extended. The disaster-related provisions, including those for areas damaged by the 2008 Midwestern storms, were not extended in the EXPIRE Act (P.L. 113-295)."
