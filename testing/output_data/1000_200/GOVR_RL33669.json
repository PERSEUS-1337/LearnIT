    "content": "In response to reports of the NSA conducting a secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), a national debate arose regarding the program's legality under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the need for additional authority, and Congressional oversight. The TSP involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals believed to be associated with al Qaeda. The Bush Administration defended the program citing constitutional and statutory support. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 as a standalone bill. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006, introduced by Senator Mitch McConnell, addressed electronic surveillance programs for detecting and preventing international terrorist threats. Related bills were introduced in the 109th and 110th Congress. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provides statutory guidance. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), established in 1978, allows for electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence information. The Bush Administration believed FISA lacked the speed to combat terrorism effectively. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007 about the challenges in using FISA for counterterrorism efforts. In January 2007, Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorized targeting international communications involving members of al Qaeda or associated terrorist organizations. Surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now require FISC approval. The President decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires. The President has decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires. The NSA program has faced legal challenges, with a court ruling it unconstitutional for violating various laws and constitutional rights. Attorney General Gonzales briefed the Intelligence Committees on classified details and directed a classified briefing for key senators. The court ruled the Terrorist Surveillance Program unconstitutional for violating multiple laws and constitutional rights. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The court ruled the Terrorist Surveillance Program unconstitutional for violating laws and constitutional rights. S. 3931 and Title II of S. 3929 would create a new Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address electronic surveillance programs. The bills would amend provisions of FISA dealing with electronic surveillance without a warrant, applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders, emergency surveillance, and congressional oversight. The bills aim to repeal wartime authorities for electronic surveillance without a warrant, amend FISA definitions, modify criminal provisions, and address the development of weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, a new Title VII in FISA would be created to regulate electronic surveillance programs. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 impacts existing law by creating a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs. This new section defines electronic surveillance programs as those gathering foreign intelligence information or protecting against terrorism, where naming every target is not feasible, and immediate or extended surveillance is necessary. Additionally, jurisdiction would be vested in the FISC under the new Section 702(a) of FISA. The proposed legislation under Sec. 4 of S. 3931 and Sec. 204 of S. 3929 would allow the FISC to review and authorize electronic surveillance programs for obtaining foreign intelligence or combating terrorism. Initial authorization can be up to 90 days, with reauthorization determined by the FISC. The Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal denials to the FIS Court of Review. The Attorney General can appeal FISC decisions to the FIS Court of Review regarding electronic surveillance programs under Title VII of FISA. If criteria for electronic surveillance under Section 104 of FISA are met, surveillance must be discontinued unless certain conditions are met. Surveillance can only continue under Title VII if an application for FISC authorization is made promptly. The Attorney General can appeal FISC decisions to the FIS Court of Review for electronic surveillance programs under Title VII of FISA. An application under Section 104 of FISA is made for FISC authorization to continue surveillance of the target. New bills authorize the transfer of cases challenging the legality of classified communications intelligence activity to the FIS Court of Review if it harms national security. The proposed language in new Section 702(b)(1) of FISA states that the originating court must transfer the case if the Attorney General's affidavit indicates harm to national security. However, it is unclear if the transfer would be to the FIS Court of Review. Proposed subsection 702(b)(2) of FISA gives jurisdiction to the FISC to determine standing and the legality of the program. In the subsection \"Procedures for Review,\" the FISC has jurisdiction to determine standing and the legality of the program. If national security information needs to be disclosed in a criminal proceeding, it will be governed by specific laws. Decisions of the FISC can be reviewed by the FIS Court of Review and may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Under new subsection 702(b)(3), the United States may seek review of decisions by the FIS Court of Review on certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision of the FISC would be binding in all other courts. Litigation privileges are preserved under new subsection 702(b)(5). A new Section 703 of FISA is created, setting out requirements for applications for approval of electronic surveillance programs. Subsection 703(b) authorizes the FISC to require the Attorney General to furnish necessary information for court determinations under new section 704. Sec. 6 of S. 3931 creates a new subsection 704 addressing necessary findings for an ex parte FISC order approving electronic surveillance programs. The court must find approval consistent with the U.S. Constitution, and new subsection 704(b) of FISA identifies factors for assessing constitutionality. Sec. 7 of S. 3931 introduces new Sec. 705 of FISA for congressional oversight, requiring the Attorney General to submit classified reports every 180 days to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Sec. 8 of S. 3931 and Sec. 208 of S. 3929 make amendments to FISA, including repealing certain sections that allow the President to authorize electronic surveillance programs. Congressional oversight is addressed in Sec. 705, requiring the Attorney General to submit classified reports every 180 days to specific committees. The amendments in S. 3931 and S. 3929 repeal sections of FISA that allow the President to authorize electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days following a declaration of war. Current laws prohibit interception of communications unless specific exceptions apply. The Communications Act of 1934 allows electronic surveillance by US officials in the course of their duties under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The exclusivity provision in current law does not affect the government's acquisition of information. The exclusivity provision in current law allows electronic surveillance by US officials under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, without affecting the government's acquisition of foreign intelligence information from international communications. Under the current law, electronic surveillance is prohibited except when conducted under FISA or specific provisions related to interception of communications and access to stored data. Proposed amendments clarify that the government can acquire foreign intelligence information authorized by federal law or the Constitution. The proposed amendments to FISA address criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. The proposed amendments to FISA increase penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. This includes raising fines from $10,000 to $100,000 and increasing imprisonment terms from 5 years to 15 years. Additional amendments to FISA include expanding definitions in the law. The proposed amendments to FISA include expanding definitions in the law, such as broadening the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" and updating the definition of \"electronic surveillance.\" The proposed amendments to FISA include expanding definitions in the law, such as broadening the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" and updating the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" to include new criteria for acquiring information and contents of communication. The proposed amendments to FISA expand definitions, including broadening the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" and updating the definition of \"electronic surveillance.\" Minimization procedures aim to limit acquisition and dissemination of non-public information on U.S. persons during foreign intelligence activities, allowing retention and dissemination of evidence of criminal activity. The intelligence information under FISA should not identify any US person without consent, unless necessary for understanding foreign intelligence. Minimization procedures apply to electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence, restricting disclosure of communications involving US persons without court order or threat determination by the Attorney General. The curr_chunk discusses changes to minimization procedures under FISA, emphasizing the restriction on disclosing communications involving US persons without a court order or threat determination by the Attorney General. This amendment would replace subsection 104(h)(4) with new language to ensure that no contents of any communication from a US person are disclosed, disseminated, used, or retained for longer than 7 days without a court order or threat indication. The curr_chunk discusses changes to wire communication definitions and contents under FISA, proposing to strike the current definition of \"wire communication\" and replace the definition of \"contents\" with a broader scope. Section 102 of FISA authorizes electronic surveillance without a court order for acquiring foreign intelligence information. The proposed amendment would expand the scope of electronic surveillance to include communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. The proposed amendment to Section 102 of FISA expands electronic surveillance to include communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers, removing the requirement for the Attorney General to certify the lack of substantial likelihood of acquiring U.S. person communication contents. Surveillance must still comply with certification and minimization procedures, with the Attorney General reporting compliance assessments to congressional intelligence committees. The amended language in Section 102 of FISA requires the Attorney General to assess compliance with minimization procedures and report to congressional intelligence committees. If electronic surveillance targets an agent of a foreign power, the report must include justification for this belief. The Attorney General must transmit certifications to the FISC under seal, and can direct common carriers to provide information. The current Sec.102(a)(4), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)(4), allows the Attorney General to direct common carriers to assist with electronic surveillance while maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference. The proposed FISA amendment does not include this provision, but introduces new authority for the President to authorize surveillance. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA introduces new authority for the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning a person believed to be outside the US, under certain conditions. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA introduces new authority for the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning a person believed to be outside the US, under certain conditions. The certification by the Attorney General for such acquisition must have a significant purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information and meet defined minimization procedures. Compliance with the certification and minimization procedures is required, with the Attorney General reporting assessments to congressional intelligence committees. The Attorney General's certification under proposed subsection 102(a) of FISA would be transmitted to the FISC and maintained under seal unless needed for legality determination. The Attorney General could direct a person to provide necessary assistance for acquisition, with records kept under approved security procedures. Compensation at prevailing rates would be required for the specified person providing aid. The new subsection 102(d) of FISA requires the government to compensate individuals providing aid at prevailing rates. Failure to comply with the Attorney General's directive could result in recourse to the FISC, with disobedience punishable as contempt of court. Individuals can challenge the legality of the directive by filing a petition with the FISC judges within 24 hours. The FISC judge assigned must review a petition within 24 hours. If deemed frivolous, it is denied, otherwise, a written determination is made within 72 hours. A petition to modify a directive can only be granted if it is unlawful. Failure to comply results in affirming the directive. A petition to the FIS Court of Review can be made by the Government or recipients of the directive. The FIS Court of Review must review petitions within 7 days of the FISC decision. A written statement of reasons must be provided. The U.S. Supreme Court can be petitioned for a writ of certiorari. Judicial proceedings must be conducted expeditiously and records maintained under security measures. The record of FISA proceedings, including petitions, orders, and reasons for decisions, must be securely maintained. Petitions are filed under seal, and Government submissions with classified information can be reviewed by the court privately. No legal action can be taken against communication service providers for assisting the Government under FISA directives. Under proposed subsection 102(k) of FISA, information acquired under an Attorney General authorization may be used or disclosed by federal officers without the consent of the United States person, only in accordance with minimization procedures. Information acquired under this section can only be used for lawful purposes and cannot be disclosed for law enforcement purposes without a statement that it may only be used in a criminal proceeding. New subsection 102(k) of FISA allows information obtained under an Attorney General authorization to be used in criminal proceedings only with advance authorization. Privileged communications obtained under Section 102 retain their privileged status. Proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) outline procedures for using or disclosing this information in federal, state, or local proceedings. The federal government can introduce or use information acquired under Section 102 of FISA in any trial or proceeding within the United States. Under Section 102 of FISA, information obtained can be used in proceedings with advance notification to the aggrieved person and the court. Similarly, state or local authorities can only use information from Section 102 acquisitions in trials or proceedings. Information obtained from a Section 102 acquisition can be used in legal proceedings with notification to the aggrieved person and the court. The aggrieved person can move to suppress the evidence if it was unlawfully acquired or not in line with an authorization order. The motion to suppress evidence from a Section 102 acquisition must be made before the trial, hearing, or proceeding, unless there is no opportunity or the person is unaware of the grounds. If the Attorney General affirms that disclosure would harm national security, a motion to suppress can be filed when seeking to discover related materials in court. When a motion is made before a federal or state court regarding a Section 102 acquisition, the court will determine if the acquisition was lawfully conducted. The court may review relevant materials in camera and disclose necessary information to the aggrieved person under security procedures. Under proposed subsection 102(q) of FISA, if a U.S. district court finds that an acquisition authorized under Section 102 was not lawfully conducted, unlawfully obtained evidence would be suppressed. If the court determines the acquisition was lawful, the aggrieved person's motion would be denied, except for necessary discovery or disclosure. Orders granting motions, decisions on lawful authorization, and court orders for review or disclosure of related materials may be issued under subsection 102(o). Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers to consult with law enforcement personnel to investigate or protect against various threats posed by foreign powers or their agents. Court orders related to Section 102 acquisitions are binding on all federal and state courts except for U.S. court of appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court. Proposed subsection 102(t) of FISA requires coordination for investigations related to weapons of mass destruction or clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or their agents. Directives and orders under Section 102 must be retained for 10 years. Amendments allow the Chief Justice to designate FISC judges, with a requirement for some to reside near Washington D.C. New subsection 103(g) provides authority for FISC orders under Title I of FISA with presidential authorization. A new subsection 103(g) would be added to FISA, providing authority for FISC orders under Title I with presidential authorization. Amendments to Sec. 104 of FISA include replacing current subsections with new ones. Certification requirements for electronic surveillance under FISA must be met in court orders. The certification for electronic surveillance under FISA would now be made by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an authorized executive branch official. Subsection 104(b) of FISA deals with excluding certain information from FISC orders for electronic surveillance targeting foreign powers. The curr_chunk discusses the exclusion of certain information from FISC orders for electronic surveillance targeting foreign powers. It proposes changes to the application requirements and the redesignation of subsections in FISA. The curr_chunk discusses proposed amendments to FISA, including expanding the list of officials who can request a review of surveillance applications. It also mentions changes to FISA Section 105 regarding FISC orders for electronic surveillance. The proposed amendments to FISA include changes to Section 105, where subsections would be redesignated and replaced. This involves deleting and replacing subsection 105(c)(1) with new specifications for electronic surveillance orders. The proposed amendments to FISA involve redesignating and replacing subsection 105(c)(1) with new specifications for electronic surveillance orders. This includes specifying the authorized coverage of devices and minimization procedures. The proposed amendments to FISA involve redesignating and replacing subsection 105(c)(1) with new specifications for electronic surveillance orders, including details on the type of surveillance, information sought, and physical entry requirements. Extensions of surveillance orders can be granted based on new findings, with exceptions outlined. The proposed amendments to FISA involve redesignating and replacing subsection 105(c)(1) with new specifications for electronic surveillance orders. Extensions of surveillance orders can be granted based on new findings, with exceptions outlined for specific targets and time limits. The proposed amendments to FISA involve extending surveillance orders based on new findings, with specific targets and time limits outlined. Extensions may be granted for a reasonable period or one year, whichever is less, under the new subsection 105(e)(2). Emergency authorization for electronic surveillance without a court order is allowed for up to 72 hours in certain situations. The proposed amendments to FISA allow for emergency electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours. The Attorney General must notify a judge of the emergency surveillance, and a court order must be sought within this timeframe. Surveillance must be terminated when the information is acquired, if a court order is denied, or at the end of the 72 hours. Use or disclosure of information acquired without a court order is restricted. The proposed amendments to FISA allow for emergency electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours. The new law would grant authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President to conduct electronic surveillance in emergencies, with the Attorney General being informed. The new law would require a FISC judge to be informed \"as soon as practicable following authorization\" of emergency electronic surveillance. An application for an FISC order must be made within seven days after authorization, and surveillance shall terminate when the information is obtained. The new law allows for emergency electronic surveillance to be approved by an executive branch officer appointed by the President, with restrictions on disclosure and use of information obtained. Surveillance must terminate when information is obtained or after seven days from approval. The revised language in the new law requires minimization procedures for emergency electronic surveillance to be followed. It also modifies limitations of liability for providers of information, facilities, or technical assistance related to FISA electronic surveillance or physical search. The revised law requires minimization procedures for emergency electronic surveillance and modifies limitations of liability for providers of aid in FISA electronic surveillance or physical search. Sec. 106 of FISA restricts the use of information on unconsenting U.S. persons acquired from electronic surveillance and includes notification requirements. The revised law includes notification requirements and allows an aggrieved person to move to suppress unlawfully acquired information from electronic surveillance under FISA. It also modifies the destruction of unintentionally acquired information in certain circumstances. The revised law includes notification requirements and allows an aggrieved person to move to suppress unlawfully acquired information from electronic surveillance under FISA. It also modifies the destruction of unintentionally acquired information in certain circumstances, emphasizing the need for a warrant for law enforcement purposes and the destruction of contents if all parties are in the United States, unless there is a threat of harm. The amendment to subsection 106(i) of FISA in S. 3886 and S. 2453 is somewhat unclear regarding the insertion of language related to significant foreign intelligence information. The language in the provision regarding the destruction of unintentionally acquired information under FISA is unclear. If the Attorney General determines that the contents contain significant foreign intelligence information or indicate a threat of harm, they may not be destroyed. The Attorney General can prevent the destruction of unintentionally acquired information if it contains foreign intelligence or indicates a threat of harm. Amendments are made to FISA sections regarding oversight and conforming language changes. The proposed amendment in S. 3929 and S. 3931 aims to enhance congressional oversight by requiring a feasibility study for a secure document management system to streamline the preparation and review of FISC orders for electronic surveillance. This system would involve key government agencies and facilitate prompt submission of applications to the FISC. The proposed amendment in S. 3931 and S. 3929 aims to streamline the submission of applications to the FISC for electronic surveillance by enhancing congressional oversight and facilitating the prompt transmittal of FISC rulings. Amendments to Title I of FISA include adding a new category of persons defined as \"agents of a foreign power\" who engage in the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Under the proposed amendment in S. 3931 and S. 3929, a new category of persons would be defined as \"agents of a foreign power\" under FISA if they engage in the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This expands the current definition which includes those involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or activities in preparation for them on behalf of a foreign power. The proposed amendment in S. 3931 and S. 3929 expands the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA to include individuals involved in the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This new subsection defines \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include destructive devices intended to cause death or injury to a significant number of people, weapons designed to cause harm through toxic chemicals, and biological agents or toxins. The proposed amendment in S. 3931 and S. 3929 expands the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA to include individuals involved in the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including those designed to cause death or injury through toxic chemicals, biological agents, or radiation. Amendments to FISA sections would address international movements of targets for electronic surveillance and physical searches. The proposed amendments in S. 3931 and S. 3929 expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA to include individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction. New subsections in FISA address the duration and extension of orders for electronic surveillance and physical searches related to international movements of targets. The court grants the motion to extinguish the order. Amendments in S. 3931 and S. 3929 would update the table of contents of FISA and create a new Title VII."
