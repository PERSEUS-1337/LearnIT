FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\" Congress finds that the tax treatment of section 529 college savings plans was changed in 2001 to exempt qualified distributions from income tax. These plans help middle-class families save for college, with 11.83 million accounts totaling $244.5 billion in assets. States sponsoring 529 plans play a significant role in promoting college savings. The average 529 account size is $20,671, with all 50 states holding a total of $244.5 billion in assets. States encourage college savings by allowing minimum contributions as low as $25 per month. The President's proposed tax on 529 plans may deter usage, leading to increased student debt. Qualified distributions from 529 plans should include expenses like computer purchases for higher education. The purpose of this Act is to strengthen and modernize 529 college savings plans to better support students today. Qualified distributions should include education expenses like computer purchases. Computer technology and equipment are now permanently allowed as qualified higher education expenses for Section 529 accounts. The amendment allows computer technology and equipment to be considered qualified higher education expenses for Section 529 accounts, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014. SEC. 3 eliminates distribution aggregation requirements in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, effective for distributions after December 31, 2014. SEC. 4 allows re-contribution of refunded amounts. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program within 60 days of the refund, not exceeding the refunded amount. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program within 60 days of the refund, not exceeding the refunded amount. The effective date for this amendment is after December 31, 2014. The House of Representatives passed the amendment on February 25, 2015, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
