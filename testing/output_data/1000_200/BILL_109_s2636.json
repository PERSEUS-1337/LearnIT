    "content": "The \"Oil Company Accountability Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes an Energy Tax Rebate under a new section 6430 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Individuals will receive a $500 payment against the tax imposed for the 2006 taxable year. The Secretary will remit the payment within 30 days of the enactment. Certain individuals, estates, trusts, and nonresident aliens are not eligible for this payment. Section 151 allows the $500 payment for the 2006 taxable year to certain individuals, estates, trusts, and nonresident aliens. A conforming amendment is made to Section 1324(b)(2) of title 31, and a clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section regarding energy tax rebate shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. Additionally, there is a revaluation of LIFO inventories of large integrated oil companies. The taxpayer, if an applicable integrated oil company for its last taxable year ending in 2005, must increase the value of historic LIFO inventories of oil, gas, or petroleum products by a layer adjustment amount. This results in a decrease in the cost of goods sold for that year. If the increases exceed the cost of goods sold, the gross income is increased by the excess amount. The layer adjustment amount is defined for this purpose. The layer adjustment amount, defined as $18.75 multiplied by the number of barrels of crude oil or barrel-of-oil equivalents in a historic LIFO layer, is not considered a change in accounting method. No change in accounting method for adjustment required by this section. No addition to tax under section 6655 for underpayments due to this section.
