    "content": "The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to authorize $9,839,262,000 for fiscal year 2007, with $50,000,000 allocated for Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Sciences (PALS) under section 10A. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 authorizes a program to award grants to high-need local educational agencies for access to laboratory science to enhance math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level through partnerships. Grants are awarded on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis. To be eligible for a grant under the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002, a high-need local educational agency must form a partnership with an institution of higher education, a business or nonprofit organization, and potentially other entities. The Federal share of the grant funding cannot exceed 33 percent, and approved agencies can receive grants for a specified duration. High-need local educational agencies approved for grants can receive funding for 3 fiscal years. To be eligible, agencies must submit a plan outlining how laboratory improvements align with state academic standards. The funding for high-need local educational agencies approved for grants can support laboratory improvements aligned with state mathematics and science academic achievement standards. The proposed improvements aim to enhance the quality of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction through clear learning outcomes, sequenced experiences, integration of science content, and student reflection and discussion. The grant proposal must include plans for professional development, safety compliance, maintenance of laboratory facilities, and assessment methods to study the impact of laboratory science on students. The grant proposal aims to enhance secondary science education by improving laboratories and providing instrumentation to improve student understanding of scientific concepts and achievement. Grants awarded under this section must supplement existing programs and draw upon the expertise of all partners to enhance the quality of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. The grant proposal aims to enhance secondary science education by improving laboratories and providing instrumentation to improve student understanding of scientific concepts and achievement. This includes developing a plan for laboratory improvement, purchasing equipment, maintaining facilities, providing teacher training, and developing curricula. The grant proposal includes professional development and training for teachers, curriculum development to integrate laboratory experiences with classroom instruction, training in laboratory safety for school personnel, and hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology. The grant proposal includes professional development, curriculum integration, safety training, and hands-on experiences to promote interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology. Grants awarded under this section cannot be used for new facility construction. High-need local educational agencies must submit an application to the Director for grant consideration. The application for the grant must be submitted to the Director with specific information required. This includes a description of the partnership, roles of each member, the proposed plan, and details of activities aligned with academic standards in mathematics and science. The grant application must include details of activities promoting student achievement in mathematics and science based on research, expected to enhance student performance and strengthen instruction quality, and encourage interest in underrepresented individuals. The grant application must include a description of activities promoting student achievement in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to prepare individuals for postsecondary studies in these fields. It should also outline how changes in student achievement will be assessed, how the partnership will assess success, and how programmatic assessments will be shared with the research community. The Director will evaluate applications based on these criteria. The Director will review grant applications based on the partnership's ability to effectively carry out proposed programs, alignment with state academic standards, use of relevant research, and potential for widespread implementation in larger reform efforts. The Director will evaluate the program based on the partnership's potential for widespread implementation in larger reform efforts and its ability to attract individuals interested in STEM fields. The Director will evaluate the program based on the partnership's potential for widespread implementation in larger reform efforts and its ability to attract individuals interested in STEM fields. The evaluation will use a common set of benchmarks and assessment tools to identify best practices and materials developed by the partnerships. Results will be disseminated to the public and compared with other partnerships funded by State or Federal agencies. The Director will disseminate program results to relevant committees and make effective materials widely available to the public. Additionally, technical assistance will be provided to high-need local educational agencies upon request. The Director will provide technical assistance to local educational agencies in developing quality grant applications and activities. An annual meeting will be convened for high-need agencies receiving grants to promote national collaboration. The Director will report on coordination efforts to relevant committees. The annual report will describe how the program authorized under this section is coordinated with the program authorized under part B of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Definitions in this section include the term 'high-need local educational agency'. The term 'high-need local educational agency' includes a local educational agency eligible for the Rural and Low-Income School Program. The term 'National Laboratory' is defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005."
