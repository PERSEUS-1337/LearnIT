    "content": "The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 authorized federal agencies to participate in Everglades restoration projects under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The Everglades is crucial to the South Florida ecosystem, which includes national wildlife refuges and national park units. Changes in water quantity and quality since the 1950s have significantly impacted the region's ecology, leading to water shortages during the dry season. The Everglades, a network of wetland landscapes in Florida, once stretched 220 miles from Orlando to Florida Bay. It served as a natural filter and retention area, recharging aquifers. Water shortages are expected to increase due to rising urban and agricultural demand. The Everglades, a vast wetland landscape in Florida, acted as a natural filter and recharge area for aquifers. However, by the mid-1800s, it was seen as unproductive and efforts to control floods and reclaim land led to human interventions like the C&SF project. This project, authorized in 1948, manipulated the Everglades' hydrology with canals, levees, and water control structures. The C&SF project in South Florida has significantly altered the Everglades' water regime, leading to habitat loss and reduced size of the ecosystem. Urban and agricultural development, combined with degraded water quality from pollutants, have further threatened plant and animal species in the area. The Everglades is harmed by degraded water quality due to pollutants from urban areas and agricultural runoff. Nutrients like phosphorous and nitrogen have caused a decline in native vegetation and an overabundance of invasive species. Restoration activities, led by the federal government and the State of Florida, aim to address the health of the Everglades through acquiring lands and implementing a multi-species recovery plan. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force coordinates these efforts to \"get the water right.\" The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, formalized by WRDA 1996, aims to coordinate restoration activities in the Everglades. The Task Force's goals include \"getting the water right,\" restoring natural habitats, and fostering compatibility of built and natural systems. The estimated cost for achieving these goals in South Florida is nearly $20 billion, with $10.9 billion allocated to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). CERP focuses on capturing and storing freshwater for use during the dry season, with 80% directed to the natural system and 20% for agricultural and urban consumption. CERP aims to capture and redistribute water in South Florida, with 80% directed to the natural system and 20% for agricultural and urban use. WRDA 2000 approved CERP and authorized $700 million in federal funds for initial projects. WRDA 2007 authorized additional activities, totaling roughly $2.0 billion in authorizations. Title VI of WRDA 2000 established that construction, operation, and maintenance costs of CERP projects would be equally shared by Floridian stakeholders and the federal government, totaling roughly $2.0 billion in authorizations. CERP authorization was achieved after negotiations among federal, state, local, and tribal stakeholders. Federal agencies responsible for CERP components receive appropriations through annual bills. Information on appropriations for CERP activities is available in CRS Report RL34009. Support for CERP projects remains broad, but concerns persist over implementation, prioritization, federal efforts, and mitigation of excess phosphorous. Issues also include restoration effectiveness and technological uncertainties. Since WRDA 2000, $0.37 billion in federal funds and $1.63 billion in state funds have been allocated to CERP projects. Some state funds have been allocated to CERP projects, particularly those part of the Acceler8 effort to expedite priority projects. Concerns arise over prioritization favoring water supply over ecosystem restoration, with proponents arguing for the dual benefits of priority projects. Federal funding pace is criticized as slow, while federal policies support participation in ecosystem restoration projects like CERP. Some stakeholders are concerned about specific Everglades restoration projects primarily benefiting locally rather than nationally. Costs for CERP projects have increased, especially due to land acquisition expenses, leading Acceler8 proponents to push for quicker action. Stakeholders fear that high CERP costs may limit funds for other national ecosystem restoration projects. Traditional Corps projects for navigation and flood control are also worried about potential funding limitations. The completion of CERP projects has been delayed, raising concerns about the feasibility of the plan. Delays in the Modified Waters Deliveries Project may impact water flows for Everglades restoration. Concerns exist that funding for other national ecosystem restoration projects may be limited due to high CERP costs. The interdependency of CERP and non-CERP projects for achieving ecosystem restoration goals was codified in WRDA 2000, which restricted appropriations until Mod Waters is complete. Controversy also surrounds a Florida state law authorizing a plan to mitigate phosphorus pollution in the Everglades, with critics concerned about potential delays in restoration efforts. Provisions in the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, FY2006 conditioned funds for restoration on achieving water quality standards in federal properties. The FY2006 Interior appropriations act conditioned restoration funds on meeting water quality standards in federal properties, showing congressional interest in overseeing water quality in Florida's federal lands. Some question the effectiveness and necessity of the complex and costly CERP plan for Everglades restoration, expressing concerns about water quality improvements and the plan's focus on water supply over natural systems. Some groups and federal agencies criticize CERP for prioritizing water supply over ecological restoration in the Everglades. The Corps made changes to include restoration activities earlier, but some still oppose CERP. Environmental groups support CERP but are concerned about using funds meant for land acquisition for other projects. Acquiring land early in the restoration process is crucial to prevent irreversible damage, according to the National Research Council. The National Research Council emphasizes the importance of acquiring land early in the restoration process to prevent irreversible damage in the Greater Everglades. Questions have been raised about the management of Lake Okeechobee, flood management in central Florida, integration of water management issues into restoration efforts, and the impact of sea level rise and climate change on the Everglades ecosystem. Ecosystem restoration is a developing science, and adaptive management is being used to address uncertainties in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is still in development, utilizing adaptive management to address uncertainties. Pilot projects, including aquifer storage and recovery (ASR), aim to test new water management strategies. However, these projects have not been completed, leading to uncertainties in their effectiveness for early water storage."
