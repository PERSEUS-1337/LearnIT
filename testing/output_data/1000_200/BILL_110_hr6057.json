Congress finds that Americans value healthy oceans and wildlife, especially in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas of Alaska, which support a variety of endangered species crucial to the subsistence cultures of Alaska Native peoples. Scientists widely agree on the importance of these ecosystems. The Arctic is experiencing significant climate change, impacting sea ice habitats for polar bears, walrus, and seals. The US proposed listing polar bears as a threatened species in 2007 due to the projected loss of sea ice. The Department of the Interior missed the deadline in 2008 to make a final decision on this matter. In 2008, the Department of the Interior missed the deadline to decide on providing Endangered Species Act protections to polar bears. Despite this, they proceeded with oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea, a polar bear habitat. A court ruling mandated a decision on listing polar bears under the Endangered Species Act by May 15, 2008. The United States Geological Survey issued reports in September 2007 projecting significant loss of polar bear population due to future sea ice changes. Global warming is the main threat to polar bears, but potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas poses additional risks to marine life. Potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas poses risks to polar bears and marine life due to the lack of effective oil spill recovery methods in the harsh Arctic environment. The Minerals Management Service plans to offer millions of acres in these areas for lease, overlapping with vital polar bear habitat. The environmental impact statement for Lease Sale 193 in the Chukchi Sea highlights the potential effects of Arctic Ocean lease sales. The Minerals Management Service warns that oil spills in the Arctic Ocean, particularly during the broken-ice period, could harm polar bears, whales, and walruses. Lack of information on marine mammal ecology and habitat use is a concern. Onshore industrial activities to support offshore oil and gas development can damage important habitat and disturb denning polar bears and other wildlife. Oil and gas development also threatens subsistence resources, public health, and wildlife survival. Tribal governments oppose offshore oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to threats to subsistence resources, public health, and cultural survival. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas. Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits leasing, preleasing, or any related activity in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine resources is identified by the National Research Council. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea areas until missing information on marine resources is identified by the National Research Council, focusing on climate change impacts and supporting baseline information for oil and gas activities. The Native communities' subsistence activities are being evaluated for environmental, public health, and cultural studies. A report will be submitted to Congress identifying missing information, evaluating ongoing studies, and making recommendations. The report to Congress evaluates ongoing and completed studies, makes recommendations for additional research needed, and addresses the listing of polar bears as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. The Secretary must conduct an oil spill response gap analysis for arctic oil operations and set a standard for lessees to recover at least 85% of spilled oil within 30 days in any ice condition. The regulations require achieving an 85 percent oil recovery standard before issuing leases or approving exploration and production plans. Additionally, areas can be closed to oil and gas activities due to response gaps in oil spill recovery. The regulations mandate an 85 percent oil recovery standard before authorizing oil and gas activities in certain areas. Operating restrictions and spill prevention systems are required to enhance safety and minimize spill risks. The Secretary must ensure all recommendations from the National Research Council are implemented before allowing exploration and development activities in specific planning areas. Development activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas must not pose a substantial risk to wildlife, habitat, or subsistence. Mitigation measures must be identified and proven effective. The term 'response gap' refers to a period where oil spill recovery standards cannot be met, and 'response gap analysis' calculates spill response system limits. The response operating limits of spill response systems are calculated for environmental factors like wind, sea state, sea ice, and visibility. This includes analyzing the frequency, duration, and timing of conditions that could limit a response in a specific location, considering local response capabilities and oil spill contingency plans. The methodology used accounts for the cumulative interaction of factors that could cause multiple variables to exceed system limits when combined. The methodology calculates response operating limits for spill response systems based on environmental factors like wind, sea state, sea ice, and visibility. It assesses the frequency, duration, and timing of limiting factors that may prevent achieving the oil spill recovery standard. The quantification includes determining the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response limits. The methodology calculates response operating limits for spill response systems based on environmental factors to achieve the oil spill recovery standard. It assesses the duration of time local conditions exceed spill response limits."
