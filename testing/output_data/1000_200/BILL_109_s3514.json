    "content": "The Act titled \"Social Security Number Online Protection Act of 2006\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains the findings of the Act. The inappropriate display of social security account numbers has led to illegal activities like fraud and identity theft, affecting interstate commerce and public safety. Social security numbers are required for various purposes, but their misuse can facilitate crime and invasion of privacy. The Federal Government must take action to prevent the misuse of social security numbers, which can lead to crime, fraud, and privacy violations. Public documents in many jurisdictions may contain social security numbers, increasing the risk of misuse. The online availability of public records stored by official repositories increases the risk of social security numbers being widely displayed and misused. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON DISPLAYING LAST 4 DIGITS OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBERS ONLINE BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. Title 18, United States Code, is amended to include a new chapter prohibiting the public display of the last 4 digits of social security account numbers by state and local governments on the internet. Sec. 2731 prohibits State and local governments from displaying the last 4 digits of social security account numbers online. This does not override stricter restrictions in Federal or State laws. Sec. 2732 outlines penalties for non-compliance. Sec. 2732 imposes civil penalties on States or political subdivisions for substantial noncompliance with displaying social security numbers online. The Attorney General can enforce this through civil actions in federal court. Sec. 2734 defines \"display to the general public on the Internet\" as placing a social security account number in a viewable manner on a public Internet site, including those that require a fee for access. The term 'social security account number' refers to the account number assigned to an individual, organization, or entity, excluding a State or any executive, legislative, or judicial agency of a State. If a State employee, contractor, or political subdivision requires the transmittal of an individual's social security account number via the Internet without proper encryption, it will be considered as displaying the number on the Internet. The term 'social security account number' refers to the account number assigned to an individual by the Commissioner of Social Security, including any derivative of such number. The amendment prohibits state and local governments from displaying social security account numbers on the internet. Grants are provided to help them comply with the prohibition on displaying the last 4 digits of social security account numbers. Effective date applies to violations occurring after the enactment of the Act. The Attorney General awards grants to States and political subdivisions to remove or redact the last 4 digits of social security numbers from public internet records. States must apply for grants by submitting an application to the Attorney General. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. The Attorney General is authorized to award grants to States for removing social security numbers from public records. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The term \"State\" includes 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Marianas."
