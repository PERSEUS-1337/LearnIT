    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that Canadian grain exports under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement have caused financial losses to American farmers and disrupted domestic grain prices. The exports continue to increase without limits, further harming U.S. farmers each year. The Congress approved the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, requiring consultations with Canada on the Canadian Wheat Board's price setting policy affecting goods exported to the United States. The President must enter immediate consultation with Canada to exclude transport rates. The President must consult with Canada to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates under Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act for consumption in the United States. However, there has been no progress on these consultations, leading to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. The Trade Agreement prohibits selling agricultural goods below the acquisition price plus related costs. TITLE I--GRAIN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY. Negotiations with Canada to determine Canadian Wheat Board prices must be pursued by the President. If negotiations fail within 120 days, Canada will be considered in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. If negotiations with Canada on Canadian Wheat Board prices fail, Canada will be treated as in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. All imports of Canadian grain to the United States will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 102. The President must negotiate with Canada to exclude agricultural goods shipped via east coast ports for consumption in the US from Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain benefiting from transport rates will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. The President must negotiate with Canada to clarify the term \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to include transportation subsidies, payments to producers, and other subsidies related to grain. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended. If negotiations fail to clarify the term \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 104. Federal agencies must provide technical assistance to petitioners in countervailing duty cases regarding Canadian subsidies for wheat and barley exports to the US. SEC. 201. Export Enhancement Program can be used to promote grain exports. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports from the United States, allowing for effective competition with Canadian grain producers. This includes considering transportation subsidies provided by Canada and the pricing strategies of the Canadian Wheat Board in foreign markets. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to address transportation subsidies from Canada and pricing strategies of the Canadian Wheat Board in foreign markets, specifically targeting sales to Mexico and wheat sales below acquisition cost. These requirements will remain in effect until an agreement is reached with Canada to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates. The United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 is amended to counteract the sale of wheat by the Canadian Wheat Board below acquisition cost until an agreement is reached with Canada. SEC. 202. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROGRAM PROTECTION. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 by adding a new subtitle for Agricultural Export Program Protection. The curr_chunk defines the term 'agricultural trade program' as export promotion, credit, guarantee, or food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation under various acts, excluding specific programs. The curr_chunk defines 'covered foreign commodity' as wheat, feed grains, or soybeans imported into the US, and 'entry' as the import or withdrawal from warehouse. The term 'person' includes exporters. The curr_chunk defines 'person' as including exporters, assignees, and participants in agricultural trade programs, and 'Secretary' as the Secretary of Agriculture. The term 'United States agricultural commodity' is defined as in the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. The curr_chunk discusses the monitoring of domestic uses of certain foreign commodities. The curr_chunk requires an end-use certificate for covered foreign commodities and quarterly reports from consignees certifying usage percentages. The curr_chunk requires end-use certificates and quarterly reports from consignees, specifying usage of covered foreign commodities and transfer details if ownership changes. The Secretary determines the necessary information for the certificates and reports. The Secretary mandates end-use certificates and quarterly reports from consignees for covered foreign commodities, requiring details like importer, consignee, country of origin, quantity, purpose of use, and transporter information. The quarterly report must include information on the transporter of the covered foreign commodity, end-use certificates held by the consignee, quantity used, and the purpose of use for each quantity. The quarterly report must include details such as the consignee's use of each quantity, quantity exported, commingling with US commodities, transfer to subsequent consignees, and changes in end-use. The Secretary may also require reporting of sales price by the importer or first consignee of a covered foreign commodity. The Secretary may require reporting of sales price for covered foreign commodities to facilitate enforcement of trade laws. Confidentiality measures will be taken to protect purchaser information. Entry of covered foreign commodities is prohibited without presenting a compliant end-use certificate. Penalties may be imposed for non-compliance. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for end-use certificates for covered foreign commodities, with penalties for violations up to $10,000. Regulations will also cover quarterly report submissions. SEC. 1583 states that compliance provisions from the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 apply to authorized programs under this subtitle. SEC. 1584 addresses suspension or debarment for using foreign agricultural commodities in certain trade programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from participating in an agricultural trade program for using a foreign agricultural commodity in violation of program terms. The Corporation may waive suspension or debarment if the person proves the use was unintentional and the quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for using a foreign agricultural commodity in violation of program terms if the use was unintentional and the quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total. This section and the amendment made by this section will become effective 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for unintentional use of a foreign agricultural commodity in violation of program terms if quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total."
