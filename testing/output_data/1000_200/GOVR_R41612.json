    "content": "The United States has historically been a major provider of food aid globally, but funding for agricultural development has declined. Critics argue that this has reduced the capacity of the U.S. to provide assistance. President Obama made alleviating global hunger a priority, especially after the global food price crisis of 2007-2008. In response, the Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a new global hunger and food security initiative in 2009. The Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for the Feed the Future initiative in 2009 to promote global agricultural development, food security, and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations. There is a call for reform in American food aid and foreign assistance to address these issues with increased attention and political will. Some argue for more innovative approaches in the new U.S. global food security initiative. The U.S. global food security initiative aims to address issues through innovative approaches, increased buy-in from local populations, and engagement from the private sector. Congress plays a key role in funding and oversight of agricultural development programs administered by various U.S. agencies and international organizations. The U.S. global food security initiative is supported by various U.S. agencies and international organizations, with Congress exerting influence through the appropriations process. Legislation in the 112th Congress may authorize and fund aspects of the initiative, building on similar efforts in the 111th Congress. Bills introduced include provisions to increase support for agricultural development, international agriculture research, and food security safety net assistance. Legislation to revise the authorizing statute for U.S. foreign assistance could also impact the initiative. The 112th Congress may consider issues related to agricultural development and global food security, as the number of food-insecure people reached historic levels in 2009. The Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative aims to address global hunger. The prospects for increasing U.S. foreign assistance funding are uncertain due to the federal budget deficit. The number of undernourished people reached historic levels in 2009, with over 1 billion people suffering from hunger. The current estimate for chronic hunger in 2010 is 925 million, a decrease from 2009. The global food and economic crises in 2008 and 2009 contributed to the rise in hungry people worldwide. The global food crisis of the early 1970s led to increased investment in agriculture, but official development assistance for agriculture declined between 1995-2006, causing an increase in hungry people in all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in undernourishment, with the proportion of hungry people rising in 2008. The proportion of hungry people rose in 2008, slowing progress in meeting MDGs. Majority of undernourished live in developing countries, with 578 million in Asia, 239 million in sub-Saharan Africa, and smaller numbers in other regions. Global hunger declined by 9.6% in 2010, with Asia showing the most significant reduction. In 2010, hunger decreased in Asia by 80 million people compared to 2009. Sub-Saharan Africa saw a smaller drop of 12 million, but still has the highest food insecurity rates. The Global Health Index (GHI) improved from 1990 to 2010, with significant progress in various regions and countries. The Global Health Index (GHI) improved significantly from 1990 to 2010, with South Asia and the Near East/North Africa regions showing a 25% and 33% decrease in scores respectively. Southeast Asia and Latin America/Caribbean had even greater progress, with GHI scores decreasing by 40% or more. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest regional GHI scores, but South Asia has made more progress since 1990. The causes of hunger differ between the regions, with factors like low nutritional status of women in South Asia and government effectiveness and conflict in sub-Saharan Africa contributing to high levels of hunger. Conflict, political instability, and high rates of HIV and AIDS contribute to high child mortality and food insecurity in countries with high Global Health Index (GHI) scores, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Progress in reducing GHI scores has been slower in these regions compared to Latin America. Only a few countries have managed to reduce their scores by 50% or more over the past few decades, with some countries even experiencing an increase in their GHI scores due to conflict and instability. According to IFPRI, conflict and political instability have increased hunger in countries like The Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia. In Swaziland, high HIV/AIDS prevalence and inequality have undermined food security. The Gambia saw a rise in undernourishment due to lower social protection spending. Zimbabwe's economic collapse has led to more underweight children and child mortality. Some countries like Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam have made significant progress in improving their GHI scores. Between 1990 and 2010, Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam showed significant improvements in their Global Hunger Index scores. Ghana was the only sub-Saharan African country among the top performers in improving their GHI score. President Obama made global hunger a top priority, pledging $3.5 billion over three years for agricultural development and food security at the G8 Summit in Italy. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion to combat hunger and poverty. The G8 summit committed to mobilizing $20 billion over three years to combat hunger and poverty, focusing on sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth. The initiative aims to support comprehensive strategies, country-owned plans, donor coordination, multilateral institutions, and accountable commitments. Social protection mechanisms and emergency assistance like food aid are also emphasized. The G8 leaders pledged sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The initiative supports country-led coordination processes in line with the Accra Agenda for Action, where developing countries commit to taking control of their own futures through strategic plans. In the AAA, developing countries commit to country-led strategies, donors pledge better coordination, and both parties promise accountability. The G8 supports the CAADP program in sub-Saharan Africa to target resources to country priorities, focusing on food security, nutrition, and increasing smallholder farmers' incomes. Established in 2003, CAADP aims to raise agricultural productivity by 6% annually and increase public investment in agriculture to 10%. The L'Aqulia declaration aims to increase agricultural productivity by 6% annually and raise public investment in agriculture to 10% of national budgets. It leverages the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) to address global food security challenges, focusing on immediate needs of vulnerable populations and long-term food and nutrition security. The L'Aquila declaration aims to address global food security challenges by enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade and tax policies, and managing the macroeconomic situation. For longer-term food security, it calls for expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led food availability growth, improving international food market accessibility, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit endorsed the initiative and called for the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund to finance investments in agricultural productivity and market access in low-income countries. At the G20 Summit, countries pledged $2 billion to support the Global Partnership for food security efforts. The United States collaborated with private sector actors for coordination. FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome with 60 heads of state endorsing the Global Partnership to reduce hunger by half by 2015. The FAO reported at a food summit that agricultural output needs to increase by 70% to feed a population of over 9 billion by 2050. The U.S. State Department launched the \"Feed the Future\" Initiative in 2010 to address global hunger and food security. The State Department released a new guiding strategy document and implementation documents for the Feed the Future initiative, focusing on sustainable food security principles and cross-cutting priorities of gender, environment, and climate change. The initiative aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries. It focuses on interventions to improve agricultural productivity, expand markets, develop policies, and enable smallholder farmers to manage risk. Progress will be measured through changes in agricultural production and income levels of farmers. Activities and investments will vary by country based on country-owned plans. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative aims to strengthen agriculture-nutrition links in rural areas through country-specific plans. It will coordinate with governments and partners to implement nutrition strategies, measuring progress by changes in child and women's nutrition indicators. Additionally, FtF will make complementary investments in regional programs, global partnerships, and research. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative focuses on strengthening agriculture-nutrition links in rural areas through country-specific plans. It includes investments in regional programs, global partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation. The initiative does not cover traditional U.S. food aid funding but emphasizes the commitment to providing emergency and humanitarian food assistance. Currently, FtF is targeting 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean based on criteria such as chronic hunger, potential for agricultural-led growth, and regional synergies. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative focuses on addressing chronic hunger and poverty in rural communities through sustainable agricultural-led growth. Investments will be made in two phases, with Phase 1 focusing on capacity-building and technical assistance for developing country investment plans (CIPs), while Phase 2 countries should have completed CIPs outlining priority areas and financial projections. Phase 2 countries under the Feed the Future initiative must have completed a Comprehensive Investment Plan (CIP) with clear priorities, costing, targets, and beneficiary analysis. They also need to commit their own resources and establish a policy environment conducive to agricultural development and improved nutrition. The initiative aims to partner with selected countries to develop and implement CIPs, with a budget request of $1.64 billion for FY2011. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes $1.64 billion for Feed the Future (FtF) activities, representing about 3% of the total international affairs budget. The request for FtF in FY2011 is 40% higher than the estimated allocation in FY2010, with a significant increase for contributions to a nutrition program. The FY2011 request for Feed the Future (FtF) is 40% higher than the estimated allocation in FY2010, with a significant increase for contributions to a newly created multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. Additionally, the Administration is requesting $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance in FY2011, including funds for Food for Peace Title II emergency and non-emergency food aid, Migration and Refugee Assistance, and other activities. The FY2011 request includes $1.690 billion for Food for Peace Title II aid, $1.605 billion for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $861 million for International Disaster Assistance, and $45 million for Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. There were discussions during the 111th Congress about reforming U.S. foreign aid programs to better address national security challenges and development needs. Many criticize U.S. aid programs as inefficient and not aligned with national security interests. The Obama Administration attempted to address issues with foreign aid through the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) led by the State Department. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in 2010 in a strategy document titled \"Leading Through Civilian Power.\" The QDDR, released by Secretary Clinton in 2010, aims to elevate American \"civilian power\" to better advance national interests and be a stronger partner to the military. It includes a statement of foreign policy objectives, recommended strategies, and reforms for implementation. Additionally, the Administration launched PSD-7 in 2009 to review the roles of U.S. government agencies in global development. The PSD-7 review aims to enhance U.S. development policy by prioritizing economic growth and democratic governance. Led by key officials, it emphasizes elevating development as a crucial aspect of U.S. foreign policy. The PSD-7 review aims to enhance U.S. development policy by prioritizing economic growth and democratic governance, creating a new government structure that elevates development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy. The QDDR will contribute to the PSD by assessing how its results fit into broader interagency approaches and the Administration's foreign policy framework. President Obama announced a new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, emphasizing the elevation of development as a core pillar of American power. Obama announced a new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, highlighting Global Food Security as one of the key initiatives. The directive emphasizes the coordination of interagency efforts to implement the directive, including the establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security at USAID to drive food security efforts. The Bureau for Food Security (BFS) will lead efforts to implement President Obama's Feed the Future initiative, coordinating with various agencies and expanding partnerships with the private sector and NGOs. The 112th Congress faces issues on agricultural development, global food security, and U.S. foreign aid reform. Congress is considering appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. Congress is currently considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House and Senate have proposed funding bills with varying amounts, both lower than the Obama Administration's request. The House bill included $1 billion for food security and agricultural development, while the Senate bill included $1.3 billion. The Senate bill for FY2011 appropriations allocated $54.22 billion, $2.61 billion below the Administration's request. Funding for food security and agriculture development programs under the Feed the Future initiative was $1.3 billion, $344 million less than the Administration's request. Congress did not pass any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011, instead relying on continuing resolutions. The current fiscal situation and change in congressional leadership may lead to further debate on funding priorities. The Administration's priorities and funding requests for food security and agricultural development are due in mid-February. There is skepticism about meeting the G8 pledge of $22 billion over three years for the Global Partnership. The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund has received only $263 million out of the pledged $914 million. Concerns have been raised about the lack of strong leadership at USAID, the primary U.S. federal agency for development work. Many experts are concerned about the lack of strong leadership at USAID, the primary U.S. federal agency for global development. The delay in appointing key officials has allowed other federal agencies to take on a larger role in development activities, raising questions about the division of responsibilities and resources. Many experts have criticized the development approach of different federal agencies, questioning its impact on USAID's authority and resources. Concerns have been raised about the decline in staff capacity at USAID, with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighting the imbalance in the national security apparatus. The United States' national security apparatus is unbalanced due to a lack of capacity, stemming from reductions in key instruments of power abroad since the 1990s. The State Department and USAID have seen significant declines in staff numbers, impacting their effectiveness in foreign assistance. Peter McPherson highlighted the significant staff reductions at USAID from 1980 to 2008, with a decrease from 2,000 to about 1,000 permanent foreign officers. In 2008, USAID only had two engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts. These cuts have led to a loss of on-the-ground effectiveness, technical expertise, and a shift towards outsourcing foreign aid programs. This has resulted in less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders, as well as country-level fragmentation in agricultural development assistance. Since the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. government has collaborated with land-grant universities to establish counterpart institutions in developing countries. In 1975, the Title XII amendment was passed to enhance international development efforts. USAID has faced challenges in managing its agricultural development portfolio due to staff shortages, leading to country-level fragmentation. To address this, USAID has hired additional agriculture foreign-service officers since the launch of the Feed the Future initiative in 2010. Since the 1990s, USAID's role in capacity building has declined, with a significant decrease in post-graduate training support. Agricultural research funding has also been reduced, leading to weaker institutional capacity in developing countries. Despite acknowledging the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness, USAID has implemented shorter and more restricted projects. USAID has recognized the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness, focusing on strengthening capacity and avoiding practices that undermine it. However, concerns remain about the lack of institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries, particularly in Africa, to effectively implement agricultural programs. Sub-Saharan Africa is noted to have a weak scientific foundation for modern agriculture, with reluctance from governments and donors to invest in science, technology, and training for long-term development. The need for interagency coordination in agricultural development and food security assistance has been widely discussed. Several U.S. agencies are involved in formulating policy and implementing assistance, including USAID, State Department, USDA, MCC, Treasury Department, and USTR. The lack of institutional capacity in the U.S. and developing countries, particularly in Africa, hinders effective implementation of agricultural programs. Sub-Saharan Africa faces challenges due to a weak scientific foundation for modern agriculture and reluctance from governments and donors to invest in science, technology, and training for long-term development. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President for better coordination in foreign assistance. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination issues between USDA, USAID, and the Millennium Development Corporation in providing food aid and development assistance. The Feed the Future initiative aims to address these challenges. The Feed the Future initiative aims to address coordination problems between USAID and the Millennium Development Corporation in providing food aid and development assistance. It is seen as a challenge and opportunity to enhance U.S. efforts in better interagency coordination, although some view fragmentation and siloing of activities across government agencies as a constraint. USAID is designated as the lead implementation agency for Feed the Future, but details on coordination with other U.S. government entities are still unclear. Funding implications of a whole-of-government approach have not been clearly articulated. Bills in the 111th Congress also highlight the need to address global hunger. In the late 1990s, donors and aid agencies recognized the need to harmonize their strategies to make international aid more effective. The United States collaborates with other donors like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union to coordinate ideas and programs. The Administration has not clearly articulated a whole-of-government approach, and bills in the 111th Congress emphasize the importance of addressing global hunger. It remains uncertain if these issues will be a priority in the 112th Congress. Donors, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union, along with the United States, collaborate in international bodies like the United Nations and the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to coordinate aid efforts. Global summits sponsored by the United Nations have been crucial in establishing development goals and creating new coordination mechanisms, such as country-led strategies for aid and development. Donors have also agreed to increase aid predictability and flexibility to better meet recipient countries' needs and priorities. The United States aligns with other donors to increase aid predictability and flexibility, supporting initiatives like the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) and the global food security initiative. Some argue that aid reform is progressing too slowly, while others believe the U.S. should maintain independence in its approach to international donor meetings. Some argue that the United States needs to do more to meet international donor objectives, while others prioritize foreign assistance aligned with U.S. interests. The Feed the Future Guide emphasizes country-led planning for program sustainability, but concerns exist over donor control and developing countries' capacity for strategic planning and accountability. Some argue that the United States needs to do more to meet international donor objectives, while others prioritize foreign assistance aligned with U.S. interests. Concerns exist over developing countries' capacity for strategic planning and accountability in the civil society sector. The country-led planning process may potentially exclude focus country civil society and nongovernmental organizations (CSOs and NGOs) or private sector actors. Little mention is made of coordinating U.S. food aid with the provision of food aid in focus countries, despite Food for Peace Title II food aid being a significant component of U.S. food security assistance. Key questions include how U.S. commodity food aid will be provided in the 20 Feed the Future focus countries. The United States is implementing U.S. food aid programs in 20 Feed the Future focus countries. Key questions include how food aid will be coordinated with Feed the Future activities, potential adverse effects, and integration of cross-cutting initiatives like gender and climate change into country plans. Integration of these issues, resource requirements, progress metrics, and coordination with other USG initiatives are unclear from the strategy to date. The Administration is working on defining key indicators and metrics for the Feed the Future initiative, but it is unclear which agency will be responsible for monitoring progress. Questions remain about the timeline for results, achieving MDG1 in the 20 focus countries, and how often Congress will receive updates."
