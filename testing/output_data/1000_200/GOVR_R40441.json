    "content": "The Navy conducted training exercises using mid-frequency active sonar off the coast of southern California, which environmentalists claimed harmed whales. The Navy issued an environmental assessment concluding minimal harm to marine mammals. Environmental groups sought relief, alleging violations of environmental laws. The district court initially granted an injunction, later modified to allow the Navy to use sonar. The Ninth Circuit initially granted a preliminary injunction barring Navy exercises using sonar off the coast of southern California. The district court later modified the injunction to allow sonar use with mitigation measures. The Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs must show \"likely\" irreparable injury for an injunction, not just a \"possibility.\" The Ninth Circuit's test for a preliminary injunction is too lenient, requiring plaintiffs to show likely irreparable injury. The Court found that the Navy's interest in realistic training outweighed potential harm to marine mammals, leading to the denial of injunctive relief. The decision was reversed, and the preliminary injunction was vacated. The Court did not address whether the Navy's exercises violated NEPA. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit, focusing on the national security interest in the challenged training exercises. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's lenient test for injunctions, emphasizing the Navy's need for realistic training over potential harm to marine mammals. The Ninth Circuit's \"mere possibility\" test for injunctions was reversed by the Supreme Court, emphasizing national security interests in training exercises over potential harm to marine mammals. Forest Service regulations under the ARA precluded notice, comment, and appeals for projects implementing forest plans covered by categorical exclusions under NEPA. In 2003, the Forest Service approved a timber sale of 238 acres of post-fire forest, stating it was not subject to appeal due to regulations. The Ninth Circuit found plaintiffs had standing due to procedural rights deprivation and reduced recreational enjoyment of national forests. The district court invalidated regulations and issued a nationwide injunction against their application. The court found the claims against the appeal prohibition ripe as they were applied to block plaintiff Earth Island Institute's administrative appeal. The Ninth Circuit ruled that certain regulations conflicted with the ARA and affirmed the district court's decision. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address questions regarding the Forest Service's regulations and respondent environmental groups' standing. The Supreme Court is considering whether the subject of judicial review in a case involving environmental groups is proper, if the groups have standing, if their challenge remains ripe after a settlement, and if the Ninth Circuit erred in affirming a nationwide injunction. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for program-wide reform, and the outcome of this case could have significant implications. The Supreme Court is considering a case involving environmental groups challenging the nationwide injunction. The outcome could impact the use of site-specific challenges for program-wide reform. Power plants and industrial operations harm billions of aquatic organisms annually by withdrawing water from waterways for cooling. The Clean Water Act (CWA) section 316(b) addresses the harm caused to aquatic organisms by cooling water intake structures at power plants. In 2004, the EPA issued a rule governing these structures, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology available. However, in Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States, the Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis, stating that facilities must adopt the best technology available without considering cost. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 14, 2008 to determine whether CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to compare costs with benefits in selecting the best technology for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. The Supreme Court is considering whether EPA can use cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology for reducing environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. There has been a shift towards greater acceptance of cost-benefit analysis, and this case will test if conservative justices will continue this trend. Industry may benefit from a decision that legitimizes cost-benefit analysis under the Clean Water Act. Industry may welcome a decision to legitimize cost-benefit analysis under the Clean Water Act, as seen in the case involving Coeur Alaska's proposal to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. Justice Breyer's past criticism of government regulation for not considering costs enough has also been highlighted in this context. The company proposes to dispose of wastewater from a mine in a national forest by piping it to a nearby lake, which would kill aquatic life. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit under the Clean Water Act, but conflicting regulations applied to the discharge. The court ruled that Coeur Alaska's proposed discharge from a gold mine, which would change the bottom elevation of waters, must comply with EPA's new performance standard under the Clean Water Act. This standard prohibits discharges from Coeur's type of ore processing into US waters and must be included in the NPDES permit. The court found that Section 404 does not exempt the discharge from meeting the performance standards. The court ruled that Section 404 does not exempt Coeur Alaska's proposed discharge from meeting EPA's performance standards under the Clean Water Act. The Corps should not have issued a 404 permit, and the district court's ruling must be reversed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating permitting authority from the Corps to EPA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating permitting authority from the Corps of Engineers to EPA under CWA section 402. The consequences of a reversal could be significant if the Court gives the Corps wide latitude to remove discharges from EPA's NPDES program by redefining \"fill material.\" EPA and the State of California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA for toxic contamination at an agricultural chemical storage facility. The liability for government cleanup costs at a contaminated site is assigned to owners, operators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances. In a specific case, the district court found railroads and Shell Oil Co. liable for a percentage of total cleanup costs. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit found railroads and Shell liable for a percentage of total cleanup costs. The court addressed questions regarding the apportionment of cleanup costs and the lack of reasonable basis for apportionment provided by the railroads and Shell. The Ninth Circuit found railroads and Shell liable for cleanup costs under CERCLA, including arranger liability for Shell due to a transaction involving disposal. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the apportionment of responsibility under CERCLA. In Northern's petition for certiorari, the Ninth Circuit's decision on apportionment of responsibility under CERCLA is challenged for departing from common law principles. Shell Oil's petition questions liability for \"arranging\" disposal of hazardous substances and joint and several liability under CERCLA. The case was argued on February 24, 2009, raising fundamental issues under the Superfund Act. The case argued on February 24, 2009, raises fundamental Superfund Act issues, challenging liability apportionment and joint and several liability under CERCLA. This case is considered significant, as it questions the government's favorable precedent and the expansive liability scheme of the Superfund statute. Burlington Northern's challenge to liability apportionment and joint and several liability under CERCLA could impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. A lax standard for reasonable basis or a tighter standard for \"arranger\" liability may result in the federal treasury having to cover more cleanup costs. Industry is concerned about manufacturer liability in selling products. The Supreme Court cases accepted, including the Navy sonar case, are important for their individual programs and may reveal the environmental direction of the Roberts Court. Industry is optimistic while the environmental community is apprehensive, as the environmental side won in the lower court decisions for all five cases. The environmental side won in the lower court decisions for all five cases, raising apprehension about potential Supreme Court reversals. The Supreme Court has historically voted against environmental positions in NEPA cases, and the current Court is perceived as less tolerant of regulation and more sympathetic to business concerns. The current Supreme Court, with a few exceptions, has been less tolerant of regulation and more sympathetic to business concerns than in the 1970s and 1980s. The increase in environmental cases this term may be due to random selection or conservative justices wanting to address issues before potential changes in the Court. Eminent Supreme Court practitioners are also showing more interest in environmental cases, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. The Supreme Court has shown a greater interest in environmental cases, with eminent practitioners increasing the likelihood of acceptance. The Court continues to reject difficult cases, including those related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The reasons for nonacceptance are speculative, but the majority of petitions for certiorari are turned down. The Supreme Court's rejection of difficult environmental cases, such as those related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, is likely due to the same justices on the Court since the 2006 Rapanos decision. This decision did not provide a clear majority rationale, leading to confusion in lower courts. Accepting a post-Rapanos case now would likely result in a similar lack of consensus among the justices."
