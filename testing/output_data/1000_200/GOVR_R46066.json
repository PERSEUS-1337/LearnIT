Some analysts question the effectiveness and sustainability of NATO deterrence efforts. Some NATO allies believe that the alliance is not adequately prepared to defend its most vulnerable members. There are differing opinions on how to approach Russia, with some advocating for increased military presence in the region while others emphasize the importance of dialogue alongside deterrence. Concerns about violating the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act have led to a reluctance to permanently deploy troops in certain countries. NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) is considered \"continuous\" but rotational to avoid violating the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act.

European allies and Canada have increased defense spending for five consecutive years, with a total of $130 billion added since 2014. By 2024, this figure is expected to reach $400 billion. While some NATO members, including Germany, are criticized for not meeting the 2% GDP guideline, they argue that contributions to ongoing NATO missions and military capabilities should also be considered. Many NATO allies, including Germany, argue that contributions to ongoing missions and military capabilities are as important as total defense spending levels. Analysts emphasize the importance of focusing on defense outputs, such as military capabilities and effectiveness in NATO missions. The alliance aims for each member to allocate at least 20% of their defense expenditure to new equipment and research. In London, allied leaders approved a U.S. proposal to reduce assessed U.S. contributions and increase German contributions to NATO's common funds, which pay for the day-to-day operations of NATO headquarters and some collective military activities.

The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress urge NATO to assess security implications of Chinese investment in Europe. U.S. officials are increasingly concerned about China's strategic foothold in Europe through unfair trade practices, investments in key industries, sensitive technologies, and infrastructure. Of particular concern is Chinese investment in critical infrastructure and 5G networks, leading to discussions within NATO about updating requirements for civilian telecommunications to address emerging 5G technology risks and cyber threats. The allies are assessing risks related to 5G technology, including cyber threats and foreign ownership. The EU is working on guidelines for 5G networks, but individual governments will make contracting decisions.

Italy withdrew its air defense system from Turkey in December 2019, while Spain continues to deploy a Patriot missile battery along Turkey's border. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg expressed concerns about Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 air defense system, suggesting that Turkey could be excluded from NATO's defense systems if it deploys the S-400. Some NATO leaders argue for excluding Turkey from defense systems if it deploys the S-400.
