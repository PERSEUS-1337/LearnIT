    "content": "Regulation is a fundamental government function, with federal agencies issuing thousands of rules annually on various topics. The costs of complying with these regulations are not included in the federal budget process, prompting some policymakers to consider measuring total regulatory costs and benefits. Legislation such as the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Creation and Sunset and Review Act of 2011 aims to assess the overall impact of federal regulations. Federal regulations have been a topic of discussion for over a decade, with challenges in measuring the total costs and benefits. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to report on this annually, but accuracy is questioned due to various factors. A report by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in 2010 highlighted the impact of regulatory costs on small firms. The report \"The Impact of Regulatory Costs on Small Firms\" by Nicole V. Crain and W. Mark Crain revealed that federal regulations cost about $1.75 trillion in 2008. Previous reports estimated costs between $416 billion and $1.1 trillion in different years. The $1.75 trillion figure has been widely cited as evidence for regulatory reform. The report by Nicole V. Crain and W. Mark Crain estimated federal regulatory costs at $1.75 trillion in 2008, leading to calls for regulatory reform. The estimate includes costs for economic, environmental, tax compliance, and safety regulations. The estimated cost of economic regulations in 2008 was more than 70% of the total regulatory costs, according to the Crain and Crain report. Economic regulations impact businesses by affecting what products and services they produce, how they operate, and how they are priced and marketed. These regulations include quotas and tariffs on foreign imports that limit competition, restrict production and employment, raise prices, and curtail U.S. economic activities. In 2008, the estimated cost of economic regulations was over 70% of total regulatory costs. Crain and Crain used a regulatory quality index to measure government policies' impact on private sector development. The index score for the US was +1.579. They conducted regression analysis to assess the effect of changes in the index on real GDP per capita. Crain used regression analysis to determine the impact of changes in the regulatory quality index on real GDP per capita. They found that a one-unit change in the index represented a 9.4% change in GDP. The difference between the US index score and the maximum value of +2.5 indicated an 8.7% reduction in GDP due to economic regulations in 2008. According to Crain and Crain, economic regulations caused an 8.7% reduction in GDP in the United States in 2008, amounting to about $1.236 trillion. The WGI index of regulatory quality for the US in 2008 was determined by aggregating expert-based measures and surveys scored on a 0 to 1 scale. Global Insight Business Conditions and Risk Indicators (scored at 0.94) and Global Insight Global Risk Service (scored at 0.95) are commercial business information providers based in London, England, and Boston, Massachusetts, respectively. They assess factors such as tax effectiveness, legislation, protectionism, access to capital markets, labor regulations, and ease of starting a business to determine business conditions and risk indicators. The Global Risk Service, Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom, and Institutional Profiles Database provide scores based on factors like export/import regulations, business ownership restrictions, foreign investment, and banking/finance. The Institutional Profiles Database and Political Risk Services International Country Risk Guide provide scores based on factors like ease of starting a business, competition, and investment profile. The regulatory quality index is developed using surveys from the Institute for Management and Development World Competitiveness Yearbook (scored at 0.50) and the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report (scored at 0.62). The surveys consider factors like access to capital markets, labor regulations, and ease of starting a business. The World Economic Forum, based in Switzerland, surveyed domestic and foreign-owned firms on various statements related to business competitiveness. Some critics question the accuracy of WGI indices, but the authors have addressed these concerns. The World Bank Development Research Group published a detailed description of how the WGI indices were developed, noting their correlation with an index of economic regulations by the OECD. Crain and Crain used the WGI regulatory quality index in their study for its broader coverage and variety of sources. The WGI authors caution that these indices are useful for broad comparisons but may not be precise enough for specific governance reforms in individual countries. The validity of Crain and Crain's estimate of the cost of economic regulations depends on the interpretation of the WGI index of \"regulatory quality\" and whether it can accurately measure the cost of regulations. Aart Kraay from the World Bank emphasized the need for more detailed and country-specific data to inform governance reforms. Aart Kraay, a lead economist at the World Bank, criticized Crain and Crain's use of the WGI regulatory quality index in their report on regulatory costs. Kraay highlighted that the index measures perceptions of the regulatory environment's quality, not just stringency. He noted that the United States ranked highly in the index. Aart Kraay criticized Crain and Crain's use of the WGI regulatory quality index, noting that it measures perceptions of the regulatory environment's quality, not just stringency. He highlighted that the United States ranked highly in the index, with countries like Finland and Sweden ahead. Kraay also pointed out potential misinterpretations of the WGI units by comparing scores to a \"minimal amount of regulation.\" In an email, Aart Kraay criticized the use of the WGI regulatory quality index by Crain and Crain, suggesting a comparison between the US and Denmark rather than a fixed score of 2.5. Kraay emphasized that the index measures perceptions of regulatory quality, not just stringency. The WGI regulatory quality index comparison between the US and Denmark is more relevant than a fixed score of 2.5. Kraay noted minor revisions to the WGI data, with Ireland having the highest regulatory index in 2008. Subtracting the US index from Ireland's yields a difference of 0.336. The difference between the regulatory quality indices of Ireland and the United States is 0.336. This suggests a 3.16% reduction in GDP in the US compared to Ireland. The monetary cost of this GDP reduction would be about $448 billion. However, higher values on the regulatory quality index may not necessarily reflect less stringent regulations, as indicated by Kraay. Kraay expressed concerns about the correlation between regulatory quality and GDP per capita, stating that high scores on regulatory quality are linked to other beneficial policies and institutions. This makes it difficult to determine the true impact of regulations on economic output. Kraay highlighted the challenge of isolating the effects of regulation from other correlated factors in econometric estimates provided by Crain and Crain. Crain and Crain defended their regulatory quality index, stating that empirical evidence supports its reflection of regulation stringency. They emphasized the index's capture of various stakeholders' perceptions and the questions used to construct it. They also clarified that they did not compare the US to other countries due to the need to estimate the total cost of regulations for small and large businesses. The SBA Office of Advocacy had the Crain and Crain report peer reviewed by economists Bob Litan and Richard Williams. Litan found the study \"terrific\" with no additions, while Williams provided more extensive comments, calling it a \"great project\" and offering suggestions to strengthen it. Williams provided extensive comments on the study, calling it a \"great project\" and offering suggestions to strengthen it. He expressed concerns about the accuracy of the index of regulatory quality in estimating the costs of economic regulations, suggesting that it may overstate the costs by capturing effects of other regulations. He also mentioned that the study might overestimate total costs due to potential overlaps in the effects of different regulations. Williams suggested that some problems could be solved with a better approach. Williams expressed concerns that the index of regulatory quality may underestimate costs and suggested improvements to better explain what it measures. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized a study on economic regulatory costs, stating that the regulatory quality index was not intended to measure regulatory burden. The WGI authors did not intend the regulatory quality index to be a proxy measure for regulatory burden or critique a country's regulatory stringency. The lack of a clear definition of \"economic regulations\" could lead to double counting. The regression analysis assumes a simplistic relationship between regulatory \"stringency\" and GDP. The report falsely suggests the US has low regulatory quality despite ranking 11th globally. The Crain and Crain report analyzed data for 25 OECD countries to assess the impact of economic regulation on GDP per capita. Economists believe a country's standard of living is influenced by factors like natural resources, labor, technology, and trade opportunities. Government interventions can also impact the standard of living. Crain and Crain used regression analysis to study the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index, considering variables like population, trade, education, and broadband subscribers. The Crain and Crain report analyzed the relationship between GDP per capita and regulatory quality index using regression analysis. They considered variables like population, foreign trade, primary education, and fixed broadband subscribers per 100 people. The control variables may not capture all factors affecting GDP per capita, and the estimation strategy used was non-standard. The Crain and Crain report analyzed cross-country panel data sets using linear regressions with country-specific and year-specific control variables. They omitted statistically insignificant year-specific control variables from their reported results, using a two-stage estimation strategy that has not been explored in peer-reviewed journals. CRS requested the data used in the study but it was not provided. The authors did not provide the data used in their study. CRS conducted a sensitivity analysis using similar data and methods, finding that the regulatory quality index had no independent effect on GDP per capita. The analysis is sensitive to control variables and measures. Most economists believe economic regulation can impact a country's standard of living, but this may not be captured in a seven-year cross-country panel. Regulatory environments evolve slowly and interact with other public policy instruments. The authors developed cost estimates for environmental regulations following OMB's approach. They used OMB's estimates from reports to Congress for regulations issued up to 2001 and converted them into 2001 dollars. For regulations issued from April 1999 to September 2001, they used OMB's 2002 report estimates. Regulatory quality may interact with social and political conditions and other public policy instruments. Crain and Crain estimated that environmental regulations cost between $175 billion and $280 billion in 2009 by using OMB reports from 1999 to 2001. They chose to use the upper-end estimate of $280 billion, believing that agencies tend to underestimate regulatory costs. Their data included a mix of academic estimates. Agencies are conservative in estimating regulatory costs. Crain and Crain used a mix of academic and agency estimates to calculate the costs of environmental rules. The methodologies and units of analysis varied between academic studies prior to 1988 and agency estimates after 1988. OMB criticized the approach of summarizing total costs and benefits of regulations by combining individual studies due to varying quality. OMB criticized the approach of summarizing total costs and benefits of regulations by combining individual studies due to varying quality, methodology, and potential for double counting. The time periods covered by cost estimates overlap, leading to inaccuracies in environmental regulatory cost information recorded by Crain and Crain. The authors inaccurately recorded OMB's environmental regulatory cost estimates for certain periods. They also failed to report OMB's estimates of regulatory benefits. The authors inaccurately recorded OMB's environmental regulatory cost estimates for certain periods and failed to report regulatory benefits. Overall, estimated benefits were higher than costs in most time periods, with some exceptions. Crain and Crain assumed OMB's coverage of environmental regulations was complete, with a note from peer reviewer Richard Williams regarding the cost estimate as an assumption. Williams noted that the estimate of environmental regulatory costs should be considered an assumption. Crain and Crain used OMB's upper estimate of costs, citing a belief that government agencies tend to be conservative in their estimates. They also referenced studies showing agencies overestimate benefits and underestimate costs, with ongoing debate on the topic. The Center for Progressive Reform analyzed their report, highlighting discrepancies in agencies' estimates. The Center for Progressive Reform criticized agencies for overestimating environmental costs, influenced by industry estimates. They argued that technological advancements reducing compliance costs were not considered. CPR cited studies showing agencies' initial cost estimates were too high and questioned the use of outdated studies by Crain and Crain. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) acknowledged concerns that agency estimates may understate costs and overstate benefits due to regulatory self-interest. OMB highlighted the lack of documentation supporting this theory, noting that regulated entities may overstate costs to influence decision makers against regulations. Estimates of costs from regulated entities may be overstated to discourage regulations, while competitive firms often find cost-effective ways to comply with regulations. Agencies tend to overestimate benefits of programs due to technological progress. Crain and Crain used data from the IRS to estimate costs of complying with federal tax paperwork. Crain and Crain estimated that businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent about 4.3 billion burden hours on tax paperwork in 2008, costing approximately $159.6 billion. They used data from the IRS and the Tax Foundation to calculate the time and cost associated with completing each type of tax form. In 2008, businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent an estimated 4.3 billion hours on tax paperwork, costing around $159.6 billion. The IRS represented about 77.8% of the government-wide estimate, with paperwork burden hours totaling about 7.5 billion. In 2008, businesses, individuals, and nonprofits spent an estimated 4.3 billion hours on tax paperwork, costing around $159.6 billion. The IRS represented about 77.8% of the government-wide estimate, with paperwork burden hours totaling about 7.5 billion. The Crain and Crain report estimated IRS paperwork burden hours to be 3.2 billion hours lower than the potential 7.5 billion burden hours in 2008. The methodology used by Crain and Crain to monetize IRS burden hours is questioned, particularly regarding assumptions about who completes business tax paperwork and the hourly rates used for calculations. In May 2009, tax preparers earned an average salary of $17.34 per hour. Considering total compensation, the average would be around $23 per hour. Multiplying 7.5 billion burden hours by $23 per hour results in a total cost of about $172.5 billion. OMB does not include tax paperwork in its annual reports on regulatory costs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does not include tax paperwork in its annual reports on regulatory costs. OMB stated that filling out tax forms is a result of the tax code itself, with regulations providing interpretations and clarifications. The IRS paperwork burden is driven by the complexities of the Tax Code, which requires collecting a significant amount of information for taxpayer compliance. Congress passed 84 tax laws in the 15 years following the 1986 overhaul of the Code. The Tax Code is complex and continuously revised, with 84 tax laws passed by Congress in the 15 years after the 1986 overhaul. IRS had to make changes to reporting requirements, increasing taxpayer burden by 47 million hours. Factors like economic and population growth also contribute to the overall IRS burden hours. The authors estimated the cost of occupational safety and health regulations, including workplace regulations from OSHA and homeland security, totaling over $64.3 billion in 2009 dollars. Additional costs from 2001 to 2008 were estimated at $471 million. The authors estimated the total cost for occupational safety and health and homeland security regulations in 2008 to be about $75.2 billion. They obtained the estimate for occupational safety and health regulatory costs between 2001 and 2008 from OMB's 2009 report to Congress. The authors estimated the total cost for occupational safety and health and homeland security regulations in 2008 to be about $75.2 billion. The costs associated with four rules were estimated at between $362 million and $389 million in 2001 dollars, with a possible overlap in estimates. The estimated cost range for homeland security regulations was between $4.2 billion to $8.6 billion annually. The Department of Homeland Security created 17 major regulations with an annual cost of $4.2 billion to $8.6 billion. Converting to 2009 dollars, the cost range is $5.1 billion to $10.4 billion. The authors used OMB's upper-end cost estimates, stating agencies tend to be conservative in estimating regulatory costs. The Center for Progressive Reform's analysis of cost estimates for occupational safety and health regulations suggests that the estimates may overstate true compliance costs. They criticized the Johnson study for inflating OSHA's original cost estimates and including fines for violations as regulatory costs, which they argued could be used to push for reducing regulations. In 2005, W. Mark Crain estimated federal regulatory costs in 2004 at $1.11 trillion. By 2010, the costs had increased to $1.75 trillion, with a significant portion attributed to a change in methodology for estimating economic regulations. If not for this change, costs for other regulations would have decreased by $6 billion between 2004 and 2008. Congress has mandated annual reports on the costs and benefits of regulations for almost 15 years. Between 2004 and 2008, federal regulatory costs would have decreased by about $6 billion if not for a change in methodology for estimating economic regulations. Congress has required annual reports on the costs and benefits of federal regulations for nearly 15 years, with various appropriations acts mandating these reports. In 2001, the \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act\" established a permanent requirement for an OMB report on regulatory costs and benefits. The Appropriations Act, 2001, known as the \"Regulatory Right-to-Know Act,\" requires OMB to prepare an accounting statement with estimates of total costs and benefits of federal rules. OMB's estimates varied significantly, particularly in benefits, in the first few years. In its reports from 1997 to 2001, OMB estimated federal regulatory costs and benefits, with significant variations in the benefits estimates. The 1998 report showed a dramatic increase in benefits due to including an EPA estimate related to the Clean Air Act, which raised questions about its accuracy. In its 2000 and 2001 reports, OMB estimated the cost of social regulations at $146 billion to $229 billion, with benefits ranging from $254 billion to nearly $1.8 trillion. The upper-bound benefits estimate dropped by nearly 50%, mainly due to a significant decrease in the EPA's Clean Air Act benefits estimate. OMB consistently presented cost and benefit estimates with strong caveats, acknowledging the difficulty in accurately estimating total costs and benefits of federal regulations. Federal regulations pose challenges in accurately measuring total costs and benefits. OMB highlighted methodological issues such as unclear baselines, regulations becoming standard practice, difficulty in attributing costs/benefits to federal regulations, and the impact of technological changes on previous estimates. Technological change can greatly impact the accuracy of estimating benefits and costs of federal regulations. Aggregating results from different studies is challenging due to variations in quality and methodology. OMB excluded \"transfer\" rules and costs associated with tax paperwork in its estimates of total regulatory costs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) excluded costs related to tax paperwork in its estimates of total regulatory costs. OMB's reports since 2001 have focused on regulations with costs or benefits of at least $100 million annually. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided estimates of costs and benefits for regulations reviewed from 1995 to 2002. Total costs ranged from $37 billion to $53 billion, with benefits ranging from $48 billion to $230 billion. EPA rules accounted for a significant portion of the benefits. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided estimates of costs and benefits for regulations reviewed from 1995 to 2002, with total costs ranging from $37 billion to $53 billion and benefits from $48 billion to $230 billion. OMB noted that EPA rules accounted for a substantial fraction of the aggregate benefits for all 107 rules. Each report since 2003 has focused on rules meeting specific criteria in the previous 10 years, excluding older estimates deemed unreliable for current policy decisions. The report decided not to reproduce the aggregate estimates from the draft report, stating that total costs and benefits of federal rules could be significantly larger. OMB emphasized that estimates for rules adopted prior to the 10-year period are of questionable relevance now. John D. Graham highlighted the limitations of estimating aggregate costs of regulations, citing the Crain and Hopkins estimate of $843 billion as a rough indicator of regulatory activity. The Crain and Hopkins estimate, produced in 2001 for the Small Business Administration, is a rough indicator of regulatory impact on the economy. Based on earlier estimates from the 1970s to 1995, it may no longer be accurate due to changes over the years. The estimate combines various types of regulations, including financial ones. The cost estimates for regulations may not be accurate for official accounting statements, as they combine diverse types of regulations with varying impacts. Information on costs and benefits is lacking, and many studies used for these estimates lack transparency for reproducibility. As a result, recent Reports to Congress focus on costs and benefits of major regulations reviewed by OMB over the last decade. The costs and benefits of major regulations reviewed by OMB over the last ten years were estimated in a 2009 report to Congress. The report provided estimates for 98 regulations that generated benefits or costs of approximately $100 million in any one year. OMB estimated costs and benefits of 98 major regulations over a 10-year period. Costs ranged from $51 billion to $60 billion, while benefits were estimated between $126 billion and $663 billion. OMB noted that these estimates were not a complete account of all regulations issued during that time. OMB highlighted that aggregating benefit and cost estimates of regulations provides valuable insights, but the resulting estimates are not precise or complete due to varying rigor and assumptions in regulatory impact analyses. Comparing OMB's estimates with other studies like Crain and Crain's is challenging due to different construction methods and presentation categories. Crain and Crain's estimates of annual regulatory costs in 2008 were significantly higher than OMB's estimates due to different inclusion criteria. Crain and Crain included costs of all rules, including economic regulations and tax paperwork, while OMB only included major rules meeting specific criteria issued over a 10-year period. Decision makers should be cautious when using aggregate regulatory cost studies to inform public policy. Decision makers using studies of aggregate regulatory costs and benefits to guide public policy should be aware of the conceptual and methodological underpinnings. The validity of Crain and Crain's $1.75 trillion estimate of total federal regulatory costs in 2008 relies heavily on the WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States, which may have been misinterpreted by the authors. Higher values on the index do not necessarily indicate less stringent regulations, and comparisons to other countries should be made cautiously. The validity of Crain and Crain's estimate of total federal regulatory costs in 2008 relies on the WGI index of regulatory quality for the United States. Higher values on the index do not necessarily mean less stringent regulations, and comparisons to other countries should be made cautiously. Concerns were raised about the use of the regulatory quality index to measure the cost of economic regulations and the regression analysis used to produce the cost estimate. Crain and Crain defended their belief that the index indicates the stringency of a country's economic regulations. Crain and Crain defended their use of the regulatory quality index to estimate federal regulatory costs in 2008, despite criticisms that the index may not be suitable for comparing regulations between countries. The World Bank cautions that such measures can be too simplistic for specific governance reforms. Crain and Crain's estimates for various regulations were based on a mix of outdated academic studies and agency cost estimates. OMB has criticized the approach of adding together diverse sets of individual studies to estimate regulatory costs, particularly citing the use of outdated estimates by Crain and Crain. The agency believes that using only the highest cost estimates from OMB reports is flawed, as it does not cover all regulations and assumes government agencies are conservative in their cost estimates. Empirical studies have not resolved this issue, and OMB has little documentation to support this view. Since 2003, OMB's annual reports to Congress on regulatory costs only include information on major rules issued in the past 10 years. Older estimates are deemed unreliable for policy decisions as incremental costs of regulations tend to decrease over time. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has increased automobile safety, but even if regulations were eliminated, companies are unlikely to stop implementing safety features due to consumer demand and product liability concerns. Environmentally responsible behavior has also become financially beneficial over time, reducing the true costs and benefits of regulations. OMB stated that regulations over ten years old may only save half of compliance costs if magically disappeared overnight. Crain and Crain's estimate for tax paperwork costs may be higher than actual data suggests. The cost of completing paperwork may be too high, especially if human resources professionals are paid at nearly $50 per hour. The authors of a report did not consider the benefits of federal regulations, even though information on regulatory benefits was available. They stated that addressing the benefits of regulation is crucial for achieving a rational regulatory system. Crain and Crain did not include regulatory benefits in their study as required by the Office of Advocacy. Executive Order 12866 mandates agencies to assess both costs and benefits of regulations to justify their implementation and maximize net benefits. The benefits of regulations should justify their costs, with agencies aiming to maximize net benefits. OMB reports to Congress show that estimated benefits often exceed costs, as seen in examples from 2010 and 2011. In 2011, major rules reviewed by OMB from 2000-2010 had costs between $44-62 billion and benefits between $136-651 billion. In FY2010, costs for 18 major rules were $6.5-12.5 billion, with benefits at $23.3-82.3 billion. Some rules only quantified costs or benefits. Crain and Crain estimated federal regulations cost $1.75 trillion in 2008. Crain and Crain's estimate that federal regulations cost $1.75 trillion in 2008 has been cited as evidence of the need for regulatory reform legislation. However, they clarified that their report was not intended as a decision-making tool for lawmakers or regulatory agencies. Information on regulatory costs alone provides only one piece of information for policymakers to consider when determining how to proceed. In assessing the sensitivity of Crain and Crain's results, CRS conducted a linear regression using different data and methods for 30 OECD countries. This analysis aims to provide policymakers with information on both costs and benefits to make valid, reasoned policy decisions. CRS ran a linear regression using data from 30 OECD countries over 2002-2008, with GDP per capita as the dependent variable and four key independent variables. They found unexpected results regarding primary school enrollment's impact on GDP per capita. The negative coefficient on primary school enrollment in the regression analysis by CRS may be due to \"aging pyramid\" demographic effects. CRS added demographic variables to account for this, obtained from U.S. Census Bureau data. The variables capture aging effects more directly than primary education. The analysis used a cross-country fixed effects panel estimator with year indicator variables and natural logarithms of variables, except the regulatory quality index, were used in the regression. Estimation results were obtained using Stata 11 xtreg procedure with robust (White) standard errors. The regression analysis used Stata 11 xtreg procedure with robust standard errors. The coefficient on the World Governance Indicators regulatory quality index is small and not significantly different from zero. Other coefficients are statistically significant. The economic effect of shifting the US regulatory quality index to Ireland's level was calculated using the coefficient estimate. The shift of the United States from the 2008 regulatory quality index value to Ireland's 2008 level would result in a $2.14 increase in per capita GDP. The imprecise point estimate of the regulatory quality index makes the calculated effect uncertain. Intercountry correlation suggests that estimating the effects of variables like the regulatory environment in economically advanced countries using panel estimation may be challenging. Estimating the effects of slow-changing variables like the regulatory environment in economically advanced countries using panel estimation methods with highly aggregated data may be challenging. Other econometric approaches focusing on specific changes in the regulatory environment could offer a better understanding of the impact of regulation on economic activity."
