    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia Recognition Act\". The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia are descendants and political successors to the original Creek Indian Nation at the time of European contact and signatories of the 1832 Treaty of Washington. The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia, with over 2,500 eligible members, chose not to be removed from their ancestral homeland as per the 1832 Treaty of Washington. They continue to operate as a sovereign tribe with a viable tribal government. In 1972, the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia petitioned for Federal recognition but lacked legal expertise and technical assistance, hindering their petition. The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia's petition for Federal recognition was denied in 1981 due to technical omissions. Despite this, various government entities have acknowledged the tribe's political leaders as part of a distinct governmental entity. The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia is defined in the Act as a tribe eligible for Federal recognition. The Act also defines \"member\" as an enrolled member of the Tribe or an individual placed on the membership rolls. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. Federal recognition is extended to the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia, making them eligible for all Federal benefits and services available to federally recognized Indian tribes and their members. This includes laws and regulations applicable to Indians without the need for a reservation. The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia is federally recognized, allowing them access to Federal benefits and services. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 applies to the Tribe and its members. The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia can transfer land to the Secretary for trust within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The land taken into trust will become the Tribe's initial reservation, with a prohibition on gaming activities as per the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Additionally, a base membership roll will be established. The Tribe must submit a membership roll to the Secretary within 120 days of the Act's enactment, based on the Tribe's Constitution. The Secretary will publish the roll in the Federal Register, and the Tribe is responsible for keeping it current. The Tribe has the right to determine future membership. Future membership in the Tribe requires being a lineal descendant on the base membership roll and maintaining political relations with the Tribe. The reservation established by this Act will be considered Indian country under Federal and tribal jurisdiction. This Act will not affect any treaties or rights secured to tribes mentioned in the Act."
