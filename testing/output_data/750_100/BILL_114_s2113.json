    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2015\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of crowdsourcing and citizen science. The Congress recognizes the benefits of using incentive prizes and challenges under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010, including paying only for success, setting ambitious goals, involving a broader group of people, and bringing diverse perspectives to problem-solving. The Congress acknowledges the advantages of using incentive prizes and challenges to solve problems, involving diverse perspectives, and maximizing cost-effectiveness. Granting Federal agencies the authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity, encourage their appropriate use, and increase public participation in the innovation process. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits such as improving government services with lower resource investments, connecting citizens to federal agency missions, and acquiring data on a larger geographic scale. Citizen science enables citizens to gather, analyze, and share data to address community and research-based concerns. It accelerates scientific research through group discovery and diverse perspectives, improving science literacy and skills. Citizen science accelerates scientific research by improving science literacy, fostering worldwide collaboration, and building trust between citizens and scientists. Participants engage in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects to enhance American competitiveness and promote science diplomacy. Federal agencies should consider meaningful incentives to engage and retain participants in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects, based on various motivations such as receiving attribution, learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving meaningful problems. Engaging in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects involves solving meaningful problems and contributing to scientific endeavors for societal benefit. SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE. Citizen science is a form of open collaboration where individuals or organizations participate in various aspects of the scientific process, including formulating research questions, designing projects, conducting experiments, collecting and analyzing data, interpreting results, developing technologies, making discoveries, and solving problems. Crowdsourcing is a method to obtain services, ideas, or content by soliciting voluntary contributions from a group, especially online. The Director refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Federal agency means any Executive agency. The term \"participant\" refers to individuals or entities volunteering in crowdsourcing projects under this section, while \"related entity\" includes Federal Government contractors. Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, cooperating parties, grantees, investigators, fellows, and detailees of a Federal agency are authorized to participate in crowdsourcing and citizen science activities to advance the mission of Federal agencies. Federal agencies can accept voluntary services from participants in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects, as long as the services are not financially compensated and do not displace any employees. Federal agencies engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must promote the projects to encourage broad participation. Each agency can determine the level of consent, registration, or acknowledgment of terms of use for participants. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must disclose privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms of use to participants in a clear manner during registration or consent process. Federal agencies can obtain consent electronically or in written form from participants for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. Projects involving human subjects must adhere to regulations, and agencies should aim to make data available despite security and privacy measures. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must make collected data open and available in machine-readable formats. Participants must be informed about the data's expected uses, ownership, and availability for public or third-party use during the consent process. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must make technologies, applications, code, and derivations of intellectual property developed through the project open and available to the public. Participants in these projects must agree to certain terms, including the publication of data if authorized. Participants in citizen science projects must agree to assume all risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for willful misconduct. Federal agencies coordinating these projects must prioritize scientific integrity. Citizen science projects must ensure participants follow scientific integrity and ethics policies. Federal agencies can partner with private or public entities for administrative duties in crowdsourcing or citizen science activities. In carrying out crowdsourcing and citizen science activities, Federal agencies can use funds appropriated by Congress or accept funds from other Federal agencies, private sector entities, or government entities. Federal agencies can receive funds from various sources, including Congress, private sector entities, and government agencies, without giving special consideration in return. The General Services Administration will develop products and services to facilitate the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science activities within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The General Services Administration will develop products and services to facilitate crowdsourcing and citizen science activities for Federal agencies, including guidance from the Director. The Director will report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 4 years as part of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act. The Director will report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 4 years, detailing the goals, participation rates, and resources used in each project. The Director will report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 4 years, detailing the goals, participation rates, resources used, activities, obligations, expenditures, and how funds were allocated among accounts. Additionally, the report will include a description of how each project advanced the mission of the Federal agency. The Director will report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 4 years, detailing the project's results, methods used for data quality, and any savings or costs incurred by the Federal Government as a result of using these projects. The report will include details on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies, highlighting challenges faced and recommendations for future action. The report will summarize the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science methods by Federal agencies, including partnerships and relevant information. It also clarifies that this section does not affect existing authority or displace resources allocated to agencies using these methods. Federal agencies authorized to use crowdsourcing or citizen science for projects."
