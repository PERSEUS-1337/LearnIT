    "content": "The Great Lakes watershed, spanning 300,000 square miles across eight U.S. states and one Canadian province, holds nearly 90% of the U.S. surface freshwater and 20% of the world's. It is vital for the economies of both countries and supports a population of around 40 million people. The Great Lakes basin supports 40 million people with jobs, drinking water, and recreation. Development and agricultural activities have degraded water quality, posing threats to wildlife and human health. Urban and industrial development have altered the ecosystem and introduced non-native species. The Great Lakes basin faces challenges such as the introduction of non-native species, sediment contamination, and threats to over 50 endangered species. Governments in the US and Canada are implementing restoration activities, with Congress enacting over 30 laws to support these efforts. The Great Lakes basin faces challenges like non-native species, sediment contamination, and threats to endangered species. Congress has not authorized a detailed plan for restoring the Great Lakes, unlike the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan for the Everglades ecosystem. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, created in 2004, provides strategic direction on federal policy, chaired by the EPA Administrator and including 10 agency and cabinet-level officers. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, established in 2004 by the EPA, collaborates with various stakeholders to form the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration. This group aims to restore and protect the Great Lakes through the Great Lakes Framework, focusing on three main goals. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, released in December 2005, aims to restore and protect the Great Lakes ecosystem through a series of recommendations for actions to be implemented over the next five years. It serves as a forum for addressing regional issues and coordinating the Strategy's implementation. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, released in December 2005, aims to restore and protect the Great Lakes ecosystem through recommendations for actions over the next five years. It includes eight issue areas and specific activities to address each issue, ranging from supporting existing programs to creating new ones and identifying projects in specific locations. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, released in December 2005, aims to restore and protect the Great Lakes ecosystem through recommendations for actions over the next five years. It includes eight issue areas with specific activities and estimated costs for implementation. The Strategy relies on existing authorities, programs, and funding, as well as new actions like enacting legislation to improve coordination among stakeholders. The Strategy aims to improve coordination among stakeholders and utilize shared resources, including tribes. Some recommendations can be implemented with existing resources, while others may require additional funding. The Strategy does not aim to fully restore the Great Lakes ecosystem but should guide decisions on activities affecting the region. The Great Lakes Strategy aims to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species, with economic losses estimated at $5.0 billion annually in 2005. Existing measures are deemed inadequate, and the goals include preventing new introductions and controlling existing species through various means. The Great Lakes basin faces challenges from habitat loss and species declines due to development, agricultural expansion, toxic pollutants, and invasive species. The ecosystem provides valuable services and supports a thriving recreation industry. Goals include improving fisheries, restoring various habitats, and increasing funding for habitat conservation and species management by $288 million annually. The issue area aims to increase habitat conservation and species management funding by $288 million annually. Water quality in the Great Lakes coastal areas is degraded, leading to human health issues and beach closures. Recommendations include improving wastewater treatment, regulating pollution sources, and managing water quality. In 1987, the United States and Canada identified 43 Areas of Concern (AOC) in the Great Lakes basin due to contaminated sediments resulting from toxic pollutants settling in sediment. The goal is to restore all AOCs in the United States through funding programs under the Great Lakes Legacy Act. Nonpoint source pollution, a major contributor to impaired waters in the Great Lakes ecosystem, comes from diffuse sources like rainfall picking up pollutants. Point source pollution, on the other hand, can be traced to specific sources such as wastewater treatment plants. Excessive levels of nutrients are primary nonpoint source pollutants in the Great Lakes. The primary nonpoint source pollutants in the Great Lakes are excessive levels of nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen. Goals include reducing sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen loading, restoring wetlands and buffer habitat, and reducing soil loss and waste flows into waterways. Persistent toxic substances (PTS) are a long-standing issue in the Great Lakes, released from contaminated sediments, industrial processes, nonpoint sources, and atmospheric deposition. The goal is to virtually eliminate the discharge of PTS into the ecosystem. The Strategy aims to eliminate the discharge of persistent toxic substances (PTS) into the Great Lakes ecosystem by reducing pollutants like mercury, PCBs, dioxins, and pesticides. Recommendations include research, monitoring, and public education to increase understanding of PTS. Ecosystem monitoring and research are currently underfunded, with goals to create a network of monitoring systems and conduct comprehensive research in the Great Lakes. The Strategy aims to create a network of monitoring systems and conduct comprehensive research in the Great Lakes to foster balanced development among economic, social, and ecological factors. Recommended actions include developing science-based indicators of ecosystem health, increasing research funding, and coordinating scientific information. The Strategy recommends enhancing sustainable planning and resource use in government programs to promote the livability of the Great Lakes. It calls for $20 billion in funding over five years, with $15.3 billion allocated for coastal health, including $13.7 billion for wastewater treatment system improvements. The Strategy recommends $20 billion in funding over five years for the Great Lakes ecosystem, with $15.3 billion allocated for coastal health and wastewater treatment system improvements. Some argue that this amount is too high compared to other restoration projects like the Florida Everglades. The Interagency Task Force suggests funding the Strategy from existing programs and current federal and state government funding. According to the task force, federal and state programs spend approximately $523 million and $100 million annually on restoring water quality in the Great Lakes. Some argue that the proposed $20 billion funding for the Great Lakes ecosystem is justified due to its size compared to other restoration projects. Restoration initiatives nationwide require significant funding, such as the estimated $15-19 billion needed for the Chesapeake Bay by 2010. Inadequate funding is a major obstacle to restoration in the Great Lakes. Data on current spending is lacking in the Strategy, except for new funding for wastewater treatment plants. Cost-sharing details are also not provided in the Strategy. The Strategy lacks details on cost-sharing plans among federal, state, and other entities, hindering the identification of funding gaps. The Collaboration and Strategy aim to enhance coordination of ecosystem restoration activities in the Great Lakes, addressing the current lack of comprehensive planning and coordination. Some view the Interagency Task Force and Collaboration as entities facilitating restoration coordination, while others believe the Strategy falls short in this aspect. The Strategy lacks specific governance structure and coordination plans, leaving questions about leadership and roles unanswered. The task force aims to coordinate restoration activities in the Great Lakes, but the Strategy itself does not provide a clear plan for governance. The task force in the annual report highlights successful coordinated responses to ecosystem issues. The executive committee of the Collaboration will create plans to coordinate the implementation of the Strategy, serving as an administrative structure to direct activities, promote accountability, and facilitate coordination among stakeholders for restoration activities. In large-scale ecosystem restoration initiatives like the Everglades, governance involves multiple stakeholders including federal and state agencies. Federal laws require policies on stakeholder interaction and implementation of restoration plans. Some question the financial feasibility of implementing all programs within the Strategy. Some suggest setting priorities for implementing programs within the Great Lakes Strategy to address financial feasibility. Priorities discussed include restoring and protecting near-shore and coastal waters, controlling invasive species, and addressing nonpoint source pollution. The Strategy could serve as a platform for introducing federal legislation for Great Lakes restoration. The Great Lakes Strategy proposes two main approaches for authorizing restoration projects: a large grant program or reauthorizing existing programs with increased funding. In the 109th Congress, a proposal suggested authorizing $4-6 billion for restoration activities in the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Strategy proposes authorizing $4-6 billion for restoration activities in the Great Lakes. The Strategy does not specify funding sources, and similar bills have not been introduced in the 110th Congress. One approach could be to reauthorize existing federal programs identified in the Strategy to achieve its goals. For example, the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006 reauthorizes appropriations for the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Act of 1990. The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Act of 1990 is reauthorized through 2012 with amendments to increase reporting requirements and allow regional projects. New programs are authorized to support the Strategy in the 110th Congress. The Strategy for restoring the Great Lakes includes the establishment of a task force within the EPA, an executive committee for progress reporting, and a Collaboration for long-term restoration planning. The $20 billion Strategy aims to restore the Great Lakes in the near term but acknowledges that more work is needed beyond its five-year goals. The $20 billion Strategy for restoring the Great Lakes raises questions about the process, cost, timeline, roles, governance, success metrics, and funding increases. These questions remain unanswered in the Strategy document but may be addressed through collaboration. The Strategy for restoring the Great Lakes raises questions about process, cost, timeline, roles, governance, success metrics, and funding increases. Collaboration is expected to address issues not covered in the Strategy."
