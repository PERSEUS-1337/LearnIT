On January 1, 2013, this article applies to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers. The article applies to state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including specific systems and retirement plans offered by public employers, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and California Constitution. Compliance with relevant tax codes is required for administration. The article applies to state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and California Constitution. However, certain entities excluded by specific sections of the California Constitution are not affected by this article, as long as they remain participating employers in a state-governed retirement system. Retirement plans approved before January 1, 2013, by voters of excluded entities are not impacted by this article. The article applies to state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and California Constitution. However, certain entities excluded by specific sections of the California Constitution are not affected by this article. Public employees protected under Section 5333(b) of Title 49 of the United States Code are exempt until a federal court rules otherwise or until January 1, 2016. If a federal court upholds the Secretary of Labor's determination that this article precludes certification under Section 5333(b) of Title 49, it does not apply to certain public employees. Additionally, the article does not apply to a multiemployer plan regulated by ERISA if the public employer joined before January 1, 2013. The benefit plan under this article applies to new public employees as defined in Section 7522.04. Individuals who switched public employers after January 1, 2013, will follow the retirement plan of their new employer if they had concurrent membership or reciprocity within the previous six months. Individuals who changed employment positions before January 1, 2013, and switched to a different defined benefit plan in a new public retirement system offered by their employer will be subject to the new plan as if they were first employed before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offered a defined benefit pension plan with a lower benefit factor before January 1, 2013, they can continue to offer that plan instead of the required formula. If they adopt a new formula after January 1, 2013, it must comply with the new requirements. New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a defined benefit formula that conforms to the requirements of this article and is approved by the Legislature. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan consisting solely of a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that plan instead of the required defined benefit pension plan. However, if they adopt a new defined benefit pension plan or formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements and be approved by the Legislature. New members of the employer's plan can only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula in place before January 1, 2013, or a formula approved by the Legislature. The Legislature must approve any new retirement benefit plan for public employers. New members can only join the defined contribution plan in place before January 1, 2013, or a plan that meets the requirements of this article. Employers can offer a defined contribution plan after January 1, 2013, with or without a defined benefit plan. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they may provide employees with the same defined benefit plan they had before joining the authority. This applies to employees from the City of Brea, City of Fullerton, or other specified cities who are not new members and are hired by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the common power being exercised. Employees hired by a joint powers authority within 180 days of a common power being exercised may retain their defined benefit plan from their previous city. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members joining after January 1, 2013, must adhere to the requirements of the article for their defined benefit plan. The Judges\u2019 Retirement System and Judges\u2019 Retirement System II are exempt from certain defined benefit formula and compensation limitations. This article does not grant membership in a public retirement system to those ineligible under its rules. Public retirement systems must comply with the article's requirements by January 1, 2013."
