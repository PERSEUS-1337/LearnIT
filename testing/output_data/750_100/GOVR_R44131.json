Congressional members are working to resolve these issues and move the program forward. This report outlines the history of UCLASS requirements development in response to Congressional requests. The Navy's UCLASS program has evolved from research on unmanned combat air vehicles in 1999. Changes in requirements over time are summarized in Table 1, with the Navy planning to use manned aircraft for certain missions while the N-UCAV fills a specific niche. The N-UCAV program focused on developing unmanned aircraft for reconnaissance missions and identifying targets in protected airspace. Northrop Grumman built a single X-47A air vehicle for testing under the program. In December 2002, the OSD mandated the Navy and Air Force to merge their UCAV development efforts into a joint program. The Defense Department directed the consolidation of Navy and Air Force UCAV programs into the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program in 2003. This program aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and military value of a networked system of weaponized unmanned air vehicles for various missions including SEAD, electronic attack, precision strike, surveillance, and global attack. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review called for the termination of the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program. Instead, the Air Force was to develop a new bomber, while the Navy was mandated to create the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) for longer-range carrier-based operations. The Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) program was initiated in 2006 as a follow-on effort to the terminated Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program. N-UCAS aimed to operate from aircraft carriers and provide persistent surveillance and strike capabilities in high-threat areas. In 2013, the Navy successfully demonstrated the technical feasibility of operating unmanned air combat systems from an aircraft carrier through the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration (UCAS-D) program. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in the UCAS-D program, a subset of N-UCAS, to develop unmanned aircraft carrier capabilities. In 2011, the Navy began planning for the UCLASS program to address surveillance and operational gaps at sea. The Navy invested in the UCAS-D program to develop unmanned aircraft carrier capabilities. In 2011, the UCLASS program was planned to address gaps in sea-based surveillance and enhance Navy operations in contested environments. JROC approved the UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document, defining it as a carrier-based ISR and precision strike asset. In 2012, JROC revised UCLASS requirements favoring permissive airspace. The Navy revised UCLASS requirements in 2012, favoring permissive airspace ISR capabilities due to budget constraints. Dyke Weatherington stated the reduction in strike capability was driven by fiscal realities. JROCMs 086-12 and 196-12 redefined the scope of the program to support various missions. The JROC emphasized affordability as the top priority for the program in a December 2012 memorandum. The CDD established an affordability KPP with a limit of $150 million for the recurring fly-away cost of air vehicles for one 600 nautical mile orbit. Funding for system development is limited, pushing industry to provide mature systems. The Navy issued a draft request for proposals (RFP) for the UCLASS system on April 17, 2014, emphasizing affordability, timely fielding, and endurance. The program aims to provide two intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7. The UCLASS system aims to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7, with a light strike capability for eliminating targets of opportunity. The design allows for capability growth to operate in contested environments, and it is expected to meet mission requirements outlined in a 2012 memo. The end goal is an autonomous aircraft capable of precision operations. The UCLASS system aims to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities in contested environments, with the ability to conduct precision strikes. The timeline for procurement is uncertain, with ongoing delays due to changes in requirements. The system is expected to expand its missions to include extended range intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, tanking, and maritime domain awareness. The Navy is conducting a review of its airborne surveillance systems and carrier air wing, resulting in a delay of around 3 years for the air system contract award and a delay of around 2 years for achieving early operational capability. The Milestone A review is now expected to occur in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years. The UCLASS program's milestone review is expected to occur in fiscal year 2017, delayed by around 3 years since the last review. The program may undergo further changes due to budgetary considerations and evolving DOD priorities."
