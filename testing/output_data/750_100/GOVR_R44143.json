    "content": "The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from denying equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court has extended equal protection principles to the federal government. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny to government actions that classify people, depending on the classification's suspect nature or motivation. The level of scrutiny applied by courts to government actions that classify people depends on the classification's suspect nature or motivation. There are three levels of scrutiny: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review, applied to classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. In determining suspect classifications, courts consider historical discrimination, minority status with unchangeable characteristics, and inadequate political protection. Suspect classifications include race, national origin, and alienage. Strict scrutiny requires government actions to be narrowly tailored to a compelling interest, with the burden of proof on the government. Intermediate scrutiny is applied to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications like gender or illegitimacy. The government must show that its actions are substantially related to an important government interest when subjected to intermediate scrutiny. The burden of proving constitutional validity lies with the government. Rational basis review is the least searching form of judicial scrutiny, where governmental action must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to survive. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action, and it only needs to be reasonable. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are contained within two separate clauses; one in the Fifth Amendment. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, with courts presuming governmental action subject to such review as constitutionally valid. Parties challenging governmental actions bear the burden of proving their invalidity. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution both contain due process clauses that prevent the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without following certain procedural requirements. The Fifth Amendment applies to federal government actions, while the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state actions. The Supreme Court has interpreted these clauses to also include substantive guarantees that protect certain liberty interests. Substantive due process protects fundamental rights from undue governmental infringement, subjecting such actions to strict scrutiny. The government must show a compelling interest and narrowly tailor its actions to meet this standard. The government must demonstrate a \"substantial\" and \"legitimate\" need for its actions to further a compelling government interest. If a compelling interest is established, the government's actions cannot burden fundamental rights more than necessary. The Supreme Court recognizes rights such as the right to have children, use contraception, and marry as fundamental. In Obergefell, the Supreme Court ruled that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages legally formed in other states, based on due process and equal protection principles. The Supreme Court in Obergefell recognized the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples, citing reasons such as individual autonomy, support for committed unions, and safeguarding children. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, citing reasons such as support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and marriage as a keystone of the nation's social order. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing that rights are not solely based on historical practices but also on a modern understanding of constitutional imperatives. This decision marked a departure from precedent and recognized the urgent need for same-sex couples to marry. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing modern constitutional imperatives. The Court did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, departing from precedent. States argued for bans to maintain traditional marriage norms and incentivize procreating couples to stay together. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, emphasizing modern constitutional imperatives. The Court invalidated state same-sex marriage bans without applying typical levels of judicial review. States argued for bans to maintain traditional marriage norms and incentivize procreating couples to stay together during child rearing. The Court did not establish heightened scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation in the Obergefell case. Dissenting Justices believed the majority overstepped by deciding on same-sex marriage instead of leaving it to the democratic process. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell expressed concern about the majority's decision to establish a fundamental right beyond history and tradition, to prevent the Court from making policy decisions on constitutional protection of rights. The decision on state same-sex marriage bans raised questions about its broader impact on gay individuals' rights and the appropriate judicial level. Obergefell raised questions about the decision's broader impact on the rights of gay individuals, specifically regarding the extension of rights outside of the marriage context. The proper level of judicial scrutiny applicable to classifications based on sexual orientation and governmental action interfering with fundamental rights was also discussed. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell focused on the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples, without addressing the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. This limited the decision's impact to the marriage context, raising questions about broader implications for the rights of gay individuals. Prior to Obergefell, federal appeals courts were divided on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Ninth Circuit and Second Circuit both recognized the need for heightened scrutiny, but did not specify if it was intermediate or strict scrutiny. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit does not consider classifications based on sexual orientation as suspect or quasi-suspect, subject only to rational basis review. The Obergefell decision focused on the right to marry, leaving unresolved the circuit split on the level of scrutiny for such classifications. The Sixth Circuit applies rational basis review to classifications based on sexual orientation, while the Second and Ninth Circuits apply heightened scrutiny. This circuit split leaves lower courts to decide how to approach laws that classify based on sexual orientation in the future. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the right to marry to polygamy, creating potential disparities in outcomes for laws based on sexual orientation depending on the evaluating court. Chief Justice John Roberts' dissent in Obergefell hinted at this possibility. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised concerns about the potential legalization of plural marriages, as hinted by Chief Justice John Roberts in his dissent. The majority's opinion in Obergefell aimed to limit its reach to same-sex marriage, possibly to prevent extending the fundamental right to marry to plural marriages. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised concerns about legalizing plural marriages, with distinctions noted between plural and same-sex marriages. The majority's departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights could potentially extend constitutional protections to plural marriages. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised concerns about legalizing plural marriages and the potential expansion of fundamental rights. The Court may consider current views when determining fundamental rights, potentially leading to more rights being protected. It did not specify the level of judicial review for state same-sex marriage bans, raising questions for future cases. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised concerns about legalizing plural marriages and expanding fundamental rights, leading to questions about the level of judicial scrutiny for government actions that interfere with fundamental rights. This ambiguity could impact the permissibility of government actions affecting same-sex couples' right to marry."
