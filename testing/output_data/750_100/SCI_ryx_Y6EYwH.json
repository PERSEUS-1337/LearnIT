A differentially private estimator is proposed to address this issue, allowing for confidential estimation of survival functions, confidence intervals, and test statistics without compromising privacy. Extensions for differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function are also provided. Empirical evidence from nine clinical datasets supports the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our proposed method offers strong privacy guarantees while maintaining good utility in clinical research. By using patient data to estimate survival functions, an adversary can reconstruct user-level data from published estimates, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. This scenario highlights the risks associated with using survival function models in medical analytics. The survival function is crucial for modeling time to events in various domains like economics, engineering, and healthcare. Healthcare data privacy is a significant concern, with information leakage posing serious risks. In this study, the focus is on the domain of healthcare data privacy. The Kaplan-Meier's non-parametric method is widely used in clinical research for estimating survival functions. This method is essential for reporting summary statistics on cohort survival in clinical studies. There is a lack of models providing formal privacy guarantees for survival function estimation using the Kaplan-Meier method. The study focuses on healthcare data privacy and the need for a model to provide formal privacy guarantees for survival function estimation using the Kaplan-Meier method. Existing related work is limited to multivariate regression models and generative models like differentially private generative adversarial networks. The study proposes a differentially private method for estimating the survival function based on the Kaplan-Meier method, addressing challenges with small sample sizes, constrained dimensionality, and mixed variable types. The method ensures differential privacy and can also provide confidence intervals. The study introduces a differentially private method for estimating survival functions, confidence intervals, and test statistics without additional privacy costs. It extends to provide estimates for competing risk cumulative incidence functions and has been validated on nine clinical datasets. The method is available as an R package for easy adoption. The survival function is essential for modeling time to event data, accounting for censored observations. It calculates the probability of not having an event just before a specific time point. The survival function calculates the probability of an event not occurring by a specific time point. Various methods, including parametric and non-parametric approaches like Kaplan-Meier's method, can be used to estimate the survival function. The Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function is defined based on distinct failure times, number of failures, and individuals \"at risk\" before each failure time. It results in a \"step\" function that changes only at failure times, not for censored observations. Additionally, the concept of differential privacy provides a provable privacy notion for randomized algorithms. Differential privacy ensures that a randomized algorithm maintains privacy by behaving similarly on similar input datasets. It defines privacy guarantees based on the distance between datasets and the probability space of the algorithm's coin flips. Smaller values of epsilon and delta provide stronger privacy guarantees. Our proposal focuses on differentially private survival function estimation, emphasizing the immunity to post-processing as stated in Theorem 1. This concept is crucial to our approach, which involves using the Kaplan-Meier method for estimation. Our approach focuses on estimating survival functions using the Kaplan-Meier method while ensuring differential privacy. We demonstrate that by following our method, various accompanying statistics can also be estimated differentially privately without using extra privacy budget. Our method focuses on estimating survival functions using the Kaplan-Meier method with differential privacy. We create a dataset matrix M with event and at-risk data for each time point. By adding noise from a Laplace distribution, we ensure privacy and perform calculations using M. Our method involves estimating survival functions using the Kaplan-Meier method with differential privacy. Algorithm 1 is presented for this purpose, with minimal changes needed for differential privacy implementation. These changes do not add computational overhead, making our method computationally efficient and easily implementable. Our method for estimating survival functions using the Kaplan-Meier method with differential privacy is computationally efficient and easily implementable, with minimal computational overhead. The formal privacy guarantees and extension possibilities for differentially private estimation of other associated statistics are also discussed. The L 1 sensitivity of our method is established as two in Lemma 1, as it only contains count variables for events and individuals at risk for each unique time point. Theorem 2 proves that Algorithm 1 is -differentially private by adding Laplace noise to ensure privacy of individual components. The approach allows for easy extension to other essential functions. The approach in the introduction allows for easy extension to other essential statistics required for survival function estimates, such as confidence intervals and test statistics for group comparison in clinical trials. The text discusses the importance of providing differentially private counterparts for confidence intervals and test statistics used in testing with the help of test statistic. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a point-wise fashion, ensuring differential privacy. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are made differentially private by using Greenwood's linear-point-wise intervals and replacing them with their respective differentially private counterparts. This ensures privacy without needing access to sensitive data for calculation. Using Greenwood's linear-point-wise intervals ensures privacy for survival function estimates without needing access to sensitive data. Differentially private confidence intervals can be provided for free, and hypothesis testing using the Logrank test is also differentially private. The Logrank test for hypothesis testing is -differentially private, ensuring privacy by replacing sensitive information with differentially private counterparts. The test statistic Z is made differentially private by the post-processing theorem. Using Algorithm 1 allows for outputting confidence intervals and the test statistic without using additional privacy budget. In some cases, events like death can prevent the observation of the event of interest. Competing events, such as death, can impact the observation of the event of interest. Competing risk cumulative incidence estimates are crucial in clinical data to avoid bias. Algorithm 1 can extend differential privacy to competing risk scenarios, ensuring -differential privacy for the cumulative incidence estimate. The method for estimating cumulative incidence in competing risk scenarios is differentially private. Replacing quantities with their differentially private counterparts ensures differential privacy. Statistics such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests that depend on these private quantities can also be argued to be differentially private. The differentially private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is obtained using Algorithm 1. The method is evaluated on nine real-life clinical datasets with time to event information. Dataset details are provided in Table 1. Our proposed method for producing differentially private estimates of the survival function is compared to the original \"non-private\" version to establish credibility and utility. Further details on dataset properties, pre-processing, and group comparison for hypothesis tests are provided in the Appendix. The evaluation of our method for producing differentially private estimates of the survival function on nine real-life datasets shows that our privacy-preserving estimation faithfully estimates the survival function with little utility loss. The estimation deteriorates with increased privacy budget, as shown in Figure 1. The differentially private estimation method provides good utility while protecting privacy, as shown in a graph with different privacy levels. Smaller datasets show worse utility, indicating the challenge of protecting privacy in such cases. The differentially private estimation method provides good utility while protecting privacy, especially for moderate to medium-sized datasets. The median survival time and its confidence intervals are important estimates reported with survival function. Our method estimates the median with high precision, as shown in Table 2. Our method estimates the median survival with high precision, even in high privacy regimes. In some cases, upper bounds on confidence intervals cannot be estimated for datasets with high survival rates like Myeloid and Ovarian, marked as \"NA\". Similar to results in Figure 1, precision improves with larger dataset sizes, balancing individual-level privacy protection. Differentially private estimation in Table 2 performs comparably to non-noisy estimation, even in high privacy settings. The test statistic (Z) follows a \u03c7 2 distribution with one degree of freedom. Our method provides accurate estimation of cumulative incidence with competing risk information, maintaining privacy even in high privacy regimes. The test statistic (Z) follows a \u03c7 2 distribution with one degree of freedom, and none of the differentially private estimates change statistical significance thresholds. The proposed method ensures faithful estimation without compromising individual privacy. Faithful estimation at high privacy levels is achieved through various differentially private methods for regression modeling. Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) developed a differentially private regression model for survival analysis, limited to multivariate regression models. The first method for differentially private estimation of the survival function has been presented, showing its potential for extending to other statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics. Our proposed method for differentially private estimation of survival function includes confidence intervals, test statistics, and competing risk cumulative incidence. Extensive evaluation on nine real-life datasets demonstrates a good privacy-utility trade-off. The datasets used for evaluation include Cancer (survival in advanced lung cancer patients), Gehan (leukemia trial), and Kidney (recurrence times). The dataset on kidney patients using portable dialysis equipment compares recurrence times to infection between males and females. Another dataset focuses on the natural history of subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, comparing males and females. Additionally, there is a dataset on a trial in acute myeloid leukemia, comparing different groups over time. The dataset on ovarian cancer survival compares two treatment arms over time in months. Another dataset on Stanford Heart Transplant data compares age groups above and below the median. Lastly, the Veteran dataset compares two treatment regimens for lung cancer over time in months. In a competing risk scenario, two datasets are used for empirical evaluation. The first dataset is from a clinical trial for primary biliary cirrhosis of the liver, with the event variable being receipt of a liver transplant. The second dataset includes subjects on a liver transplant waiting list from 1990-1999, with the event of interest being receiving a transplant. The differentially private extension shows excellent estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function with strong privacy guarantees. The algorithm is proven to be -differentially private. The differentially private extension provides strong privacy guarantees while estimating competing risk cumulative incidence function. The algorithm is proven to be -differentially private, comparing probability density functions at an arbitrary point. The private version of the algorithm ensures differential privacy for survival function estimation, as per the post-processing Theorem (Dwork & Roth, 2014)."
