It is essential for airlines to have this insurance for aircraft loan agreements and to meet requirements of some foreign countries. Airlines rely on private insurance markets for catastrophic coverage. After 9/11, airlines faced a cancellation of third-party liability war risk coverage worldwide. After a worldwide cancellation of third-party liability war risk coverage, the U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure U.S. air carriers had coverage. The commercial insurance market has stabilized, and many carriers are now purchasing war risk coverage from private insurers. Private coverage is readily available for loss or damage in the event of a terrorist attack, according to a 2012 European Union study. The study found that airline insurance is a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines paying approximately $2.3 billion for basic insurance in 2011. This translates to about $60 per flight or $0.80 per passenger, with insurance prices varying depending on factors such as location, size, fleet age, and maintenance. Insurers have limited coverage for third-party damage caused by war or terrorism, with liability and hull risk typically covered in a single policy. The study concluded that the private market for aviation risk insurance is adequate, but could change in the event of a major terrorist incident. Commercial insurers provide most airlines with war risk coverage, including U.S. carriers. The aviation insurance market has been soft in recent years, with ample availability and lower prices reported by brokers. The aviation insurance market has been soft in recent years, with ample availability and lower prices reported by brokers. However, a series of airliner losses in 2014, including the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight 17, may lead to increases in aviation insurance premiums. Further unsettling the aviation risk environment is damage to aircraft in recent attacks on airports. Some aviation insurers predict a 50% increase in insurance premiums due to recent events like the fighting at Tripoli airport in Libya. War risk insurance premiums could triple, the largest jump since 9/11. However, it is too early to determine the exact price increases as major carriers have not renewed their policies yet. The 2014 insurance losses may also result in higher premiums for all-risk policies. The commercial market's reaction and the possibility of private coverage becoming too expensive or unavailable remain uncertain. Since April 30, 2005, EU Regulation 785/2004 (as amended by Regulation 285/2010) requires all air carriers and aircraft operators flying within, into, out of, or over EU territory to be insured for aviation-specific liabilities, including war- and terrorism-related risks. Overflights by non-EU air carriers or operators using aircraft registered outside the EU are exempt from minimum insurance requirements for passengers, baggage, and cargo. EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates war risk insurance for non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU, even though many non-EU countries do not require it. The federal government provided war risk insurance to the merchant fleet in World War I and II, but not for aviation during those wars due to limited commercial air operations. During the Korean War airlift, aviation war risk insurance was limited and worrisome for operators. In 1951, a law was passed to provide war risk insurance for U.S. and foreign-flag aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. The 1951 law provided war risk insurance for aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. Premium rates were set by the Secretary of Commerce, and a revolving fund was established within the Treasury to fund the insurance program. The federally provided war risk insurance for aviation could be underwritten by authorized companies. Disputes over claims could be settled in federal district court. The program continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and was later delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation in 1966. The era of international terrorism began with the 1968 hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 in Rome by PFLP members. This was followed by a TWA flight hijacking in 1969 and attempted hijackings of four airliners in 1970, with three successful. The hijacking of the fourth aircraft, an El Al Boeing 707, was stopped by an armed Israeli guard on board. Known as the Dawson's Field hijackings, two planes were taken to a remote landing strip in Jordan and destroyed. The fate of the third aircraft, a Pan Am 747 hijacked on September 6, 1970, is relevant for discussing insurance coverage for terrorist acts. The hijackers diverted the plane to Beirut, Lebanon, after the crew expressed concerns about landing at Dawson's Field. The hijackers diverted a large jet at Dawson's Field to Beirut, Lebanon, and then to Cairo, Egypt. In Cairo, an explosive was detonated, destroying the jet. The aircraft was insured under various policies, including war risk policies split between FAA and commercial insurers. The event caused concern in the commercial insurance industry regarding insuring Boeing 747s. Following the Dawson Field hijackings, the FAA expanded federal aviation war risk insurance coverage due to concerns over terrorist hijackings in the Middle East. The government set the insurance rate at 20 cents per $100 of insurance, which was twice the price of commercial insurance before the hijackings but less than what the private market would have charged. The new insurance offered after the Dawson Field hijackings was part of the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program in response to the Middle East crisis. A 1973 court decision ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed in Cairo was covered under the airline's standard policy, not its war risk policies, defining \"act of war\" as an operation for military advantage. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a decision narrowing the definition of war for insurance claims related to the 9/11 attacks. Insurers offering \"all risk\" policies were found liable for the destroyed aircraft claim, as large terrorist organizations did not have significant attributes of sovereignty. Prior to 9/11, aviation war risk insurance was issued without premium under agreements with the Department of Defense. Prior to the 9/11 attacks, aviation war risk insurance was issued without premiums under indemnification agreements with the Department of Defense (DOD). Over 99% of all war risk insurance issued by the FAA was for DOD charter flights to move troops, cargo, and relief supplies overseas. Premium war risk insurance was only available when the President determined travel to specific foreign locations was necessary for U.S. foreign policy interests. During the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, the FAA issued war risk policies to carriers for specific routes in conflict areas. Air carriers began cancelling flights to the Middle East due to soaring commercial war risk insurance rates, with premiums increasing significantly. Trans World Airlines and Pan Am suspended flights indefinitely. During the first Gulf War, commercial war risk insurance rates soared, leading to flight cancellations to high-risk destinations like Israel, Athens, Istanbul, and Karachi. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue flights from Israel under a government-issued war risk policy. FAA did not insure Tower Air's flights from New York to Tel Aviv after Iraqi Scud missiles were fired into Israel. In response to the 9/11 attacks, commercial insurers cancelled third-party liability war risk coverage for airlines and increased premiums. Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 to expand coverage to include acts of terrorism. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 extended the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was extended through various acts, most recently in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. The program includes coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at the limits carried by air carriers. The current program authority expires on September 30, 2014. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was extended through various acts, most recently in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. The program includes coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at the limits carried by air carriers. FAA indicated that limits for comprehensive coverage were set at limits carried by the insured airlines in their existing commercial insurance policies, while third-party liability limits were set at limits specified in their FAA third-party-only war risk policies. Rates were set to match commercial rates in force on the date of enactment. P.L. 107-296 further stipulated that the total premium paid by the air carrier for the policy should not exceed twice the premium that the air carrier was paying to the Department of Transportation for its third party policy. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, extended through various acts, capped rates for air carriers and specified coverage for losses. Following 9/11, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to address terrorism damage in the insurance market. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage to U.S. air carriers, with insurance ranging from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier. TRIA may still cover terrorism losses if airlines opt for commercial insurance. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage to U.S. air carriers ranging from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier. The FAA currently insures 27 air carriers, covering approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. Between April and August 2014, 17 U.S. air carriers switched from FAA war risk insurance to commercial coverage. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines, with coverage ranging from $100 million to $3 billion per carrier occurrence. The total maximum exposure of all insurance currently in force is $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. FAA estimates premium collections to be $18 million for FY2015. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines, with coverage ranging from $100 million to $3 billion per carrier occurrence. The total maximum exposure of all insurance currently in force is $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. FAA estimates premium collections to be $18 million for FY2015. The coverage offered under the program begins with the first dollar of loss and reimburses 100% of losses, including hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability. The curr_chunk discusses various events that are excluded from coverage under the policy, including acts of foreign enemies, warlike hostilities, civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, strikes, riots, civil commotions, labor disturbances, and acts for political or terrorist purposes. Payments in response to ransom or extortion demands are specifically denied. Excluded events under the policy include malicious acts, confiscation by foreign governments, and hijacking. Payments for ransom or extortion demands are denied. The policy excludes events such as hijacking, unlawful seizure of the aircraft, and discharge of weapons or explosives. Premiums charged by the FAA are based on the risk assumed by the program. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program paid over $10 million for losses related to claims from three specific incidents since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program paid over $10 million for losses from three specific incidents: an attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009, an incident involving an unattended SkyWest aircraft seized by a fugitive in 2012, resulting in a total loss of the aircraft and damage to airport facilities and personal vehicles. Total claims paid to date amount to $9.6 million. In April 2014, the FAA paid $256,890 for repairs to a Boeing 767-223 aircraft owned by Air Transportation International, LLC, damaged by gunfire over Afghanistan in 2012. The Secretary of Transportation proposed reforms to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to reduce its scope. The FAA proposed changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to provide coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons, offer full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days in case of a market disruption, and continue to provide non-premium war risk insurance for carriers supporting national defense. The President's FY2014 budget proposed changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, aiming for commercial insurers to take on 80% of the risk by FY2018. This would reduce FAA's share to 20%. Previous budgets also included proposals for changes in the program. The FY2013 and FY2012 budgets proposed a $150 million deductible for hull and liability exposures under the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program. The airline industry, represented by Airlines for America (A4A), opposed the changes, stating that ending the program would harm the U.S. airline industry's economic viability. A4A opposed ending the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, citing potential financial costs and service reductions. They recommended maintaining the program and extending it for three years. The Secretary of Transportation's proposal to end the program was criticized for its budget implications. The current Administration proposal aims to reduce budgetary costs by increasing funds coming in or reducing funds going out from government insurance programs. This can be achieved by raising premiums, seeking higher returns on funds, or reducing assumed risks to lower eventual payouts. Premiums collected by FAA totaled $165 million. The FAA collected $165 million in premiums in FY2013, with the potential to increase premiums by raising the statutory cap to eliminate implicit subsidies and attract more funds into the program. Airlines with low risk profiles may seek private insurance or operate with less coverage if premiums increase. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, currently over $2 billion, is invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with returns near historical lows. Private insurers invest in a wider range of instruments with higher historical returns. Private property/casualty insurers earned $67.6 billion in net investment income and realized gains in 2013 on $1.48 trillion in cash and investments. If the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund had similar returns, it would have earned $91 million instead of $26 million in FY2013. Private insurers' investments are riskier than Treasury securities as they do not cover the full amount of possible losses, leaving the insured to bear some risk through deductibles and co-insurance. The government offers aviation insurance coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance since 2002, covering losses up to maximum limits. Risk-sharing mechanisms like deductibles and co-insurance discourage behavior changes that could increase the likelihood of losses, known as \"moral hazard.\" The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program also covers losses not typically considered war risks. Private insurers often share risks among multiple insurers, especially for large risks, with contractual arrangements varying based on the types of risks involved. Reinsurance is commonly used to spread risk, and significant savings can be achieved by placing more risk on airlines. Private insurers often share risks among multiple insurers, with each covering a portion of possible loss through tailored insurance or reinsurance contracts. Loss sharing can be based on a percentage of the loss, a certain level of loss, or a combination of both. This risk sharing allows parties to leverage their expertise in different facets of insurance operations. Private insurers often share risks among multiple insurers through tailored insurance or reinsurance contracts. Loss sharing can leverage expertise in different facets of insurance operations. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act created a program mixing loss sharing based on the level of loss and a percentage of the loss. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) involves loss sharing where the government covers 85% of losses once they reach 20% of an insurer's premiums. The program was initially intended to expire quickly, reducing the government's share of losses to zero, but has since been reauthorized with a more gradual decrease in government coverage. Improved international guidance on risk decisions for flights in conflict zones could help stabilize the program. Decisions on flights in conflict zones impact private market war risk insurance premiums and coverage terms. After the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 in Ukraine, there is a focus on disseminating threat information for informed decisions on civilian flight operations in high-risk regions. Insurance underwriters are considering withdrawing coverage for flights in certain conflict zones, requiring more details on flight routes. Insurers are considering withdrawing coverage for flights in certain conflict zones in the Middle East and Africa due to concerns about inconsistent risk assessment by airlines. The practice of flying over conflict zones to save fuel costs has been questioned after the Malaysia Airlines crash in 2014. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has convened a task force to examine this issue. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has formed a multinational task force to improve collaboration in assessing conflict zone risks for civilian aircraft. Current guidelines require countries to identify conflict areas, assess risks, and establish safety measures, but not all countries share this information or take necessary precautions. The FAA and other aviation authorities issue warnings or restrictions on overseas flight operations to mitigate risks to civil aircraft. In July 2014, FAA restricted flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict after a rocket exploded near Ben Gurion Airport. The FAA restricted flights to and from Israel in July 2014 after a rocket exploded near Ben Gurion Airport. Israeli authorities asked international airlines to resume flights despite risks, showing reluctance to disseminate warnings that may impact travel. This highlights the cautious approach of governments in issuing guidance to airlines operating in conflict zones. Improved processes for assessing conflict zone hazards to civil aviation, issuing warnings, and restricting flights could address concerns over private market war risk insurance premiums and coverage by potentially reducing uncertainties and ambiguities in assessing risk. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers and aircraft operators to be insured for aviation-specific liability, including acts of war, terrorism, hijacking, sabotage, unlawful seizure of aircraft, and civil commotion. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates insurance coverage for aviation-specific liability, including terrorism, hijacking, sabotage, unlawful seizure of aircraft, and civil commotion. The minimum insurance coverage required per passenger is 250,000 SDRs ($378,523) for passenger liability, higher than the Montreal Convention's requirement. Non-commercial aircraft operations with a MTOM of 2,700 kg have a lower minimum of 100,000 SDRs ($151,409) per passenger. Baggage liability requires 1,131 SDRs ($1,712) per passenger in commercial operations, and cargo liability requires 19 SDRs ($29) per kilogram. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates insurance coverage for aviation-specific liability, including terrorism, hijacking, sabotage, unlawful seizure of aircraft, and civil commotion. The minimum insurance coverage per accident depends on the MTOM of the operated aircraft, ranging from 750,000 SDRs ($1,135,568) to 700 million SDRs (nearly $1.06 billion). Sanctions for infringement of the regulation are effective, proportional, and dissuasive, including the withdrawal of the operating license from EU air carriers. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program is similar to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program created after 9/11. The federal government provides insurance programs in various ways, with 71 activities identified by the Government Accountability Office. After the 9/11 attacks, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA, P.L. 107-297) was enacted to address the lack of coverage for terrorism-related losses in the commercial insurance market. TRIA provided federal coverage for such losses temporarily, as insurers were reluctant to offer terrorism coverage due to high costs. Initially set for three years, the program aimed to transition coverage back to the private sector by 2005, but industry reluctance persisted. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) was reauthorized in 2005 and 2007 due to the insurance industry's reluctance to cover terrorism risk. With the 2014 expiration approaching, bills have been introduced to extend the program, which provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering specific lines of coverage. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering commercial property/casualty coverage, including terrorism coverage. The program reimburses insurers for losses without upfront premiums, funded by the government's general fund. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) allows for a post-event recoupment fee on commercial insurance policies to recover government costs. The coverage is more limited than federal aviation war risk insurance, operating through private insurers with similar limits and deductibles. TRIA coverage is subject to a substantial general deductible and applies under specific circumstances before federal funds are disbursed. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) requires a minimum of $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act before federal funds are available. The coverage under TRIA is narrower than aviation war risk insurance, with no federal limits on terrorism coverage. Private insurers must offer terrorism coverage under the same terms as other causes of loss, but can charge a separate premium. State laws may limit terrorism premiums. Terrorism premiums may be limited under state laws regulating insurance."
