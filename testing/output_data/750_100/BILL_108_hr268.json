    "content": "The Act titled \"United States Weather Research Program Act of 2003\" focuses on establishing a weather research program. The United States Weather Research Program, established under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, improving weather forecasts, and quick progress in impactful areas. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, and improving weather forecasts. It aims to make quick progress in impactful areas by establishing goals, leveraging resources, and making research grants to universities and research institutions. The United States Weather Research Program, established in 1992, focuses on hurricanes, floods, heavy precipitation, and improving weather forecasts. It aims to make quick progress in impactful areas by establishing goals, leveraging resources, and making research grants to universities and research institutions. Program research priorities are outlined in Section 3. The United States Weather Research Program's research priorities include improving hurricane forecasts for landfall location and strength, enhancing forecasts for heavy precipitation events like winter storms and rain storms, and improving flood forecasting and warning systems for inland flooding related to tropical cyclones. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on improving hurricane forecasts, enhancing predictions for heavy precipitation events, and improving flood forecasting for inland flooding related to tropical cyclones. Additionally, they work on two-to-fourteen day forecasting to improve weather predictions and warnings, conduct research to fill observational gaps in the Northern Hemisphere, and test advanced data assimilation techniques in global models. They also study societal and economic impacts to identify methods of delivering weather information effectively. The United States Weather Research Program focuses on improving weather communications, assessing social and economic impacts of adverse weather, evaluating useful weather information for decision makers, and researching societal and economic impacts to improve human conditions. They also test research concepts related to weather forecasting. The United States Weather Research Program tests research concepts at test bed centers to transfer technology to operational meteorologists. SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY PLANNING AND PROCESS. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration leads the US Weather Research Program, coordinating with other federal agencies to develop a five-year plan for weather research and information dissemination. The US Weather Research Program coordinates with federal agencies to develop a five-year plan for weather research and information dissemination, including methods for disseminating weather information and best practices for transferring research results to forecasting operations. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to specific congressional committees, detailing the five-year plan, federal agency roles and funding, and any changes made to the plan. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to specific congressional committees, detailing the five-year plan's objectives and a detailed assessment of their achievement. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Office of Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and $15,500,000 for fiscal year 2005, with at least 50% allocated for grants to institutions of higher education. For fiscal year 2006, $16,000,000 is allocated, with at least 50% for competitive grants to institutions of higher education."
