    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion for DHS in FY2013, a slight decrease from the previous year. The overall estimated DHS budget for FY2013 is $681 million below the budget for FY2012. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill on May 22, 2012. The Senate-reported appropriations numbers for DHS in FY2013 were based on S. 3216 and S.Rept. 112-169. The Senate bill proposed a net discretionary appropriation of $39,514 million, excluding funds for overseas contingency operations and disaster relief. This amount was slightly above the Administration's request but below the amount provided under P.L. 112-74. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments on June 7, 2012. The House passed H.R. 5855 on June 7, 2012, with a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS for FY2013. Funding for certain activities was 27% below the requested level due to offsets from management accounts. Increases were proposed for Customs and Border Protection, Coast Guard, and FEMA. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as P.L. 112-175 on September 28, 2012, a continuing resolution allowing federal government operations until March 27, 2013. It passed the House 329-91 on September 13, 2012, and the Senate 62-30 on September 22, 2012. On March 26, 2013, the President signed H.R. 933 into law as P.L. 113-6, the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act. Division D of that act includes the Department of Homeland Security's Coast Guard and FEMA funding. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013 allocated $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS. Two across-the-board cuts reduced the discretionary budget authority by $52.4 million. After the impact of sequestration, $38.348 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority was available for DHS to use. The impact of sequestration on the Department of Homeland Security's budget for Fiscal Year 2013 was significant, resulting in a reduction of discretionary budget authority to $38.348 billion after two across-the-board cuts totaling $52.4 million. The continuing resolution for FY2013 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security is detailed in S.Rept. 112-169 and H.J.Res. 117. Post-sequester funding levels are from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2013 Post-Sequestration Operating Plan. Historical funding data is sourced from the Analytical Perspectives volume of the FY2006-FY2014 President's Budget request documents. All amounts in the report are in budget authority and rounded to the nearest million. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, including funding for various offices and agencies like Customs and Border Protection. Title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 includes appropriations for various agencies such as Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. Title III includes appropriations for National Protection and Programs Directorate, Office of Health Affairs, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Title IV includes appropriations for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Science and Technology Directorate, and Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Title V contains general provisions providing congressional direction to the department. The FY2012 appropriations bill included a sixth title for a $1 billion emergency appropriation for the Disaster Relief Fund. The Senate version did not have any additional titles. Differences in the structure of subcomponents and accounts were noted in the proposed FY2013 appropriations bills. The congressional budget process determines the maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, through a two-stage process. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among the appropriations committees as 302(a) allocations for enactment in annual appropriations bills. In the budget process, appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds to subcommittees for each bill. These allocations, known as 302(b) allocations, must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made by the Appropriations Committee throughout the year as bills progress towards enactment. The FY2012 appropriations bills were impacted by the Budget Control Act, which set spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories. For FY2013, a separate cap of $686 billion was established for security spending, including defense, veterans affairs, international affairs, nuclear security, and intelligence programs. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories in FY2012. For FY2013, a separate cap of $686 billion was established for security spending, including defense, veterans affairs, international affairs, nuclear security, and intelligence programs. All other spending was capped at $361 billion out of the total of $1.047 trillion. Adjustments were allowed for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud and abuse. The House-passed budget resolution set lower levels for enforcement. The Budget Control Act set spending caps for security and nonsecurity categories in FY2012, with lower levels agreed to in the House-passed budget resolution. The Budget Control Act also established a process of automatic spending reduction through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, triggered when deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by January 15, 2012. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated sequestration process for FY2013, requiring OMB to implement spending cuts across defense and nondefense funding to achieve equal reductions. The American Taxpayer Relief Act made changes to the procedures in the BCA. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated sequestration for FY2013, with changes made by the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Significant changes included delaying the implementation of the joint committee sequester to March 1, 2013, reducing the dollar amount by $24 billion, and lowering statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 and FY2014. President Obama ordered the sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, with OMB reporting budget authority cancellations for non-exempt funds. Sequestration was applied at the program, project, and activity levels. Sequestration was implemented at the program, project, and activity level within each account for FY2013. The post-sequestration numbers in this report are derived from the FY2013 DHS operating plan, which only includes resources provided through P.L. 113-6. This report does not address the sequestration of resources provided in P.L. 113-2. Section 3001 of P.L. 113-6 includes across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority to comply with FY2013 discretionary spending limits. DHS falls under the \"security\" category and receives a 0.1% cut. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 includes additional across-the-board rescissions for nonsecurity and security budget authority to avoid exceeding spending limits. The percentages can be increased if OMB determines more rescissions are necessary. OMB calculated that additional rescissions of 0.032% of \"security\" budget authority and 0.2% of \"nonsecurity\" budget authority are needed to avoid exceeding spending limits. Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief under the Budget Control Act are not subject to these cuts. Table 2 displays DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013, FY2012, and the President's FY2013 request. Justifications for adjusting discretionary budget caps under the BCA include emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and disaster relief. No adjustments were made for emergencies in FY2012, but $258 million was allocated for Coast Guard overseas contingency operations. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief under the BCA is determined by OMB using a formula based on the rolling average of disaster relief spending over the last ten fiscal years. For FY2013, OMB determined the allowable adjustment to be $11,779 million, fully exercised including $6,400 million from the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 113-6. The FEMA Disaster Relief Fund received $6,400 million in pre-sequestration resources in P.L. 113-6 for FY2013 appropriations. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for civilian federal employees, including almost all DHS employees. The House rejected a proposed civilian pay raise, resulting in a slight reduction in appropriations for civilian salaries within the DHS. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the pay raise, but current legislation does not provide resources for it. The breakdown of DHS appropriations by title lacks transparency, as the agency's budget varies widely among its components. DHS components have varying budgets, with FY 2013 discretionary budget authority broken down by size in Table 4 and Figure 1. Figure 1 includes adjustments for disaster relief and overseas operations but not general provisions impacting budget authority. The discretionary budget authority provided in P.L. 113-6 is compared against the bill's budget allocation, along with resources available under adjustments to the discretionary budget cap under the BCA. Funding under these adjustments is not considered appropriations in this report. Figure 1, despite accounting for discretionary cap adjustments, does not provide a complete picture. Figure 1, despite accounting for discretionary cap adjustments, does not fully depict the resources available to individual DHS components. Many components rely on fee income or offsetting collections for funding, with less than 4% of CIS's budget coming from direct appropriations. Figure 2 shows how much of the DHS budget is not funded through discretionary appropriations, comparing the Administration's FY2013 budget request to the enacted budget for FY2013 before sequestration. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2013, including discretionary and mandatory funding, as well as adjustments under the Budget Control Act. The graphic reflects enacted funding for FY2013, which includes funding from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. Some amounts are from the Administration's budget request documents, not congressional documents. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation or sequestration. The amounts represent enacted amounts at the start of the next fiscal year's appropriation cycle, with exceptions noted for FY2009 and FY2011. Alternative sources are referenced when previous year's data are not included in the report. The House Appropriations Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee marked up DHS appropriations bills in May 2012. P.L. 113-6 was enacted as the second-latest annual appropriations for the department. Figure 3 illustrates the timing history of DHS appropriations bills. Title I of the bill funds department management activities, A&O account, and the Office of the. The Administration requested $1,279 million for department management activities, Analysis and Operations (A&O) account, and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in FY2013. The House-passed bill proposed $1,020 million, while the Senate-reported bill suggested $1,102 million. After across-the-board cuts, the final appropriations for Title I were $1,086 million, a decrease of 15.1% from the requested level. The operating plan for DHS in FY2013 shows sequestration reducing funding to $1,026 million. Table 6 details enacted amounts for Title I components in FY2012 and FY2013, including post-sequester levels. The departmental management accounts cover general administrative expenses. The Department of Homeland Security's expenses include the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management, Under Secretary for Management, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, and Office of the Chief Information Officer. The Administration typically requests funding for headquarters consolidation. In each section, a graphic shows the discretionary appropriation for each DHS element. It compares the component's size to others in DHS and previous year's levels. FY2013 requests vs FY2012 appropriations: OSEM $134M (+$1M), USM $222M (-$14M), OCFO $55M (+$5M), OCIO $313M (+$55M). The total request for departmental management activities in Title I for FY2012 was $724 million, with increases in funding for OCFO and OCIO. The Administration also requested $134 million for OSEM, proposing separate line items for three offices previously funded under the Office of Policy. The Administration requested $222 million for the USM and 902 full-time employee equivalents (FTEs), with program changes including funding for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman and training programs for law enforcement personnel related to ICE Secure Communities and 287(g) programs. The Under Secretary for Management (OUSM) will receive an increase of $441,000 for the transfer of the Directives function. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) will have $26 million for salaries and expenses and $10 million for Human Resources Information Technology. The USM will get $5 million for improvements to the Nebraska Avenue Complex. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) requested $55 million, including $6.7 million for Financial Systems Modernization. The OCFO requested $313 million for a new core financial system at FEMA in FY2013 to accurately account for resources. Within the OCIO account, Infrastructure and Security Activities requested $122 million, including $65 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. The migration timeline will enable continued closures of major Component data centers. The House Appropriations committee recommended decreased funding for management activities under Title I, with OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO receiving less funding compared to the President's request. The total funding recommended was $627 million, representing a decrease of $97 million or 13.4%. This migration will enable closures of major Component data centers to consolidate to two data centers across the enterprise. The House Appropriations committee recommended reduced funding for management activities under Title I, with OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO receiving less funding compared to the President's request. The total recommended funding was $627 million, a decrease of $97 million or 13.4%. This reduction was justified by the committee to cover the lack of revenue from unrealized funding proposals and failure to comply with statutory requirements. Amendments passed during floor consideration further reduced the budget for management by almost $33 million. Amendments passed during floor consideration would have reduced the budget for management by almost $33 million, with the four largest amendments reallocating funds within different agencies. During floor consideration, amendments were passed to reduce the budget for management by $33 million. This included reallocating funds within agencies such as reducing funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $10 million and increasing funds for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology by $10 million. Another amendment reduced funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $5 million and increased funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million. These changes would have left the USM with $41 million less than the requested level. During floor consideration, amendments were passed to reduce the budget for management by $33 million, reallocating funds within agencies. Representative Flake proposed using $17,000 from international programs for U.S. Customs and Border Protection salaries. OSEM faced provisions withholding $71 million until all required reports for the FY2014 budget were submitted. The committee received proposals related to the FY2014 budget request, including a provision to restrict the use of Coast Guard-operated fixed wing aircraft. $5 million in funding for the Office of General Counsel was proposed to be withheld until a final overseas aircraft repair station security regulation was published. Over $124 million in funding under the USM appropriation would be withheld until all required reports were submitted. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $7 million (10%) from the requested level for OCPO for \"failure to comply with the statutory requirement to submit on time a comprehensive acquisition report with quarterly updates.\" Under the OCFO account, more than $29 million would have been withheld from obligation until the Committee received all reports and plans that were, by statute, required to be submitted with or in conjunction with the FY2014 budget request. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $7 million for OCPO due to non-compliance with acquisition reporting requirements. The Committee withheld over $29 million from the OCFO account until all required reports and plans were submitted. The report emphasized direct communication from relevant components regarding their areas of responsibility, rather than through appropriations liaisons. The recommended appropriation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer would be $242 million, allocated to salaries/expenses and development/acquisition of information. The House-recommended appropriation included $27 million for Information Technology Services and $55 million for Security Activities, but did not provide the proposed $65 million for migration to consolidated data centers due to budget shortfalls. The Senate-reported bill for departmental management in Title I would have provided appropriations totaling $655 million, representing a decrease of $69 million (9.5%) from the President's request. This excludes funding for DHS headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths. The Senate committee report also highlighted a programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights. The Senate committee report highlighted a programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (OCRCL), including $1,327,000 to ensure compliance with civil rights statutes and constitutional requirements. Despite the increase, the recommended budget for OCRCL was down by roughly $1 million from FY2012 levels. The report also mentioned that DHS discontinued funding for its historian and encouraged the Secretary to fill the position again using funds provided in FY2013. The committee report highlighted funding reductions for reception and representation expenses in FY2012 and proposed further reductions for FY2013 due to budget constraints. The report recommended funding for oversight of major acquisitions, workforce development, and security measures to safeguard DHS personnel and facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a reduced appropriation for the OCHCO and OCIO due to budget constraints, with a focus on critical operational missions. The OCHCO was recommended $35 million, $1 million below the request, while the OCIO was recommended $248 million, with $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reduced appropriations for the OCIO, including $57 million for technology investments overseen by the OCIO. Additionally, $65 million for data center migration was allocated, bringing the total bill for the OCIO to the level of the Administration's request. The committee report highlighted that data center consolidation investment is expected to result in nearly $3 billion in savings by 2030. The law provides appropriations for OSEM, USM, and OCFO, with slight reductions compared to the President's request. The total funding provided for departmental management in Title I is $643 million, a decrease of $170 million or 21% from the President's request. Only OCIO experienced a funding reduction based on sequestration, with a decrease of $69 million or 22%. The P.L. 113-6 included a direction for the DHS CIO to submit a multi-year investment and management plan for information technology acquisition projects funded under the CIO. The Senate's explanatory statement also directs the Secretary to provide a report detailing all costs. The Secretary is directed to provide a report on travel costs and submit a contingency plan for user fee collections. The USM is to submit a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report with the President's FY2014 budget proposal. DHS is required to provide quarterly updates on the implementation of the balanced workforce strategy and submit a detailed report to the appropriations committees. The CFO will continue to give semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization efforts. Funding levels for management accounts are outlined in Table 7, with funding numbers reflecting across-the-board spending cuts from P.L. 113-6. The DHS provided quarterly updates on workforce strategy implementation and financial systems modernization efforts. Funding numbers for management accounts in P.L. 113-6 reflect spending cuts, but not the impact of sequestration. The \"DHS Plan\" column shows budget resources after sequestration as of April 26, 2013, with potential transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration effects. House and Senate Appropriations committees identified issues, including the Administration's proposal for separate line items under OSEM. The Administration proposed separate line items for three offices under OSEM - OIA, SLLE, and PSO. Each office would report directly to OSEM, but the proposal was rejected at each stage. The Administration's proposal to have three offices report directly to OSEM was rejected during the legislative process, including P.L. 113-6. The House committee emphasized the need for Senate-confirmed individuals to head these offices and directed the Department to explore the possibility of establishing an external affairs office to streamline functions. The Senate committee report criticized DHS for not justifying the need for standalone external affairs offices like PSO and SLLE, suggesting that these functions could be consolidated within the Office of Policy. The Administration's budget proposed increasing resources through measures like raising the aviation security fee and allowing CBP to receive reimbursement. The House rejected proposals for customs fee revenues and CBP reimbursement agreements, while the Senate included them. The House committee report highlighted a shortfall in the DHS budget due to assumptions on new revenue sources. The Committee rejects unrealistic budgeting approaches and warns of consequences for Department requests. It will consider enacted proposals in future legislation but until then, they will not be treated as relevant. The House committee expressed concern about late submissions of required plans and reports by the Department, withholding funding as a consequence. The Department has been egregiously late in responding to Congressional direction, failing to submit statutorily required reports on time. The investment plans, expenditure plans, reports, and justifications outlined by the Committee are essential for DHS to better protect the American people. Such plans are vital for oversight work, yet in many instances, they have been late, incomplete, or not submitted. The Department has been late in submitting statutorily required reports and plans, with some being more than three months overdue. The Senate-reported bill proposed withholding 59% of budgets until all required reports are submitted. The House provision reduced the USM budget by 70% if its provisions were to become law for FY2013. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of the budgets of OSEM, USM, and CFO until all reports and plans due by May 1 are submitted. The House committee report referenced the GSA inspector general's findings. The GSA inspector general's findings on conference spending and the need for better oversight in the current fiscal climate require the Department's Office of Inspector General to report on compliance with federal laws and regulations. New provisions in House and Senate bills include quarterly reporting to the DHS OIG. The Senate bills require quarterly reporting to the DHS OIG on government events costing over $20,000. Grants or contracts funded by the department cannot be used for unrelated conferences. Funds for travel or conferences must comply with OMB Memorandum M-12-12. Section 3003 of Division G of P.L. 113-6 addresses these provisions. The House and Senate bills aim to limit the number of employees attending overseas conferences, with the House capping attendance at 50 employees unless it's a law enforcement conference, and the Senate capping attendance at 50 employees per DHS component. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 45 locations in the Washington, DC area, a legacy of its rapid assembly from 22 federal agencies. The fragmentation is cited as a major inefficiency. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters is a major contributor to inefficiencies due to fragmentation, resulting in time and cost inefficiencies. A $3.4 billion master plan was approved to create a new DHS headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia, with $1.4 billion funded through the DHS budget and $2 billion through the GSA. The DHS headquarters project at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia has received $1.366 billion in investments through FY2012, with $434 million from DHS and $933 million from GSA. Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, is close to completion. The Administration is seeking funding for consolidating other DHS offices in the DC area to save on lease costs. The Administration requested funding for a highway interchange to support the St. Elizabeths DHS headquarters project, which is not typically funded through Homeland Security appropriations. Additionally, $24.5 million was requested for moving the Coast Guard into its new facility. The budget for moving the Coast Guard to its new facility in FY2013 was included in the budget submission to Congress. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funding for the highway interchange or St. Elizabeths project through the Homeland Security bill. $10 million would be provided through the Coast Guard's construction budget for additional support. The Committee recommends no new construction funding in the bill for new Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion, $89,000,000 below the request. Funding is included in the Coast Guard appropriation to cover costs for moving the headquarters to St. Elizabeths and ensure completion of the current project. Additional funding under Coast Guard construction will improve site access and support analysis for follow-on work. The Committee recommends no new construction funding for Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion, $89,000,000 below the request. Funding in the Coast Guard appropriation covers moving the headquarters to St. Elizabeths and completing the current project. Additional funding will improve site access and support analysis for follow-on work. The Department is exploring options to modify or consolidate current leases due to delays in permanent headquarters construction. The Committee encourages continued efforts and requests progress updates within 90 days, including revised schedule and cost estimates. $10,000,000 is included under the Coast Guard Acquisition. The Committee includes $10,000,000 for Phase 1 of construction to ensure Coast Guard can move in 2013 without obstacles. The minority views highlight the lack of $89 million for site access improvements for the new DHS headquarters. The new DHS headquarters project has faced funding shortages, leading to delays and increased costs. The Coast Guard may be the only tenant for the next 3-5 years. Phase 2 construction for DHS central headquarters and FEMA has no funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for a highway interchange. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for a highway interchange, funded through the Under Secretary for Management's office. No funding was provided through the Coast Guard construction budget, and an attempt to use the funds as an offset for an unrelated amendment failed. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management for headquarters and mission support consolidation. The Under Secretary must submit an expenditure plan within 90 days of the act's enactment, detailing fund allocation, schedule, and cost estimates. Quarterly briefings are required on consolidation activities, with updates on any deviations from the plan. The Department is developing an updated expenditure plan with the General Services Administration for the headquarters consolidation project. The plan will be completed by the end of summer 2012 and submitted to the Committee. It will identify construction segments, resource requirements, and funding timelines. The Department of Homeland Security is working on an expenditure plan with the General Services Administration for headquarters consolidation. $29 million is allocated for necessary expenses related to the project. The funds support the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) manages the DHS intelligence enterprise, collects, analyzes, and shares intelligence information with all DHS components and homeland security partners. The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) develops and coordinates departmental and interagency operations plans, managing the National Operations Center for incident management and situational awareness. OPS's budget partly comes from the National Intelligence Program. The FY2013 request for the Analysis and Operations account was $322 million, a decrease of $16 million from FY2012. H.R. 5855 proposed $317 million for the account, $4.5 million below the President's request. The recommendation was $21 million less than FY2012. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended denying the proposed increase in executive service salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, a decrease of $14 million (4.1%) from FY2012 and an increase of $2 million (0.6%) from the President's FY2013 request. This amount was $7 million (2.2%) higher than the House's proposal. The House Committee on Appropriations also recommended denying the proposed increase in executive service salaries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $324 million for the Analysis and Operations account, an increase of $7 million (2.2%) above the House amount. The Committee directed DHS to focus the expenditure plan on I&A's unique expertise and continue briefings on the State and Local Fusion Centers program. P.L. 113-6 provides $322 million for the Analysis and Operations account. The Analysis and Operations account receives $322 million, falling between the amounts in H.R. 5855 and S. 3216. This is the same as the President's FY2013 request and 4.7% below FY2012. The operating plan for DHS in FY2013 indicates sequestration reduced this to $306 million. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about I&A's mission, citing a lack of focus and vague authorities. Representative Sue Myrick highlighted these issues during a House hearing on DHS's role in the intelligence community. The Aspen Institute report suggested that DHS's intelligence activities should focus on specific homeward-focused areas where it has unique strengths and value, rather than duplicating efforts of other agencies. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department's programs, keeping Congress informed about any issues. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department's programs. The OIG ensures DHS information technology security and reviews legislation and regulations. The OIG reports to Congress and the Secretary of DHS, requesting $144 million in funding, including $2.6 million for audits of states receiving FEMA grant funds. The DHS OIG requested $144 million in funding for audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. The House-passed bill allocated $109 million for the OIG, with $24 million funded through a transfer. The committee reduced the OIG appropriation by $10 million due to dissatisfaction with communication on border corruption investigations. The Committee allocated $24 million from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund for disaster-related audits and investigations. The Senate-reported bill provided $123 million for the DHS OIG, with an additional $24 million from the DRF for investigating corruption. The report recommended additional funding for investigating corruption and criminal conduct at CBP and ICE, as well as completing audits mandated under P.L. 110-53. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $121 million for the OIG in FY2013, a $4 million increase from the previous year. The OIG budget for FY2013 saw a decrease of $23 million from the President's request, but a $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund brought the resources in line with the request. Sequestration reduced OIG budget authority by $7 million. The FY2013 expenditure plan projected gross total resources to be $138 million, $3 million less than FY2012 enacted levels. Both House and Senate bills required the OIG to conduct reviews and provide reports to the Appropriations Committees. The House directed the OIG to report on various matters including expenditure plans, integrity of CBP and ICE officers, DHS expenditures on special events, non-competitive contract awards, and reviews of local law enforcement operations. Additionally, the OIG was tasked with assessing DHS compliance with federal laws and regulations, conducting TSA screening inspections, and evaluating adjudication fraud detection reforms. The OIG was directed to assess TSA screening, adjudication fraud detection reforms by USCIS, and delays in FEMA's public assistance programs. The Senate did not include specific provisions but requested a review of FEMA's application of rules for awarding public assistance funds. This was reiterated in Section 565 of Division D of P.L. 113-6. The House had previously tasked the OIG with various assessments related to DHS expenditures and compliance with federal laws. The House and Senate reports emphasize compliance with language in the explanatory statement, unless specifically negated. No additional funding is allocated for new tasks for the OIG, except for integrity investigations of ICE and CBP officers in P.L. 113-6. The Senate expressed concerns about the OIG's independence and reporting ability. The OIG's current organizational structure hinders its independence and timely reporting of results. GAO is directed to review how the OIG reports its audits and investigations, ensuring compliance with independence standards. The OIG has many senior positions filled by acting officials, potentially impeding its duties. Title II of the DHS appropriations bill includes funding for U.S. Customs and Border. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. The requested amount for FY2013 was $30,759 million, with the House-passed bill proposing $30,946 million and the Senate-reported bill suggesting $30,974 million. After cuts, the final amount provided was $31,267 million. The DHS appropriations bill provides $31,267 million for Title II, a 1.7% increase from the requested level. Sequestration reduced this to $30,184 million for FY2013. Table 8 shows the enacted amounts for individual components, including House-passed and Senate-reported appropriations, and the post-sequester level of available resources. CBP, under P.L. 113-6, is responsible for security at ports of entry, preventing entry of terrorists. Officers inspect people and goods to determine authorization. They enforce over 400 laws to prevent illegal entries, with programs like Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation. Facilitation, risk-based targeting, inspection of travelers and goods at POEs; Border Security and Control, Border Patrol; Air and Marine Interdiction; Automation Modernization, customs and immigration IT systems; Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, Technology; Facilities Management; immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. Funding details for CBP appropriations and FY2012-FY2013 reflect spending cuts compared to FY2012 enacted amounts. The DHS Plan column assesses post-sequester resources provided by P.L. 113-6 as of April 26, 2013, but it does not represent a final funding level as the department may make transfers and reprogramming to mitigate sequestration impacts. The Administration requested $10,345 million for CBP in FY2013, a $190 million increase over FY2012. The Administration requested $10,345 million for CBP in FY2013, a $190 million increase over FY2012. The total budget request included $1,626 million in fees, mandatory spending, and trust funds, for a gross budget request of $11,971 million, which is a $320 million increase from FY2012. Program changes included transferring the US-VISIT program to CBP with a $261.5 million increase and a $31 million increase for the Automated Targeting System. The FY2013 budget for CBP included funding for the operation and maintenance of the Automated Targeting System (ATS), Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison, National Targeting Center, Container Security Initiative, intellectual property rights enforcement, and expansion of CBP's Centers for Excellence and Expertise. There was a decrease in funding for the Office of. Decrease in funding for certain industries to facilitate import process; Decrease in Office of Air and Marine Interdictions budget due to fewer new aircraft acquisitions; Reduction in Air and Marine salaries from fewer air missions; Decrease in management and administration staffing and services; Decrease in fleet acquisition and management expenses. Decrease in funding for various areas including information technology, nonintrusive inspection operations, CBP officer overtime, field support staff salaries, Air and Marine salaries, and training expenses to reduce costs and prioritize essential missions. The House approved $10,172 in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, with decreases in training expenses and transportation program costs. This represented a slight increase from the previous year's appropriation and a decrease from the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, including amendments to add $43,000 to CBP salaries, $10 million to the BSFIT account for communications infrastructure, and a $3 million cut from the BSFIT appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $10,454 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, including amendments to add $43,000 to CBP salaries, $10 million to the BSFIT account for communications infrastructure, and a $3 million cut from the BSFIT appropriation. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provides $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $201 million from last year's appropriation and $12 million from the President's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) allocated $11,872 million in gross budget authority for CBP, a $98 million decrease from the previous year's appropriation and a $222 million increase over the President's request. Sequestration further reduced CBP budget authority by approximately $575 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected total spending for CBP to be $11,298 million, $353 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. Policy issues related to CBP, such as the US-VISIT program and CBP staffing, were discussed during the FY2013 appropriations cycle. The US-VISIT program, CBP staffing, reimbursement authority, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security were mandated by Congress in 1996. The entry-exit system tracks foreign visitors' arrival and departure by collecting biographic information. The US-VISIT program collects biographic and biometric information about foreign visitors for identification purposes. This data is stored in DHS databases and shared with various government agencies to identify potential risks to the United States. The entry-exit system has been operational at U.S. ports of entry since December 2006. The US-VISIT program collects biographic and biometric information about foreign visitors for identification purposes, which is stored in DHS databases and shared with government agencies. DHS regulations require most non-citizens entering the US to provide biometric data, but no data is collected from most passengers exiting through land ports. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system, focusing instead on an enhanced biographic exit program and a U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. The enhanced biographic exit program and integrated U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system involve sharing passenger manifest data with DHS to identify overstays and flag high-priority individuals for investigation. Canadian biometric records of third country nationals entering through land ports are also shared with DHS. The U.S. entry-exit system utilizes Canadian entry data as records of U.S. exits. Congress has called for a comprehensive exit system to be implemented, with the system's organizational structure changing multiple times since its creation in 2003. The U.S. entry-exit system has undergone organizational changes since its creation in 2003. DHS reorganized US-VISIT under different directorates, including BTS and NPPD, before it became a stand-alone office in FY2006. Funding for a proposed Screening Coordination Office (SCO) was never appropriated. The FY2013 budget proposed moving US-VISIT from NPPD to CBP and ICE to improve operational and cost efficiencies. Congress did not fully support the move, with the House bill transferring $73 million to CBP and ICE while leaving $191 million for a new Office of Biometric Identity Management within NPPD. The Senate bill recommended transferring US-VISIT to CBP. The committee recommended transferring US-VISIT to CBP as a stand-alone appropriation, separate from the existing CBP Salaries and Expenses account. The US-VISIT Program was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management under P.L. 113-6. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents, with concerns raised by both chambers about DHS staffing levels. The Senate report warned of adverse consequences if high staffing levels are maintained. The Senate report warned of adverse long-term consequences if DHS maintains high staffing levels during budget tightening by cutting investments in infrastructure. The House report encouraged CBP to consider changes to reduce OFO staffing requirements at POEs, including automation, risk-based targeting, managing staffing surges, exploring partnerships, expanding trusted programs, and relying on technology. The House and Senate reports recommend changes to CBP staffing, including a more specific plan for border patrol agents and OFO staffing at Northern Border ports of entry. CBP is directed to refine its model for forecasting user fee revenues to ensure adequate funds for officer salaries. Some Members may disagree with efforts to reduce CBP staffing. Increased border patrol staffing has grown significantly since FY2005, while staffing at ports of entry has only seen a modest increase. Some argue that heightened enforcement between ports of entry has pushed illegal migrants and drug smugglers to enter through ports of entry. Supporters of increased ports of entry staffing believe it enhances security and facilitates legal admissions more effectively than automated systems. The implementation of sequestration in 2013 by DHS officials warned of potential furloughs, reduced overtime hours, and decreased hiring for frontline CBP personnel. This could result in the equivalent of cuts to over 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 2,750 CBP officers. DHS aims to minimize the impact by eliminating employee performance awards, reducing outside contracts, and limiting administrative expenses. CBP officials plan to reduce overtime, freeze hiring, and potentially implement furloughs to address budget constraints. With a significant portion of the budget allocated to salaries and benefits, frontline staffing may face reduced hours and furloughs. Specific plans had not been announced at the time of the report. The administration is considering public-private partnerships to enhance services at ports of entry, despite restrictions on CBP providing services on a fee-for-service basis. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five public-private partnerships in FY2013. The partnerships in FY2013 allow persons to reimburse CBP for additional services at POEs, new facilities, and expansion at land ports of entry. CBP collects user fees, including COBRA fees, to fund customs services. A portion of COBRA fees reimburses CBP for customs functions like overtime compensation and benefits. Merchandise processing fees are deposited in CBP's Customs User Fee Account for customs revenue functions. Certain passenger fees are also collected for the same purpose. COBRA passenger fees collected without appropriation for customs functions, drawing Congressional interest. Examples include NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 and United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011. Total collection from FY1994-FY1997 was about $639 million. The Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-42) eliminated a passenger fee exemption for travelers from certain countries, resulting in increased COBRA fees. Funds raised were directed to the Customs User Fee Account but have not yet been obligated for customs revenue collection. Some Members of Congress have raised questions about the disposition of these funds. Some Members of Congress have questioned the use of fees raised from the Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011. The House Appropriations Committee directed CBP to explain how it will access and eliminate $639 million identified by GAO. CBP's budget for FY2013 included these fees for officer salaries, but a shortfall occurred as the funds were not made available to CBP in the appropriation bill. The House proposed shifting $70 million from CBP headquarters to address this shortfall. The House proposed addressing a budget shortfall in CBP officer salaries by shifting $70 million from CBP headquarters and increasing fee revenues. P.L. 113-6 appropriated an additional $110 million to cover the shortfall and directed CBP and OMB to include COBRA fees in future budget requests. DHS' strategy for the Southwest Border includes using technology to monitor and detect illegal entries. Since 1998, DHS has tried to develop a network of border cameras, radar, and sensors for surveillance, but initiatives have not met desired levels due to criticism of contracting practices and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced the SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan, focusing on rapid deployment of existing technology for border surveillance. House and Senate reports criticized DHS for delays in implementing new surveillance equipment under the new plan. The Senate report criticized CBP for prematurely calling for proposals to use SBI net technology along the Arizona border, as existing towers had not proven successful. Both chambers recommended fully funding the President's request for the BSFIT account but also recommended rescinding unobligated balances, with the House calling for $40,412,000 in rescissions and the Senate calling for $92,000,000. P.L. 113-6 included $73,232,000 in rescissions. In FY2013, CBP relied on manned and unmanned aircraft for surveillance, with OAM supporting 277 aircraft. The budget included funding for the \"Big Pipe\" project for real-time data transmission. OAM reported a decrease in flight hours from 94,968 in FY2011 to 65,000 in FY2013. CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems as of November 2012. As of November 2012, CBP operated 10 unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for border surveillance, with UAS accounting for 5,737 flight hours in FY2012. Some Members of Congress support UAS use, but concerns exist about privacy threats and cost effectiveness. A May 2012 DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's UAS program for lacking proper planning. The appropriations committees recommended increases to the OAM budget for upgrading the fleet, increasing flight hours, and supporting UAS operations. P.L. 113-6 appropriated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, including a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. CBP's Salaries and Expenses account was shifted to a new sub-account within the Air and Marine account. P.L. 113-6 report language directs CBP to restore overall and UAS flight hours to 2011 levels. CBP is responsible for screening cargo passing through U.S. ports for contraband and dangerous materials. The 9/11 Act established a deadline for DHS to begin excluding cargo that has not been scanned by July 1, 2012. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano extended the 100% scanning deadline in May 2012, raising questions about balancing security benefits with the costs of scanning U.S.-bound cargo. The costs of maintaining scanning technology and personnel for U.S. importers have led to discussions on focusing scanning on high-risk cargo to cut costs and facilitate legal trade. The FY2013 budget included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) for customs inspections abroad. CBP's primary program for customs inspections abroad, including proposed increases to the Automated Targeting System. House and Senate Appropriations Committees support the President's request. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws within the U.S. ICE develops intelligence to reduce illegal entry into the United States, investigate and enforce violations of immigration laws, locate and remove overstayed visa holders and deportable aliens, combat terrorist financing and money laundering, and enforce export laws. See Table 8 for agency-level details. ICE's funding for FY2013 reflects spending cuts compared to FY2012, but does not include additional cuts from sequestration. The Administration requested $5,332 million for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million from FY2012. The Administration requested $5,644 million in gross budget authority for ICE in FY2013, a decrease of $218 million (3.7%) from the FY2012 enacted amount. The budget request included increases for the Alternatives to Detention program, personnel and operations consolidation, video conferencing expansion, and transfer of US-VISIT. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed budget reductions for various programs within ICE, including transferring the overstay analysis function from NPPD to ICE, reducing funding for the 287(g) program, OPLA, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The proposed budget authority for ICE in FY2013 was $5,474 million, a decrease of $77 million from FY2012 and an increase of $142 million from the Administration's request. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed budget reductions for various programs within ICE, including transferring the overstay analysis function from NPPD to ICE, reducing funding for the 287(g) program, OPLA, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The proposed budget authority for ICE in FY2013 was $5,474 million, a decrease of $77 million from FY2012 and an increase of $142 million from the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended ICE receive $5,330 million in net budget authority for FY2013, a decrease from the Administration's request and the FY2012 enacted amount. ICE's funding for FY2013 was $5,642 million, a slight decrease from the Administration's request and a decrease from the previous year. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE, a decrease from last year's appropriation but an increase from the President's request. ICE's FY2013 budget was $5,642 million, slightly lower than the Administration's request and the previous year. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 allocated $5,426 million for ICE, a decrease from the previous year's appropriation but an increase from the President's request. Sequestration further reduced ICE's budget authority by approximately $200 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected total spending for ICE to be $5,442 million, $420 million less than FY2012 levels. ICE faces challenges in allocating resources effectively to fulfill its mission due to the wide range of civil and criminal violations under its jurisdiction. The FY2013 appropriations process involves discussions about ICE's role in detaining and removing aliens, with a focus on the capacity to remove 400,000 aliens a year. There are an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens and 1.9 million criminal aliens in the United States. ICE has the capacity to remove 400,000 aliens a year, sparking debate on how to prioritize removal. H.R. 5855 directs ICE to prioritize removing aliens convicted of crimes, with $1,600 million allocated for this purpose. The Secretary of DHS is to prioritize removal based on the severity of the crime. ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the US. Concerns exist about ERO's detention space, release decisions based on space availability rather than case merits, and varying detention conditions leading to inequities. Detention conditions vary by area, leading to inequities. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention for noncriminal alien detainees, citing lower costs and more proportional treatment. ICE maintained 34,000 detention bed spaces in FY2012, with a budget request for a reduction to 32,800 beds in FY2013. In early 2013, ICE released 2,228 detainees due to operating under a continuing resolution and upcoming reductions. ICE Director John Morton stated that despite funding for 34,000 beds, ICE's daily detention population exceeded 35,000 individuals, including those not required to be detained by law. Critics viewed the release of 2,228 detainees as a political move to pressure Congress to avoid sequestration reductions. P.L. 113-6 mandates ICE to maintain 34,000 detention beds for FY2013 due to the high cost of detaining aliens and the challenge of removing non-detained aliens with final removal orders. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring for non-detained aliens with final removal orders, using tools like electronic monitoring devices and home visits. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million to expand the ATD program. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space and an additional $40 million to expand the ATD program. H.R. 5855 maintained current bed amounts and increased ATD funding by $20 million, while Senate-reported S. 3216 decreased detention space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases ATD funding by $19 million. The Administration also requested $139 million for Secure Communities, a program for information sharing between DHS and the Department of Justice. ICE is expanding the Secure Communities program to identify more removable aliens, including Level 1 offenders. House and Senate appropriators support the expansion and have allocated funds for it. The enforcement of immigration laws by state and local law enforcement agents has sparked debate about their role, training, resources, civil rights violations, and impact on communities. Some argue that the federal government lacks resources for enforcement. The federal government has limited resources for enforcing immigration laws, leading to debates on whether state and local law enforcement should be utilized. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the previous year. ICE plans to discontinue less productive 287(g) task force agreements in favor of the more efficient Secure Communities screening process. The House and Senate debated funding for 287(g) task forces, with differing amounts proposed. The final bill funded the program at $68 million, and ICE established a Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about their operations. The Public Advocate Office was created in response to critiques of ICE operations. Some argue it is not productive and a misuse of resources. P.L. 113-6 prohibits funding for the Public Advocate position within ICE. TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the U.S. and was transferred to DHS in 2002. In 2002, TSA was transferred to DHS from the Department of Transportation under the Homeland Security Act. TSA's duties include safeguarding the aviation system from terrorist threats through passenger and baggage screening, detection systems, and security technologies. TSA also oversees security for marine and land transportation, assessing terrorist risks, issuing regulations, and enforcing them for protection. The TSA is responsible for safeguarding transportation systems, enforcing regulations, and serving as a liaison for security. The TSA budget is complex, with various resources available including airline security fees and funds for screening technology investments. The TSA's budget includes fees for transportation threat assessment and credentialing, not reflected in traditional appropriations. The President's request for TSA's budget included $7,645 million in gross budget authority, offset by $2,515 million in proposed collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million, a 2.5% decrease from FY2012. In FY2012, there was a 7.1% drop in net appropriations for aviation security. The President's request proposed decreases in funding for Surface Transportation Security, reflecting planned reductions in procurement for baggage and passenger checkpoint technologies. The President's request includes reductions in screening technology maintenance costs, the FFDO program, and flight crew training. Funding for TTAC would increase by $68 million, with a one-time increase for infrastructure modernization and adjustments to TWIC fees. The requested funding levels for Transportation Security Support and the Federal Air Marshals Service were decreased in the House-passed H.R. 5855, with a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million for TSA. This represents a $147 million decrease from the gross funding requested. The House-passed bill for aviation security specified $5,041 million in gross budget authority, $57 million less than requested. The House rejected proposed increases in passenger security fees, resulting in a $58 million increase above the Administration's request. Additional cuts were recommended for screening operations, including reductions in screener workforce costs and checked baggage explosives. The House-passed bill included reductions in screener workforce costs and checked baggage explosives detection equipment procurement. It specified funding for surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS, with some amounts below the requested levels to address a budget shortfall. The committee noted reductions in the TSA budget to offset a shortfall caused by proposed security fee increases not yet enacted. The Senate bill allocated $7,633 million for TSA, with $4,919 million as net discretionary appropriation, a decrease from the Administration's request. This included $5,087 million for aviation security, slightly less than requested. The Senate bill allocated $7,633 million for TSA, with $211 million in cuts for aviation security from the Administration's request. This included reductions in checkpoint equipment and explosives detection systems procurement, citing unobligated prior-year balances. Additionally, there was a $8 million reduction in screener staffing. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for various TSA programs, including $24 million for the FFDO program, $12 million above the request. The total gross budget authority for TSA in FY2013 was $7,551 million, $290 million less than the FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration further reduced TSA budget authority by roughly an additional $339 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected gross total spending for TSA in FY2013 to be $7,212 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected gross total spending for TSA in FY2013 to be $7,212 million, $629 million less than FY2012 enacted levels. Passenger security fees under ATSA are set at $2.50 per flight segment, not to exceed $5.00 per one-way trip. The Administration proposed changing the fee structure for TSA passenger security fees in FY2013 to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, doubling the fee on direct flights but not affecting connecting flights. Airlines have raised concerns about fee increases impacting passenger air travel. The Administration estimated that changing TSA passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip would increase revenue by $317 million. $117 million would go towards aviation security costs, and $200 million towards deficit reduction. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the proposal, including a provision for the fee increase. The Senate committee approved using passenger security fees to offset aviation security costs, but lacked jurisdiction to provide permanent authority for the fee increase. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional limitations. Ultimately, P.L. 113-6 did not change passenger security fees. TSA identified over $100 million in savings through improved management efficiencies, including reductions in travel, conferences, and overtime pay. Questions were raised about why inefficiencies were not corrected sooner. Efficiency improvements are crucial for addressing budget sequestration impacts at TSA. Initiatives like PreCheck and modified screening procedures aim to focus resources based on security risk assessments. Trial programs are also in place for screening known flight crew members and elderly passengers. TSA is implementing modified screening procedures for elderly passengers, similar to those for children, to improve efficiency and potentially save costs. The PreCheck program, modeled after CBP programs like Global Entry, is being expanded to include members of trusted traveler programs and frequent flyer programs at select airports. The PreCheck program is being expanded to include members of trusted traveler programs and frequent flyer programs at select airports. The House and Senate committees support the expansion plans and want TSA to report on statistics, passenger satisfaction, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures for PreCheck enrollees. The Senate committee expressed concern about TSA's known crew member pilot program being limited to pilots and proposed expanding it to include flight attendants. TSA's risk-based screening pilot programs have been viewed positively, but its behavioral-based observation and screening of passengers face scrutiny. TSA's proposal to increase Behavior Detection Officers was not supported by the House committee due to a lack of clear evidence. The House committee did not support increasing Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) due to lack of clear evidence of their effectiveness in aviation security. They called for a cost-benefit analysis and a risk-based strategy for BDO deployment. Additionally, TSA was required to provide semiannual briefings on progress in trusted traveler approaches and budgetary constraints. There was also a proposed $13 million reduction in funds for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program at the FY2012 level. The House passed an amendment to increase FFDO funding by an additional $10 million to $36 million, offset by reductions in other areas. The TSA was directed to revisit the use of FFDOs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended maintaining funding for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program, with the Senate recommending $24 million for FFDO and crew member training programs. This reflects a slight decrease compared to FY2012 due to budget constraints. The programs were fully funded at $25 million under P.L. 113-6 but were subject to sequestration cuts. The Coast Guard, as the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, is responsible for securing U.S. ports, waterways, and territorial waters. It also conducts missions like search and rescue, environmental protection, and navigation aids. The President requested $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations for the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard requested $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations, $257 million less than FY2012's enacted amount. This includes $6,791 million in operating expenses and $1,217 million in capital acquisitions. The House and Senate recommended additional funding, with the Senate allocating more due to funding overseas contingency operations directly under the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard requested $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations, $257 million less than FY2012's enacted amount. The largest differences with the President's request had to do with vessel procurement. P.L. 113-6 provided USCG with $10,400 million in total gross budget authority, $68 million more than FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration reduced USCG budget authority by roughly an additional $268 million. The plan projected gross total spending in FY2013 for USCG to be $10,132 million, $200 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. The FY2013 projected funding for USCG is $10,132 million, $200 million less than FY2012 enacted levels. The largest differences in funding recommendations between the President's request and House and Senate bills concerned vessel and aircraft acquisition, with the President requesting $139 million. The President requested $139 million for vessel and aircraft acquisition. The House bill funded four fast response cutters for $224 million, while the Senate bill funded six for $335 million. The House provided $90 million for one long-range fixed wing aircraft and $28 million for two MH-60 helicopters, while the Senate requested $8 million for four Response Boat Medium vessels. The Senate did not request funds for MH-60 helicopters or DOD's budget to be transferred to the Coast Guard. P.L. 113-6 requires a capital investment plan for FY2014-FY2018 to be submitted with the President's budget. DHS's sequestration plan allocates $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, including $646 million for a national security cutter, $319 million for fast response cutters, and $8 million for a new icebreaker. Aircraft funding is reduced from $191 million to $181 million according to the plan. The DHS sequestration plan indicates a reduction in aircraft acquisitions funding from $191 million to $181 million, with $86 million allocated for long-range aircraft. The Coast Guard's fleet modernization has been a key issue for Congress, with the House bill proposing $56 million for housing and aids to navigation, including $31 million for shore facilities backlog. The Coast Guard received $30 million for housing and aids to navigation, reduced to $29 million due to sequestration. The House Appropriations Committee called for implementing card readers for TWIC. The Senate Committee requested a briefing on Coast Guard actions. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a Coast Guard briefing on Interagency Operations Centers at ports following a critical GAO report. The U.S. Secret Service has missions in criminal investigations and protection, including financial crimes and identity theft. The U.S. Secret Service is involved in criminal investigation activities such as financial crimes, identity theft, and computer fraud. They also have a protection mission that includes safeguarding the President, Vice President, their families, and other designated individuals. The U.S. Secret Service is responsible for security at National Special Security Events (NSSE), including major party national conventions and international events in the U.S. The President designates NSSE, giving the USSS authority to coordinate security with other law enforcement agencies. The Administration requested $1,601 million for the USSS in FY2013, a decrease of $66 million from FY2012. The Administration requested $988 million for the USSS in FY2012, with $324 million for its investigation mission and 7,061 FTE for personnel needs. For FY2013, the House-passed DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,613 million, a decrease of $54 million from FY2012 but $12 million more than the Administration's request. The decrease in funding was due to the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season and reduced demand for candidate protection. The reduced demand for major presidential candidate protection led to a decrease in the USSS budget for FY2013. The Senate-reported version of the DHS appropriations bill recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million, reflecting a total decrease of $54 million from the previous year. However, there was an increase in funding for specific programs such as support for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Electronic Crimes Special Agent Program. The Senate recommended an appropriation of $1.611 billion for USSS in FY2013, $56 million less than the previous year. They approved funding for specific programs and noted the Director's actions regarding improper behavior in Colombia. In FY2013, the Secret Service planned to spend $1.527 billion, $84 million less than the appropriated amount in P.L. 113-6 after the sequester. The reduction mainly affected the Service's protection and investigation mission funding. The DHS Plan column in Table 14 details the budget resources available post-sequestration, with potential transfers and reprogramming to offset the impact. The Secret Service planned budget cuts in FY2013 due to sequestration, affecting protection and investigation missions. Congress is concerned about balancing these missions and addressing recent agent misconduct. Congressional action has focused on the protection mission, while maintaining the Service's role in investigating financial crimes. The Secret Service's role in investigating financial crimes, such as combating counterfeiting, has been addressed by Congress, with a focus on the protection mission. There has been an increase in the need for protection activities due to potential terrorist attacks and threats to the President. The Administration requested $5,911 million in appropriations for various agencies under the DHS appropriations bill. The Administration requested $5,911 million for FEMA in FY2013, with the House-passed bill providing $5,930 million and the Senate-reported bill providing $5,971 million. Both versions also included $5,481 million for disaster relief offset by a Budget Control Act adjustment. The FY2013 Disaster Relief Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-6) provided $5,920 million for FEMA, which is 0.2% higher than the requested level and 4.3% above FY2012. It also included $6,400 million for disaster relief offset by a Budget Control Act adjustment. Table 15 shows the enacted amounts for different components in FY2012 and FY2013, as well as post-sequester levels reported by DHS. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes the Office of the Under Secretary for NPPD, Office of Infrastructure Protection, and Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The Administration has proposed transferring the US-VISIT program from NPPD. The Administration has proposed relocating the US-VISIT program from NPPD to other Department locations. The House suggests keeping some functions in a new Office of Biometric Identify Management within the Directorate. The FY2013 Request supports the activities of the Office of the Under Secretary through the Management and Administration Program. The Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS) supports the activities of the Office of Infrastructure Protection and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, with projects focusing on infrastructure protection, cybersecurity, and communications. The Administration's FY2013 budget request for NPPD activities includes $1,217 million, with a decrease in funding compared to FY2012. The Management and Administration budget remains at $50 million, while the IPIS budget sees an increase of $278 million, mainly for securing federal infrastructure. The IPIS budget request for FY2013 includes significant increases for securing federal information systems. This includes a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security and a $116 million increase for Network Security Deployment to support the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS). The NCPS is an intrusion detection system. The NCPS, also known as the EINSTEIN project, is an intrusion detection system using digital signatures developed by the National Security Agency. Additional funding would expand deployment of version 3.0 for active defenses and development of version 2.2 for threat visualization and information sharing across federal agencies. Programmatic increases include $15 million for US-CERT for data analysis and $5 million for MS-ISAC to support state and local governments. The FY2013 request decreased funding in infrastructure protection and communications activities. Infrastructure protection funding was reduced by $40 million (13.7%) below the FY2012 appropriation, with a significant reduction in the budget for the Infrastructure Security Compliance project. This project supports compliance with Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) at covered facilities. The Administration reduced funding for infrastructure protection activities, including compliance with CFATS at covered facilities. The reduction included $16 million for NPPD obligations and $8 million for contract support elimination in incident planning exercises. The House proposed $1,347 million for NPPD, allocating funds for Management and Administration, IPIS, and OBIM. The House proposed $1,110 million for IPIS and $191 million for OBIM. They would have provided $5 million less for Management and Administration due to concerns about TSA fee increases and CBP fee revenues. The reduction in the IPIS request was mainly in the Security Compliance project, with $29 million less allocated. Additionally, $17 million was reduced based on program implementation issues and unobligated funds. The House proposed reductions in funding for various projects, including $29 million less for the Security Compliance project in IPIS. They also reduced funding for the deployment of the NCPS by $17 million, citing concerns about NPPD's ability to use the funds. Other cuts included $3 million in the Global Cybersecurity Management project and $7 million in the Programs to Study and Enhance Telecommunications project. Additionally, the House directed NPPD to collaborate with the Coast Guard on program implementation and consider using private sector security programs for approving security plans under CFATS. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD, with funds directed towards developing security capabilities, including continuous monitoring, for other agencies to use. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,170 million for IPIS, including additional funding for bombing prevention, vulnerability assessments, and the Security Compliance project. They noted the need for funds above the requested amount to implement future plans. However, they proposed $18 million less than requested for the Federal Network Security project to support monitoring capability and other security measures. The Committee recommended withholding $120 million of the $184 million proposed by the Senate for continuing monitoring capability and security measures until NPPD produces an expenditure plan. They also recommended funding above the requested amount for cybersecurity projects, including $17 million for cybersecurity education. The Committee recommended funding increases for cybersecurity projects, including $17 million for cybersecurity education and the Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity and Awareness project. They also highlighted the importance of improving the cybersecurity posture of state, local, territorial, tribal governments. Additionally, the Committee mentioned the first National Cyber Security Review conducted by NPPD to assess cybersecurity capabilities and expressed the expectation for annual reviews to track progress. Increases were also recommended for the Office of Emergency Communications and related projects like the Next Generation Telecommunications project. After recommending funding increases for cybersecurity projects, the Committee allocated $1,439 million for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM in P.L. 113-6, with $50 million for Management and Administration, $1,157 million for the IPIS program, and $232 million for Biometric Identity Management. Post-sequestration, NPPD/IPIS and OBIM would receive $1,337 million according to the FY2013 operating plan, with $48 million for Management and Administration and $1,065 million for the IPIS program. The FY2014 operating plan allocates $48 million for Management and Administration, $1,065 million for IPIS, and $224 million for Biometric Identity Management. Specific items for IPIS include funding for cybersecurity education, CFATS, and the Federal Network. Congress receives an expenditure plan for the Federal Network Security program, allocating $202 million to assist federal agencies in acquiring monitoring equipment and software. Instructions related to CFATS were provided in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, with GAO and the Coast Guard tasked to examine DHS progress. GAO will review CFAT inspections once a sufficient number have been completed to assess inspector training and inspection procedures. The GAO will review how CFAT inspections were conducted, inspector training, and barriers to compliance. NPPD must provide semiannual reports on the compliance program and brief on alternative security programs. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act also requires agencies to submit expenditure plans for cybersecurity improvements and quarterly reports to OMB. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is tasked with providing annual summary reports to Congress on execution reports. Table 16 shows funding levels for FY2012 and FY2013 within the IPIS program. The DHS Plan assesses post-sequester resources, with potential transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration impacts. NPPD identified issues with CFATS compliance program implementation, prompting ongoing reviews and improvements. The Directorate is addressing major problems with implementing the CFATS compliance program and developing ways to mitigate them. Congress is interested in oversight of this issue, especially in the context of cybersecurity, which has been a focus during the 112th Congress.\u8bae\u4f1a\u5bf9CFATS\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u9762\u3002 The Federal Protective Service (FPS), under NPPD, is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel. Legislation expanding DHS's role in safeguarding critical infrastructure may require additional resources. FPS operations focus on security and law enforcement activities to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats. This includes risk assessments, countermeasures like barriers and cameras, law enforcement response, and assistance to federal agencies. FPS is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and provides security for National Special Security Events. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and provides security for National Special Security Events. FPS employs 1,225 law enforcement officers and administers services for 13,000 contract security guards. The President's FY2013 budget request included 1,279 FTEs and $1,302 million for FPS, with funding offset by security fees charged to GSA building tenants. In FY2013, fees were collected for security operations, including building-specific security and Security Work Authorizations. The House-passed H.R. 5855 projected no changes to the FPS budget, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no specific changes but required a briefing on FPS management and budget improvement efforts. P.L. 113-6 did not recommend any changes to the FPS budget. FPS was directed to brief the appropriations committees on their progress in implementing recommendations from a GAO report. Congress is concerned about certain aspects of the FPS mission and its funding. Appropriators are interested in improving training for contract guards, federalizing contract guards, and developing standards for checkpoint detection technologies for explosives. In the 112th Congress, legislation was introduced to enhance federal building security and strengthen the Federal Protective Service (FPS) ability to protect federal facilities. However, none of the proposed bills were enacted. In the 113th Congress, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013 (H.R. 735) has been introduced. The Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013 has been introduced to set staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and create a pilot to expand the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees programs such as the BioWatch program, the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC), and the department's occupational health and safety programs. OHA also coordinates DHS programs with a public health or medical component and received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) received $167 million in FY2012 appropriations and requested $166 million for FY2013. The proposed funding would support 101 FTEs, with allocations for programs such as BioWatch, NBIC, Chemical Defense, Planning and Coordination, and Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill would have provided $132 million for FY2013. The FY2013 budget for the Office of Health Affairs was $167 million in FY2012, with a request for $166 million in FY2013. The Senate-reported bill proposed $168 million for FY2013, slightly more than FY2012 and the President's request. The decrease in funding largely reflected a decrease for the BioWatch program. After across-the-board cuts, the FY2013 budget for the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) was $132 million, $35 million less than FY2012 and $34 million less than the President's request. The reduction in funding mainly affected the BioWatch program. The FY2013 budget for the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) was $132 million, reflecting across-the-board cuts. The House Appropriations Committee noted the separation of DHS activities to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The House Appropriations Committee noted the separation of DHS activities to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction (WMD), directing the Secretary to submit a consolidation plan to merge DNDO and OHA into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate report and House explanatory statement did not carry a parallel directive, but the Senate reiterated the need for coordination of WMD activities. The House Appropriations Committee calls for a comprehensive review of WMD operations, including a potential merger of OHA and DNDO. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, accounts for a significant portion of OHA's budget. The program aims to deploy more advanced sensors. The BioWatch program, aimed at detecting bioterrorism pathogens in U.S. cities, has faced challenges with its Gen-3 sensors. The estimated life cycle cost of Gen-3 is $5.8 billion, raising questions about the justification for such a large investment. Congressional appropriators have shown interest in program performance and have sought to limit funding or call for reviews. The decreased funding for the BioWatch program in FY2013 hinders the development of Gen-3 sensors for the rest of the year. FEMA's main mission is to reduce loss of life and property from all hazards through preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation activities. FEMA executes its mission through various activities, providing incident response, recovery, and mitigation assistance to state and local governments. It also supports disaster preparedness through grant programs. The Administration requested a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528 million for FEMA for FY2013, an increase of $261 million over the previous year. Additionally, an extra $5,481 million was requested for the Disaster Relief Fund. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $4,451 million for FEMA for FY2013, including $23 million added through floor amendments. The Senate-reported S. 3216 also included the requested funding for the Disaster Relief Fund. The Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed a total discretionary appropriation of $4,582 million for FEMA for FY2013, including $55 million more than the President's request and $316 million more than FY2012. The bill also included the requested funding for the Disaster Relief Fund, with a total of $4,351 million provided for FEMA after across-the-board cuts, $84 million more than FY2012 but $177 million less than the President's request. The DRF received $1 million less than requested due to the impacts of the cuts. The bill includes $6,400 for the Disaster Relief Fund under the Stafford Act, funded by the disaster relief cap adjustment. FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions and $6,076 million from the BCA adjustment, before sequestration impacts. These numbers do not reflect the full range of FEMA's appropriated resources. The DRF received a significant infusion of capital from P.L. 113-2, but there is no authoritative statement on post-sequester funding levels. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints. This could have a significant impact as they fund the largest percentage of public safety expenditures. President Obama issued a directive for the Secretary of DHS to develop a national preparedness goal in coordination with various levels of government, informed by specific threats and vulnerabilities. The goal includes measurable objectives to mitigate risks. The national preparedness goal defines core capabilities necessary to prepare for incidents posing the greatest risk to national security, superseding a previous directive after 9/11. The National Preparedness Goal (NPG) was released on October 7, 2011, by the Secretary of DHS under PPD 8. It identified core capabilities and targets for integrated, layered, all-of-nation approach to achieve a secure and resilient Nation. Before 9/11, only three federal grant programs were available for homeland security. Several homeland security grant programs were established to ensure state and local preparedness, including the State Domestic Preparedness Program, Emergency Management Performance Grant, Metropolitan Medical Response System, State Homeland Security Grant Program, Citizen Corps Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, Driver's License Security Grants Program, Operation Stonegarden grant program, and Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program. State and local governments receive federal assistance through various grant programs such as Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Grants, Port Security, Over-the-Road, BZPP, IECGP, and EOC. However, this federal assistance only makes up a small portion of the total spending on public safety by state and local governments, which averages $218. Total expenditures for state and local governments for public safety amount to $218 billion annually, covering police protection, fire protection, corrections, and inspections. Federal grants for preparedness make up less than one percent of these expenditures. The President requested $1.8 billion for state and local homeland security preparedness in FY2013, an increase of $400 million from FY2012, including funding for a National Preparedness Grant Program. The House Appropriations Committee denied the Administration's request to consolidate state and local preparedness grant programs into a National Preparedness Grant Program due to lack of congressional authorization, implementation details, and stakeholder participation. The Senate Appropriations Committee also expressed concerns. The Senate Appropriations Committee and the House expressed concerns about the proposal to consolidate state and local preparedness grants, citing uncertainties about risk assessments, funding allocation, and grant program funding levels. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, rejecting the consolidation proposal and advocating for the continuation of the grant structure enacted in FY2012. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, advocating for the continuation of the grant structure enacted in FY2012 for various security programs. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, including funding for Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, and education/training/exercises. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013, with allocations for State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and non-profit security grants. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, including funding for Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, and education/training/exercises. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013, with allocations for State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and non-profit security grants. Additionally, $1,467 million was provided for state and local programs, with a decrease of 20.3% from the requested level and 8.6% above FY2012. Sequestration further reduced budget authority for FEMA's state and local grants program by roughly an additional $77 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected $1,400 million for state and local programs, $50 million more than FY2012. P.L. 113-6 removed a transfer from grant programs paying FEMA's administrative costs, increasing total grant funding by $132 million. Table 18 shows funding levels for FEMA state and local programs, with the \"DHS Plan\" column outlining post-sequester resources as of April 26, 2013. This column does not represent final funding levels as transfers and reprogramming may occur. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. A percentage of AFG funding may be set aside for grant program administration starting in FY2013. In FY2013, grant administration would be shifted to the SLP Management and Administration office. The Administration requested legislative language to use SAFER grants for maintaining firefighter staffing levels. The House-passed bill funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER grants. The House-passed bill funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER grants into the State and Local Programs account. The Senate-reported bill proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, with $337.5 million each for AFG and SAFER, also rejecting the shift of funds. The Senate bill included SAFER waiver authority language and emphasized consideration of economic hardship by DHS. The Committee expects DHS to consider economic hardship when using waiver authority. P.L. 113-6 allocates $642 million for firefighter assistance, with AFG and SAFER each receiving $321 million. Administrative costs will come from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. DHS retains SAFER waiver authority for FY2013. The DRF funds various emergency and disaster assistance programs. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) provides emergency assistance to states, local governments, nonprofits, and individuals affected by disasters. Despite being funded annually, the account often runs out before the fiscal year ends due to high demand for assistance, partly from ongoing recovery efforts like the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005. Critics argue that reliance on supplemental funding is due to underfunding the DRF, with average regular appropriations between 2005 and 2011 falling short of monthly expenditures. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) through the regular appropriations process for FY2013, a decrease of $1,011 million from the previous year. This request included $608 million for activities not directly tied to major disasters under the Stafford Act. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for FY2013, with $5,481 million allocated for disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act. This reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing these costs to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The FY2013 request was over three times larger than the previous year's request. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills for FY2013 allocated funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) based on FEMA's planned spending for past catastrophic events, with a $500 million reserve. Both bills included a $24 million transfer to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits and investigations on disaster-related spending. The total funding requested for the DRF was adjusted downward by $1,200 million to account for projected recovery of funds not needed for past disasters. Prior to sequestration, P.L. 113-6 allocated $7,007 million to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with $24 million earmarked for audits by the DHS Office of Inspector General. This amount exceeded the Administration's initial request by $918 million. Sequestration later reduced the funding to $6,653 million. The Budget Control Act (BCA) included provisions for an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to prevent sequestration due to exceeding discretionary spending caps. This adjustment provides additional budget authority for federal costs incurred by major disasters declared under the Stafford Act. It is important to distinguish between \"disaster relief\" funding under the BCA and the Disaster Relief Fund. The BCA defines funding for \"disaster relief\" as activities carried out pursuant to a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. While a portion of DRF funding is eligible for the BCA allowable adjustment, the DRF is not wholly \"disaster relief\" by the BCA definition. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the DRF had access to roughly $7.3 billion due to a continuing resolution. The government allocated additional resources for disaster relief in FY2013 through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, due to high demand on the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). Congress approved $11,485 million in extra funding, exceeding the available allowable adjustment for disaster relief. In FY2013, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received all available funding under the Budget Control Act's allowable adjustment for disaster relief. The Administration proposed eliminating the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program, stating it duplicated the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program are both funded by the National Flood Insurance Program. PDM awards grants before disasters, while HMGP does so after. NFIP programs only address flood hazards, while PDM and HMGP cover all hazards. The Administration mentioned $174 million in unobligated balances for PDM to continue grants as it phases out. The PDM program is set to continue awarding grants for several years despite being phased out. Both the House-passed and Senate-reported bills did not include language ending the program, but proposed small amounts of funding, signaling concerns about slow award pace and unobligated balances. Funding levels would be reduced from FY2012, with rescinded funding from unobligated balances, specifically for congressionally directed projects. The DHS operating plan for FY2013 shows that the PDM program has a post-sequester funding amount of nearly $25 million, posing challenges for program administration. With reduced funding, it becomes difficult to fund state minimum awards and conduct a new round of applications. FEMA may use existing, unfunded applications to continue the program cycle. Additionally, the EFS program has seen reduced funding requests, with $100 million requested for FY2013. The EFS program in FY2013 requested $100 million, a $20 million reduction from FY2012. Congress funded it at $120 million in FY2012, with the House proposing the same amount for FY2013 and the Senate suggesting $150 million. The post-sequester funding level for FY2013 is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. The EFS program in FY2013 requested $100 million, a $20 million reduction from FY2012. Concerns arose over delayed distribution of funds during FY2012, with FEMA and the National Board taking nine months to begin distributing assistance. The lowest funding total for the program since FY2000 was allocated in FY2013. The Administration requested $1,561 million for FY2013, a decrease of $229 million from the enacted level. The House-passed bill provides $1,510 million, 3.3% below the request and 13.4% above FY2012. The Senate-reported bill provides $1,535 million, 1.7% below the request and 15.2% above FY2012. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,520 million after cuts, 0.5% below the request and 2.2% above FY2012. The House-passed and Senate-reported appropriations for FY2013 were lower than the Administration's request of $1,561 million. The enacted level in P.L. 113-6 was $1,520 million, with three major activities dominating the work of USCIS. The USCIS receives direct appropriations for processing immigration benefits, funded largely through fee income. The agency was directed to transform its revenue structure with the creation of the Examinations Fee Account. The USCIS receives direct appropriations for specific projects like reducing backlogs and the E-Verify program. Most revenue comes from adjudication fees. The requested budget for FY2013 was $3,005 million, with $143 million from direct appropriations and $2,862 million from fee collections. The direct appropriation includes funding for E-Verify and Immigrant Integration Initiative. The FY2013 budget request for USCIS includes $20 million for the SAVE Program to verify individuals' eligibility for benefits based on immigration status. The remaining $2,862 million is expected to be funded by fee collections, with $2,391 million for adjudication services, $89 million for information services, and $382 million for administration expenses. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a gross budget authority of $3,004 million for USCIS in FY2013. The proposed appropriations for USCIS in FY2013 were $3,004 million, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. The House Appropriations Committee recommended not including funds for the requested pay increase and emphasized monitoring USCIS' fee revenues and obligations. Additionally, the Committee recommended allocating $20 million of user fee revenues for USCIS. The Committee recommended allocating $20 million of USCIS user fee revenues for the SAVE program and at least $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records. They did not provide funding for military naturalizations, directing USCIS to secure funding from the Department of Defense. The Committee expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective measures. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended allocating $20 million of USCIS user fee revenues for the SAVE program and $112 million for the E-Verify program in FY2013. The proposed USCIS budget authority for FY2013 was $2,999 million, with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. This was $26 million less than requested but $14.5 million above the amount provided in FY2012. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program and $5 million for Immigrant Integration grants. They directed that no appropriations be used to operate the Office of Citizenship Services and that its operations continue to be fee-funded. Additionally, they expressed concern about the costs of administering the Immigrant Integration grant program. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provides $114 million for the program, a decrease from the requested level but an increase from the previous year. Sequestration would reduce the funding to $109 million, with potential transfers and reprogrammings affecting different areas. Table 20 shows enacted, requested, and post-sequester funding amounts for USCIS in FY2012 and FY2013. Potential issues for Congress included fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, and the USCIS Transformation program. The House Committee directed USCIS to monitor fee revenues and obligations to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. They also requested quarterly briefings on fee revenues and obligations, including the costs of operations like asylum and refugee processing. Funding for immigrant integration grants remains an ongoing issue. The House Committee directed USCIS to monitor fee revenues and obligations to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting projects. Funding for immigrant integration grants continues to be an issue for Congress. In FY2013, USCIS allocated $7.5 million from the Immigration Examinations Fee Account funds for immigrant integration grants, with an additional $2.5 million in appropriations. None of the funds can be used to provide services to aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residency. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program, questioning the justification for continued investment in the current contract. They directed USCIS to provide regular updates on efforts to deliver the first application form release. The House and Senate Committees are concerned about the operability of the E-Verify program. The House bill extended E-Verify authorization for one year and directed USCIS to create a review process for final non-confirmations. The Senate Committee requested a report on the cost of expanding E-Verify and recommendations for its use in the agricultural industry. The House Committee supports using E-Verify in agriculture but faces challenges like non-office hiring and limited internet access. They aim to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and digitize immigration records to avoid paper processing delays and document loss during shipping. The House Committee directed USCIS to continue converting immigration records to digital format through EDMS and to eliminate the paper version of USCIS Form I-94. They expressed concerns about coordination issues affecting vulnerable individuals in need of resettlement and urged DHS to review refugee processing for streamlining while maintaining security vetting. The Senate Committee encouraged DHS to use its parole authority under Section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to address urgent humanitarian needs, particularly in the interest of family unity and to address medical emergencies following natural disasters. They also urged the Secretary to allocate sufficient resources for future natural disasters. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides basic and advanced law enforcement instruction to federal entities, state and local law enforcement, campus police, Native American tribes, and international agencies to promote consistency and collaboration. FLETC administers training at four sites in the US, offers online training, and conducts training at other locations as needed. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) offers basic and advanced law enforcement training at various locations. The proposed budget for FLETC is $258 million, a reduction of $13 million from the previous year. The budget includes two appropriations - Salaries and Expenses ($229 million) and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses ($29 million). The reduction in the budget is mainly due to efficiencies and a decrease in basic training funding. The House-passed bill proposed a $4 million reduction in basic training funding and deferred construction work, resulting in a decrease in Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses. The bill allocated $256 million for FLETC, $16 million below last year's level and $2 million below the request. Salaries and Expenses would see a cut of less than $1 million, while the Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses appropriation would be reduced by $2 million. The House Appropriations Committee cited the Administration's reliance on unauthorized fee increases to fund parts of its budget. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $258 million for FLETC, matching the President's request. However, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 reduced this to $257 million, $1 million below the request and $14 million below the FY2012 level. Sequestration would further decrease funding to $245 million. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the primary DHS organization for research and development (R&D), with a proposed budget of $831 million for FY2013. It conducts R&D in its own laboratories and funds R&D in DOE national laboratories, industry, universities, and other entities. It also supports acquisitions by other DHS components through testing and technology-related activities. The Administration requested $831 million for the S&T Directorate for FY2013, a 25% increase from FY2012. The request for Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) saw a $212 million (79.9%) increase, with the largest increase in disaster resilience R&D. A $50 million reduction in Laboratory Facilities funding was due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The FY2012 appropriation for NBAF construction was $50 million, one-third of the Administration's request. DHS planned an assessment for the need of NBAF considering threats, costs, safety, and alternatives.

The DHS appropriations bill includes general provisions that may involve transfers and reprogramming to address sequestration impacts. These provisions typically include rescissions of previous funding and special initiatives. The Administration usually requests rescissions in specific accounts rather than in the bill's title. The DHS appropriations bill includes general provisions for FY2013, with the Administration proposing not carrying forward 35 provisions from the FY2012 bill. These provisions include rescissions, one-time provisions, permanent changes in the U.S. Code, and deemed \"restrictive\" by the Administration.

Federal government spending involves a process starting with budget authority enactment by Congress, followed by fund obligation and payment. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress, which may be indefinite or available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. Budget authority can be available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. One-year budget authority must be spent within the fiscal year, while multi-year and no-year budget authority allow for spending over a specified period or indefinitely. Obligations are incurred when federal agencies use funds for personnel, contracts, services, etc., in a fiscal year, while outlays are the actual funds spent during that year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Discretionary and mandatory spending make up the total funds available for spending by a federal agency. Discretionary agencies and programs are funded each year in appropriations acts. The funds available for spending by a federal agency consist of discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts, while mandatory spending is provided in laws other than appropriation acts and is typically not appropriated each year. Within DHS, the Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting funds collected by the federal government are not counted as revenue but as negative outlays, offsetting discretionary spending within DHS's net discretionary budget authority. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. The DHS budget includes permanent appropriations for entitlement programs like Secret Service retirement pay, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the budget contains Trust and Public Enterprise Funds that are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget for calculating gross budget authority. The Office of Management and Budget publishes an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism, including homeland security funding analysis. The analysis has become more refined over the years, with distinctions between homeland and non-homeland security activities becoming more precise. Comparisons between years may not be strictly comparable due to these distinctions. The Office of Management and Budget's annual report to Congress on combating terrorism includes a refined analysis of homeland security funding. While comparisons between years may not be strictly comparable due to increasing specificity, it is important to note that DHS funding does not encompass all federal spending on homeland security. In FY2012, DHS accounted for 52% of total federal funding, followed by the Department of Defense at 26%, Department of Health and Human Services at 6%, and Department of Justice at nearly 6%. The top five agencies in spending on homeland security in FY2012 were Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, Department of State, and Department of Homeland Security. These agencies collectively accounted for 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. It is important to note that not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security-related. The total budget authority for DHS was $52.5 billion, with $35.1 billion specifically allocated for homeland security activities. The total budget authority for DHS in FY2012 was $52.5 billion, with $35.1 billion allocated for homeland security activities. The budget amounts shown in the report may not align with total amounts elsewhere due to inconsistencies. No authoritative data for FY2013 is available yet due to the impact of sequestration and P.L. 113-6."
