    "content": "The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents, providing over $40 billion in benefits annually. Approximately 8.2 million individuals are covered by FEHB each year, with 85% of federal employees and 90% of retirees participating. Coverage options include individual, family, and self plus one plans. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents. Coverage options include self plus one coverage for themselves and one eligible family member. Health benefits plans are typically fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs), with premiums shared between the federal government and the employee or retiree. All FEHB plans must cover basic services like hospital and physician care, with varying cost sharing through deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance. Prior to FEHB's establishment in 1959, federal employees could not obtain health insurance through the government. Prior to 1959, federal employees could not obtain health insurance through the government. By 1950, private sector employers started offering health insurance and paying a portion of their employees' premiums. In 1951, President Truman's Commission recommended the federal government offer health insurance for its employees. Congress passed the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act after debate on the matter. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA; P.L. 86-382) established eligibility parameters, health plan options, benefits, and government premium share. It created an Employees Health Benefits Fund, outlined OPM's role, and allows OPM to contract with insurers and manage FEHB. FEHBA has been amended multiple times since its enactment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) has been amended multiple times since its passage. The general model of FEHB, where enrollees choose coverage from private insurers, remains unchanged. Employees and retirees share premium costs with the government, with access to the same plans at the same cost. Changes include adjustments to the government's share of premiums and expansions in eligibility, services, and benefits. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) has undergone multiple amendments since its inception. Congress plays a role in modifying the FEHB program, which allows enrollees to choose coverage from competing insurers with minimal intervention from OPM. The program serves as a model for both private and public health insurance programs and has been successful in providing cost-conscious choices for enrollees. Researchers have explored exporting aspects of the successful FEHB model to other health care programs like Medicare, expanding access to FEHB for non-federal workers, and creating new programs based on FEHB for small business employees or the uninsured. Some policymakers have introduced legislation to expand FEHB eligibility or create new programs. The FEHB model has also been considered as a good model for state-level health insurance exchanges. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program is seen as a model for state-level health insurance exchanges. Congressional policymakers have a financial interest in FEHB's viability and sustainability, as the federal government contributes to its costs. Congress also has legislative authority over the program. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program has always shared costs with Congress having the authority to restructure it. This report explains the program's evolution, Congress's past interactions, and changes made such as conditioning federal funds on policy changes, adjusting the government's share of premiums, modifying eligibility, and implementing policies affecting the program. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program has evolved over time with Congress having the authority to make changes. Congress can place conditions on federal funds to modify the program, such as prohibiting the use of funds for certain purposes like covering abortions. The provision prohibiting the use of funds for abortions was reinstated by the 103rd Congress, with exceptions for cases of danger to the woman's life, rape, or incest. Government's share of FEHB premiums has increased over the years, starting at 50% and later changing with the creation of the \"big six\" formula in 1971. The \"big six\" formula for setting the government's share of FEHB premiums was created in 1971, with the government contributing 40% initially and increasing to 50% in 1974. In 1997, the Balanced Budget Act introduced the current formula where the government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not exceeding 75% of any one plan's premium. Since its enactment, eligibility for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) has been extended to more categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members. In 1978, part-time employees were included, and in 1988, certain temporary workers became eligible. In 1988, FEHB coverage was extended to certain temporary workers and Congress authorized temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) for separating employees. TCC enrollees must pay the entire FEHB premium and a 2% administrative fee. TCC is generally available for up to 18 months, with exceptions like 36 months for children aging out of their parents' plans. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program was established five years before Medicare. Initially, there was little interaction between the programs due to federal employees not being eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment. In 1982, Congress passed a law that allowed federal workers to be eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment by applying Medicare's Hospital Insurance tax to federal employment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program was established in 1959 under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (P.L. 86-382). It set the parameters for eligibility, benefits, premium shares, and the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Eligible participants included current federal employees and retirees who retired after July 1, 1960. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB) was established in 1959 under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act. Eligible participants included current federal employees and retirees who retired after July 1, 1960. Retirees needed at least 12 years of service or a disability to qualify for an immediate annuity. They also had to be enrolled in an FEHB plan for at least five years prior to retirement or at the earliest opportunity. Family members of employees and retirees were also eligible. OPM could contract or approve different types of health benefit plans for FEHB participation. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB) offers two levels of benefits: Employee Organization Plans for members of employee organizations and Comprehensive Medical Plans, which include group-practice and individual-practice prepayment plans for health benefits. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB) offers health services on a prepaid basis through group or individual-practice prepayment plans. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans was 50% of the lowest rate charged by a carrier for service benefit and indemnity plans. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans varied based on coverage type, ranging from $1.75 to $4.25 biweekly for employees and retirees. For those enrolled in employee organization or comprehensive medical plans, the government's share was 50% of the premium if below $2.50 for individual coverage and $6.00 for family coverage. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans varied based on coverage type, ranging from $1.75 to $4.25 biweekly for employees and retirees. Postal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1960 (P.L. 86-568) authorized FEHB coverage for employees of county committees under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act and their dependents. To Amend the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 88-59) extended the deadline for applications from qualified employees. The deadline for applications to participate in FEHB was extended from December 31, 1959, to December 31, 1963, by P.L. 88-284. The act also removed the requirement for employee organizations to have offered health care benefits before applying for FEHB coverage. P.L. 88-284, enacted on March 17, 1964, expanded FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. It allowed retirees to maintain FEHB coverage if enrolled by December 31, 1964. OPM was granted authority to terminate contracts with carriers not meeting enrollment requirements. Premium shares were made equal for all enrollees, regardless of gender. The act changed the government's share of premiums for employee organization plans and comprehensive medical plans, making the share equal for all enrollees regardless of gender. It also authorized FEHB coverage for certain United States commissioners. P.L. 88-531 authorized FEHB coverage for certain United States commissioners and their dependents if the Civil Service Retirement Act applies to them. P.L. 88-631 authorized FEHB coverage for teachers in the District of Columbia with at least two school years of temporary employment. P.L. 89-379 extended FEHB coverage to congressional employees with certain staff fellowships. P.L. 89-504 amended FEHB to adjust government contributions. P.L. 89-504, enacted on July 18, 1966, amended FEHB by changing the government share of premiums to $1.62 for individual enrollment and $3.94 for family enrollment. The coverage for dependent children was extended to age 22, and employees on leave without pay could maintain coverage. P.L. 90-486, August 13, 1968 converted National Guard technicians to federal employee status, making them eligible for FEHB coverage. P.L. 90-578, October 17, 1968 authorized FEHB coverage for full-time United States magistrates. P.L. 91-175, December 30, 1969 granted federal employees the option to continue FEHB during transfer to an international organization. P.L. 91-418, September 25, 1970 increased the federal government's contribution to health benefits insurance. P.L. 91-418, enacted on September 25, 1970, changed how the government's share of health insurance premiums was determined by introducing the \"big six\" formula. This formula calculated the average premiums of six benefit plans to adjust the government's contribution to reflect medical price inflation. The Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-648) extended FEHB coverage to noncitizen employees in the Panama Canal Zone and allowed family members of deceased employees with less than five years of service to continue enrollment. The Personnel Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-648) extended FEHB coverage to federal employees assigned to state or local governments, allowing them to maintain eligibility and coverage. It also provided coverage to state or local government employees assigned to an executive agency. Additionally, the Act extended FEHB coverage to U.S. nationals employed by the federal government under P.L. 93-160 in 1973. P.L. 93-160 extended FEHB coverage to eligible U.S. nationals employed by the federal government at duty stations outside the U.S. and Panama Canal Zone. P.L. 93-246 increased the government's share of FEHB plan premium from 40% to 50% in 1974, with a provision to increase to 60% in 1975. The Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHB) was expanded in P.L. 93-363 to provide direct access to licensed clinical psychologists and optometrists without prior referral. The government's share of premium was capped at 75% and plans had to comply with OPM decisions on health benefit entitlement. The amendments in P.L. 94-310 granted FEHB enrollees direct access to optometrists or clinical psychologists without supervision or referral. Enrollees were entitled to payment or reimbursement for services rendered. To amend Title 5, United States Code to restore health benefits coverage for certain individuals whose survivor annuities are restored under P.L. 94-342. This allows surviving spouses covered by FEHB to reenroll if their annuity was terminated due to remarriage and later restored. Additionally, to establish uniformity in Federal Employee Health Benefits and coverage by preempting certain state or local regulations. P.L. 95-368, enacted on September 17, 1978, established uniformity in benefits and coverage under FEHB by preempting certain state and local laws inconsistent with FEHB contracts. It provided protections to medically underserved populations and required insurance carriers to pay for health practitioners licensed by a state to provide covered services from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 1984. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) allowed part-time career employees and their dependents to access FEHB coverage for licensed health practitioners serving medically underserved populations. Employee organizations could apply to sponsor a health benefit plan between December 31, 1978, and January 1, 1980. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) allowed part-time career employees to access FEHB coverage for licensed health practitioners serving medically underserved populations. P.L. 95-583 reduced the creditable service required for retirement FEHB coverage from 12 years to 5 years. The requirement for employees to continue FEHB into retirement is to be enrolled in an FEHB plan for at least five years prior to retirement or enroll at the earliest opportunity. Amendments in P.L. 96-54 redefined employee for FEHB coverage, excluding United States commissioners. P.L. 96-70 redefined employee eligibility to exclude non-citizens. The amendments in P.L. 96-179 redefined the term employee for FEHB eligibility, excluding non-citizens and individuals with permanent duty stations outside the United States, unless they were employees at specific agencies in the Panama Canal Zone. The changes also eliminated the \"lives with\" requirement for natural children to be covered by FEHB. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248) eliminated the \"lives with\" requirement for natural children to be covered by FEHB and added a dependency requirement for all children to be covered. It also redefined the term medically underserved population for making benefit payments under FEHB. Effective January 1, 1983, federal employees were required to pay the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax under this act. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248) changed FEHB coverage requirements for natural children and added a dependency requirement for all children. It also redefined medically underserved populations for FEHB benefit payments. Federal employees were required to pay the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax starting January 1, 1983. The subsequent amendment in P.L. 97-346 allowed federal employees to qualify for premium-free Part A based on previous private sector employment and made Medicare payments secondary for employees aged 65 to 69 covered under certain employer group health plans. The amendments in P.L. 97-346 required OPM to determine the difference in government's health plan premiums for 1983 and pay the difference into contingency reserves of all FEHB plans. P.L. 98-151 prohibited funds from being used for abortions or administrative expenses. The Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-615) extended FEHB coverage to former spouses of federal employees. This marked the first time an abortion-related provision was applied to FEHB in an appropriations bill. The Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 extended FEHB coverage to former spouses of federal employees, with the former spouse responsible for both the employee's and government's premium shares. P.L. 99-53 authorized additional employee organization plans in FEHB if applied within 90 days of enactment. The Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-251) allowed a new mixed model prepayment plan to participate in FEHB, combining group practice and individual practice prepayment plans. It also specified conditions for plan approval and allowed certain disability annuitants reemployed to enroll in FEHB if previously enrolled. The Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-251) expanded the types of medical plans under FEHB, removed the requirement for group practice prepayment plans to include physicians from three specialties, mandated studies on extending FEHB contracting to additional health practitioners, and allowed contracting authority for clinical social workers with referral requirements. The Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-251) expanded FEHB coverage and allowed OPM to waive service requirements for retirement coverage in exceptional circumstances. It also provided a three-week period for enrollees to change or cancel their enrollment in certain situations. Beginning October 1, 1986, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 required USPS to pay the government's share of the health plan premium for postal employees. Reserves held by carriers in excess of minimum levels were to be returned to the Employees Health Benefits Fund as prescribed by OPM.

The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-360) included provisions affecting FEHB, later repealed by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-234). It would have required OPM to reduce rates for Medicare-eligible retirees in FEHB. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 required OPM to report to Congress on changes needed for health benefit plans for Medicare-eligible individuals under FEHB. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) authorized OPM to impose debarment and sanctions on health care providers convicted of illegal activities, including financial misconduct, patient neglect or abuse, drug-related offenses, and interference with criminal investigations. It also set time limits for OPM to initiate debarment proceedings and prohibited providers without a valid license from participating in FEHB. OPM was also given the authority to impose fines on providers for making false claims.

It also created Temporary Continuation of FEHB Coverage (TCC) for separating employees to maintain coverage for up to 18 months by paying full premiums. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1988 (P.L. 100-679) extended health benefits coverage to certain federal employees, including those on the office staff of former Presidents or Vice Presidents. P.L. 101-76 adjusted the big six formula in response to Aetna's withdrawal from FEHB. For plan years 1990 and 1991, the government's share of FEHB plans would be calculated by adjusting the Aetna high option premium from the previous year. These provisions would not apply if comprehensive reform legislation is enacted that amends FEHB financing provisions. OPM must transmit recommendations to Congress for comprehensive FEHB reform within 180 days of enactment. P.L. 101-239 required USPS to pay FEHB premiums for survivors of postal employees who retired on or after October 1, 1986. P.L. 101-246 authorized FEHB coverage for former spouses of Foreign Service employees.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (P.L. 102-484) prevented changes to FEHB that would impact Medicare beneficiaries, including not requiring retired FEHB enrollees eligible for Medicare to pay out-of-pocket differences and maintaining the waiver of coinsurance for prescription drugs. These changes were intended for plan year 1993 but were not implemented due to the act. P.L. 102-484 allowed for the continuation of FEHB benefits for individuals involuntarily separated from the Department of Defense due to a reduction in force. The act limited the individual's payments to the employee's share of premiums, with the agency covering the remaining portion. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) required most FEHB plans to apply Medicare Part B limitations on payments for physician services to benefits provided to retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older who do not participate in Medicare Part B. It also required physicians and suppliers who accept Medicare payments. The Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-123) required physicians and suppliers accepting Medicare payments to accept equivalent payment and cost sharing from FEHB. Nonparticipating providers in Medicare cannot charge more than the limiting charge. The act also extended and modified the restructured big six formula until 1998. Government Appropriations Act, 1994 (P.L. 103-123) was the first appropriations act since fiscal year 1984 that did not include a provision restricting funding for abortion coverage in FEHB plans.

The act also required a report to be written by the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of HHS and the Director of OPM, for the establishment of a demonstration program allowing certain beneficiaries of Department of Defense health programs entitled to Medicare Part A to enroll in a health plan offered through FEHB. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) modified the formula for determining the government's share of FEHB premiums, requiring OPM to calculate the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB annually. The biweekly government share of an FEHB plan for an employee or retiree is 72% of the weighted average premium. The government's share of an FEHB plan is 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, with a cap of 75% set by P.L. 105-33. Additionally, individuals enrolled in FEHB cannot enroll in a Medicare MSA plan until OPM certifies no increased expenditures for the federal government. The Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (P.L. 105-261) directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct a demonstration project with OPM allowing certain individuals eligible for Department of Defense health benefits to enroll voluntarily in health plans offered through FEHB. The project ran for three contract years under FEHB, with eligible beneficiaries enrolling during an open enrollment period for the year 2000, and ending on December 31, 2002. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) made administrative changes to FEHB, including debarment of fraudulent health care providers and modifying the definition of a carrier.

The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 modified the definition of a carrier under FEHB and allowed government-wide plans to be underwritten by participating affiliates. It also revised preemption provisions to ensure FEHB contract terms supersede any state or local laws related to health insurance. OPM is required to encourage carriers to enter into contractual arrangements. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 established rules for readmission of plans in FEHB and required plans to provide direct access to certain licensed providers for enrollees. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 allowed FEHB plans to provide direct access, direct payment, and reimbursement to licensed health care providers not specified in statute. Individuals from FDIC and Federal Reserve health plans could enroll in FEHB plans when their plans terminated. The District of Columbia Courts and Justice Technical Corrections Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-274) treated Public Defender Service employees as federal employees for health insurance eligibility under FEHB. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (P.L. 105-277) required all FEHB plans to cover contraceptives, with exceptions for certain plans based on religious objections. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (P.L. 106-65) required the Secretary of Defense to compare the case management program of the Department of Defense with the coverage offered by at least 10 FEHB plans, including a report on TRICARE and FEHB health care coverage. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (P.L. 106-117) changed how TCC works for certain individuals who are involuntarily separated from a position in the Department of Veteran Affairs. It allowed them to continue coverage under FEHB and be liable for no more than the employee's share of premiums. The comparison must include cost-sharing requirements, overall costs, covered benefits, and exclusions from coverage. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Children's Equity Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-394) mandates that employees must provide health insurance coverage for dependent children under FEHB if they cannot show other coverage. If no longer enrolled, the federal agency must enroll them in a family plan with lower coverage. The National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2001 (P.L. 106-398) directs federal agencies to enroll employees in family coverage if they fail to provide documentation of other coverage for their children. Employees with individual coverage can switch to family coverage. The National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2001 (P.L. 106-398) directed a study comparing Department of Defense health programs with Medicare and FEHB plans for therapies. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2001 (P.L. 106-522) allowed certain DC employees to be treated as federal employees for FEHB eligibility.

The act also directed a study on the health needs of reserve components of the Armed Forces and National Guard. P.L. 107-304 allowed beneficiaries of an OPIC-administered health benefits plan to obtain FEHB coverage when the OPIC plans terminate. Any prior enrollment in an OPIC plan is considered enrollment in FEHB. The State Justice Institute Reauthorization Act of 2004 extended FEHB coverage to employees who started after October 1, 1988. The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 allowed for temporary continuation of FEHB coverage for federal employees called to active duty for more than 30 days. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (P.L. 108-487) authorized the Director of the CIA to protect intelligence operations and identities. This included the establishment of a nonofficial cover for certain actions. The Director of the CIA can establish a nonofficial cover employee health insurance program for designated employees and their families. Employees in this program cannot participate in FEHB simultaneously but can switch to FEHB coverage as approved by the Director. The P.L. 110-74 allowed unmarried, dependent children under 25 who are full-time students to have health insurance coverage under FEHB. P.L. 110-279 authorized federal benefits, including FEHB, for certain Senate restaurant employees after operations are contracted out. P.L. 110-422 specified TCC requirements for NASA employees due to Space program termination. The termination of the Space Shuttle Program led to NASA employees facing involuntary separation, declination of reassignment, or voluntary separation. The act ensures that employees receiving TCC under FEHB are only liable for their share of the health benefits premium, with NASA covering the remaining share. This requirement applies to individuals separated on or after the enactment of this section. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) contains provisions that apply to health insurance coverage, including FEHB plans. OPM has provided guidance to FEHB plans on implementing ACA provisions, some of which impose new requirements on the plans. OPM has expanded provisions in the ACA for FEHB plans, such as allowing adult children up to age 26 to remain on their parent's health insurance plan. This provision took effect in January 2011, extending dependent coverage and providing TCC for three years when the child ages out at 26. Disabled children can also remain on their parent's plan if the disability occurred before age 26. The ACA allows adult children up to age 26 to remain on their parent's health insurance plan, with disabled children able to stay on indefinitely if the disability occurred before age 26. Plans must offer certain preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs, but cost sharing may apply if beneficiaries use out-of-network providers. The ACA required plans to provide a summary of benefits and coverage (SBC) and a glossary of terms to help consumers understand health insurance terms. Plans were also prohibited from imposing lifetime limits on certain health benefits. The ACA required plans to establish restricted annual limits on the dollar value of benefits before January 1, 2014, when annual limits were prohibited. FEHB plans were expected to eliminate lifetime limits on specified benefits starting in 2013 and comply with coverage requirements for clinical trials. The ACA required plans to establish restricted annual limits on benefits before 2014, with a prohibition on annual limits after that. FEHB plans were to eliminate lifetime limits on specified benefits in 2013 and comply with clinical trial coverage requirements. The ACA also mandated reporting of a medical loss ratio and required large group plans, including FEHB plans, to provide annual rebates to enrollees based on this ratio starting in 2011. The ACA mandated that large group plans, including FEHB plans, provide annual rebates to enrollees if the premium revenue spent on clinical claims and health quality costs is less than 85%. Carriers must issue rebates directly to OPM, which are deposited into the health plan's contingency reserve to reduce the following year's premiums. The act also modified the definition of qualified medical expenses affecting FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs. The ACA made changes to tax-advantaged accounts like HSAs and HRAs, restricting coverage of OTC medicines without a prescription except for insulin. It also increased the penalty for nonqualified HSA withdrawals for those under 65 and lowered the maximum annual contributions to HCFSA under FEHB from $5,000 to $2,500 since 2013. Since May 1, 2012, eligible Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations can purchase FEHB for their tribal employees, with the tribe or tribal organization covering the government's share of the premium. The coverage is only available for employees, not retirees, and imposes administrative requirements on employers affecting federal agencies. The Affordable Care Act required employers to provide the cost of employer-sponsored coverage on an employee's W-2 after December 31, 2010. In 2014, insurers, employers, and government agencies had to report individual coverage details to the Secretary of HHS. The requirement was delayed until 2015. Members of Congress and certain staff have limited health plan options under the act. Beginning January 1, 2014, Members of Congress and designated staff could no longer purchase FEHB plans as active employees but could enroll in a health plan through a SHOP exchange with an employer contribution. Upon retirement, they are allowed to enroll in an FEHB plan. For more details, refer to CRS Report R43194. The ACA includes provisions to raise revenues impacting FEHB plans, such as annual fees on health insurance plans based on market share, PCORI fees on insurers, and a 40% excise tax on coverage exceeding certain thresholds starting in 2018. The ACA includes a 40% excise tax on health insurance coverage exceeding $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage, including premiums for health, dental, and vision coverage, and payments towards health-related accounts. In 2018, insurance coverage exceeding $10,200 (or $27,500 for a family) will be subject to a 40% excise tax. The ACA mandates the Director of OPM to contract with health insurance issuers to offer at least two multistate plans (MSPs) through each exchange in each state. MSPs will provide individual or group coverage, with separate risk pools from FEHB. The Director cannot reduce resources for FEHB while administering MSPs. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-67) allows FEHB enrollees to choose \"self plus one\" coverage in addition to individual and family coverage. The government determines the premiums for self plus one coverage in the same way as for individual and family coverage. OPM determines premiums for self plus one coverage in FEHB by finding the weighted average premium of all plans and paying either 72% of this average or 75% of any given plan's premium, whichever is smaller. For the first year of the self plus one option, OPM will calculate the weighted average premium based on actuarial analysis."
