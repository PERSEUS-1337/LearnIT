    "content": "The cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana are prohibited under federal law, but several states have legalized medical and recreational use. On January 1, 2014, Colorado legalized commercial sales of recreational marijuana for individuals 21 and older, becoming the first jurisdiction in the world to do so. Washington followed on July 7, 2014, and Alaska and Oregon approved ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana on November 4, 2014. District of Columbia also approved measures to legalize cultivation, possession, and exchange of marijuana on the same day. There has been a shift in popular sentiment towards marijuana policy, with polls showing a majority of Americans favoring legalization. This has sparked debate at the federal level, with bills introduced in Congress to remove marijuana from Schedule I drugs and impose a federal excise tax on its production. Another bill suggests creating a National Commission on Federal marijuana policy. The debate on marijuana legalization includes proposals for a National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy and the potential revenue from taxing marijuana. This report focuses on the economic aspect of legalizing marijuana, specifically on imposing an excise tax. It discusses arguments for taxes and provides an overview of marijuana production. Marijuana is a preparation of the plant Cannabis sativa, primarily used for its psychoactive effects. The main psychoactive ingredient is THC, which is responsible for the \"high\" users experience. Various cannabinoid compounds in marijuana contribute to its effects. Consumers may seek different marijuana strains based on the varying cannabinoid compounds present, such as cannabidiol (CBD) for anxiety relief. The potency of marijuana products can vary depending on preparation and relative concentration. Stalks and stems have minimal psychoactive content, while leaves and flowers contain increasing levels of THC. The leaves and flowers of marijuana plants have increasing concentrations of THC, with the highest levels found in the resin-coated trichomes on the buds. Female plants grown without pollination from male plants can produce buds with higher resin content, known as sinsemilla, containing 10%-18% THC. Marijuana consumption methods vary. Marijuana is consumed by smoking the dried plant matter in various forms like joints or blunts. A typical joint contains less than half a gram of marijuana, with each hit containing approximately one-twentieth of a gram. Other devices like glass pipes and vaporizers are also used for consumption. Cannabis can be processed into various products with different THC levels and consumption methods, such as hashish with over 40% THC content and edibles made by dissolving THC in fats, oils, or alcohol. Excise taxes are discussed as potentially distorting prices of commodities. The section discusses reasons for imposing an excise tax on marijuana, including reflecting external costs, discouraging use, preventing price falls too rapidly, funding programs, and raising revenue. Economic efficiency is achieved when the price equals costs, and if marijuana consumption imposes costs on others, a tax could restore economic efficiency. This rationale has been used for alcohol and tobacco as well. The economic analysis suggests that external costs should be separated from the costs borne by the user. For instance, if a substance causes early death, the individual bears the costs of treating illness, while society bears the loss of tax revenue and some healthcare costs. Society also gains from the early death in the form of reduced future health costs and transfer payments. These external costs are typically significant in studies of other substances. The external costs of alcohol and tobacco were estimated to be $30 billion in a 1991 study. Similar estimates for marijuana do not exist, but it is believed that the external costs are smaller than the total costs. No U.S. study on marijuana of this nature could be found, but it is possible to estimate the necessary tax to correct for externalities by examining other studies. A British study compared the harm of alcohol and cannabis, with alcohol ranking 72 and cannabis ranking 20. When considering only external harm, alcohol ranked 47 and cannabis ranked 9. A Canadian study found health costs per user for cannabis to be about 12%. Evidence suggests that marijuana has lower non-health costs compared to alcohol, especially in terms of impaired driving ability. The Canadian study found that marijuana impairs driving ability less than alcohol and is inversely related to domestic violence. Enforcement costs for marijuana are higher due to its illicit status. Marijuana has smaller externalities per user compared to alcohol, with lower prevalence of use according to NSDUH data. Based on NSDUH data, marijuana usage is 19% (past year) and 14% (past month) as common as alcohol. External costs of marijuana range from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion, requiring a tax per ounce estimate based on market size and price. White House ONDCP report provides data on marijuana unit price, total expenditure, and consumption weight in the US. The ONDCP report extrapolates data from the NSDUH and ADAM surveys to estimate a 40% increase in marijuana consumption in the US from 2002 to 2010. Total expenditures on marijuana in 2010 are estimated to be between $30 billion and $60 billion, with increasing THC levels in marijuana during that period. The White House's 2014 ONDCP report estimates the price per gram of marijuana from 2000 to 2010, showing a constant nominal price but likely decreasing inflation-adjusted price over time. In 2010, the price per gram was $7.11 ($199.08 per ounce). Anecdotal prices from underground sources also provide insight into the market. Using data from priceofweed.com, the price of marijuana can be estimated as $317 per ounce, after weighting the observations for quality. However, the representativeness of the data submitted to the website is unclear. High-quality marijuana can be obtained in some areas for $28 per eighth of an ounce ($224 per ounce). Consumers may have to pay at least $10 per gram, or $238 per ounce. Tax rates range from 0.8% to 5.3% of the price, with estimates of external cost ranging from $1.60 to $16.80 per ounce. In a legal market, prices would be lower. The tax on a joint could range from $0.30 to $0.05, similar to the tax on a six-pack of beer. The tax on marijuana would be similar to the tax on a six-pack of beer, with states likely imposing additional taxes. These state taxes may already exceed the external costs of marijuana. Imposing a tax could also serve to discourage marijuana use due to underestimation of long-term health costs and potential dependence. Some argue that marijuana use can lead to long-term health costs and dependence, especially among underage users. Studies show that around 9% of marijuana users become dependent, and medical marijuana laws in the US increase the likelihood of abuse or dependency by 15%-27% in adults. More research is needed to better understand the risks of marijuana addiction. Economists debate whether user behavior is suboptimal in terms of addiction. Some economists argue that user behavior regarding addiction is debated, with theories like \"rational addiction\" suggesting informed choices and others pointing to hyperbolic discounting. The impact of a tax intended to benefit users must also consider the reduction in income. Researchers estimate that heavy users, constituting 20% of marijuana users, consume 80% of the marijuana in the US. A tax on marijuana, similar to alcohol and tobacco taxes, would primarily affect heavy users, making it regressive. Despite this, current users may benefit from lower prices if marijuana is legalized. Imposing taxes to discourage consumption depends on how users respond to price changes, expressed as elasticities by economists. A low price elasticity means the tax has little effect on behavior but imposes a significant burden on users. Gallet (2014) analyzed 42 studies on illicit drug demand, including 13 on marijuana price elasticity. The model predicts a demand elasticity range of -0.15 to -0.31, indicating a small decrease in demand with a 1% price increase. Users may be harmed by a tax meant to benefit them due to the low responsiveness of consumer demand to price changes. Users may be harmed by a tax imposed for their own benefit, as gains from moving to optimal consumption may be offset by lost income. Government policies aim to limit drug use by minors, with marijuana legalization laws prohibiting purchases by those under 21. However, minors can still obtain drugs through various means, with estimates showing higher price elasticity for youth. Taxes could be more effective in reducing youth usage. The policy question revolves around determining the appropriate tax burden on non-responsive adult users to limit youth consumption of marijuana. Setting the tax at a level that prevents a significant drop in marijuana prices post-legalization, especially among minors who are more price-sensitive, is crucial. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced costs of evading law enforcement. This may necessitate a tax to prevent prices from falling too low, especially to deter youth consumption. The tax level may need to be adjusted based on the consequences of a legal market. Many current producers operate on a small scale without economies of scale. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced costs of evading law enforcement. This may necessitate a tax to prevent prices from falling too low. Many current producers operate on a small scale without economies of scale, leading to higher compensation for workers in the illicit trade of marijuana compared to other industries. In a competitive market, prices would fall to reflect lower production costs. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced costs of evading law enforcement. Prices would fall to reflect lower production costs, providing a range for a federal tax rate to be considered. The tax should not be set too high to avoid encouraging illicit productions, aiming to offset only part of the price reduction from legalization. Caulkins estimates that the production cost of high-quality marijuana per pound is equivalent to the current retail price per ounce. Outdoor production costs less but may have lower THC levels. Processing costs add $20 to $35 per pound. Greenhouse production costs around $215 plus processing costs, totaling around $15 per ounce. The cost of producing high-quality marijuana varies depending on the method used. Outdoor production costs around $2.80 per ounce, while greenhouse production costs around $15 per ounce. Government-sponsored marijuana in Canada can be produced for $9 per ounce. Retail market costs are estimated at $2.80 per ounce. The cost of producing high-quality marijuana varies depending on the method used. In jurisdictions where marijuana is quasi-legal, prices tend to be lower than the street price but higher than production costs. Prices for medical marijuana in Canada range from $1.80-$5 per gram to the final consumer, with suppliers able to supply for $1-$4 per gram. Street prices are listed as $10-$15 per gram. The street prices for marijuana range from $280-$420 per ounce, with potential discounts for larger quantities. In Canada, the government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 (CAD) per gram in April 2014, eliminating small growers and homegrown marijuana. Actual prices can be seen in Colorado marijuana shops through websites like Leafly.com. Leafly.com is a website and app that helps users find marijuana shops, dispensaries, and doctors. They provide consumer reviews and prices for different marijuana products. In Denver, prices range from $9 to $15 per gram, $29 to $40 per eighth of an ounce, and higher for larger quantities. In Colorado, marijuana prices range from $9 to $15 per gram, $29 to $40 per eighth of an ounce, and $190 to $350 per ounce. Prices on Leafly may include tax, but submissions to priceofweed.com show lower prices in Colorado, with high quality at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. These prices reflect a mix of illicit and legal markets, likely including taxes on legal purchases. Prices in Colorado show a decrease with legalization, but they are not close to production costs. The quasi-legal status of the market hinders banking assistance for producers, who also face high federal taxes without deductions due to the illegal status. Marijuana businesses face high federal taxes without deductions due to their illegal status. Researchers estimate a significant price decrease of over 80% if marijuana is legalized, with prices potentially dropping to $40-$60 per ounce. The potential price reduction of marijuana in a fully legalized market is estimated to be around $100-$150 per ounce on average, with street prices currently ranging from $200-$300 per ounce. This suggests a wide scope for a tax rate adjustment to align legalized marijuana prices with current illegal market prices. The price of marijuana is $50 per ounce, with a potential tax of up to $200 per ounce. Lowering taxes and monitoring market conditions may be the best strategy. Tax revenue could be used for marijuana research. A marijuana tax could fund research on the effects of medical marijuana, which is approved in 23 states and the District of Columbia. The American College of Physicians report highlights barriers to marijuana research and urges study of its efficacy and side effects for various conditions. A marijuana tax could fund research on the effects of medical marijuana, approved in 23 states and the District of Columbia, and study its efficacy, side effects, externalities, addictive properties, and health effects on recreational and medical users. Revenue could also finance information programs on risks and discourage consumption by minors. Excise taxes historically raise revenue for emergency spending, like cigarette taxes for health care programs such as CHIP. An excise tax on marijuana can generate revenue for various purposes, including funding research on medical marijuana and financing information programs to discourage consumption by minors. The revenue raised from the tax is uncertain due to market uncertainties, but casual consumers entering the market could increase revenue. The legalization and taxation of marijuana at the state level could significantly impact potential revenue collected from a federal excise tax. If more states legalize marijuana and set their excise tax rates to equalize prices with illicit marijuana, federal revenue could increase. Federal lawmakers may face constraints in levying excise taxes on marijuana if legal and illicit markets are not equalized. Analysts estimate that nationwide marijuana legalization could generate $5.8 billion annually in excise taxes. Analysts estimate that a federal excise tax on marijuana could generate $5.8 billion annually if taxed at 50% of its price to consumers. This calculation is based on a $13.13 billion national market for marijuana, a 50% price decrease post-legalization, and a 25% increase in consumption. Additionally, $3.3 billion in annual savings from law enforcement expenditures is projected. Miron and Waldock suggest a tax range of $50-$75 per ounce, noting that their market size estimates are conservative compared to other projections. The calculation outlines how to estimate revenues from an excise tax on marijuana, using a $50 per ounce tax. It considers the effects on consumption and interactions with income taxes, depending on market conditions and tax rates. Data on price and quantity are necessary for estimating revenue yield, with market value estimates ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion. The potential revenue from a federal excise tax on marijuana is calculated based on a $50 per ounce tax rate. Assuming a fully legalized industry with a $150 total price per ounce, the federal excise tax revenue would be $50 multiplied by the quantity. If quantity remains the same at $40 billion divided by $250, the federal excise tax revenue would be $50 multiplied by $40 billion divided by. The federal excise tax revenue from marijuana legalization, assuming a price of $150 per ounce, would be $8 billion. With a price elasticity of -0.25, the projected excise tax collection would be $9.1 billion. The projected excise tax collection from marijuana legalization is estimated to be $9.1 billion, with a 14% increase in quantity. This is lower than the $10 billion tax on alcoholic beverages, but the actual revenue gain is reduced by 25% to $6.8 billion due to the wedge between output and income caused by excise taxes. The estimate is based on assumptions and may change depending on the spread of legalization and coverage of medical marijuana. Currently, only Colorado and Washington allow recreational marijuana, representing less than 4% of the population. Short-term revenue from legalization might be less than $300 million, but more could be gained by taxing medical marijuana in other states. Tax collection data from Colorado and Washington could indicate the potential tax base of a national legalized market. Marijuana sales are taxed at state and local levels. In Colorado, recreational marijuana sales are subject to three state taxes: a 15% excise tax, a 10% retail excise tax, and a 2.9% general sales tax. The effective tax rate is between 15% and 25%. Medical marijuana is subject to a 2.9% general sales tax. Local taxes may also apply. Colorado collected over $37.0 million in taxes and fees from January to September 2014. The national market for marijuana could be estimated based on Colorado's tax revenue data. Extrapolating from Colorado's tax data, the national sales tax base for recreational marijuana could be between $15.9 billion and $17.0 billion per year. It is challenging to extrapolate medical marijuana data. Based on tax collections data from Colorado, medical marijuana consumption could potentially double the current consumption base. Extrapolating from combined medical and recreational marijuana sales in Colorado, the US market size is estimated to be at least $30 billion, although this may be underestimated due to continued illicit sales. The levels of illicit sales in Colorado are ongoing, potentially due to lower prices or existing relationships in the black market. Consumption may be inflated by non-resident sales, known as \"pot tourism.\" The issue of exempting medical marijuana and enforcing any exemptions is important. Design issues for an excise tax, such as levying it at earlier production stages, can reduce administrative costs and tax evasion opportunities. Federal excise taxes on marijuana are typically imposed on manufacturers and imports to reduce administrative costs and tax evasion risks. Taxes can be based on a per unit measurement or product price, with advantages and disadvantages to each approach. A tax by weight is similar to tobacco excise taxes, as it limits the size of individual units. A weight-based tax on marijuana could be administered at the manufacturing level, similar to tobacco regulations. However, it may lead to the production of more potent marijuana. In contrast, a potency-based tax, based on THC content per ounce, could be more complex and costly to enforce. A potency-based tax on marijuana may be more complicated and costly to enforce due to the need for accurate lab testing of strains. Lab tests can cost $60-$120 per sample, with potential for price reduction if more testing labs enter the market. More competition in testing may lead to lower prices, but could also result in growers choosing labs that underestimate THC levels. It may be challenging to accurately measure THC content in marijuana products. A tax based on THC potency could increase consumption of less potent marijuana, potentially leading to undesirable health effects. An alternative potency calculation for marijuana taxation could be based on the THC to CBD ratio, encouraging consumers to choose more sedative strains. Ad valorem taxes, like those in Colorado and Washington, could be applied as a percentage of the sales price to adjust for price changes and easily tax a variety of products. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes a 50% tax on the producer or importer price. A manufacturers tax imposed after the plant is grown and harvested is simpler to administer. Federal excise taxes are typically imposed at the manufacturer stage for products like tobacco and alcohol. Regulations are needed for vertically integrated firms that are both manufacturers and retailers. Regulations for pricing in the marijuana industry may involve creating a retail tax regime to capture price markups. The price of marijuana products can be determined by various factors, not just intoxication potential. Tax rates can be adjusted for inflation using measures like the Consumer Price Index. Given the uncertainty over prices and demand after legalization, sunset provisions for the tax could be incorporated into any initial authorizing language of a marijuana tax. Sunset provisions could encourage legislators to revisit marijuana tax laws to better reflect the evolving conditions of the nascent, legalized industry. Tax rates on marijuana could be initially set low to undercut the black market, then gradually increased to limit consumption. Delegating tax rate adjustments to the Secretary of the Treasury could be an option. Different methods of taxation, such as a general tax based on price or weight with surcharges for higher-THC products, could be combined to shape consumption and reduce negative social costs. However, implementing differential tax rates may add complexity and inequality to the tax system. Different tax rates could create unequal tax burdens for marijuana consumers, similar to alcohol which is taxed based on potency and category. Cigarettes are taxed per unit, while cigars have an ad valorem tax with a high ceiling. Lawmakers may need to consider integrating existing marijuana stocks into the tax base and address taxation of marijuana plants and consumer goods in legalized jurisdictions. Integrating preexisting marijuana plants and products into the tax base in legalized jurisdictions could help meet demand, simplify tax regulations, and increase federal revenue. However, some products may not meet new federal regulations. An alternative option is to allow ample time between enacting the tax and its effective date. Integrating preexisting marijuana plants and products into the tax base in legalized jurisdictions could simplify tax regulations and increase federal revenue. Colorado and Washington have different approaches to this issue, with Colorado initially issuing retail licenses to existing medical marijuana dispensaries and Washington allowing current plants to be converted to legal stocks with a producer license. When federal excise taxes increase, untaxed floor stocks may be subject to tax, with exemptions for small retail operations. Policy makers could implement regulations at the federal level or allow states to make their own laws regarding marijuana taxes. Age restrictions on recreational marijuana purchases in Colorado and Washington could impact the tax base, as younger individuals use marijuana at higher rates. Excluding these consumers from the legal tax base may lead to underground production or indirect sales of legally purchased marijuana. Under Colorado state law, residents can possess up to one ounce of marijuana and make unlimited transactions as long as they stay within the limit. Non-residents are limited to purchasing one quarter of an ounce in a single transaction to prevent larger-scale diversion or export. It is unclear if this restriction has effectively reduced diversion. The implementation of more restrictive purchasing limits and an ad valorem tax rate can increase the effective tax rate on heavy users. Production limits in Washington are set at 80 metric tons for the marijuana market to prevent diversion to other states and regulate the number of licenses issued. Colorado does not have a specific target for production limits. In Colorado, there is no specific production limit set for marijuana. Concerns exist about diverting exports to countries where marijuana is illegal. Mark Kleiman suggests a production limit could prevent negative social consequences and reduce the power of large producers. Production limits may lead to inefficiency and windfall profits for firms. Production limits can lead to inefficiency and windfall profits for firms in the market. The federal government has never considered production limits for any other commodity, and they are unlikely to work for states and a national legal market. Tax treatment of medical marijuana varies by jurisdiction, with Colorado applying a 2.9% general sales tax but exempting it from certain retail marijuana taxes. Medical marijuana use is contentious, with evidence showing a negative correlation with prescription drug deaths. Exempting medical marijuana from taxes could incentivize users to seek medical prescriptions, as seen in Colorado's tax data analysis. Exempting medical marijuana from federal taxes could limit the tax base if strict standards for medical prescriptions are not enforced. This could increase the cost of tax administration. Producers would need to know the end use of the product if the tax is imposed at the production level, requiring segregation of sales and marking devices. Rules for excise taxation vary across different products. In Washington, home growing of marijuana for recreational use is not allowed. However, individuals can grow up to six plants for personal use, while households can grow up to 12 plants. The issue of home production being exempt from taxation raises questions about quantity limits, with experts suggesting a single plant can yield approximately a pound of marijuana, of which the average user consumes less than four ounces. Experts suggest that home production of marijuana could yield a significant amount, with the average user consuming less than four ounces per year. While some argue that home production may not pose a threat to taxation due to users still participating in the illicit market, others believe it could undermine enforcement efforts. Banning home production could potentially increase revenue from marijuana taxes. A lower tax rate or exemption for small marijuana producers could be linked to collection at the packaging and distribution level. However, this may not be efficient as it could encourage evasion and go against the objective of collecting taxes from larger producers. Another option is to apply a lower tax to outdoor-grown marijuana, which uses less energy than indoor cultivation. Legalization of marijuana could lead to reduced prices and encourage outdoor cultivation due to lower energy usage. However, concerns exist about the negative environmental effects of outdoor cultivation diverting land and water resources. Incentives for higher-potency marijuana may drive indoor production. Another option is to impose a special occupational tax on businesses involved in marijuana production, distribution, or sales. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 (H.R. 501) proposes an occupational tax on marijuana businesses, with a $1,000 annual tax for producers, importers, and manufacturers, and a $500 annual tax for others in the industry. This tax is separate from licensing fees and is aimed at generating revenue. The role of enforcement and administrative efforts is crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana. History shows that increased enforcement efforts can deter illicit trade, as seen with bootleg spirits after Prohibition. Today, similar efforts would need to prevent regular consumers from engaging in illegal transactions with dealers. Legalizing and taxing marijuana would require enforcement to compel producers to obtain licenses and pay taxes. Without adequate resources for tax enforcement, it could undermine the federal tax base. Marijuana smuggling may be more prevalent due to its compactness, but its pungency makes it easier to detect compared to alcohol. Legalizing and taxing marijuana would require enforcement to compel producers to obtain licenses and pay taxes. To reduce the number of taxable entities, a tax closer to the point of production could be implemented. Tax stamps, seals on packages, individual marks on joints, or the use of dye could be used as evidence of tax payment. New technological developments are also being considered. Colorado enforces tracking of marijuana plants from \"seed to sale\" using RFID tags. Marijuana enterprises report inventory through a linked-computer system called Marijuana Inventory Tracking Solutions. The Enforcement Division in Colorado uses a linked-computer system called Marijuana Inventory Tracking Solutions (MITS) to complement traditional enforcement methods. Standardizing weights and potency measurements would be necessary for a marijuana tax regime to ensure consumer safety and accurate dosing. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could establish marketing standards for labeling and branding of different marijuana strains to inform consumers and prevent competition. Regulations could define labeling standards for different marijuana strains to inform consumers and prevent competition. Different tax rates between medical and recreational marijuana could lead to arbitrage opportunities for heavy users. Enforcement of regulations is crucial for proper tax collection from nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp during the omnibus farm bill debate, allowing certain research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow hemp for research purposes. Hemp could be legalized for industrial production if marijuana is legalized for commercial production, with THC content used to distinguish between the two. Europe and Canada allow hemp with less than 0.3% THC, while the US proposed legislation with less than 1% THC. Concerns about marijuana being hidden in hemp fields contribute to the illegality of hemp. The claim that marijuana can be hidden in hemp fields is likely overstated due to cross-pollination weakening marijuana plants. The decision or delay of federal legalization could impact state marijuana tax policies. States with legalization laws may rely on licensing private businesses for marijuana sales. The debate over licensing private businesses versus state-based monopolies for marijuana sales revolves around regulation, corruption, and revenue generation. The differences in revenue extraction between the two systems may be minimal or hard to predict. The debate over licensing private businesses versus state-based monopolies for marijuana sales revolves around regulation, corruption, and revenue generation. The dominance of licensing systems across states could make it difficult for lawmakers to roll back such systems and encourage state monopolies in the future. Uncertainties about post-legalization prices, market size, and consumer response make revenue projections for marijuana taxes uncertain. The uncertainty surrounding marijuana prices, spillover effects, and health impacts complicates setting tax levels. Differential consumer responses to potency and price, along with compliance costs, limit tax imposition options. Legalized marijuana sales have a narrower tax base compared to alcohol or tobacco, especially if medical marijuana is exempt from federal taxation. The discussion in the text reported some broader information on the magnitude of the social costs and benefits of marijuana, specifically focusing on the relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption. If marijuana is a substitute for alcohol, it may have positive spillover effects on society due to fewer social costs associated with marijuana consumption compared to alcohol consumption. Marijuana consumption has fewer social costs than alcohol consumption, but when consumed with alcohol, it may result in negative spillover effects on society. Researchers have not reached a consensus on this issue, as many economic studies do not capture long-term effects or examine representative populations. Marijuana research in the United States is highly regulated by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, responsible for policy research, does not fund research on the medical benefits of marijuana. There is uncertainty about the effects of marijuana and alcohol use together, limiting the feasibility of taxing marijuana based on societal costs. Initiatives in Colorado and Washington provide researchers with an opportunity to study the effects of broader marijuana legalization policies. The social costs of legalization may vary based on polydrug use, with some claiming marijuana as a gateway drug to other illicit substances. Some believe marijuana is a gateway drug to other illicit substances. Research on marijuana's impact on traffic fatalities is limited due to methodological issues. Studies have examined its effects on driving abilities and its link to actual fatalities. Studies have found that marijuana is the most commonly detected non-alcohol drug in drivers involved in crashes, but there is no clear causal link to traffic fatalities. Testing technology for marijuana intoxication is currently limited. The prevalence of nonalcoholic drugs in drivers should be seen as an indicator of use, not impairment. Advanced tests are needed to differentiate between recent users and medical marijuana patients. Marijuana legalization could potentially reduce criminal justice spending. Marijuana legalization could lead to significant savings in criminal justice spending at federal, state, and local levels. Estimates vary, with some suggesting savings of $7.7 billion per year in enforcement costs. Research indicates that a small percentage of inmates serving drug-related sentences are marijuana-only offenders. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 31.2% of offenders in FY2013 were sentenced to federal prison for drug offenses, with 28.4% related to marijuana. Federal legalization of marijuana would not impact current inmates, but its effect on future federal prison population is uncertain. Legalizing marijuana could potentially reduce the federal prison population by 2% over time, with drug violations currently accounting for a significant portion of incarcerations. However, federal legalization would not affect state and local inmates already serving sentences for marijuana-related charges or future incarcerations in jurisdictions that do not legalize it. These benefits would be solely related to the legalization of marijuana, not its taxation or regulation. Legalizing marijuana could potentially reduce the federal prison population by 2% over time, with drug violations currently accounting for a significant portion of incarcerations. However, federal legalization would not affect state and local inmates already serving sentences for marijuana-related charges or future incarcerations in jurisdictions that do not legalize it. These benefits would be solely related to the legalization of marijuana, not its taxation or regulation. The majority of costs associated with the black market for illicit drugs are related to illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana. Many marijuana exchanges take place indoors among parties where there is less risk for conflict, whereas many other drug transactions take place outdoors among strangers or in public. Marijuana producers and retailers cannot deduct selling expenses for federal tax filings under IRC Section 280E due to trafficking in controlled substances. The IRS enforces a provision prohibiting marijuana-related businesses from deducting expenses on federal tax filings, resulting in a tax penalty for these businesses. Some businesses, like Canna Care marijuana dispensary, have challenged these penalties in court. The IRS imposed a tax penalty of over $800,000 on Canna Care, a marijuana dispensary in San Francisco, for disallowing $2.6 million in business deductions. This discrepancy between federal and state tax treatments creates incentives for underground economic activities. Marijuana businesses face challenges in deducting their expenses, leading to an implicit tax of up to 39.6%. The current tax system imposes an implicit tax of up to 39.6% on business expenses for marijuana businesses, creating an economic advantage for illicit sellers. The Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 aims to exempt compliant marijuana businesses from certain tax restrictions. The Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 aims to exempt compliant marijuana businesses from certain tax restrictions, allowing tax credits or deductions for expenditures related to trafficking in controlled substances. An estimate of the national marijuana tax base can be calculated using data from Colorado or Washington, although total demand may be underrepresented due to pending licenses and the unknown impact on the underground market. For the purposes of this report, recent tax revenue data from Colorado are used to estimate the state's marijuana tax base. The recreational tax base is calculated using data from the 10% retail marijuana sales tax and the 2.9% general sales tax. The two tax bases are averaged to determine a monthly aggregate tax base for recreational sales. The 10% retail marijuana sales tax in Colorado collected $2.9 million, while the 2.9% sales tax collected $886,915 in September 2014. This led to tax base calculations of $29.4 million and $30.6 million, respectively. Averaging these numbers estimated $30.0 million in recreational marijuana sales in the state. This data can be used to extrapolate estimates for national sales tax bases. The national sales tax base for recreational marijuana can be estimated by multiplying points in each state or district by their population and marijuana usage rates, based on data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. This calculation assumes variations in consumption are primarily due to population and usage rates, not price changes or tax rates. Based on data from Colorado, the national sales tax base for recreational marijuana could be $14.5 billion to $15.4 billion per year, subject to revision. Medical marijuana sales in Colorado were $31.3 million in September 2014, with monthly sales ranging between $31 million and $35 million from January to September 2014. In FY2013, Colorado's medical marijuana tax base was $314.2 million in sales. It is uncertain if the opening of the recreational marijuana market has impacted medical marijuana demand in the state. Extrapolating this data to the general U.S. population is challenging due to incomplete data in some states and potential self-selection bias among medical marijuana patients. Based on Colorado's tax collections data, medical marijuana consumption could double total marijuana consumption amounts, even if regulations were more strictly enforced post-legalization. Users denied a medical card could still purchase marijuana for recreational use."
