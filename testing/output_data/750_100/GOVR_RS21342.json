    "content": "The diversity visa lottery encourages legal immigration from countries other than major sending countries to the US. It was added to the Immigration Act of 1990 to promote new and varied migration. The current lottery started in FY1995 after temporary lotteries. The Diversity Visa Lottery, established in FY1995, provides 55,000 visas annually to natives of countries with lower immigrant admissions in the past five years. Visas are allocated based on regional populations, with a limit of 7% per country. The Diversity Visa Lottery, established in FY1995, provides 55,000 visas annually to natives of countries with lower immigrant admissions in the past five years. Each country is limited to 7% or 3,850 visas, and Northern Ireland is treated as a separate foreign state. Recipients become legal permanent residents of the United States. The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 temporarily reduces the annual ceiling by up to 5,000 visas. Starting in FY1999, the diversity ceiling became 50,000 to offset immigrant visa numbers for certain unsuccessful asylum seekers. In FY2002, 42,829 persons were granted LPR status with diversity visas, representing 4% of all LPRs. The top five countries were Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine. Top Diversity Visa Sending Countries from FY1997-FY2002 include Albania, Nigeria, Russia, and Ukraine. Some nationals from post-Soviet nations reported being born in the Soviet Union, potentially understating the numbers for Russia and Ukraine. The diversity visa recipients from different world regions significantly differ from family-based and employment-based immigrants. European immigrants accounted for 39.4% of diversity visa recipients compared to 10.4% of family-based and employment-based immigrants in FY2002. African immigrants received 38.1% of diversity visas compared to 3.6% of family-based and employment-based visas. Caribbean, Latin American, and Asian immigrants were more prominent in family-based and employment-based immigration, resulting in smaller percentages among diversity visa recipients. To be eligible for a diversity visa, an alien must have a high school education or two years of relevant work experience. The alien or their spouse must be from a country listed for the diversity visa lottery. Winners undergo reviews by Department of State consular officers and DHS inspectors to ensure visa eligibility. The State Department announced the FY2005 lottery on August 19, 2003, with a 60-day application period from November 1 to December 30, 2003. Criteria for exclusion from the U.S. include health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, illegal entry, and immigration violations. For the FY2005 diversity lottery, applications had to be submitted electronically for the first time. Entrants from countries with high immigration rates were usually ineligible. Ineligible countries for FY2005 included Canada, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. When applying for a diversity visa, petitioners must follow State Department instructions precisely to avoid disqualification. In the FY2003 lottery, over 2 million out of 8.7 million applications were disqualified for not complying with instructions. Aliens submitting multiple applications are disqualified, but spouses and unmarried children under 21 can submit separate entries. Derivative beneficiaries must be listed on the initial petition. Any derivative beneficiary must be listed on the petition when initially filed, and their visas count against the 50,000 cap. If a diversity lottery winner dies before obtaining LPR status, the visa is revoked, and derivative beneficiaries lose their entitlement. Winners of the FY2005 diversity lottery will be notified by mail between May and July 2004, with visas issued between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2005. Winners of the FY2005 diversity visa lottery must act quickly to file necessary documentation to demonstrate admissibility as LPRs before September 30, 2005. In-person interviews are expected to start in October 2004. Some question the continuation of the lottery due to long wait times for family members to immigrate. Supporters of the diversity visa lottery argue for its importance in providing new immigrants to the US, while critics suggest amending the INA to exclude nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries. Critics of the diversity visa lottery suggest amending the INA to exclude nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries due to difficulties in background checks and terrorism concerns. The issue of who should bear the costs of operating the lottery has also been raised, with some proposing a fee to enter the lottery. The State Department defends the diversity visa against criticisms of fraud and misuse. The diversity visa lottery has faced criticism for being vulnerable to fraud and misuse, but the State Department is working to address these concerns."
