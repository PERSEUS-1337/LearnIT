    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS covers employees hired before 1984, while FERS covers those hired in 1984 or later. Employees in CSRS do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS employees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but only FERS employees receive employer matching contributions. ERISA does not apply to CSRS and FERS governmental retirement plans, which do not offer employer matching contributions. Spouses and former spouses are protected under ERISA through requirements for joint and survivor annuities and qualified domestic relations orders in private-sector plans. In divorce cases, retirement benefits are divided by state court orders. Married participants in defined contribution plans need spousal consent to name a beneficiary other than their spouse. Federal employees' retirement benefits are governed by Title 5 of the United States Code. Title 5 of the United States Code governs retirement benefits for federal employees, similar to ERISA for private-sector plans. Both require a joint and survivor annuity as the default benefit, with written consent needed to waive it. However, ERISA and Title 5 differ on when pension payments to a former spouse can begin after a divorce. Title 5 allows payment of benefits to a former spouse when the plan participant reaches retirement age, regardless of retirement status. However, CSRS or FERS annuity cannot be paid to a former spouse until the employee has separated from federal service and applied for an annuity. ERISA and Title 5 also differ in beneficiary designation for defined contribution plans. ERISA requires married participants in defined contribution plans to get spousal consent to name a beneficiary. Federal regulations for the Thrift Savings Plan allow participants to name anyone as a beneficiary without spousal consent. A state court decree can award a former spouse of a federal employee a share of retirement annuity or survivor annuity. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will pay benefits specified in a court order for retirement annuity or survivor annuity. Section 8345 of Title 5 allows a former spouse of a federal employee to be awarded a share of the employee's CSRS retirement annuity through a state court decree. OPM will divide the retired employee's monthly annuity as directed by a court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. Payments will only be divided after OPM receives the court order, and the right of the former spouse to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retired employee's death. A former spouse of a deceased federal employee may receive a CSRS survivor annuity if the employee elected a survivor annuity for the former spouse or if a state court decree of divorce, annulment, or separation requires a survivor annuity. The survivor annuity is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity. The retired worker's annual pension is reduced to fund the joint and survivor annuity. The survivor annuity for a former spouse of a deceased federal employee is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded the full survivor annuity through a court order, the current spouse is not entitled to receive it unless the former spouse dies or remarries before the age of 55. A survivor annuity paid to a former spouse of a federal employee terminates if the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55, unless the marriage to the employee lasted at least 30 years. The annuity can be restarted in the same amount if the remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment. Any modifications to the survivor annuity must be made before the employee retires or dies. A survivor annuity for a former spouse of a federal employee can only be modified before the employee retires or dies. OPM will not honor a court order for a survivor annuity if the former spouse waived their right to it. If an employee opts for a refund of their retirement contributions upon separation, they forfeit their CSRS annuity. State courts can block refund payments if a former spouse is entitled to a share of the annuity. FERS is generally exempt from state court proceedings, but a FERS retirement annuity can still be affected. Section 8467 allows a FERS retirement annuity to be divided between a federal annuitant and a former spouse based on a state court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation. OPM will divide the annuity as directed by the court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse after the employee has separated from federal service and applied for an annuity. The right of a former spouse to receive a survivor annuity from a retired federal employee's annuity ends upon the retiree's death. A survivor annuity can be granted if the retiree elected it or if a court order specifies it. Section 8445 of Title 5 allows a federal employee to choose a FERS survivor annuity for a former spouse, with the option for a state court to award it if the employee passes away. The FERS survivor annuity is 50% of the retiree's single-life annuity. A survivor annuity under FERS is equal to 50% of the single-life annuity to which the retired worker would have been entitled. The joint and survivor annuity is funded by reducing the retiree's single-life annuity amount by 10%. In return for this reduction, the worker's spouse or former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity equal to 50% of the worker's full annuity before the reduction is taken into account. An employee may provide for the equivalent of no more than one FERS spouse survivor annuity. The sum of FERS survivor annuities paid to the employee's spouse at the time of death and all former spouses cannot exceed 50% of the single-life annuity to which the annuitant was entitled. If a survivor annuity has been awarded to a former spouse through a court order, the employee's current spouse is not entitled to receive it unless the former spouse has died or remarried before age 55. The annuity terminates upon the death or remarriage of the spouse or former spouse before age 55. An exception exists for remarriages lasting at least 30 years after January 1, 1995. If a FERS employee remarries and the marriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment, the annuity restarts in the same amount. A court order for a survivor annuity to a former spouse can only be modified before the employee retires or dies. OPM will not honor a court order for a survivor annuity if the former spouse previously waived their right to it. If an employee in FERS dies after 18 months but less than 10 years of service, their spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit equal to half of the employee's annual basic pay. The lump-sum survivor benefit for a FERS employee is equal to one-half of the employee's annual basic pay plus a lump-sum payment. This benefit can be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse as per a state court order. If the employee dies after 10 years of service, the surviving spouse receives a lump sum and an annuity equal to 50% of the employee's earned annuity. Electing to receive a refund of contributions forfeits the right to a FERS annuity, which can be blocked by a state court. An employee can designate beneficiaries for their TSP account balance by filing Form TSP-3 with the Thrift Board. The Board does not recognize wills or estate planning documents. Spouse consent is not required to designate someone other than the spouse as the beneficiary. A married FERS participant must obtain their spouse's written consent for certain TSP account transactions, while CSRS participants do not need spousal consent but the spouse will be notified. Spouses of married FERS participants are entitled to a joint and survivor annuity from the TSP. The TSP requires written consent from a participant's spouse for certain transactions, including a joint and survivor annuity with a 50% survivor benefit. State court orders regarding divorce, annulment, and property settlements are recognized by the TSP. Federal employees in FERS participate in Social Security, and former spouses may be eligible for benefits if married for at least 10 years. If a former spouse of a worker insured by Social Security remarries, they generally cannot collect benefits on the worker's record unless the marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment. Divorced spouses can receive widow or widower benefits if married for at least 10 years. Survivor benefits end if the divorced spouse remarries before age 60 unless the later marriage ends. Remarriage does not affect Social Security survivor benefits for the deceased worker's children."
