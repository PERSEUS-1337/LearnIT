    "content": "The Supreme Court has held in abeyance the question of whether a demonstration of actual innocence would render a defendant's execution unconstitutional. Davis's habeas petition raised these questions, but the District and Circuit Courts concluded that only the Supreme Court could review the determinations. Davis was convicted of murder, obstruction of a police officer, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. The victim was a police officer shot while responding to a disturbance. The jury found two aggravating factors. Davis was sentenced to death for the murder of a police officer in the performance of his duty and murder committed after first wounding the victim. He petitioned for habeas relief in federal court based on newly discovered evidence and alleged prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. He also claimed actual innocence as an exception to the procedural default rule. The district court rejected Davis's constitutional claims, which were affirmed by the court of appeals. Despite petitioning for a new trial based on witness recantations and evidence of another man committing the murder, the Georgia Supreme Court denied his petition. Davis sought approval from the federal court of appeals to file a second federal habeas petition, claiming innocence in the murder he was convicted of. The majority denied his application, stating he failed to meet the requirements for a second petition as the evidence presented was not new or newly discoverable. The majority denied Davis's application for a second federal habeas petition, stating it lacked new evidence or newly discoverable information. The dissenting member argued for granting the petition if a death row inmate claims actual innocence. The Supreme Court transferred Davis's petition for habeas relief to the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to determine if new evidence establishes his innocence. The district court may find that certain provisions of the AEDPA do not apply to habeas petitions filed under the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. Justice Stevens suggested three avenues to relief in response to Justice Scalia's dissenting quip that the transfer sends the district court on a \"fool's errand.\" The understanding flows not from the language of the Supreme Court's transfer order itself, but apparently from the language of Justice Steven's concurrence which accompanies the order. Scalia assumes the District Court may not grant relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(d)(1). However, the transfer is not a 'fool's errand' as the court may find exceptions for an original habeas petition or an 'actual innocence' claim. Even if \u00a72254(d)(1) applies, the court may still consider other factors in the AEDPA analysis. The court may find exceptions for an original habeas petition or an 'actual innocence' claim, even if \u00a72254(d)(1) applies. The district court believes section 2244(b)'s jurisdictional bar on second or successive habeas petitions may not apply. The Judiciary Act of 1789 established federal courts' power to issue writs of habeas corpus, including the Supreme Court's authority to grant such writs for inquiries into the cause of commitment. In 1867, Congress expanded federal courts' jurisdiction to issue the writ in all cases. Congress expanded federal courts' jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus in all cases, clarifying the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction over habeas decisions of lower federal courts. The first case under this new authority involved William McCardle, a Mississippi newspaper editor. The new appellate authority involved William McCardle, a Mississippi newspaper editor arrested by military authorities for trial by a military commission under reconstruction laws. His petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied by the federal circuit court, and he appealed to the Supreme Court. The government tried to dismiss the appeal, but the Court denied the motion as the military custody exception only applied to the expansion of habeas under the 1867 Act, while McCardle relied on the pre-existing habeas authority of the Judiciary Act. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal in Ex parte McCardle (1868) after Congress repealed the law granting appellate jurisdiction. However, the Court clarified that it still had the ability to review lower court habeas decisions despite losing jurisdiction for appeals in habeas cases. The Supreme Court confirmed its ability to review lower court habeas decisions despite losing jurisdiction for appeals in habeas cases before the 1867 Act. The Supreme Court retained jurisdiction to review habeas cases despite losing appellate jurisdiction under the 1868 Act. Congress later restored the Court's authority to review habeas cases in 1885. In 1885, Congress reopened Supreme Court review in habeas cases after cumbersome appellate procedures. The original writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court was rarely successful and urged for abandonment. The scope of Congress's control over Court's appellate jurisdiction in habeas cases resurfaced in Felker v. Turpin in 1996. Felker argued that 28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3)(E) limits appellate jurisdiction for second or successive habeas petitions. The Court upheld this limitation, stating that AEDPA does not strip the Court of its authority to entertain habeas petitions. Review can still be sought through the original writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court upheld the limitation on appellate jurisdiction for second or successive habeas petitions under 28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3)(E) in Felker v. Turpin. The Court maintained that AEDPA does not remove its authority to consider habeas petitions, allowing review through the original writ of habeas corpus. Felker sought review and reversal of \u00a72241 of Title 28, but the Court refused relief under its original writ authority. It did not hold that it was required to follow the act's standards, but acknowledged that they inform their consideration of original habeas petitions. The Court denied Felker's original writ petition seeking review of \u00a72241 of Title 28, stating that legislative barriers alone do not constitute exceptional circumstances for issuance of a writ. In Boumediene v. Bush, the Court addressed Congress's authority to bar access to the writ of habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay. The case clarified the availability of habeas for foreign nationals in a combat zone, establishing that detainees held in Guantanamo were not beyond the reach of U.S. courts. The Supreme Court clarified that detainees held in Guantanamo were not beyond the reach of U.S. courts, despite Congress's attempts to limit habeas petitions through the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military Commissions Act. The Supreme Court addressed the applicability of the suspension clause to foreign nationals detained in Guantanamo and concluded that the clause has full effect at Guantanamo Bay. It also determined that the Military Commissions Act did not constitute a formal suspension of the writ. The Supreme Court addressed the Suspension Clause's applicability to foreign nationals detained in Guantanamo, finding that it has full effect there. The Court also considered whether the statute stripping jurisdiction for the writ of habeas corpus avoids the Suspension Clause mandate by providing adequate substitute procedures in the Detainee Treatment Act's combatant status review tribunal procedures. The Court found little precedent to guide its assessment of an \"adequate substitute.\" The Supreme Court examined the applicability of the Suspension Clause to foreign nationals in Guantanamo, determining that it applies fully. The Court also evaluated whether the statute removing jurisdiction for habeas corpus provides sufficient substitute procedures. In the context of Boumediene, the Court outlined essential features of habeas corpus and any adequate substitute, emphasizing the prisoner's right to demonstrate errors in law application and the necessary scope of habeas review. The necessary scope of habeas review depends on the rigor of earlier proceedings. When a person is detained by executive order, the need for collateral review is more pressing. The court conducting the habeas proceeding must have the means to correct errors and assess the sufficiency of the Government's evidence against the detainee. The Court found the Detainee Treatment Act procedures inadequate compared to normal habeas procedures, ruling that the Military Commissions Act's attempt to limit habeas jurisdiction for Guantanamo detainees is unconstitutional. The court emphasized the importance of admitting relevant exculpatory evidence and ensuring a fair review process for detainees. The habeas review of a state prisoner's conviction or sentence may be barred, but an exception exists for cases of actual innocence based on new evidence. The petitioner must demonstrate a constitutional violation that likely led to the conviction of an innocent person. The habeas court may issue the writ based on insufficient evidence of guilt if new evidence shows that no reasonable juror would have convicted the petitioner. The habeas court may issue the writ based on insufficient evidence of guilt if new evidence shows that no reasonable juror would have convicted the petitioner. An applicant is entitled to habeas corpus relief if no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Herrera v. Collins involved a claim of actual innocence unsupported by any claim of guilt. The Court established the threshold showing for a claim of actual innocence in capital cases, considering the disruptive effect on finality and burden on states. The Court set a high threshold for proving innocence in capital cases, with some Justices suggesting the Constitution would prevent the execution of an innocent person. However, the petitioner in this case did not meet this high standard. The level of persuasion required for a freestanding innocence claim is higher than for an innocence-plus-constitutional-defect claim. Davis's petition may need to survive inquiries regarding the Constitution's prohibition on executing actually innocent individuals, the availability of original habeas relief, any constraints on such petitions, and potential statutory impediments. The Herrera Court debated whether executing an indisputably innocent man would be cruel and unusual punishment or a violation of due process. The transfer to district court indicates a belief that actual innocence could potentially warrant habeas relief. In appropriate circumstances, actual innocence may provide grounds for habeas relief. The Court in Felker suggested that statutory impediments do not necessarily bind a court considering original petitions. Prudential rules developed by the Supreme Court, including those related to second or successive petitions and deference to state courts, are likely to influence a court's consideration. Section 2244(b) of title 28 of the United States Code mandates the dismissal of a claim in a habeas petition if it was previously presented or omitted, unless based on a new constitutional interpretation by the Supreme Court or newly discovered evidence proving innocence. The section 2244(b) of title 28 mandates the dismissal of a claim in a habeas petition if it was previously presented or omitted, unless based on a new constitutional interpretation by the Supreme Court or newly discovered evidence proving innocence. In the claim, no reasonable jury would have convicted the petitioner, based on the Carrier standard that requires showing a constitutional violation probably resulted in the conviction of an innocent person. The Davis District Court has indicated it will not revisit the issue of the applicability of the section 2244(b) bars. The section 2254(d) of title 28 precludes habeas relief based on the same claim if a state court has ruled on the merits, unless the decision was contrary to Supreme Court precedent or involved an unreasonable application of the law. Justice Stevens noted that this section does not have a counterpart in earlier Supreme Court rulings. The District Court may find that \u00a72254(d)(1) does not apply rigidly to an original habeas petition, and it could be unconstitutional to deny relief to a death row inmate who has proven innocence. The Teague doctrine might also come into play in usual habeas procedure. The Teague doctrine may prevent a state prisoner from using habeas to benefit from a new constitutional interpretation if it does not prohibit the conduct of conviction or is not a \"watershed rule of criminal procedure.\" The Supreme Court has set a high threshold for habeas relief in cases of hypothetical freestanding innocence claims, with some arguing it is even higher than the standard for Schlup claims. This threshold is described as \"extraordinarily high\" in the context of innocence cases. The Supreme Court has established a high threshold for habeas relief in cases involving hypothetical innocence claims. Davis must provide clear and convincing evidence of his innocence to satisfy this standard, as demonstrated in the District Court's extensive examination of the record. The Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause condemns punishments that offend evolving standards of decency. State practices and legislative actions, guided by Supreme Court precedents, determine permissible punishments. Most states allow innocent defendants to challenge capital convictions, with only three states not offering capital punishment as a sentencing option. The Eighth Amendment permits execution of a defendant only if responsible for another's death, serving penological purposes. The District Court borrowed the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard to establish actual innocence. The district court applied the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard from Sawyer to determine Mr. Davis's actual innocence. Despite some doubt cast by new evidence, the majority of trial evidence remained intact and the new evidence was deemed not credible. As a result, the court found that Mr. Davis failed to prove his actual innocence for habeas relief in federal court. The District Court denied Davis's habeas relief, stating he failed to prove his actual innocence. The Supreme Court disposed of the case without a written opinion on March 28, 2011."
