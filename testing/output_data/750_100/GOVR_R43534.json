    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. Concerns arose in 2013 about the FISC's orders, leading to proposals to amend FISA or FISC practices. The report focuses on proposals to alter the process for selecting judges for the FISA courts, which are established by Congress to review government surveillance applications. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and their salaries cannot be diminished to ensure independence. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), an Article III court, to issue orders related to foreign intelligence investigations. The FISC can approve electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen register/trap and trace device use, and access to business records upon proper application by a federal officer. FISA also created the FISA Court of Review to review any application denials. The FISA Court of Review has jurisdiction to review denials by the FISC. The Chief Justice designates judges for both courts, serving seven-year terms without eligibility for reappointment. The FISC has 11 district court judges from at least seven judicial circuits, with one as presiding judge. The FISA Court of Review has three judges from district or circuit courts, with one as presiding judge. Some argue over the authority to select judges. Several bills in the 113th Congress aim to change the process for selecting FISA judges, with proposals including transferring selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts or allowing the President to choose FISA judges with Senate advice and consent. Critics argue that the current process, overseen by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, is too partisan and lacks transparency. The bill proposes giving the President the authority to select FISA judges with Senate advice and consent, or alternatively, congressional leadership could have this power. The main concern is the constitutionality of designating judges by a specific branch of government. The judicial branch has expressed worry about proposals to shift selection away from the Chief Justice. This report outlines the constitutional process for appointing Article III judges and discusses the alternative method of \"designation\" where current federal judges can temporarily serve on another federal court. The report discusses proposals to shift the authority of selecting federal judges away from the Chief Justice and outlines the constitutional process for appointing Article III judges. It also explores the alternative method of \"designation\" where current federal judges can temporarily serve on another federal court. The Supreme Court has ruled that Article III judges are principal officers appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate. If Congress expands the duties of an office requiring constitutional appointment, a second appointment may not be necessary if the new duties are related to the original post. The Supreme Court has established that military officers can serve on a military court without a second constitutional appointment if the new duties are related to their original post, based on the principle of \"germaneness\" from previous cases. The Appointments Clause generally allows existing federal judges to serve in separate positions in a related Article III capacity without violating the Constitution. Congress has a history of using designations for Article III courts and giving the Chief Justice authority to assign federal judges to other federal courts. The creation of the now-defunct Commerce Court is an example of this practice. The Chief Justice was given authority to designate federal judges to a special tribunal by Congress. The Commerce Court's Chief Justice-based designation process became a model for future specialized courts. Lower federal court judges were also vested with designation authority. The Supreme Court has upheld designations within the judicial branch. The Supreme Court has upheld designations within the judicial branch, stating that the power of Congress to designate judges in different districts is a matter of statutory construction and does not violate the executive power of appointment. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's authority to designate judges in different districts, including FISA judges, dismissing constitutional challenges to the Chief Justice's designation authority. The courts have consistently upheld the constitutionality of this process. The Ninth Circuit rejected an argument that the FISC violates the Appointments Clause as judges are designated by the Chief Justice, citing precedent of temporary assignment of judges. District courts have also upheld the FISA designation process, noting that FISA judges are not distinguishable from other federal judges. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes dispersing the selection process for the FISC between the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice, increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13. The central issue is whether designation by certain individuals within the branches of government would be constitutionally permissible. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would designate the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit, with at least five associate justices of the Supreme Court required to concur in the Chief Justice's designation for the FISA Court of Review. The Chief Justice would have the final act of designating a judge to the FISA courts under the proposal, with limited judicial precedent suggesting that such an arrangement could be constitutional. Congress has the power to determine how and where a judge may exercise jurisdiction, as seen in the McDowell case. The McDowell Court affirmed Congress's power to designate judges to serve in different districts, suggesting that chief judges could potentially appoint judges to FISA courts within their circuits. This authority is not expressly limited by the Constitution, although the precedent cited is based on an 1871 statute. The McDowell Court's decision was based on an 1871 statute that could limit a chief judge's designation authority for FISA court judges. There are proposals to shift this authority to the President, such as the Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761). The proposal to \"designate\" judges for the FISC and FISA Court of Review could be seen as a second constitutional appointment, potentially affecting the FISA courts' status as Article III courts due to the difference in tenure requirements. A reviewing court may determine that a federal judge appointed to serve on the FISA courts for a fixed term does not lose his overall Article III status or its protections. In contrast, a proposal giving the President sole authority to select an existing federal judge for the FISA courts could raise constitutional concerns. The President's authority to appoint federal judges to the FISA courts may raise separation-of-powers concerns, but Mistretta v. United States established that such appointments are permissible within the judicial branch. The President's limited power to remove judges from the U.S. Sentencing Commission does not extend to affecting their tenure or compensation. The President's authority to appoint federal judges to the FISA courts may raise separation-of-powers concerns. The Court concluded that the President cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges or coerce them in their judicial duties. FISA judges exercise judicial powers on an Article III court, unlike the judges in Mistretta who were acting in an extrajudicial capacity. The selection of FISA judges by the President alone may raise separation-of-powers concerns if the President's power to remove judges could compromise their impartiality. Proposals suggest vesting designation authority with congressional leadership, potentially problematic under the Appointments Clause. The proposals to vest appointment authority with congressional leadership may raise separation-of-powers concerns under the Appointments Clause and Chadha principles. The appointment authority proposals by congressional leadership may raise separation-of-powers concerns under the Appointments Clause and Chadha principles. Congressional designations to the judiciary must adhere to bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution."
