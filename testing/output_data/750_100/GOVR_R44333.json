    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising health insurance enrollment and an aging population. The tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for healthcare provision are often overlooked in budget discussions, as they result in revenue foregone through preferential tax treatment. Congressional focus on health-related tax expenditures is important. The value and changes in health-related tax expenditures are important for Congressional attention. Questions include the value over time, impact of the ACA, comparison to total revenue, and size relative to health program outlays. Federal support for health has grown through direct outlays and revenue losses. This report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to provide insights into the growth of health support through direct outlays or revenue losses. The Committee on the Budget relies on the tax expenditure definition and estimation methodology used by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), which defines tax expenditures as revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws allowing special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, or credits. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) defines tax expenditures as special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, or credits that cause a revenue loss from the income tax system. These provisions diverge from the baseline definition of income, resulting in forgone revenue. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, such as health, commerce, housing, and energy. The Department of the Treasury also has its own list of tax expenditures organized by budget function. Tax expenditures are categorized by budget function, such as health, commerce, housing, and energy by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the Department of the Treasury. The difficulty arises in containing cross-cutting health provisions within a narrow category, complicating the understanding of tax expenditures. For example, some health tax expenditures for medical benefits for active-duty military dependents might be related to spending programs in OMB's national defense budget function. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) typically analyzes tax expenditures by budget area. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) categorizes tax expenditures by forms like exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Economists evaluate tax expenditures based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity to aid Congressional decision-making. Tax expenditures, such as exclusions and deductions, can impact economic distortions and certain groups. They can correct inefficiencies in the health care market but may undermine tax progressivity. Administering social policy through the tax code could benefit lower-income households due to direct reporting of income and family size on tax forms. Administering social programs through the tax code could increase tax filing complexity and administration costs. Direct spending or grant programs may be easier for beneficiaries and reduce administrative costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures, excluding Medicare-related provisions as of December 2015. Tax provisions in this report include health and Medicare tax expenditures before FY2015, with health tax expenditures estimated at $234.0 billion in FY2016. The largest tax expenditure is the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), projected to increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. Subsidies for insurance purchased also contribute to health tax expenditures. The second largest health tax expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges, with the annual amount estimated to increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. These tax provisions subsidize private health insurance costs and activities with positive spillover benefits to society. Some health tax provisions have positive spillover benefits to society, such as exclusion of interest on state and local government private activity bonds for nonprofit hospitals and itemized deduction for charitable giving to qualified nonprofit health organizations. These provisions have origins in legal doctrine or thought about income definitions at the time of adoption and may have been indirectly affected by other policies. The ESI tax exclusion, originating in 1918, allowed employer payments for individual health coverage to be deductible. Conflicting regulatory rulings on employer health contributions arose in 1954 under a comprehensive revision of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESI tax exclusion, established in 1918, allowed employer payments for individual health coverage to be deductible. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 expanded the role of the exclusion, excluding contributions from income. JCT data from FY1974 to FY2019 shows changes in health-related tax expenditure provisions over time. The Medicare-related tax provisions analyzed separately in figures through FY2014 have changed over time. JCT stopped classifying these provisions as tax expenditures as of FY2015. Multiple tax expenditure provisions are added together for this report to show changes over time in tax expenditures. JCT does not typically combine values due to potential interactions altering the estimated value. Health-related tax expenditures have increased over time, with a 43.0% increase from FY2004 to FY2014 in real terms. The annual tax expenditure value for health-related provisions has increased by 11.5% in nominal dollars and 7.5% in real dollars from FY1974 to FY2014. The annual growth rates of health-related tax expenditures have fluctuated above and below historical averages since the enactment of the ACA in 2010. In nominal dollars, the annual value is estimated to increase from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019, with a total of $234.0 billion in FY2016. The growth is attributed to factors like changes in demographics and health care costs. The growth of health-related tax expenditures has varied since the ACA in 2010, increasing from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019. Factors contributing to this growth include changes in demographics, health care costs, and policy changes affecting tax expenditures. Medicare benefits are excluded from income tax, with tax expenditures measured based on benefits exceeding insurance payments. Tax expenditures for Medicare (Part A, B, or D) exceeded enrollees' payments, indicating the value of insurance was greater than premiums. From FY1987 to FY2014, tax expenditures for Medicare increased by 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) annually. Before FY1987, tax expenditures for Medicare were minimal, suggesting insurance benefits were roughly equal to payments. Tax expenditures for Medicare have been increasing annually at rates higher than payments, indicating the value of insurance to beneficiaries has grown. The value of health-related tax expenditures has also risen significantly over the years, outpacing the growth of total revenue collections. Health tax expenditures have been increasing annually at rates higher than total revenue collections. Estimates show an increase from 6.4% of total revenue in FY2015 to 7.7% in FY2019. The ACA has implemented various taxes to raise revenue, including the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax. Additionally, a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution was imposed. The ACA implemented various taxes to raise revenue, including the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and the medical device tax. A 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax was also imposed. The annual revenue raised by these provisions is small compared to total health tax expenditures. The comparison between outlays and tax expenditures can track federal support to the health sector. Medicare and Medicaid costs are mostly mandatory. Health programs like Medicare and Medicaid are primarily mandatory outlays, while administrative costs are funded through discretionary spending. Federal health research, veterans' health care, and certain public health clinics are also funded through discretionary spending. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays but were still less than health mandatory outlays. Health-related tax expenditures have grown from 0.3% of GDP in FY1974 to 1.5% in FY2014, while health discretionary outlays remained between 0.3% and 0.5% of GDP over the same period. This appendix provides a description and legislative origins of each health tax expenditure provision identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) stopped classifying Medicare-related tax expenditure provisions starting FY2015. Health tax expenditures, some of the longest-standing provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, may have had different historical rationales for their creation. These provisions could have originated from past legal definitions of taxable events or income, administrative rulings to comply with previously enacted laws, or policy traditions. The curr_chunk provides additional information on historical background for individual provisions related to tax expenditures. It references a specific document, CRS Committee Print CP10001, for more details."
