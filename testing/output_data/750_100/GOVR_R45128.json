    "content": "Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018 (H.R. 1625), which included Agriculture appropriations bills from both the House and Senate Committees. The House had also passed a consolidated bill (H.R. 3354) that included agriculture. The final appropriation was facilitated by new budget caps in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123). The House passed an eight-bill consolidated appropriation, H.R. 3354, on September 14, 2017, which included amendments to the Agriculture bill. The enacted Agriculture appropriation is $23.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than FY2017. The Administration proposed $15.8 billion, the House passed $20 billion, and the Senate reported $20.53 billion. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation totals $146 billion, including mandatory spending of nearly $123 billion. The bill funds USDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service, and the FDA. The Trump Administration released its full FY2018 budget request on May 23, 2017. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriation bill includes funding for USDA, FDA, and CFTC in even-numbered fiscal years. The bill covers mandatory and discretionary spending, with a focus on discretionary amounts. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts. Mandatory spending is controlled differently from discretionary spending, which is set by annual appropriations acts. The annual budget resolution process establishes spending limits for discretionary appropriations, while mandatory spending is governed by budget rules during the authorization process. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations accounted for 16% of the total budget. In FY2018, Agriculture appropriations totaled $146 billion, with discretionary appropriations making up 16% ($23.3 billion) and mandatory spending comprising the majority at $123 billion. The mandatory amount included $99 billion for programs in the 2014 farm bill. Key discretionary spending items included WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance, food safety inspection, conservation, and animal and plant programs. The main mandatory spending items in Agriculture appropriations include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity and conservation programs. SNAP is an \"appropriated entitlement\" that requires annual funding, while the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) operates on a line of credit. The annual appropriation reimburses the Treasury for using a line of credit. Changes in the Agriculture appropriations bill have generally mirrored changes in the bill's total discretionary limit. Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, declined through FY2013, and have since increased. Historical comparisons may require adjustments for inflation and other factors. The stacked bars in Figure 3 show authorized discretionary spending for each appropriations title since FY2008. The Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget request in 2017 later than expected, with an outline released on March 16, 2017. The total of positive stacked bars in appropriations titles exceeded the official discretionary spending allocation due to budgetary offsets from negative amounts in Title VII general provisions and other adjustments. Rescissions and limits on mandatory programs contributed to the net negative general provisions. The Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget outline on March 16, 2017, proposing a 21% reduction for USDA and FDA programs. Congress reminded the Administration of its authority to set final funding levels for FY2018 in the explanatory statement for the FY2017 appropriation. Agencies were cautioned against presuming program funding outcomes and taking premature actions. The Trump Administration released its FY2018 budget outline on March 16, 2017, proposing a 21% reduction for USDA and FDA programs. Agencies were cautioned against presuming program funding outcomes and taking premature actions. The Administration requested $15.82 billion for Agriculture appropriations, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. The Trump Administration proposed a 21% reduction for USDA and FDA programs in its FY2018 budget outline, requesting $15.82 billion for Agriculture appropriations, $5.3 billion less than in FY2017. Congressional appropriations committees evaluated the request and began considering their own bills in the summer of 2017. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on June 28, 2017. The House Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on June 28, 2017, and the full Appropriations Committee passed an amended bill on July 12, 2017. The House later passed an eight-bill consolidated appropriation on September 14, 2017, with Agriculture as Division B, including budget-neutral amendments. The House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation totaled $20 billion, $1.13 billion less than FY2017. The House-passed FY2018 Agriculture appropriation totaled $20 billion, $1.13 billion less than enacted in FY2017. The reduction was achieved by cutting various programs such as rural development, nutrition assistance, farm and conservation programs, department administration, and research. The Senate Appropriations Committee also made allocations to its subcommittees in July 2017. The Senate Agriculture Subcommittee marked up its FY2018 bill on July 18, 2017, with a discretionary total of $20.53 billion, $352 million less than FY2017. The full Appropriations Committee passed the amended bill on July 20, 2017, with a vote of 31-0. The Senate-reported bill would have provided $776 million more than the House-passed bill on a comparable basis. The Senate-reported bill for FY2018 made fewer reductions compared to FY2017 than the House-passed bill. It reduced rural development by $119 million and agricultural research by $57 million, while increasing foreign food aid by $140 million. Additionally, it included $220 million more in reductions through rescissions and changing mandatory programs than the House-passed bill. FY2018 began without an enacted appropriation, leading Congress to pass CRs to fund the government. The Congress has passed Continuing Resolutions (CRs) to fund the government, which continue the previous year's funding rate and provisions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prorates funding to agencies on an annualized basis through apportionment. CRs may include anomalies or specific administrative changes. The first CR for FY2018 lasted until December 8, 2017, maintaining FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies for the agriculture appropriation. The Continuing Resolution for FY2018 includes a 0.6791% reduction across-the-board and sufficient funding for nutrition programs. It also provides an increase of about $2 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, totaling $238 million. Additionally, there is a technical correction for the computation of rescission to Section 32 funds. The Continuing Resolution for FY2018 extended multiple CRs, including one to January 19, 2018, and another to February 8, 2018, to avoid a government shutdown. It also waived PAYGO rules for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to prevent sequestration of mandatory spending. The fifth Continuing Resolution (CR) extended the government shutdown to March 23, 2018, as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. This Act raised budget caps, provided disaster assistance, amended farm bill provisions, and authorized supplemental appropriations for hurricane losses. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included supplemental appropriations for hurricane and wildfire losses, a six-week CR, revisions to agriculture programs with long-term policy implications, and raised discretionary spending caps from the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provided $3.6 billion in disaster assistance for 2017 hurricanes and wildfires, including block grants to states, funding for conservation and watershed recovery, rural water and wastewater recovery, and additional funding for dairy, permanent disaster assistance, and cotton programs in the expected successor to the current farm bill. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 provided $3.6 billion in disaster assistance for 2017 hurricanes and wildfires, including block grants to states, funding for conservation and watershed recovery, rural water and wastewater recovery, and additional funding for dairy, permanent disaster assistance, and cotton programs in the expected successor to the current farm bill. The BBA offsets some of these additions by extending sequestration on mandatory accounts under the BCA for two more years, for FY2026 and FY2027, at an estimated future effect on agriculture accounts of $2.6 billion. Raising the budget caps for overall discretionary spending facilitated the development of a final full-year appropriation for FY2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised the nondefense discretionary cap by $63 billion for FY2018 and by $68 billion for FY2019. It also increased the defense cap by $80 billion for FY2018 and by $85 billion for FY2019. Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018, with a discretionary total of $23.3 billion for the Agriculture portion. The enacted FY2018 Agriculture appropriation increased by $2.1 billion compared to FY2017, reaching a total of about $146 billion. This includes $123 billion of mandatory spending and an additional $1.38 billion in General Provisions for various programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act increased funding for various programs through an extra $1.38 billion in General Provisions. This includes additional funding for rural water programs, expanding rural broadband, Food for Peace foreign food aid, and opioid enforcement and surveillance at FDA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act increases agricultural research spending by $138 million across four agencies, with specific increases for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative and Agricultural Research Service. It also boosts funding for Food for Peace by $134 million to $1.6 billion, without imposing as many changes to mandatory program spending as in previous years. The FY2018 Agriculture appropriation lacks usual CHIMPS, costing about $740 million against the discretionary limit compared to FY2017. Table 3 compares the FY2018 appropriation to House-passed, Senate-reported, and Administration proposals, as well as prior years FY2015-FY2017. Budget Sequestration is a process of automatic reductions that cancel mandatory and/or discretionary spending. Sequestration is a budget enforcement mechanism triggered by exceeding statutory budget goals, leading to reductions in discretionary and mandatory spending. It is authorized in the BCA for discretionary spending through FY2021 and for mandatory spending through FY2027. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have prevented sequestration on discretionary spending, except for FY2013. The Bipartisan Budget Acts have raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration, but sequestration still applies to certain mandatory spending accounts. The original FY2021 sunset on mandatory sequestration has been extended four times to offset avoiding sequestration of discretionary spending or for other bills. Congress has extended mandatory sequestration multiple times, with the latest extension until FY2027 as an offset in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration. Sequestration has been extended until FY2027, with some farm bill mandatory programs exempt. Crop insurance is mostly exempt, while farm commodity programs, disaster assistance, and conservation programs have been subject to sequestration. Nonexempt mandatory accounts continue to face sequestration in FY2018. Sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts in agriculture continues in FY2018 at a 6.6% rate, resulting in a $1.3 billion reduction from authorized funds.
