    "content": "The federal government responded to the 9/11 and anthrax attacks by increasing funding for biodefense, focusing on capacity shortages in diagnostic, clinical, and research laboratories. The DOD, DHS, HHS, and USDA have expanded their high-containment laboratory capacity for studying dangerous pathogens since 2001. High-containment laboratories are crucial in the biodefense effort, aiding in better responses to biological attacks and understanding bioterrorism threats. However, they also pose a risk as a potential source of materials or training for attacks. The federal government has invested in research for countermeasures against dangerous pathogens, with funding for civilian biodefense increasing significantly since FY2001. The funding for civilian biodefense increased from $690 million in FY2001 to $5.4 billion in FY2008, supporting academic and industrial researchers handling dangerous pathogens. Concerns about aging laboratory infrastructure and limited capacity have been exacerbated by the influx of funds and researchers. Non-federal entities have also expanded high-containment laboratories due to the threat of bioterrorism and emerging diseases. The increase in high-containment laboratory capacity has raised new policy questions and increased focus on existing ones, such as the optimal size and type of laboratories, coordination of efforts among agencies, and the balance between benefits and risks of expanding capacity and trained scientists. The federal government is considering tighter oversight of high-containment laboratories due to concerns about accidents, noncompliance, and community resistance. These facilities may also be regulated by state and local laws. The focus is on biosecurity concepts in the regulation of these laboratories. The report discusses the government's regulation of high containment laboratories, focusing on biosecurity and biosafety measures. Biosecurity involves securing pathogens from theft, while biosafety aims to reduce the risk of unintentional infection. The report also addresses the proliferation of high-containment labs, challenges for policymakers, and policy options for Congress to consider. Biosecurity and biosafety are closely related mechanisms to lower the risk of infection in laboratories. The Select Agent Program regulates commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released into the environment. The Select Agent Program, established in 1996, identifies organisms and toxins that could be used for bioterrorist attacks. The 2001 anthrax mailings led to increased government interest in bioterrorism threats, resulting in stricter regulations on pathogen possession through laws like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-188) imposed stricter regulations on the possession of select agents, requiring entities to develop security and biosafety plans certified by the federal government. The Select Agent Program oversees the possession, transfer, and use of select agents, focusing on regulating access to select agents and the facilities where they are stored. Scientists must register with the federal government to access select agents. The government requires applicants to provide information for background checks to handle select agents. Permits are valid for five years and nontransferable. Facilities using select agents must create security plans to protect them from theft or improper access, which are reviewed by HHS or USDA. Inspections are conducted by CDC to ensure regulatory compliance and security plan implementation. The CDC conducts announced inspections of regulated facilities every three years to ensure compliance with Select Agent Program regulations. Noncompliance can result in fines, and possession of select agents without completing the security risk assessment process is a violation of federal law. As of February 2009, 390 entities were authorized to work with select agents, with 15,300 staff having security risk assessment approvals. The federal government has developed a Laboratory Response Network linking state or local public health laboratories to handle dangerous pathogens. Tensions have increased over select agent approvals for access. The increase in academic entities and researchers has raised tensions over the Select Agent Program in academia. Approximately 200 entities chose to transfer or destroy their select agent inventories rather than comply with the regulations. The performance of the program has been scrutinized in various investigations by agency Inspectors General. The HHS IG and USDA IG found non-compliance with select agent regulations in universities and laboratories. Three entities withdrew their select agent licenses. CDC suspended a select agent entity in 2007. In 2007, the CDC suspended a select agent entity certificate at Texas A&M University for failure to report occupational exposures and allowing access to select agents without security risk assessments. Several organizations have been fined for violations of select agent regulations, with a total of $1,887,000 in fines levied on 12 organizations by the HHS OIG. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens acknowledge the risk of contracting diseases and accidental release of pathogens. In the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. government began issuing formal guidelines to mitigate the risks of contracting diseases and accidental release of pathogens in laboratories. The guidelines, disseminated by HHS in the publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), establish four main levels of biosafety (BSL-1 to BSL-4) to guide researchers in handling biological agents safely. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines define four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for safe handling of biological agents. Each level has specific protections, with higher levels for more dangerous pathogens. BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs are considered high-containment. The guidelines were developed by the DOD, HHS, and USDA to protect lab workers from different pathogen risks. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines define four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for safe handling of biological agents, with criteria for defining levels and best practices for safe laboratory operation. The guidelines also emphasize the importance of considering biosafety levels in relation to both pathogen and experiment, not just specific pathogens. The BMBL describes primary and secondary barriers to infection, as well as standard and special laboratory practices for each biosafety level. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines define four biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) for safe handling of biological agents. The most recent edition of the BMBL includes security guidelines for different biosafety levels. Researchers and laboratory workers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing the laboratory. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its transmission potential, treatment, and research activity. Procedures involving pathogens that may cause disease in humans should be conducted at appropriate biosafety levels (BSL-2 to BSL-4) based on the severity of the potential risks. It is crucial to consider both the pathogen and the procedure when determining the biosafety level for handling deadly pathogens. The BMBL recommends handling the bacteria that causes anthrax at BSL-2 for certain activities and at BSL-3 for work involving production quantities or high concentrations of cultures. Thirteen out of 73 select agents and toxins warrant BSL-4 containment. BSL-4 containment is required for 13 out of 73 select agents and toxins, while 30 others can be studied at BSL-2 depending on circumstances. BSL-4 facilities in the US work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. BSL-3 facilities may not always use select agents, so not all are subject to regulations. Only a small proportion of BSL-2 facilities fall under the Select Agent Program. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is recommended. Compliance with BMBL guidelines is crucial, as it is widely adopted as facility policy and required for federal contracts and grants. Noncompliance can lead to loss of funding. Various laboratories appoint health and safety officials to ensure proper operation of protective equipment. The BMBL guidelines are crucial for laboratories to comply with, as they are required for federal contracts and grants. These guidelines are also incorporated into building design standards, grant requirements, and the Select Agent Program. The design standards for facilities funded by the agency adhere to BMBL guidelines and may include security requirements. The National Institutes of Health has specific design specifications for their buildings, including ventilation, utilities, and access controls. Separate security requirements are outlined in another document, and checklists are used to ensure compliance before laboratories are occupied. The NIH has specific design standards for their facilities, including ventilation and access controls. The laboratory commissioning process follows biosafety guidelines established by HHS through the BMBL. Agencies often contract out the commissioning of laboratories at a specific biosafety level, with guidelines suggesting involvement of companies not part of the facility's design or construction. The NIH Model Commissioning Guide emphasizes the need for highly specialized individuals, such as licensed Professional Engineers, with extensive experience in designing, optimizing, and testing systems for facilities. Laboratory facilities receiving federal funding must adhere to biosafety guidelines outlined in the BMBL. Laboratories receiving federal funding must comply with biosafety guidelines outlined in the BMBL to maintain funding. Non-compliance could result in the withdrawal of existing funding and withholding of future funding. Grantee organizations may need to provide evidence of adherence to health and safety standards if requested by the awarding office. Similar requirements may be included in contracts and other award mechanisms. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research often require the establishment of an institutional biosafety committee (IBC) to oversee compliance with federal guidelines. The IBC has the authority to determine biosafety levels for research activities and can mandate specific precautions. Some suggest expanding the IBC's oversight to other research areas. Some experts propose using Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) to oversee research with biosafety concerns. The Select Agent Program regulations incorporate guidelines from the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), making it mandatory for entities possessing select agents to develop a security plan for compliance. However, some experts argue that the IBC mechanism lacks sufficient oversight for these responsibilities. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in the United States has increased significantly in recent years, with a twelve-fold increase in BSL-4 space since 2004. This expansion is attributed to federal construction, increased funding for research requiring high-containment labs, and oversight processes that include security and biosafety plans reviewed by federal officials. The federal government is investing in the construction of high-containment laboratories for research and public health purposes. Examples of this investment can be seen in various departments such as Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture. These facilities are either federally owned and operated, federally owned but privately operated, or privately owned and operated. This investment is aimed at enhancing government capabilities in biocontainment. The Department of Defense has maintained high-containment laboratories since World War II, focusing on defensive research to protect against biological weapons. President Nixon ended the offensive biological weapons program in 1969, shifting all DOD labs to defensive work. The Department of Defense has high-containment laboratories focused on defensive research to protect against biological weapons. The USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is the sole location of BSL-4 laboratory space in DOD, with a $683 million expansion underway to increase BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory space. Other DOD labs have also increased their BSL-3 capacity since 2001 for research into infectious diseases. The federal government established the National Bioforensics Analysis Center in 2004 under the Department of Homeland Security to analyze pathogens for identifying biological attack perpetrators. The DHS established the National Bioforensics Analysis Center as part of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center in Frederick, MD. Permanent facilities, including a BSL-4 laboratory and BSL-3 laboratories, are under construction and expected to be fully operational in 2010. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center from USDA to DHS due to reaching the end of its usable lifespan. The DHS is replacing the aging PIADC with the new NBAF in Kansas, a BSL-4 laboratory focused on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) maintains BSL-4 laboratories at NIH in Bethesda, MD, and CDC in Atlanta, GA. They have also invested in constructing BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) to support biodefense research. The HHS is building BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX, along with BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) across the United States. These labs will assist in public health efforts during bioterrorism or infectious disease emergencies. Additionally, the HHS has established the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) to coordinate a network of labs for responding to various health emergencies. The LRN coordinates public health labs for emergencies, including those with BSL-3 capabilities. USDA is building new BSL-3 labs in Ames, IA, and Fort Collins, CO. Academic institutions are also investing in labs. Academic institutions, private sector companies, and non-profit institutions are investing in high-containment laboratory facilities, such as BSL-3 labs. This is in response to increased federal funding for biodefense research, with universities like the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University constructing or planning to construct additional high-containment laboratory space to enhance their ability to compete for funding and recruit new faculty. Some companies and institutions maintain high-containment laboratory facilities for medical testing, product development, and manufacturing goals. They may choose to have in-house facilities or contract with firms like Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and Battelle Memorial Institute. The expansion of these labs raises issues for policymakers. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has raised concerns for policymakers regarding capacity, oversight, risk management, international implications, and local considerations. Following the 2001 anthrax mailings, it was evident that existing infrastructure was inadequate, leading to the decision to construct additional facilities despite the high costs involved. The high capital and maintenance costs of constructing high-containment laboratories require federal investment and support. Decision-making on building these facilities lacked a national needs assessment, leading to concerns of overcapacity and safety. A lack of information on high-containment laboratory capacity hinders coordinated planning. Estimates of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories vary and have been criticized for relying heavily on registered facilities. The number of BSL-3 laboratories working with select agents may not require registration. Non-governmental estimates show an increase in high-containment laboratory capability, but the exact number of BSL-3 laboratories is uncertain. A government-wide assessment is needed to determine if construction has exceeded national needs. The construction of high-containment facilities has raised questions about capacity utilization and the need for increased funding for research, operations, and management. A government-wide assessment is necessary to determine if construction has surpassed future national needs. The construction of high-containment facilities has led to concerns about capacity utilization and the potential need for increased funding. Agencies undergoing a large increase in capacity may face higher operations and maintenance costs, regardless of full utilization. Interagency federal planning efforts could help manage overcapacity costs, but would require agreement on prioritization and shared facility use among agencies. The construction of high-containment facilities has raised concerns about capacity utilization and funding. Efforts to coordinate homeland security research and development have not addressed the use of agency laboratory assets. Congress may need to consider central coordination for multi-agency high-containment laboratory use. The growth of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has raised concerns about pathogen release and biological weapon proliferation. Events like laboratory infections and improper shipping have led to a reexamination of oversight frameworks. Consensus on the best approach to overseeing these laboratories has not been reached. Some experts suggest expanding regulations for high-containment laboratories to include mandatory biosafety training and broader biosecurity measures. Others propose enhancing self-regulatory approaches with increased training in best practices and greater worker engagement and responsibility. Increased high-containment laboratory capacity presents both benefits and risks. Increased high-containment laboratory capacity allows for greater diversity of biodefense research and more efficient public health sample testing. However, it also increases the risk of theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens. Legislation has been passed to enhance physical security, but as the number of facilities expands, so does the potential for harm. The expansion of high-containment facilities has led to more facilities possessing select agents, with security weaknesses identified by investigations. Regulatory focus on compliance could help prevent incidents, but growing laboratory capacity may strain resources. Despite planning to minimize accidents, safety controls can be overwhelmed. The GAO has testified that each high-containment facility has an inherent associated risk, which increases as more facilities are constructed. The incremental risk is difficult to measure and may vary depending on compliance with best practices and regulations. Factors contributing to the risk include accidental releases, subsequent illness, and the total number of laboratories. Policymakers may rely on estimates for cost/benefit analysis due to limited information availability. Policymakers may conduct cost/benefit analysis on research in high-containment labs, weighing benefits like biodefense breakthroughs against costs like infections. Institutional effects, like national lab networks and lab technique proliferation, may be overlooked in federal assessments. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety and the potential for insider threats. As more individuals are trained in high-containment techniques, the risk of malicious intent also increases. Some experts argue that these skills are not necessary for a bioterrorist attack, while others believe otherwise. The DOJ asserts that the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax mailings was a government scientist expert in high-containment technique, which may have international ramifications. Other countries may view the increase in high-containment laboratory capacity as excessive and potentially for offensive biological weapons development, damaging U.S. efforts to promote adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention. The expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity in the U.S. may lead to international proliferation of such facilities, increasing the risk of misuse for malevolent purposes. Differences in biosafety regulations among countries could impact business decisions of pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may choose to locate research and production facilities in other countries due to unfavorable regulatory environments in the United States. This could impact national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks, as countries relying on foreign production may face restricted access to treatments during emergencies. Governments might hoard domestically produced countermeasures to prioritize their residents' access. Some U.S. scientists are limiting international collaborations due to differences in biosecurity regulations between countries. This may deter industry from investing in research in the U.S. as perceived barriers to collaboration could lead to companies seeking countries with lower restrictions. The impact of biosecurity regulations on international collaboration and research remains unclear. The presence of U.S. biosecurity standards may influence international partners to adopt similar policies. Local resistance to building high-containment laboratories in the U.S. varies, with some supporting economic benefits while others strongly oppose. Some groups oppose new laboratories due to public health concerns and doubt economic benefits claimed by proponents. Policymakers have options to address these issues, including deferring action until expert panel reports are available. Congress could choose to defer additional action until expert panel reports are complete or decide to increase oversight of facilities, pathogens, or personnel. Balancing security controls with research productivity is crucial, with some in the scientific community supporting measures to reduce terrorist threats while opposing those that hinder scientific progress. Some policymakers oppose measures that restrict research on deadly pathogens, arguing current oversight is sufficient. Supporters of the status quo suggest focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists instead of increasing security in high-containment labs. The Bush Administration created expert groups to examine biosafety and biosecurity issues, suggesting a focus on disrupting bioterrorist activities through intelligence gathering rather than implementing costly regulatory frameworks. Policymakers may defer action to fully understand policy impacts. The Bush Administration established expert groups to address biosafety and biosecurity concerns, focusing on intelligence gathering to combat bioterrorism. Congress could wait for these groups to complete their investigations and recommendations before taking action. Some policymakers may find these efforts insufficient and may require further measures. President Bush established the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States in 2009 through an Executive Order. The group, co-chaired by the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services, includes various other government officials and is tasked with reviewing and evaluating biosecurity laws and practices. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight was formed in December 2007 to review and make recommendations on existing and new biosafety and biosecurity laws, regulations, and practices. Recommendations to the President are due in July 2009. The Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight, co-chaired by HHS and USDA, includes staff from various federal agencies. Recommendations will be presented to HHS and USDA leadership. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies on dual-use research. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies on dual-use research, including oversight frameworks, a code of conduct for researchers, and biosafety training programs. Multiple working groups are analyzing and publishing recommendations. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 addressing high-containment laboratory issues with potential recommendations for legislative and executive branch action. Congress may benefit from waiting for these recommendations. Congress may consider waiting for recommendations from the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity and the GAO regarding high-containment laboratory issues before taking action. This approach could lead to new policy ideas and options. Alternatively, Congress may choose to address the issue without waiting for reports. Previous efforts to determine the number and capacity of such laboratories have been unsuccessful. Previous efforts to determine the number of high-containment laboratories have failed. Various sources have called for a comprehensive inventory of existing capacity, which may be challenging due to the diverse locations and types of non-federal laboratories. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be sufficient to identify all high-containment laboratories. Efforts to identify high-containment laboratories have faced challenges due to diverse locations and types. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be enough to gather information about existing facilities and their capacity. Concerns about competitiveness and reporting burden hinder obtaining a complete inventory. Incentivizing self-reporting or mandating registration with the federal government are potential solutions. Facility registration with the federal government could create a comprehensive list of high-containment laboratories, providing information on capacity, use, and distribution. This approach was part of the early Select Agent Program implementation. One option to address the difficulty of determining the full scope of high-containment laboratories is to limit a survey to federal facilities. Federal agencies could be mandated to report their high-containment facilities and capacity to Congress through the Executive Branch, allowing for efficient planning and resource allocation. The government can assess if federal high-containment capacity exceeds the need, considering resource allocation costs and security concerns. Congress should weigh economic costs of surveying high-containment labs and compare it with a needs assessment to maximize benefits. Some policymakers are calling for a moratorium on new federally funded construction of high-containment laboratories to address the need for a needs assessment and potential costs to research and other priorities. Some policymakers are calling for a moratorium on new federally funded construction of high-containment laboratories to address the need for a needs assessment and potential costs to research and other priorities. The establishment and operation of new high-containment laboratories may lead to over-building and redundant operations among agencies. Incremental increases in capacity may be more beneficial than constructing large amounts of new laboratory space. Some agencies defend constructing new laboratory space by assessing interagency needs on a case by case basis. However, without a government-wide assessment, synergies or existing infrastructure in other agencies may be overlooked. A construction moratorium could impact the federal government's ability to meet national goals. Delays in construction of laboratory facilities may hinder planned research activities and national priorities like establishing a permanent bioforensics capability. Calls for expanding high-containment laboratory facilities could be impeded by a construction moratorium. Some suggest licensing and certifying all high-containment laboratories. One approach to licensing all high-containment laboratories is to apply Select Agent Program requirements, ensuring uniform security standards. Alternatively, directly regulating these laboratories or expanding the Select Agent Program are possible options. Establishing a separately administered program for licensing high-containment laboratories could provide flexibility in requirements, such as differentiating between labs with select agents and those without. However, challenges in implementation and acceptance from the scientific community may arise. Licensing may not cover all laboratories of concern, as select agents could be handled outside of high-containment facilities. A more comprehensive approach to biosecurity oversight would involve regulating all laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment, capturing all locations with sufficient biosecurity for select agent use. However, this approach would lead to overseeing a significantly larger number of facilities, including those handling human-infective pathogens. Facilities handling human-infective pathogens, impacting public health, diagnostic, hospital, industrial, and academic laboratories. Some experts suggest expanding the select agent list to include dangerous pathogens not covered by the current regulations, such as SARS, dengue fever, western equine encephalitis, and yellow fever. Some scientists are concerned about expanding the select agent list to include more pathogens, as the current definition may hinder research by not accurately differentiating between pathogens of concern and similar ones. The NIH has requested the National Academies to determine scientific advances necessary to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy. Focusing on the Select Agent list would only impact entities using pathogens of concern, not other high-containment facilities. This approach could limit disruption of scientific development and public health activities, allowing regulatory efforts to target high-risk laboratories. Current Select Agent Program personnel background checks could be expanded to all personnel using BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities, potentially requiring a different level of background screening for access to high-containment facilities without select agents. The scope of such screening would depend on policymakers' evaluation. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may face challenges, such as resistance to government documentation and certification. Some researchers may choose to leave rather than undergo required clearance. The extent of this resistance is unclear, making effective personnel screening difficult. The Department of Defense has extensive personnel oversight programs for access to select agents, but a DOD scientist was involved in the 2001 anthrax mailings. The Select Agent Program requires worker training tailored to individual needs and work, but lacks specific training standards, risking variation in quality. Developing training standards could help address this issue. Some experts suggest that current biosafety training programs are insufficient to meet demand and should be expanded with standardized training to ensure core competencies. The effects of expanded training on reducing laboratory acquired infections are uncertain, as the rate of these infections is lower than other injuries. Enhanced training for high-containment laboratory workers should include considerations for the dual-use nature of pathogens to address biosecurity concerns. Lessons from incidents can inform improvements in addressing unexpected events. Reporting mechanisms, both voluntary and mandatory, have been suggested and implemented. In high-containment laboratories, reporting mechanisms, whether voluntary or mandatory, are crucial for disseminating information about incidents involving select agents. However, fear of penalties or professional repercussions may deter researchers from reporting, hindering the improvement of safety practices to prevent future events. Some experts suggest enhancing the reporting system in high-containment laboratories to establish a database of accidents and corresponding remediation. This database could provide warnings to scientists to prevent future accidents. Penalties for reporting accidents to this database should be minimized to encourage reporting. Congress may need to consider the balance between encouraging accident reporting in high-containment laboratories and the potential for negligence to go unpunished. Policymakers must weigh the benefits of increased oversight with the regulatory burden it may impose, which could face resistance from scientists and stakeholders. The benefits of enhanced oversight may be challenging to quantify but could mainly manifest in reducing accidents. Increasing the scope of the Select Agent Program may create barriers to public health response and international collaboration, critics argue. Timely transfer of materials between high-containment laboratories is crucial for responding to emerging diseases like SARS and avian influenza. Increasing the scope of the Select Agent Program, with requirements for laboratory and personnel certification, may hinder international collaboration on regulated pathogens. This could impact public health response and scientific research, potentially reducing scientific productivity in academia. Increasing the scope of the Select Agent Program may hinder international collaboration on regulated pathogens, impacting public health response and scientific research. This could reduce scientific productivity in academia and increase costs for public health laboratories and hospitals. Identifying the most appropriate oversight agency remains a key issue. The appropriate oversight agency for regulating pathogens may need to be reassessed due to increasing homeland security concerns. Policymakers may consider assigning this responsibility to a different agency like DHS, rather than the current regulators focused on laboratory safety. If policymakers decide to establish new authorities, oversight may be split between agencies regulating security and high-containment laboratories. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones and potentially consolidating oversight into one agency could facilitate implementation. Limited federal resources have been allocated to overseeing biosafety practices, which are currently voluntary. Expanding biosafety practices for high-containment laboratories may require additional federal resources. The 111th Congress is considering legislation to address the expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity. Bills such as H.R. 1225 and S. 485 aim to extend the authorization of the Select Agent Program and expand criteria for determining select agents. Additional funding and staffing may be needed for agencies overseeing new mandates. The bills under consideration by the 111th Congress aim to enhance the Select Agent Program by requiring reviews and recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences. They also mandate minimum biosafety and biosecurity training for access to select agents, as well as improvements to monitoring and inventory procedures. Additionally, the HHS Secretary must evaluate current and planned capacity and share lessons learned across biodefense and infectious disease sectors. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) aims to improve laboratory capacity and streamline guidance on infrastructure, maintenance, and personnel training. It also establishes a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System for reporting incidents voluntarily. The bill authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories for operation and maintenance costs. The bill requires the DHS Secretary, in consultation with the HHS Secretary, to provide a report to Congress detailing activities to integrate the RBL network and assess the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity for biodefense or infectious disease emergencies. Global biocontainment technologies are widespread, and without international harmonization, domestic policy changes may only partially address the threat of high-containment laboratories being sources of bioterror weapons. The challenge for congressional policymakers is defining the goal of enhanced oversight of high-containment laboratories, which may impact the choice of policies to address bioterror threats. A registry of existing capacity could improve planning and coordination but offer limited security benefits. Rigorous oversight programs, including facility and personnel licensure, mandatory training, and restricted construction of new facilities, may enhance security at a regulatory cost. Restricted construction of new facilities may enhance security but come with regulatory burden, increased federal expenditures, and hindered scientific progress in countermeasure research, bioforensics, and public health. Policymakers must balance competing national needs when considering policy options for these complex issues."
