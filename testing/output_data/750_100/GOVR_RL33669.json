    "content": "The National Security Agency (NSA) faced scrutiny over the secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), sparking a national debate on its legality under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the need for additional authority. The program involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals believed to be associated with al Qaeda. The Bush Administration supported a program for electronic surveillance of individuals affiliated with al Qaeda. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006, along with other bills addressing oversight of surveillance programs in the 109th Congress. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides a framework for electronic surveillance programs to acquire foreign intelligence information. Three bills have been introduced in Congress: H.R. 11, S. 187, and S. 139. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorizes the production of tangible things for foreign intelligence investigations and counterterrorism efforts. The Bush Administration believed electronic surveillance under FISA was valuable but lacked speed in dealing with terrorists. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee about FISC orders issued on January 10, 2007. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) judge issued orders allowing the Government to target international communications involving al Qaeda or associated terrorist members. All surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now require FISC approval. The President decided not to reauthorize the TSP when the current authorization expires. The Attorney General briefed Intelligence Committees on classified FISC orders regarding the NSA program. Legal challenges to the program led to a ruling by Judge Anna Diggs Taylor declaring it unconstitutional. Judge Anna Diggs Taylor ruled the Terrorist Surveillance Program unconstitutional for violating various laws and the U.S. Constitution. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which stayed the judgment pending appeal. The American Civil Liberties Union v. National Security Agency case involves the creation of a new Title VII under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address electronic surveillance programs. This follows a ruling by Judge Anna Diggs Taylor declaring the Terrorist Surveillance Program unconstitutional. The bills aim to amend provisions of FISA related to electronic surveillance, including warrantless surveillance under Attorney General certification, FISA court orders for foreign intelligence surveillance, emergency surveillance, liability limitations for aiding electronic surveillance, and congressional oversight. They would also repeal wartime authorities for warrantless surveillance after a congressional declaration of war and update FISA definitions. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 proposes changes to FISA definitions and criminal provisions, including addressing weapons of mass destruction and international movements of surveillance targets. Sec. 3 of S. 3931 creates a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 proposes changes to FISA definitions and criminal provisions, including addressing weapons of mass destruction and international movements of surveillance targets. S. 3929 creates a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs, defining \"electronic surveillance program\" under Section 701 as a program for gathering foreign intelligence information or protecting against international terrorism. The proposed changes under the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 include granting jurisdiction to the FISC for reviewing and authorizing electronic surveillance programs for obtaining foreign intelligence information or combating international terrorism. Initial authorization can be up to 90 days, with reauthorization determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the Attorney General is notified. The Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal decisions to the FIS Court of Review for electronic surveillance programs. If criteria for surveillance are met, surveillance of a target must be discontinued. The Attorney General must discontinue surveillance of a target under the electronic surveillance program authorized under Title VII of FISA unless certain conditions are met. Surveillance can only continue under Title VII if an application is made for an FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance. The bills also authorize the transfer of cases involving a challenge to the surveillance program. The bills authorize the transfer of cases involving challenges to classified communications intelligence activity related to a foreign threat to the FIS Court of Review if it is deemed necessary for national security. The bills authorize the transfer of cases challenging classified communications intelligence activity to the FIS Court of Review for national security reasons. The Attorney General's affidavit may lead to transfer from the originating court, but the destination court is unclear from the proposed subsections of FISA. The FISC has jurisdiction to determine standing and the legality of programs in criminal proceedings. Disclosure of national security information is governed by specific acts. Decisions of the FISC can be reviewed under proposed subsections. The FISC decisions can be reviewed by the FIS Court of Review and the U.S. Supreme Court. Challenges to electronic surveillance programs can be dismissed by the FISC or originating court. Litigation privileges are preserved under new subsection 702(b)(5). A new Section 703 of FISA is created under S. 3931, outlining requirements for electronic surveillance program applications. The FISC can request additional information from the Attorney General for determinations under Section 704. Section 704 addresses necessary findings for ex parte FISC orders approving surveillance programs. The court must find that approval of the electronic surveillance program is consistent with the U.S. Constitution. New subsection 704(b) of FISA lists factors for assessing constitutionality. Section 705 of FISA addresses congressional oversight, requiring the Attorney General to submit classified reports every 180 days to congressional intelligence committees. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence oversees electronic surveillance programs authorized under FISA, with provisions for congressional committees to obtain necessary information. Amendments to FISA include repealing certain sections. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence oversees electronic surveillance programs authorized under FISA, with provisions for congressional committees to obtain necessary information. Amendments to FISA include repealing Sections 111, 309, and 404, which permit the President to authorize surveillance without a court order for up to 15 days following a declaration of war. The current 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(e) allows officers, employees, or agents of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance in the normal course of their official duty as authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The proposed amendment would clarify and maintain this provision. The current 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) allows the United States Government to acquire foreign intelligence information from international communications using means other than electronic surveillance. The exclusivity provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) prohibits electronic surveillance unless conducted under FISA, chapter 119, or related laws. The amendments to FISA in Sec.8(b)(2) of S. 3931, Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929, address Section 109 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1809, allowing the United States Government to acquire foreign intelligence information authorized under Federal statute or the Constitution. Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929, amended by Sec. 8(b)(2)(A) of S. 3931, criminalizes engaging in unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosing information obtained through such surveillance. The penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance would be increased under the proposed legislation. The proposed legislation would increase penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information, with fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Amendments to FISA include expanding the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals expected to possess foreign intelligence information while in the United States. The proposed legislation would amend FISA by updating the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" to include intentional surveillance directed at a specific individual in the United States. The proposed legislation would update the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA to include intentional surveillance of a specific individual in the United States with a reasonable expectation of privacy. Minimization procedures under FISA aim to limit the acquisition and retention of non-publicly available information on unconsenting U.S. persons during foreign intelligence surveillance. These procedures allow for the retention and dissemination of evidence of criminal activity to law enforcement, while ensuring that non-foreign intelligence information on U.S. persons is not disseminated in a way that identifies them. The information under FISA should not identify any US person without consent, unless necessary for understanding foreign intelligence. Minimization procedures apply to electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence upon AG certification, ensuring no disclosure of communication involving a US person. The proposed changes to FISA would replace subsection 104(h)(4) with new language regarding minimization procedures for electronic surveillance, ensuring that information involving a United States person is not disclosed, disseminated, or retained without proper authorization. The proposed changes to FISA include procedures for electronic surveillance to prevent disclosure of communication from a United States person without proper authorization. The proposed changes to FISA include updating the definition of \"contents\" in communications and authorizing electronic surveillance without a court order. Section 102 of FISA authorizes electronic surveillance without a court order for acquiring foreign intelligence information upon certification by the Attorney General. The proposed amendment expands the application to include electronic surveillance directed at the contents of communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. The proposed amendment to FISA expands electronic surveillance to include foreign powers or agents of foreign powers, removing the requirement for the Attorney General to certify no substantial likelihood of acquiring U.S. person communication contents. The Attorney General must certify and assess compliance with minimization procedures for electronic surveillance directed at agents of foreign powers under FISA. The report must include justification for targeting the individual as a foreign power agent. Under FISA, the Attorney General must certify electronic surveillance of foreign power agents and transmit the certification to the FISC under seal. The Attorney General can direct common carriers to provide necessary assistance for surveillance while maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference with their services. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA creates new authority for the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize surveillance for up to one year on individuals believed to be outside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes. The Attorney General can certify in writing under oath that the acquisition of foreign intelligence information outside the United States does not constitute electronic surveillance, involves obtaining information from a wire or electronic communications service provider, and has a significant purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence. The Attorney General can certify in writing under oath that the acquisition of foreign intelligence information outside the United States does not constitute electronic surveillance, involves obtaining information from a wire or electronic communications service provider, and has a significant purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence. The certification need not identify specific locations, and compliance with the Attorney General's certification and minimization procedures is required. The Attorney General is also required to report assessments of compliance to congressional intelligence committees. The Attorney General can certify in writing under oath that the acquisition of foreign intelligence information outside the United States does not constitute electronic surveillance. The certification would be transmitted to the FISC and maintained under seal unless necessary for legality determination. The Attorney General would be authorized to direct a person to provide assistance for the acquisition while protecting secrecy and minimizing interference with services to the target. The Attorney General can direct a person to provide assistance for acquiring foreign intelligence information outside the US. The person must keep records under approved security procedures. If the person fails to comply, the Attorney General can seek FISC's help to enforce compliance, with contempt of court as a possible consequence. Compensation at prevailing rates is required for the aid provided. Under the new FISA provision, a person can challenge a directive by filing a petition with the FISC judges. The assigned judge must review the petition within 24 hours. If deemed frivolous, the petition will be denied, and the directive affirmed. The FISC judge must affirm a petition challenging a directive within 72 hours if not deemed frivolous. If the directive is not modified or set aside, immediate compliance is ordered. A petition to the FIS Court of Review can be made if seeking review of an FISC decision. The FIS Court of Review must provide a written statement of reasons for its decision within seven days of the FISC decision. The record must be transmitted under seal to the U.S. Supreme Court for review. Judicial proceedings under Section 102 of FISA must be conducted expeditiously. The record of FISA proceedings, including petitions, orders, and reasons for decisions, must be securely maintained. Petitions are to be filed under seal. Government submissions with classified information may be reviewed by the court privately. No legal action can be taken against communication service providers. The proposed subsection 102(k) of FISA allows information acquired under an Attorney General authorization to be used or disclosed by federal officers without the consent of the United States person, as long as minimization procedures are followed. Legal action cannot be taken against communication service providers for providing information to the Government under new subsections 102(a) or 102(b). Proposed subsection 102(l) of FISA prohibits the disclosure of information acquired under Section 102 for law enforcement purposes without the advance authorization of the Attorney General. Additionally, subsection 102(k) ensures that privileged communications obtained under Section 102 retain their privileged status. Proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) of FISA outline procedures for using or disclosing information acquired under Section 102 in federal or state proceedings. The federal government can only introduce or use such information in court proceedings against an aggrieved person if it complies with the requirements of the proposed subsection. The Government must notify the aggrieved person and the court of its intent to use information obtained under Section 102 in proceedings. States or political subdivisions can only introduce such information in court proceedings if it complies with the requirements outlined in FISA. The state or political subdivision must notify the aggrieved person, court, and U.S. Attorney General before using information acquired under Section 102 in legal proceedings. The aggrieved person can move to suppress evidence from Section 102 acquisitions if unlawfully obtained. The motion to suppress evidence acquired under Section 102 of FISA can be made before the trial if unlawfully obtained or not in conformity with authorization. If the Attorney General files an affidavit that disclosure would harm national security, a court may be notified. The U.S. district court will determine the legality of seeking Attorney General directives or materials related to Section 102 acquisition, or evidence obtained from it, in response to a motion to suppress filed under FISA. The U.S. district court will review the Attorney General's directive and related materials to determine the legality of the acquisition under Section 102 of FISA. The court may disclose relevant portions to the aggrieved person if necessary for an accurate determination. If a Section 102 acquisition under FISA is found to be unlawfully authorized or conducted, evidence obtained would be suppressed. If deemed lawful, the court may deny the aggrieved person's motion, except for necessary discovery or disclosure. Any decisions or orders related to Section 102 acquisitions may require review or disclosure of relevant materials. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers acquiring foreign intelligence information to coordinate with law enforcement to investigate or protect against threats from foreign powers or terrorism. The decisions related to Section 102 acquisitions may require disclosure of relevant materials. Proposed subsection 102(u) of FISA mandates retention of directives and orders for 10 years. Amendments authorize the Chief Justice to designate district court judges for FISA cases. States to publicly designate 11 district court judges from at least seven U.S. judicial circuits as FISC judges, with a requirement for at least three to reside within 20 miles of Washington D.C. New authority is proposed for FISC orders under Title I of FISA if the President authorizes the Attorney General in writing. FISC judges can approve electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The amendments to FISA include changes to the certification requirements for electronic surveillance orders, with new subsections replacing current ones. Certification is now made by designated executive branch officials. The amendments to FISA include changes to the certification requirements for electronic surveillance orders, with certification now made by designated executive branch officials in the area of national security or defense. The amendments to FISA include changes to the certification requirements for electronic surveillance orders, with certification now made by designated executive branch officials in the area of national security or defense. The application for surveillance must include information about the surveillance techniques and U.S. persons likely to be obtained, as well as whether physical entry is required for the surveillance. The amendments to FISA include changes to the certification requirements for electronic surveillance orders, with certification now made by designated executive branch officials in the area of national security or defense. Sec. 104(b) of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1804(b), would expand the list of officials who can request a personal review of surveillance applications under subsection 104(a) to include the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The proposed amendment to FISA would change the process for approving electronic surveillance orders, removing the requirement for the President's authorization and redesignating subsections within the act. The proposed amendment to FISA would redesignate subsections within the act, including specifying new requirements for electronic surveillance orders. The proposed amendment to FISA would redesignate subsections within the act, including specifying new requirements for electronic surveillance orders. Section 1805 specifies the use of multiple surveillance devices and minimization procedures. Subsection 105(d) excludes certain information from applications for court orders authorizing electronic surveillance on foreign powers and their facilities. The proposed amendment to FISA would redesignate subsections within the act, including specifying new requirements for electronic surveillance orders. Each order under this section must specify the type of electronic surveillance involved, including whether physical entry is required. Extensions of an order authorizing electronic surveillance may be granted on the same basis as an original order, with new findings required for an extension. The proposed amendment to FISA would allow extensions of surveillance orders under specific conditions, such as targeting foreign powers or groups engaged in international terrorism. Extensions may be granted for up to one year if no communication of any individual United States person will be acquired during the period. The proposed amendment to FISA allows extensions of surveillance orders for up to one year, targeting foreign powers or groups engaged in international terrorism. Extensions require new findings and may not exceed one year or a reasonable period determined by the court. The current subsection 105(f) of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(f) allows emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General in cases of emergency situations for obtaining foreign intelligence information. The Attorney General must notify a FISC judge of the emergency surveillance. The current subsection 105(f) of FISA allows emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General in cases of emergency situations for obtaining foreign intelligence information. This authorization must be sought within 72 hours, and if not approved by FISC or at the end of the 72 hours, surveillance must be terminated. The proposed legislation would replace the current subsection 105(f) with a new one. The new language in subsection 105(f) of FISA would grant emergency electronic surveillance authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Attorney General must be informed of the surveillance, and a FISC judge must also be notified under the new law. The new law requires immediate notification to a FISC judge after authorizing emergency electronic surveillance. An application must be made to the FISC judge within seven days of authorization, compared to the current 72-hour requirement. The current subsection 105(f) authorizes surveillance, which terminates when information is obtained, application is denied, or after 72 hours from Attorney General approval. Proposed amendment replaces 72 hours with seven days for approval by an executive branch officer appointed by the President. The President, with Senate consent, can authorize emergency electronic surveillance. The restrictions on disclosure and use of information obtained from such surveillance align with existing law. Minimization procedures must be followed when authorizing emergency surveillance. The modification of subsection 105(f)(1)(D) of FISA requires minimization procedures to be followed for electronic surveillance. Additionally, amendments to subsection 105(i) limit liability for providers assisting with FISA surveillance or searches, protecting them from legal action if aid is provided in accordance with a court order or request. The modification of FISA requires minimization procedures for electronic surveillance and limits liability for providers assisting with surveillance or searches if aid is provided in accordance with a court order or request. Sec. 106 of FISA limits the use of information acquired from electronic surveillance on unconsenting U.S. persons and includes notification requirements. The modification of FISA allows for suppression of unlawfully acquired information in official proceedings and modifies the destruction of unintentionally acquired information in certain circumstances. The amendment to subsection 106(i) of FISA in Sec. 209(g)(1)(B) of S. 3886 and Sec. 9(g)(1)(B) of S. 2453 is unclear, indicating a potential change in the handling of certain communications under the law. The amendment to subsection 106(i) of FISA would insert language to clarify the handling of communications containing significant foreign intelligence information. The amendment to subsection 106(i) of FISA would expand the circumstances for the destruction of unintentionally acquired communication contents, requiring destruction unless deemed to contain significant foreign intelligence or indicate a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The amending language in the current text suggests redundancy in the inclusion of certain phrases. Amendments to FISA sections 106(k) and 108 add new requirements for oversight by the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence. The National Intelligence, in consultation with key agencies, is conducting a feasibility study to develop a secure document management system for FISC orders authorizing electronic surveillance. The feasibility study is being conducted to develop a secure document management system for FISC orders authorizing electronic surveillance, with amendments made to Title I of FISA to include new categories of persons as \"agents of a foreign power.\" The amendment to FISA includes new categories of persons as \"agents of a foreign power,\" expanding the definition to cover individuals involved in the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or activities related to it. The amendment to FISA broadens the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals engaged in sabotage, international terrorism, or the development of weapons of mass destruction for a foreign power. The amendment to FISA expands the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include destructive devices, weapons involving toxic chemicals, biological agents, and weapons releasing radiation or radioactivity. The amendment to FISA broadens the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include devices that release radiation or radioactivity at dangerous levels. It also expands the scope to cover the development and proliferation of such weapons, in addition to sabotage and international terrorism. Amendments to FISA sections address the duration and extension of surveillance orders for international targets. The amendment to FISA expands the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" and addresses the duration and extension of surveillance orders for international targets. New subsections would be added to FISA to ensure surveillance remains in force even if the target is outside the United States unless a motion to extinguish the order is granted by the court. The government files a motion to extinguish the order, and the court grants it. Amendments to FISA include replacing Section 102, repealing wartime authorities, and creating a new Title VII."
