    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for volumes of cellulosic biofuel under the Clean Air Act. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to provide estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the Energy Information Administration to estimate cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the current calendar year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to estimate the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility based on actual production during a specific period. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the Energy Information Administration to determine the estimated annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility based on its average monthly production. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to estimate the annual cellulosic biofuel production volume for a facility based on its monthly production averages. For each cellulosic biofuel production facility starting production after January 1 of the current year, specific requirements apply. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the Energy Information Administration to estimate the annual cellulosic biofuel production volume for a facility based on its monthly production averages. For new facilities starting production after January 1 of the current year, specific requirements apply to determine the average monthly volume produced. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to estimate annual cellulosic biofuel production volume for a facility based on monthly averages, with specific requirements for new facilities starting production after January 1 and ending on October 31 of the current year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the Energy Information Administration to estimate annual cellulosic biofuel production volume for a facility based on monthly averages. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration to estimate the total production volume of cellulosic biofuel for the upcoming year based on projected volumes from all relevant facilities. The Clean Air Act is amended to specify the calculation method for cellulosic biofuel production volumes and define cellulosic biofuel. The Clean Air Act is amended to exclude compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, or electricity from biogas produced from landfills or wastewater treatment facilities from the definition of cellulosic biofuel. The Clean Air Act excludes certain types of biogas from the definition of cellulosic biofuel, including biogas produced from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, agricultural digesters, and separated municipal solid waste digesters. The regulation of cellulosic and advanced fuel pathways is addressed in the final rule of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Clean Air Act excludes certain types of biogas from the definition of cellulosic biofuel. Mitigation requirements related to cellulosic biofuel pathways under the renewable fuel standard will be reissued to conform to amendments. In the Clean Air Act, remove the volume of cellulosic biofuel for 2014."
