Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs between the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. island territories. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal waterways and harbor channels. The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) gives the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responsibility for maintaining federal navigation channels, impacting the U.S. economy due to the increase in merchandise trade since 1986. Harbor maintenance costs are supported by a harbor maintenance tax (HMT) on imported and domestic waterborne cargo and cruise passengers. The harbor maintenance tax (HMT) is imposed on imported and domestic waterborne cargo and cruise passengers at a rate of 0.125% of the cargo value or cruise ticket price. The revenue generated goes into the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF) to cover costs of dredging channels, maintaining jetties, and operating locks at coastal and Great Lakes ports. The fund can only be used with an appropriation by Congress. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is collected on waterborne cargo and cruise passengers to fund harbor maintenance. The revenue goes into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), which can only be accessed with congressional approval. Surplus HMT receipts reduce the federal budget deficit, with a balance of $8.5 billion in the trust fund as of July 2013. In FY2014, the Corps expects $1.8 billion from the HMT and $247 million in interest for the HMTF. The HMTF is set to receive $2.05 billion from the harbor maintenance tax and interest. Proposed bills aim to increase spending on harbor maintenance, ensuring HMT revenues are used for this purpose. H.R. 3080 would gradually increase HMTF expenditures, with a target of 80% by FY2020. Increasing HMTF expenditures annually would ensure 80% of the prior fiscal year's HMT collected is spent on harbor maintenance. This could potentially reduce funding for other Corps activities like harbor construction or flood control. Congress may need to allocate more funds to the energy and water development appropriation to compensate for the increased HMTF funding, which could impact activities outside this appropriation to stay within federal budget caps. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established by Congress in 1986 to pay for eligible operations and maintenance costs of commercial navigation in harbors and inland harbors in the United States. Harbors are defined as capable of transporting commercial cargo by commercial vessels, while inland harbors are used for accommodating commercial vessels and shipping waterborne cargoes on inland waters. The definitions of \"inland harbors\" and \"coastal or Great Lakes harbors\" have key distinctions, with inland harbors required to currently handle cargo. Commercial cargo includes passengers transported for compensation but excludes fresh-caught fish. The definitions have remained unchanged since 1986, and the Corps did not conduct a rulemaking to implement the harbor maintenance provisions in WRDA 1986. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as a purpose. Harbor projects are usually authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects, with O&M costs payable from the HMTF. For \"multi-purpose\" projects, only costs related to commercial navigation are eligible for HMTF recovery. Joint-use costs allocated to commercial navigation are eligible for recovery from the HMTF. High-use ports, handling over 10 million tons of freight per year, accounted for 90% of maritime commerce and received two-thirds of HMTF spending in FY2013. Moderate-use ports, handling between 1 million and 10 million tons of cargo, accounted for 9% of maritime commerce and received 19% of HMTF spending. Low-use ports had minimal HMTF spending and fewer O&M projects planned. In FY2013, high-use ports received two-thirds of HMTF spending, while low-use ports had minimal funding and fewer O&M projects planned. This allocation of funds is a key point of debate in the HMTF discussion between S. 601 and H.R. 3080. The allocation of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending is a key point of debate between S. 601 and H.R. 3080. H.R. 3080 aims to prevent damage to local economies by ensuring fair distribution of funds, while S. 601 appears to prioritize funding for large commercial cargo ports. Corps data show 1,228 waterways eligible for HMTF reimbursement for operations and maintenance. Almost 75% of the 1,228 waterways eligible for Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending handled little or no cargo, with 61% carrying no cargo from FY2005 to FY2009. Additionally, 100 waterways handled less than one truckload of cargo per day, and 50 waterways handled less than the equivalent of one Panamax shipload per year. The Administration's budget requests for the Corps have directed the majority of HMTF spending to high-use harbors based on cargo volume, rather than cargo value. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) spending is based on the volume of cargo, favoring ports handling tankers, bulk ships carrying grains, ores, and coal. Using a value-based metric could direct more funds to ports with container ships, concentrating funding on major container ports like Los Angeles, Long Beach, New York/New Jersey, Savannah, and Oakland. In 2012, U.S. maritime container shipments were mainly handled by ports, with high-use ports receiving only half of requested O&M funds in FY2011. Moderate-use ports received 30% of requested funds, while low-use harbors received 10%. Despite low-use harbors requesting $766 million, nearly as much as the busiest harbors' $922 million, they only received one-tenth of the funds needed according to local Corps officials. The most economically significant ports received only half of the funds requested in 2008, with the 59 busiest commercial shipping channels operating at authorized widths and depths only 30% of the time. A 2012 National Academy of Sciences study highlighted the financial stresses on the Corps, leading to partial investments across many facilities instead of larger investments in critical facilities. When measuring harbor traffic in terms of ship capacity, it is more concentrated than when measured by tonnage. 90% of ship traffic occurs at the top 35 ports, with the top 10 ports accounting for 60% of commercial ship calls. The Corps may consider concentrating O&M funds on high-use harbors for national economic benefit, potentially hindering moderate-use ports from developing into high-use ports due to lack of channel depth. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance needed every few years. From FY1999 to FY2008, 400 to 500 harbors and channels received maintenance annually. Despite authorization for 1,400 projects, only 360 are actively maintained by the Corps. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance needed every few years. Despite authorization for 1,400 projects, only 360 are actively maintained. It is unclear if the Corps is maintaining fewer projects due to policy, funding, or maintenance needs. A 2003 study highlighted the lack of systematic reevaluation of economic justification for federal investment in harbor projects. The Corps' current policies and management tools are inadequate for identifying inefficient harbor projects and managing maintenance. There is a need for explicit requirements and procedures to confirm the economic viability of projects and reevaluate them when necessary. The 2003 Corps study revealed that many harbor projects authorized decades ago are now underutilized due to the availability of alternative transportation methods. Small harbors once vital for maritime commerce are now mainly used for pleasure boats. The Corps retains responsibility for maintaining protected channels and small harbors, mainly funded by a cargo tax. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest some inland waterways projects not needed for commercial cargo. Recent initiatives prioritize harbor maintenance projects of commercial importance. The Corps developed a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" in 2008 to allocate funds among harbors objectively. The Corps prioritizes allocation of funds among harbors based on data on commercial tonnage, value, and ship transits. Recent budget guidance shows the use of metrics to group projects, with criteria including tonnage and cost per ton for commercial navigation. Other criteria considered are support for commercial fishing, public transportation, and public safety. The Corps prioritizes allocation of funds among harbors based on data on commercial tonnage, value, and ship transits. Recent budget guidance shows the use of metrics to group projects, with criteria including tonnage and cost per ton for commercial navigation, support for commercial fishing, public transportation, public safety, infrastructure condition, and legal requirements. The large number of criteria raises concerns about the lack of clarity on which harbor navigation projects would qualify for priority funding. In a 2008 report, the Government Accountability Office recommended creating an advisory committee to provide input on national harbor maintenance projects. The 2010 GAO report raised concerns about the Corps' lack of transparency in prioritizing harbor maintenance projects. Congress is worried that the criteria used may not lead to the highest return on investment. The Corps' budget process focuses more on anticipated rather than demonstrated project performance, but the O&M budget does reflect actual performance for completed projects. In the Operation and Maintenance program, actual project performance is assessed against authorized purposes to determine budget priority. Opportunity cost is a significant metric for distributing funds efficiently to harbors, considering the economic benefits of maintenance. Former Secretary of the Army highlighted the importance of this concept. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly. The costs of operations and maintenance activities funded from the HMTF vary among ports, with higher costs at smaller ports compared to major cargo ports. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly. The Corps maintains federally designated channels, and the HMTF pays for 100% of the federal cost of maintaining harbors up to 45 feet in depth. For harbors deeper than 45 feet, a non-federal sponsor is responsible for 50% of the additional cost. S. 601 would change the non-federal cost share. S. 601 would modify the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M, with local cost-sharing needed only for channels deeper than 50 feet. New construction costs are not covered by the HMTF and are funded by general government revenues. The federal share of construction costs varies based on harbor depth, with general fund expenditures for construction at coastal harbors totaling $175 million in FY2013. S. 601 would allow ports with excess revenue from the Harbor Maintenance Tax to use funds from the HMTF for dredging berths or removing contaminated sediments. H.R. 3080 expands the use of the Harbor Maintenance Tax Fund (HMTF) for dredging berths and contaminated sediments under certain conditions. The bill could potentially benefit ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach, leading to a redistribution of funds from other ports. In 2011, New York harbor generated $132 million, about 15% of total HMT collections that year. Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors generated about a quarter of the total HMT collections. The top 15 harbors in terms of tax receipts collect more than 75% of total HMT revenue, raising concerns about equity and efficiency. The Corps maintains harbors for public safety reasons, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft authorized by Congress between 1850 and 1950. The Corps prioritizes funding for \"critical\" harbors of refuge, subsistence harbors, and channels used by passenger ferries. In FY2011-FY2014 budget justifications, 30 harbors were identified for O&M funding based on these criteria. (No harbor is funded solely for one purpose, so a subsistence harbor may also be a harbor of refuge.) In FY2012-FY2014, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated an additional $30 million for the maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors. They criticized the administration's criteria for not allowing these harbors to compete for navigation maintenance funds and urged the Corps to revise the criteria for a fair allocation. Projects are funded to develop an equitable allocation based on economic impact, particularly for projects important to national defense or public health and safety. President Clinton proposed phasing out federal funding for harbors not contributing to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, identifying 501 projects totaling $63 million annually. The Clinton Administration proposed shifting responsibility for maintaining harbors to state and local governments to focus the Corps on national water projects. President Reagan had suggested cutting funding for harbors with high federal maintenance costs to save $150 million annually. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was established as a user fee during the Reagan Administration. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was enacted as a user fee during the Reagan Administration after Congress rejected the original proposal to allow local port authorities to assess fees on ships for harbor maintenance. Debate over maintaining harbors with little commercial cargo dates back to the 1950s, with the Corps' policy not to maintain harbors with minimal commercial navigation. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was established to maintain navigable waterways, but there is no obligation to maintain economically unviable waterways. Recent minimum appropriations have prevented funds from being used on obsolete waterways. A 1956 audit found that the Corps was maintaining channels mainly used by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to their policy. The General Accounting Office recommended Congress establish specific policies for maintenance criteria. The GAO recommended that Congress establish specific policies for determining which navigation projects should be federally funded. They identified 11 coastal projects of questionable value, with only two still carrying cargo. One project, the Okeechobee Waterway in Florida, was recommended to be reclassified as a flood-control project due to its minimal navigation benefits. Reclassification would have made the waterway ineligible for Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund funding. The waterway in question did not get reclassified, allowing it to receive $30 million from the HMTF between FY1999 to FY2008. It handled 21 barges and 2,000 tons of cargo in 2012, along with 3,997 recreational vessels. Another project in Texas received $17 million from the HMTF but has not moved any cargo in recent years. Recent budget requests have shifted O&M expenses to flood risk mitigation instead of navigation, highlighting the positive economic impact of recreational harbors. Recreational harbors have a positive local economic impact, with studies showing that boaters on the Great Lakes spend billions annually and create thousands of jobs. While recreational boaters do not contribute to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), they do pay federal fuel taxes that support various boating-related programs and facilities. The use of boat fuel taxes for harbor dredging dates back to a time when it was funded from general revenues. The Corps is exploring local financing for harbor maintenance through a pilot program on the Atlantic Coast. However, crucial information on current HMTF expenditure is not publicly available. The Corps has not made current HMTF expenditure reports publicly available, including data comparing harbor usage with O&M expenses. Congress requested annual reports on HMTF status in 1992, but the most recent report on the Corps website covers FY2005 and FY2006. The Corps has continued to request funds for these reports in its yearly budget justifications. The Corps tracks tonnage and vessels using channels and waterways since 1977 but faces issues with matching facility nomenclature. They lack comparisons of channel dimensions to modern vessel needs and economic losses from deficiencies. The Corps has established the Navigation Economic Technologies Program (NETS) to develop economic tools for navigation improvement evaluation. The program focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects. The Corps focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects, rather than maintenance of existing harbors and channels. Congress requested estimates for nationwide channel availability and funding needed to increase availability to 95% over three years, but this information was not included in the FY2014 budget request. The Federal Maritime Commission estimates the average HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container is $109, which is small compared to cargo value but significant against typical freight charges. Shipping a 40-foot container from Asia to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000, with imported electronics valued at $117,606 being assessed an HMT of $147, increasing shipping costs by about 4%. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) raises port-to-destination shipping costs by about 4%. U.S. ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders claim that the HMT diverts inbound cargo to ports in Canada or Mexico due to the lack of a similar tax. Factors like risk mitigation and rail rate disparities also influence shippers' decisions, according to a 2012 FMC study. If an equivalent fee were imposed on cargo coming to the United States through Canadian West Coast ports, shippers would divert roughly 59,000 to 72,500 40-foot containers per year from Canadian to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to introduce legislation to replace the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) with a maritime goods movement user fee to reduce incentives for shipment through Canada and Mexico. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) may hinder transshipment of cargo by sea between U.S. ports. Domestic waterborne cargo between U.S. harbors only pays the HMT once, but if cargo is unloaded at a U.S. port and reloaded on another ship, the HMT is levied twice. This could discourage coastal feeder service, which struggles to compete with road and rail for container transshipment at U.S. ports. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) poses challenges for domestic waterborne shippers, with up to $500 million per year going uncollected. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable, impacting the price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. Exporters do not pay the HMT for port use when exporting a product. The debate over WRDA is happening in the context of concerns about the cost-effectiveness of industrial supply chains. House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are worried that the President's budget requests for Corps O&M in FY2013 and FY2014 are not enough to maintain competitiveness in the global marketplace. They have directed the Corps to use additional funds for harbors to enhance international competitiveness. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce have launched the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative to improve the nation's marine transportation system and infrastructure for international competitiveness. Supply chain competitiveness affects product costs and global prices, influencing investment decisions. The importance of supply chain competitiveness for global prices and investment decisions is highlighted in a 2010 analysis comparing the United States and China. It emphasizes the need for alignment between supply chain management and strategic priorities. In 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to address these issues. In 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to improve transportation infrastructure investments by aligning waterside and landside infrastructure investment along national priorities. President Obama announced an initiative to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in response to the Panama Canal expansion. A task force was established with officials from various departments and White House offices to address the need for a strategic framework in allocating federal investments in response to requests from state and local governments, ports, and maritime stakeholders."
