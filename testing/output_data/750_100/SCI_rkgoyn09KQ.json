    "content": "In this work, a neural autoregressive topic model is combined with a LSTM based language model to address challenges in probabilistic topic modelling. The approach aims to incorporate language structure by considering word order in local collocation patterns, improving the estimation of word probabilities in a given context. The ctx-DocNADE model combines a topic model and a language model to learn word meanings and thematic structures in documents. It addresses challenges in probabilistic topic modeling by considering word order and local collocation patterns. Limited context or small training corpora can be problematic for topic models in short texts or sparse document collections. The ctx-DocNADE model incorporates external knowledge into neural autoregressive topic models using word embeddings in a LSTM-LM to improve word-topic mapping in small or short-text corpora. The novel neural autoregressive topic model variants with neural language models and embeddings priors outperform state-of-the-art generative topic models in generalization, interpretability, and applicability over long-text. Probabilistic topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE variants are commonly used to extract topics from text collections and predict word probabilities in documents. These models learn latent document representations for NLP tasks such as IR, document classification, and summarization, but they do not consider word order and treat context as a bag of words, neglecting semantic information. Traditional topic models like LDA, RSM, and DocNADE do not consider word order and language structure, treating context as a bag of words. This limits their ability to capture semantic information when estimating word probabilities in a given context. The word \"bear\" in the second sentence is likely related to stock market trading, as indicated by the preceding words \"market falls.\" Language structure and functional words are ignored in topic models, but a deep contextualized LSTM-based language model has shown promise in capturing different language nuances. Recent studies have integrated latent topics and neural language models to improve language models with global dependencies, focusing on capturing semantics at a document level. Recent studies have integrated latent topics and neural language models to improve language models with global dependencies, focusing on capturing semantics at a document level. While bi-gram LDA and n-gram based topic models can capture word order in short contexts, they struggle with long term dependencies and language concepts. In contrast, DocNADE variants learn word occurrences across documents with a coarse granularity, but ignore language structure due to the Bag of Words assumption. Recurrent neural networks have shown a significant reduction in perplexity over standard n-gram models in language modeling. The proposed neural topic model, named ctx-DocNADE, integrates language structure into neural autoregressive models using LSTM-LM. It accurately predicts words by considering global and local contexts, offering complementary semantics through joint word and latent topic learning. The neural topic model, ctx-DocNADE, integrates language structure into neural autoregressive models using LSTM-LM to predict words accurately by considering global and local contexts. It combines joint word and latent topic learning to capture semantics, particularly in long texts and corpora with many documents. However, learning from contextual information remains challenging in settings with short texts and few documents due to limited word co-occurrences and significant word non-overlap. Distributional word representations, such as word embeddings, have shown to capture semantic and syntactic relatedness in words, unlike traditional topic models with \"BoW\" assumption. This is especially beneficial in scenarios with short texts and limited word co-occurrences, where traditional models struggle to infer relatedness between words. In the distributed embedding space, word pairs are semantically related, as shown in FIG0. Previous work integrated word embeddings into LDA and DMM models, outperforming traditional topic models. Contribution 2: Distributed compositional priors are incorporated in DocNADE by using pre-trained word embeddings via LSTM-LM to enhance learning latent topics and textual representations on smaller corpora or short texts. By integrating similarities in a distributed space and leveraging complementary information through LSTM-LM, the topic representation becomes more coherent. This approach combines the benefits of complementary learning and external knowledge, merging topic and language models with pre-trained word embeddings to model short texts effectively. Our approach, ctx-DocNADEe, combines topic and language models with pre-trained word embeddings to model short and long text documents. It improves textual representations in terms of generalizability, interpretability, and applicability. When applied to various datasets, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative topic models, resulting in a gain of 4.6% in topic coherence. Our proposed modeling approaches, named textTOvec, generate contextualized topic vectors for short-text and long-text documents. The models result in a gain of 4.6% in topic coherence, 6.5% in precision at retrieval fraction 0.02, and 4.4% in F1 for text classification across various datasets. The code for textTOvec is available at https://github.com/pgcool/textTOvec. Generative models like Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) BID9 and its variants BID11 are used to estimate the probability distribution of multidimensional data. NADE BID13 decomposes the joint distribution of binary observations into autoregressive conditional distributions, modeled using a feed-forward network for tractable gradients of data negative log-likelihood. DocNADE BID12 models collections of documents as orderless bags of words. DocNADE BID12 models collections of documents as orderless bags of words, learning word representations reflecting document topics only. It disregards language structure and semantic features encoded in word embeddings. Autoregressive conditional distributions are computed using a feed-forward neural network for word observations. The log-likelihood of a document in DocNADE models is computed using a weight matrix connecting hidden to output, bias vectors, and a word representation matrix. The document is treated as a bag of words, and autoregressive conditional distributions are calculated using a neural network for word observations. The DocNADE model computes hi and p(vi|v<i) in Table 1, with extensions ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe incorporating language structure and external knowledge. These models consider word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge to overcome BoW-based representation limitations. DocNADE and ctx-DocNADE models represent each document as a sequence of words. In ctx-DocNADE, the conditional probability of a word is based on two hidden vectors. The weight matrix in DocNADE encodes topic information for each hidden topic feature. The weight matrix in DocNADE encodes topic information for hidden topic features and word vectors. The LSTM component shares the weight matrix to incorporate global and local influences, representing column vectors in the embedding layer. This extends DocNADE by considering word order and language concepts through context-dependent representations. The second version adds distributional priors to ctx-DocNADE. The second version of the model extends ctx-DocNADE by incorporating distributional priors, initializing the LSTM embedding layer with a pre-trained matrix E and weight matrix W. The DocNADE component reduces computational complexity by reusing linear activations with tied weights. In each epoch, an LSTM is run over the word sequence to extract hidden vectors hLMi corresponding to ci. The computational complexity in ctx-DocNADE or ctx-DocNADEe is O(HD + N), where N is the total number of edges in the LSTM network. The models can be used to extract a textTOvec representation. In ctx-DeepDNEe, DocNADE and LSTM can be extended to a deep, multiple hidden layer architecture for improved performance. In improving topic models, the modeling approaches combine DocNADE with language concepts from LSTM-LM for short-text analysis. State-of-the-art comparison includes IR-precision and classification F1 scores. The study evaluates the performance of DocNADE combined with LSTM-LM language concepts on short-text and long-text datasets. Four quantitative measures are used: generalization, topic coherence, text retrieval, and categorization. Baselines are compared, and data statistics are provided in TAB1. The study focuses on improving topic models for various tasks. In comparing performance of proposed models ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe with related baselines, various word and document representation methods are evaluated, including glove, doc2vec, LDA based BoW TMs, neural BoW TMs, and jointly trained topic and language models. Experimental setup involves training DocNADE on a reduced dataset. Experimental Setup: DocNADE is trained on full text/vocabulary (FV) and document representations are computed for different evaluation tasks. The models were run over 200 topics using glove embeddings of 200 dimensions to quantify the quality of learned representations. To improve complementary learning in ctx-DocNADEs, pre-training is done for 10 epochs with \u03bb set to 0. Experimental setup details and hyperparameters for tasks, including ablation over \u03bb on validation set, can be found in the appendices. BID14 is used for short-text datasets to assess representation quality in sparse data setting. Generative performance of topic models is evaluated by estimating log-probabilities for test documents and computing average held-out. The log-probabilities for test documents are estimated to compute average held-out perplexity per word. DocNADE ignores the mixture coefficient to determine the exact log-likelihood in ctx-DocNADE versions. The optimal \u03bb is determined based on the validation set, with ctx-DocNADE achieving lower perplexity scores compared to baseline DocNADE for both short and long texts. In the FV setting, ctx-DocNADE outperforms baseline DocNADE on AGnewstitle and 20NS 4 datasets. Topic coherence is assessed using BID4 BID19 BID7 measures, with higher scores indicating more coherent topics. Gensim module is used to estimate coherence for 200 topics, showing higher scores in ctx-DocNADE compared to DocNADE. The introduction of embeddings in ctx-DocNADEe boosts topic coherence, leading to a 4.6% gain on average over 11 datasets. Proposed models outperform baselines methods glove-DMM and glove-LDA. Table 8 illustrates an example topic from the 20NSshort text dataset for DocNADE, ctx-DocNADE, and ctx-DocNADEe, showing that the inclusion of embeddings results in a more coherent topic. Our proposed models improve topic models for textual representations by incorporating language concepts and external knowledge via neural language models. The focus is on enhancing topic models, unlike previous studies that focused on improving language models using topic models. The performance of our models is quantitatively compared to TCNLM in the experimental setup. In the most recent work, the performance of our models (ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe) is compared to TCNLM in terms of topic coherence on the BNC dataset. Different sliding window sizes and mixture weights are tested, showing results for various models. The top 5 words of seven learned topics from the models are also presented. The comparison between our proposed models (ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe) and TCNLM in terms of topic coherence on the BNC dataset revealed that the inclusion of word embeddings in ctx-DocNADEe resulted in more coherent topics. However, ctx-DocNADEe did not show improvements in topic coherence over ctx-DocNADE. Additionally, the top 5 words of seven topics from TCNLM and our models were qualitatively compared. The comparison between our models (ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe) and TCNLM in terms of topic coherence on the BNC dataset showed that ctx-DocNADEe with word embeddings had more coherent topics. The top 5 words of seven topics from TCNLM and our models were compared for topic expression. Text retrieval was performed using short-text and long-text documents with label information, following a setup similar to BID15. The text discusses the comparison of retrieval precision scores for short-text and long-text datasets using DocNADE and its extensions. It mentions that the introduction of pre-trained embeddings and language/contextual information improves performance. The introduction of pre-trained embeddings and language/contextual information improves performance on the IR task for short texts. Topic modeling without pre-processing and filtering certain words also enhances IR precision. The FV setting with DocNADE or glove shows improved performance over the baseline RV setting. The ctx-DocNADEe model reports a 7.1% gain in IR precision on average across datasets. The ctx-DeepDNEe model demonstrates competitive performance on specific datasets. The ctx-DocNADEe model outperforms DocNADE(RV) by 6.5% in precision at fraction 0.02, across 14 datasets. It also surpasses TDLM and ProdLDA 6 by noticeable margins in text categorization using logistic regression classifier. The ctx-DocNADEe model shows improved classification performance compared to DocNADE(RV) with gains of 4.8% and 3.6% in F1 score for short and long texts, respectively. Overall, there is a 4.4% increase in F1 score. Additionally, on the 20NS dataset, DocNADE achieves a classification accuracy of 0.734. The ctx-DocNADEe model outperforms DocNADE in classification accuracy on the 20NS dataset, with scores of 0.751 and 0.734 respectively. The proposed models, ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe, also outperform NTM and SCHOLAR. Meaningful semantics are captured through topic extraction, with a topic related to computers identified in the data. The ctx-DocNADEe model extracts a more coherent topic compared to others. The ctx-DocNADEe model outperforms DocNADE in classification accuracy on the 20NS dataset. It captures meaningful topics, with a coherent topic related to computers identified in the data. The text retrieved for each query using DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe models is analyzed qualitatively. The top 3 texts for an input query from the TMNtitle dataset are shown in Table 9, with ctx-DocNADEe retrieving texts with no unigram overlap with the query. The ctx-DocNADEe model outperforms DocNADE in classification accuracy on the 20NS dataset, with a coherent topic related to computers identified in the data. The top 3 retrievals for an input query are illustrated in Table 9, showing texts with no unigram overlap with the query. In FIG5, the quality of representations learned at different fractions of the training set from TMNtitle data is quantified, showing improvements due to the proposed models ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe over DocNADE. The gains in both IR and classification tasks are significant for smaller fractions of the datasets, with ctx-DocNADEe reporting a precision of 0.580 vs 0.444 at 20%. The study compared ctxDocNADEe to DocNADE, showing improvements in precision and F1 scores at different fractions of the training set. The findings support the enhancement of topic models with word embeddings, particularly in sparse data scenarios. The combination of neural autoregressive topic models and neural language models improves the estimation of word probabilities in context. The study introduced a neural autoregressive topic model (DocNADE) and a neural language model (LSTM-LM) in a single framework to incorporate language concepts in each autoregressive step. This allows for learning a latent representation of the entire document while considering local collocation patterns. External word embeddings were also used to enhance learning. Experimental results showed that this approach outperformed state-of-the-art generative topic models in terms of generalization, topic interpretability, and applicability.

TAB10 shows perplexity scores for different \u03bb in the Generalization task. Class labels are not used during training, only for document retrieval validation. For document retrieval, Doc2Vec models were trained using gensim on 12 datasets with specific hyperparameters. The models were trained with distributed bag of words, 1000 iterations, a window size of 5, and a vector size of 500. The same train/development/test split was used for training the models as well as in the information retrieval task. For training Doc2Vec models, logistic regression classifiers were used on inferred document vectors with L2 regularization. Multilabel datasets used a one-vs-all approach. Models were trained with liblinear solver, 200 iterations, and 200 topics. Hyperparameters beta and lambda were set accordingly. The hyperparameter beta was set to 0.1 for long texts and 0.01 for all datasets, while the mixture parameter lambda was fixed at 0.6. Classification tasks used relative topic proportions as input, with SCHOLAR BID3 generating more coherent topics than DocNADE. In information retrieval tasks, SCHOLAR BID3 without meta-data performed worse than ProdLDA. The experimental results suggest that DocNADE outperforms SCHOLAR in generating representations for tasks like information retrieval and classification, but lags behind in interpretability. This opens up new avenues for future research."
