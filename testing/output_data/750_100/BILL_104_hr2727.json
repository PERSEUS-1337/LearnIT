    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congressional Responsibility Act of 1995\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The \"Congressional Responsibility Act of 1995\" aims to ensure that Federal regulations are only enacted through the legislative process outlined in Article I of the Constitution, preventing Congress from delegating this responsibility to unelected officials in the executive branch. The \"Congressional Responsibility Act of 1995\" requires regulations proposed by executive branch agencies to be approved by Congress before taking effect, promoting accountability and democracy in decision-making. SEC. 3. ENACTMENT OF AGENCY REGULATIONS. Regulations must be approved by Congress before taking effect. Agencies must submit a report to Congress with the text and explanation of proposed regulations. SEC. 4. EXPEDITED CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURES FOR AGENCY REGULATIONS. SEC. 4 outlines expedited congressional procedures for agency regulations. It mandates the Majority Leader of each House of Congress to introduce a bill containing the text of a regulation submitted by an agency within three legislative days. If not introduced, any Member of that House may do so. The bill must state that the agency regulations are approved and have the force of law. The regulations approved by the Majority Leader of each House of Congress shall have the force of law. A bill described in subsection (b) cannot be referred to a committee. Any Member can move to consider the bill the day after announcing their intention. All points of order against the bill are waived. The motion is privileged in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The motion to proceed to the consideration of the bill is privileged in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is not debatable, amendable, or subject to postponement. Once agreed to, the respective House must immediately proceed to consider the bill without interruption. The bill remains the unfinished business of the respective House until disposed of. Debate on the bill is limited to one hour, divided equally between supporters and opponents. Amendments are not allowed. Further debate limitations are allowed. Postponement, consideration of other business, or recommitting the bill motions are not allowed. Reconsidering the bill's vote is also not allowed. Appeals from the Chair's decisions on Senate or House regulations are permitted. The regulations of the Senate or the House of Representatives apply to the bill procedure without debate. A vote on final passage must occur within 60 days of the bill's introduction. An exception allows for a motion to suspend certain subsections, which requires a majority vote. The bill procedure in the House of Representatives is similar to other bills. If the other House has passed a bill with the same text, it will not be referred to a committee and can only be considered for final passage. The procedure in the receiving House will be the same. The procedure in the House of Representatives for bills received from the other House is the same as if no bill had been received, but the final vote will be on the bill from the other House. Once the bill from the other House is dealt with, the original bill in the receiving House cannot be considered. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The term \"agency\" and \"regulation\" are defined in accordance with specific sections of the United States Code. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to agency regulations issued after its enactment. SEC. 7. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Regulations in bills passed under this Act are not subject to judicial review as agency actions under title 5, United States Code."
