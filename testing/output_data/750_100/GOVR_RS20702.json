    "content": "The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 authorized federal agencies to participate in Everglades restoration projects under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The Everglades is crucial to the South Florida ecosystem, which includes national wildlife refuges and national park units. Changes in water quantity and quality since the 1950s have significantly impacted the region's ecology. The Everglades in South Florida has been significantly impacted by changes in water quantity and quality, leading to water shortages during the dry season. Urban and agricultural demand is increasing, causing more frequent shortages. The Everglades, once a vast network of wetlands, is now struggling to receive sufficient freshwater due to altered water regimes. The Everglades in South Florida once had a natural flow of water from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay through wetlands acting as filters. However, by the mid-1800s, efforts to control floods and reclaim land altered the landscape, leading to a perception of the Everglades as an unproductive swamp. The Everglades in South Florida underwent significant changes due to flood control and reclamation efforts, altering its natural water flow. The Central and Southern Florida project by the Army Corps of Engineers further modified the Everglades' hydrology with canals, levees, and water control structures. These human interventions have drastically impacted the Everglades' water regime. The Everglades' water regime has been significantly altered by human interventions like the Central and Southern Florida project, leading to habitat loss and reduced size. Changes in water flow have impacted the ecosystem, with less water during the dry season and more during the rainy season. Urban and agricultural development have further contributed to the degradation of the Everglades, threatening plant and animal species. The Everglades have been harmed by degraded water quality due to pollutants from urban areas and agricultural runoff, leading to a decline in native vegetation and an overabundance of invasive species. Restoration efforts by the federal government and the State of Florida, including acquiring lands and preparing a recovery plan, are underway to address the ecosystem's health. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, established by WRDA 1996, coordinates restoration activities with goals to improve water quality, restore habitats, and ensure compatibility of natural and built systems. The estimated cost for achieving these goals in South Florida is nearly $20 billion, with $10.9 billion allocated to CERP for \"getting the water right\" through restoring hydrologic functions and water quality. CERP focuses on water quantity, quality, and timing. CERP aims to capture and store freshwater for use during the dry season, directing 80% to the natural system and 20% for agricultural and urban consumption. It involves removing levees and canals, building reservoirs, storage wells, and pumping stations to redistribute water to replicate natural flow. Title VI of WRDA 2000 approved CERP as part of the Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact. Title VI of WRDA 2000 approved CERP as part of the Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic Environmental Impact, authorizing $700 million in federal funds for initial projects. WRDA 2007 authorized a second set of activities, including the Indian River Lagoon and Picayune Strand restoration projects, totaling roughly $2.0 billion in authorizations. Title VI of WRDA 2000 established that construction, operation, and maintenance costs of CERP projects would be equally shared by Floridian stakeholders and the federal government. CERP authorization was achieved after negotiations among federal, state, local, and tribal stakeholders. Federal agencies responsible for CERP components receive appropriations through annual bills. Information on appropriations for CERP activities by the Corps is available in CRS Report RL34009, Energy and Water Development: FY2008 Appropriations. Recent concerns over the implementation of CERP include project prioritization, federal efforts pace, mitigation for excess phosphorous, restoration effectiveness, and technological uncertainties. Since WRDA 2000, $0.37 billion in federal funds and $1.63 billion in state funds have been allocated to CERP. In FY2007, federal and state funds totaling $2 billion have been allocated to CERP projects, with a focus on Acceler8 efforts to prioritize certain projects. Concerns have been raised about this prioritization potentially neglecting ecosystem restoration in favor of meeting water supply needs for agricultural and urban users. Proponents of Accerler8 argue that priority water supply projects with restoration benefits are progressing too slowly due to federal funding delays. Stakeholders are concerned that some Everglades restoration projects primarily benefit local areas rather than the nation, and that CERP costs are increasing. The increasing costs of CERP are a concern for stakeholders worried about federal funds being diverted from other ecosystem restoration projects. Delays in completing CERP projects raise concerns about the plan's feasibility. For instance, delays in the Mod Waters project may impact water flows for eastern Everglades restoration. The interdependency of CERP and non-CERP projects for ecosystem restoration goals is highlighted in WRDA 2000. The WRDA 2000 codified ecosystem restoration goals and restricted appropriations for specific CERP components until Mod Waters is complete. Controversy also arises from a Florida state law in 2003 that may delay restoration efforts by extending phosphorus mitigation deadlines. The Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, FY2006 (P.L. 109-54), included provisions conditioning funds for restoration efforts. The FY2006 Act (P.L. 109-54) included provisions tying restoration funds to water quality standards on federal properties in Florida. Failure to meet standards could result in reduced appropriations for restoration. Some question the effectiveness and necessity of the complicated and costly CERP plan for Everglades restoration. The complicated and costly CERP plan for Everglades restoration has raised concerns about its effectiveness and lack of focus on improving water quality. Some groups and federal agencies criticize CERP for prioritizing water supply over ecological restoration. Despite revisions to include restoration activities earlier, opposition from some groups and scientists persists. Environmental groups supporting CERP worry about Florida's financial contribution. Some groups question using funds designated for land purchase for other CERP projects, emphasizing the importance of land acquisition for successful Everglades restoration. The National Research Council report highlights the need to acquire land early to prevent irreversible damage from development. Concerns also arise about Lake Okeechobee management and flood control's impact on the Caloosahatchee River ecosystem. The Caloosahatchee River's ecosystem and water management issues are integrated into Everglades restoration efforts. Questions remain about the impact of sea level rise and climate change on CERP and the future of the Everglades ecosystem. Ecosystem restoration is a developing science, with adaptive management being used in CERP to address uncertainty and integrate new information. CERP integrates new information into restoration efforts, using pilot projects like ASR to test water management strategies. These projects aim to store surface water in aquifers for later use during dry periods, but uncertainties remain about their effectiveness."
