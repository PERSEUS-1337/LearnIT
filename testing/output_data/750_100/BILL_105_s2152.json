Congress finds that over 1 billion people in the developing world live in severe poverty, with high child mortality rates and preventable deaths from malnutrition and disease. Women in poverty face greater workloads and fewer opportunities compared to men. In the developing world, women in poverty lack stable employment and social safety nets, often turning to self-employment. They struggle to access credit at reasonable rates, hindering their ability to escape poverty. Many poor individuals face high interest rates when trying to obtain credit for self-employment. An international Microcredit Summit aimed to expand access to credit for 100 million of the world's poorest families by 2005, especially women. The Microcredit Summit aims to reach nearly half of the world's absolute poor by providing access to loans at reasonable interest rates through self-sustaining microcredit programs led by organizations like the Grameen Bank and Accion International. Microcredit institutions like Bank, Accion International, and FINCA have high repayment rates of 95% or more. They not only reduce poverty but also decrease dependency on foreign aid. Interest income from loans can cover institutional costs, ensuring long-term sustainability. These institutions leverage foreign assistance resources by recycling loans for new benefits. The development of sustainable microcredit institutions is crucial for poverty reduction and economic development. In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative with increased funding to expand microenterprise programs. In fiscal year 1996, total funding for microenterprise activities fell to $111,000,000, with only 39 percent used for programs benefiting the poorest with loans under $300. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is critical to achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1996. The funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world should be increased to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to support the growing capacity of microcredit institutions. The United States needs to modestly increase funding for international microcredit programs to reach the goal of the Microcredit Summit, focusing on institutions serving the poorest. Expanding and replicating successful microcredit institutions is crucial to reaching millions of the poorest with microcredit. Microcredit institutions require assistance in developing their capacity to expand services and access capital. PVOs and NGOs have shown competence in developing networks of local microcredit institutions to reach the very poor and promote financial sustainability. AID should prioritize investing in these organizations due to their effective partnerships. AID should prioritize investing in PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations to expand successful microcredit institutions globally and improve coordination efforts among development aid agencies. The Act aims to promote best practices in providing financial services to the poor and developing institutional capacity. It focuses on continuing and expanding AID's commitment to microcredit institutions, making microenterprise development a key economic growth strategy, and supporting US PVOs and international organizations in providing services to microentrepreneurs. The Act aims to promote best practices in providing financial services to the poor, focusing on microcredit institutions and supporting microentrepreneurs, especially women in developing countries. The Act aims to promote best practices in providing financial services to the poor, focusing on microcredit institutions and supporting microentrepreneurs, especially women in developing countries. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms such as AID, microcredit, microenterprise, poverty lending, mixed programs, and PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations. Private voluntary organizations and international, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations active in the project's region with the capacity to develop and implement microenterprise programs for the poor, especially women. SEC. 4. MICROENTERPRISE ASSISTANCE. The President, through the Administrator of AID, is authorized to establish programs for microenterprise assistance in developing countries. Programs will be primarily carried out by US PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations, including credit unions and private financial intermediaries. Eligibility criteria will be established by the Administrator of AID. The Administrator of AID will establish eligibility criteria for entities involved in microenterprise assistance programs in developing countries. Criteria will include access to formal financial sector, targeting the poorest individuals, focus on working with poor women, and implementation plans. The Administrator of AID will establish eligibility criteria for entities involved in microenterprise assistance programs in developing countries, including a plan for financial self-reliance through realistic interest rates. Funding levels for fiscal year 1999 require at least $160,000,000 for assistance under this Act. In fiscal year 1999, funds are available for microenterprise activities in the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Europe, the newly independent states of the Former Soviet Union, Asia, and the Near East under the FREEDOM Support Act. At least $80,000,000 must be used for poverty lending, and support for pvos and other nongovernmental organizations is also required. In fiscal year 1999, funds are available for microenterprise activities in various regions under the FREEDOM Support Act. At least $80,000,000 must be used for poverty lending, with support for United States PVOs and indigenous nongovernmental organizations. Additionally, not less than $45,000,000 shall be provided through AID for these organizations, including a matching grant program. To support poverty lending means funds lent to members of the poverty target population in low-income countries in amounts equivalent to $300 or less in 1997 United States dollars, and funds used for institutional development of an entity engaged in poverty lending. The term \"poverty target population\" refers to the poorest 50% of individuals living below the poverty line in a foreign country. This includes making loans of $300 or less in 1997 US dollars to this population or participating in the poverty lending portion of a mixed program. SEC. 5. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. The Administrator of AID will strengthen mechanisms for microenterprise programs and develop systems for monitoring the impact of assistance under section 4. The Administrator of AID will establish a monitoring system with performance goals, indicators, and recommendations for adjustments to enhance assistance for the very poor, especially women. The Administrator of AID will monitor microenterprise credit and loans provided to the poverty target population, report to Congress annually on progress. The Administrator of AID will report annually to Congress on the progress of implementing the institutional plan to expand access to credit and financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families by 2005, with a focus on women. The report will also include a summary of information collected in AID's annual presentation to Congress."
