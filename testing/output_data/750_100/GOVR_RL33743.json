    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. Other trade negotiations that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. Congress has granted the President TPA/fast track authority for over 40 years. The President has been granted Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for over 40 years, allowing for expedited consideration and unamended voting on trade agreement implementing legislation. TPA balances Congress's constitutional authority over trade policy while giving the President negotiating leverage with U.S. trade partners. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has been granted for over 40 years, allowing expedited consideration of trade agreements by Congress. Earlier versions of TPA were adopted with bipartisan support, but as trade negotiations have become more complex, renewal of TPA has become more controversial. The expiration of TPA raises questions about its renewal and form, reflecting decades of debate and compromise between Congress and the executive branch. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has evolved over time, highlighting the partnership between Congress and the President in trade policymaking. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress authority over foreign trade regulation, emphasizing the need for cooperation to negotiate trade agreements effectively. The relationship between the two branches can be strengthened or strained based on political and economic conditions. Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and collect taxes. The President has authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements under Article II. Both legislative and executive branches are involved in developing and executing U.S. trade agreements. Congress historically set tariff rates on imported products for the first 150 years of the United States. Congress historically had authority over foreign trade through setting tariff rates on imported products, which was the main trade policy instrument and a key source of federal revenue. Early trade debates in Congress often involved Members from northern manufacturing regions advocating for protectionist tariffs, while those from southern commodity exporting regions pushed for lower tariffs. The President's role in trade policy was primarily focused on negotiating and implementing bilateral treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation, with the Senate's advice and consent, which included commitments to most-favored-nation treatment. In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act imposed high tariffs, leading to retaliatory measures by trade partners and worsening the Great Depression. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (RTAA) was developed in response to the damaging effects of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in the 1930s. It authorized the President to enter into reciprocal trade agreements to reduce tariffs, marking the first time Congress delegated expanded trade authority to the President. Congress delegated expanded trade authority to the President to reduce tariffs within predefined ranges, aiming to lessen political pressure from special interests. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, the last general tariff legislation, now only applies to imports from Cuba and North Korea without MFN status. Congress retained broader trade authority and safeguarded against executive branch overreach. Congress delegated expanded trade authority to the President to reduce tariffs within predefined ranges, aiming to lessen political pressure from special interests. The trade agreements authority was subjected to periodic review and renewal, leading to a decline in general tariff levels and the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, shifting trade negotiations from bilateral to multilateral forums. Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Congress granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and submit agreements for congressional review. This allowed the President to conclude the GATT Kennedy Round, focusing on tariff reduction agreements. The GATT member countries reached agreements in the Kennedy Round related to nontariff barriers (NTBs), including a customs valuation agreement and an antidumping agreement that would have required changes in U.S. laws and regulations beyond tariff modifications. Changes in U.S. law or regulations beyond tariff modifications led Congress to believe the President had overstepped his authority. A resolution in 1966 instructed the Johnson Administration against negotiating \"nontariff commitments,\" but when ignored, Congress refused to implement the NTB changes. This set the stage for the creation of fast track authority for trade agreements, as future multilateral trade agreements would increasingly focus on nontariff barrier rules, necessitating changes in U.S. law for compliance. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 expired in 1967, prompting Congress to seek a legislative remedy for presidential encroachment on legislative authority. The Nixon Administration sought new authority to negotiate the Tokyo Round in the GATT, which Congress granted in the Trade Act of 1974. This act provided the President with the authority to enter into trade agreements that reduced or eliminated tariffs within certain parameters. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to negotiate trade agreements that reduced tariffs within specific parameters. Agreements requiring changes beyond tariffs could only take effect with Congress passing implementing legislation, raising concerns about special interest pressures in trade policymaking. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to negotiate trade agreements, but there was concern that U.S. trading partners would be reluctant to negotiate agreements subject to unlimited congressional debate and amendment. The Senate Finance Committee recognized the need for negotiated agreements to receive an up-or-down vote by Congress to provide assurances to trading partners. The Trade Act of 1974 allowed the President to negotiate trade agreements with assurances that Congress would consider them within a specific time-frame. Congress agreed to expedited treatment for trade agreements, with limited time for committees to consider implementing bills and no amendments during debate. The executive branch had to consult with relevant committees during negotiations and notify Congress 90 days before signing an agreement. Additionally, 10 Members of Congress were accredited as advisers to the U.S. delegation of negotiators. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded the number of Members of Congress advising the U.S. delegation to 10. This led to the fast track trade negotiating authority, resulting in agreements on NTBs during the Tokyo Round of the GATT. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first trade implementing bill passed by Congress. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (P.L. 96-39) was the first trade implementing bill passed by Congress under the expanded trade agreements authority and expedited procedures, which have remained unchanged since 1974. These provisions, found in Sections 151-154 of the Trade Act of 1974, have been revised by Congress over the years. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988, without extending tariff modification authority. This act amended the Trade Act of 1974 to include trade agreements authority for negotiation and implementation of bilateral free trade. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority for bilateral free trade agreements, reducing tariffs and addressing nontariff barriers. Congress considered U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The legislation waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress 60 days prior to negotiations with other countries. Expedited procedures could be denied if either committee disapproved. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, but expedited procedures were only extended for agreements before June 1, 1991. Agreements after that date but before June 1, 1993, could be approved under expedited procedures if the President requested an extension. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993. The President requested an extension of such authority, which survived proposed House and Senate resolutions of disapproval. Congress could withhold a trade agreement from fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval if the USTR had failed to consult adequately. Congress expanded trade negotiation objectives and passed implementing legislation for NAFTA. Congress extended the President's trade agreement authority until April 16, 1994, solely for the Uruguay Round under H.R. 1876 (P.L. 103-49). The extension received strong support in both the House (295-126) and the Senate (76-16). No changes were made to the fast track authority. New authority was not approved by Congress until after the expiration on April 16, 1994. The fast track authority expired on April 16, 1994, and new authority was not approved until the Trade Act of 2002. Congress did not renew fast track authority in 1997 or 1998 due to lack of support and various reasons. The decision not to renew trade agreements authority for the Clinton Administration was due to disagreements on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues with Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The lack of new negotiations at the WTO also made renewal a low political priority. In 2001, President George W. Bush requested a renewal of fast track authority, renamed as \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. The TPA included new language for labor and environmental provisions as \"principal negotiating objectives.\" The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002, also known as TPA, defined principal negotiating objectives but did not require enforceable labor standards in trade agreements, leading to opposition from labor groups and some Members of Congress. It established the Congressional Oversight Group for consultation in addition to existing trade advisors. The House version of the bill passed by a narrow margin, with Republicans mostly in favor and Democrats mostly opposed. The Trade Act of 2002, including the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act, was supported by Republicans and opposed by Democrats. It passed in the Senate and was adopted by both the House and Senate. The legislation approved implementing agreements with various countries. The proposed BCTPA was introduced in 2015. The Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act (BCTPA) was introduced in 2015 by Senators Hatch and Wyden and Representative Ryan. It is modeled after the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Priorities Act of 2014. The legislation was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee in April 2015. TPA-2015, a substitute amendment to H.R. 1314, passed on May 22 by a vote of 62-37. It includes updated negotiating objectives on trade in goods, services, agriculture, intellectual property rights, regulatory practices, and digital trade. The legislation also addresses currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. If enacted, TPA-2015 will expire on July 1, 2021. TPA-2015, if enacted, will expire on July 1, 2021. It may be used for agreements like TPP, T-TIP, TISA, and EGA. The Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) is a plurilateral agreement being negotiated at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reduce or eliminate barriers on goods to promote the environment. Through TPA/fast track, Congress aims to define trade policy priorities and ensure the executive branch adheres to these objectives in trade negotiations. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to define trade policy priorities and ensure the executive branch adheres to objectives by requiring consultation with Congress and placing limitations on trade agreements authority. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) was established to tighten Congress's control over trade agreements negotiation and implementation, requiring passage of implementing legislation for agreements involving nontariff barriers (NTBs). This process changed when trade negotiations expanded to include NTBs, leading to the establishment of \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" under the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) includes expedited procedures for passing trade implementing legislation through Congress. These procedures are available for qualifying bills that meet certain conditions, such as progress in meeting TPA's negotiating objectives and fulfilling notification and consultation requirements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) statute requires implementing bills to approve the agreement and administrative action, and make necessary changes to laws. Congress has the power to control the approval and implementation of trade agreements. Congress has the authority to control the approval and implementation of trade agreements, as outlined in the Trade Promotion Authority statute. The President can enter into force an agreement by presidential proclamation after ensuring the partner country has complied with the agreement's provisions. The Trade Promotion Authority statute outlines the process for Congress to review and approve trade agreements. The President must notify Congress before signing an agreement, provide a list of required changes to U.S. law, and transmit the final legal text of the agreement for review. The Trade Promotion Authority statute outlines the process for Congress to review and approve trade agreements. Congress must fulfill certain requirements to implement the agreement, including supporting statements on how it meets congressional priorities, changes existing agreements, and serves U.S. commercial interests. If these requirements are met, Congress agrees to follow expedited legislative procedures as defined in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Promotion Authority statute outlines the process for Congress to review and approve trade agreements, including expedited legislative procedures such as mandatory introduction of the bill in both houses, limited floor debate, and no amendments allowed. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation. The Trade Promotion Authority statute outlines the process for Congress to review and approve trade agreements, including expedited legislative procedures. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation, emphasizing the importance of trade in U.S. foreign economic and security policy. Congress sets the objectives for the President to pursue in trade negotiations, expecting the Administration to honor them for trade agreement implementing legislation. The Trade Promotion Authority statute outlines the process for Congress to review and approve trade agreements, including expedited legislative procedures. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation, emphasizing the importance of trade in U.S. foreign economic and security policy. Administration is expected to honor these objectives for trade agreement implementing legislation. Trade negotiating objectives are categorized into overall objectives, principal objectives, and other priorities, focusing on enhancing economies and reducing trade barriers. Trade negotiating objectives include reducing trade barriers, protecting foreign investment and intellectual property rights, promoting transparency, fair regulatory practices, combating corruption, enforcing environmental and labor laws, and ensuring effective dispute settlement. Consultation with Congress is a crucial obligation. Language defining these objectives has been contentious in the past, leading to challenges in passing Trade Promotion Authority legislation. The 2002 renewal controversy surrounding Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) highlighted the significance of negotiating objectives in future trade agreements. The labor provisions, a key focus in TPA objectives, sparked debate due to the lack of enforceable standards. This contentious issue could resurface when specific trade agreements are presented to Congress. The debate over Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) centered on the lack of enforceable labor standards. This issue was evident during the 2005 debate on the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). The renewal of TPA/fast track authority is crucial as it grants the President authority to negotiate trade agreements, provided regular consultations are conducted. The President's authority to negotiate trade agreements is extended under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), with the requirement to consult regularly with Congress, including the Congressional Advisory Groups (CAG). Notification and consultation procedures have been revised with each renewal of authority, with specific timelines outlined in the process. The President must notify Congress in writing at least 90 days before commencing negotiations. The President must notify Congress in writing at least 90 days before commencing negotiations and consult with relevant committees and CAGs. Special consultations are required for agriculture, import sensitive agricultural products, fishing, textile industries tariffs, and other issues. Specific notifications and consultations are also needed before and after agreements are signed. The President must consult with relevant committees and CAGs, notify revenue committees 180 days before any potential changes to trade remedy laws, submit advisory committee reports within 30 days of notifying Congress, and provide trade agreement details to USITC 90 days before entering. The Trade Promotion Authority requires the President to consult with Congress, notify committees of trade agreement details, and release the text of the agreement before entering into it. This consultation process ensures congressional oversight of trade policy. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluated the consultation process for trade negotiations. Despite extensive consultations with Congress, many staff felt they didn't have enough time to provide input. The consultation process for trade negotiations did not allow sufficient time for input from Congress, leading to concerns about the need for greater and earlier congressional involvement in drafting FTAs. Similar issues were raised regarding consultation on TPP and other trade negotiations. Congress adopted TPA procedures to prevent delays in trade implementing bills due to congressional procedures. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures were designed to prevent delays in trade implementing bills by congressional procedures. TPA protects fragile trade agreements from congressional amendments that could alter the basic agreement, while also limiting the use of expedited procedures. Each renewal of TPA provides expedited procedures for trade agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures provide expedited processes for trade agreement implementing bills for a limited time, ensuring congressional oversight. TPA-2015 extends these procedures until July 1, 2021, without a deadline for submitting implementing legislation for agreements entered into before the authority expires. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the President to request an extension of the TPA authority after a certain period of time. The extension is granted unless either House of Congress adopts a disapproval resolution, which must be reported out of either the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the President to request an extension of the TPA authority, which can be denied by Congress through disapproval resolutions from the House Ways and Means or Senate Finance Committees. This process serves as a reminder to the executive branch about congressional prerogatives in trade agreement negotiations and allows Congress to influence agreements before finalization. Failure to meet consultation and reporting obligations may lead Congress to reject the President's requests for TPA extension. Congress can decide that the implementing bill is not eligible under TPA rules if the President fails to meet requirements. This can be done through a joint \"procedural disapproval\" resolution in both houses of Congress. The new CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for an implementing bill if there is a failure to notify or consult with Congress on a trade agreement. A CCR is triggered if the committee reports implementing legislation unfavorably, leading to different procedures in each chamber. The Trade Act of 1974 allows expedited procedures for trade bills, but Congress can change or override these rules. Cooperation between legislative and executive branches is crucial for the success of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The Trade Act of 1974 allows expedited procedures for trade bills, but bipartisan agreement on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has been lacking since 1993. Cooperation between legislative and executive branches is essential for the success of TPA. Congress has integrated certain procedures into the process of approving trade agreements, including reviewing agreements before introducing implementing bills, holding hearings, and conducting informal markup sessions. During informal markup sessions, committee members review an informal draft of the implementing bill and the final text of the trade agreement to raise concerns, offer amendments, and signal changes they would like to see in the actual implementing bill. This process serves as a test run of congressional response to the trade agreement. The two revenue committees may use a \"mock conference\" to reconcile differences in their markups and clarify key points in the final implementing bill for a trade agreement already concluded. The Administration has discretion in accepting changes from Congress, as seen with the CAFTA-DR agreement. The Senate Finance Committee unanimously supported an amendment for the U.S.-Oman FTA implementing legislation, citing TPA's requirement for necessary provisions. A bipartisan call for better consultation prior to trade agreements arose due to dissatisfaction with the Oman FTA and TPA process. Congress has at times added side agreements or letters to trade agreements outside of formal TPA requirements. Side agreements or side letters can involve additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement has been signed. They can act as clarifying devices, addressing specific issues and concerns, and are typically addressed from and to the top trade negotiating representative. Side agreements and letters accompany the agreement, but their status with respect to fast track procedures can be unclear. The USTR, trade minister, or equivalent must sign side agreements and letters accompanying the agreement for them to be considered in force. Enforceability of these agreements is untested, and some Members of Congress rely on informal commitments from the executive branch to address issues raised in mock markups, often related to special interests. The Bush Administration made accommodations to sugar, textile, and labor interests in the CAFTA-DR implementing bill. The administration made accommodations to secure congressional support for Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which expired on July 1, 2007. President Obama requested TPA renewal in 2013 and 2015, facing criticism for delaying the request. Congress may also be influenced by the desire to update the 2002 law. The 2002 law on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is viewed as outdated and may not fully capture the current debate. Some policy issues and technical changes are being considered. TPA is seen as unnecessary if consensus can be reached on passing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). TPA goes beyond expedited legislative procedures and helps build consensus on trade policy between the executive and Congress. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) helps build consensus on trade policy between the executive and legislative branches, signals congressional support for FTAs, and defines negotiating objectives for Congress. The timing of TPA renewal is debated, with some suggesting waiting until negotiations are near completion for a specific FTA. The debate over Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) renewal centers on the timing of action. Some argue for early consideration to allow Congress to weigh in on negotiation objectives, while others suggest waiting until negotiations are near completion. The scope of U.S. trade negotiating objectives has expanded with the changing structure of trade, rendering many objectives under prior grants of TPA outdated. Several negotiating objectives in TPA-2015 address topics relevant to modern trade issues. The TPA-2015 negotiating objectives focus on modern trade issues such as state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, trade effects on SMEs, and global supply chains. Congress should consider these new objectives, which reflect the evolving nature of global trade. The Trade Act of 2002 led to controversy among Democrats, resulting in a partisan vote. Approval of FTAs was withheld until a bipartisan agreement was reached in 2007, known as the \"May 10th Agreement,\" which included changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The \"May 10th Agreement\" included changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Some Democrats and Republicans have differing views on whether these commitments should be included in future trade agreements. TPA-2015 includes key provisions from the May 10th Understanding on labor and environmental provisions, but it is unclear how much it reflects the IPR provisions. Some Members of Congress are unhappy with the executive branch's handling of trade negotiation consultations required under TPA, especially with the TPP negotiations. Key issues include ensuring Congress can influence FTAs early in the negotiation process. Congress can influence the substance of FTAs early in the negotiation process by having appropriate access to draft texts. Some Members argue they have less access than business and NGO representatives. Members on trade committees stress the importance of being kept current on negotiations to influence agreement text and participate in drafting. Congress can influence trade agreements by having access to draft texts early in the negotiation process. There is bipartisan interest in enforcing commitments of trade partners, with separate legislative efforts and the creation of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center by President Obama. Congress may need to consider language on trade agreement enforcement in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The use of TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress raised technical issues that Congress may wish to reevaluate. Some Members may wish to define the \"necessary or appropriate\" language more precisely in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation. There have been attempts to introduce provisions challenging a strict interpretation of TPA-2015. Flexibility in applying TPA provisions may be debated among Members of Congress. Some argue for a time limit on introducing FTA implementing bills, citing delays in past legislation. Others suggest changes to FTA text after negotiations as a point of contention. Some argue that changes in the U.S.-South Korea FTA text after negotiations could have affected approval on technical grounds, prompting Congress to consider addressing this issue in TPA renewal. The power of TPA lies in the political agreement between Congress and the President, rather than its statutory guarantees. Congress aims to build consensus on trade policy despite challenges. Congress seeks bipartisan consensus on trade policy, understanding the need for minimal agreement to pass legislation. Options for TPA renewal include renewing and revising TPA authority, extending targeted TPA, and more. The TPA-2015 legislation offers options for renewing TPA authority, including extending targeted TPA for specific agreements like the TPP or granting the President permanent fast track/TPA authority. Representative Levin proposed a modified grant of TPA covering only TPP negotiations during the House Ways and Means Committee markup. The lack of TPA could delay action on future reciprocal trade agreements, but trade policy can move ahead without it. Some Members oppose TPA due to concerns about giving up congressional authority. Legislation to renew TPA was proposed in the 114th Congress. In the 114th Congress, legislation to renew TPA was signed by the President on June 29, 2015, reauthorizing it for four years with a possible three-year extension. The legislation includes changes like increased requirements for executive branch consultation with Congress and private sector advisers. It also outlines \"overall trade negotiating objectives\" and \"principal trade negotiating objectives.\" The legislation renewed TPA in the 114th Congress with increased requirements for consultation and outlined trade negotiating objectives, including topics like trade in goods, services, foreign investment, intellectual property, and new issues such as digital trade and currency provisions. The bills renewed TPA in the 114th Congress with new provisions on currency and human rights as principal trade negotiating objectives, including capacity building and other priorities. Congressional Trade Agreements Authority Requested by and Granted to Presidents Since 1934 Congressional Timeline under TPA A Short Guide to the Expedited Legislative Procedures for Passage of Trade Implementing Bills Under TPA. The House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees hold \"mock markups\" on informal drafts of implementing legislation, voting to approve or disapprove. The vote and amendments are not binding on the Administration. These meetings allow Congress to express concerns before final legislation is sent to Congress. The President sends the final legal draft of the trade agreement and implementing bill to Congress. The draft bill, reflecting amendments from mock markups, is sent to Congress when in session. Identical bills must be introduced in both houses and referred to relevant committees. Committees have 45 days to report the bill, or it is automatically discharged. If the bill is a revenue bill, the Senate must act on the House bill. The Senate Finance Committee has a deadline to act on the House bill, with limited debate and no amendments allowed. If floor action is not completed within 15 days, any Member can bring it to a vote. After the bill is reported or discharged, any Member may bring it to a vote. A bill passes by simple majority. The Senate typically acts second and debates its own bill, but takes its final vote on the bill received from the House of Representatives. This procedure ensures both houses act on the same measure, clearing it for presentation to the President. The implementing bill is signed, and the agreement enters into force for the United States when the President proclaims it. After the USTR assures the President of necessary changes, the agreement enters into force by proclamation."
