    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section title and findings. The Act is titled the \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1997\" and highlights the importance of women's health care, particularly the role of obstetrician-gynecologists in providing primary and preventive care throughout a woman's lifetime. (4) 60 percent of office visits to obstetrician-gynecologists are for preventive care. Obstetrician-gynecologists manage women's health beyond the reproductive system and are uniquely qualified to provide basic health care services. (5) They refer patients to other physicians less frequently, avoiding costly and time-consuming referrals. (6) More than 20 States have acted to promote access to obstetrician-gynecologists for patients. Access to obstetrician-gynecologists is not protected for patients in other States or in Federally-governed health plans. SEC. 2706 of the Public Health Service Act ensures access to obstetrical and gynecological services under group health plans and insurance coverage. SEC. 2706 of the Public Health Service Act allows female enrollees in group health plans to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without requiring prior authorization. Enrollees in group health plans can designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider for coverage of obstetric and gynecologic care without prior authorization. Ordering gynecologic care from the designated physician is considered prior authorization from the primary care provider. The group health plan must not deny women eligibility based on avoiding coverage requirements for gynecologic care. Monetary payments or rebates to women are also prohibited. The group health plan must not penalize providers for providing care in accordance with the section, and must comply with notice requirements. The group health plan must not penalize providers for care provided under this section, and can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. State laws regarding health insurance issuers are not preempted by this section. The text chunk discusses the continuation of health insurance issuer standards for group health insurance coverage that offer more protections to enrollees than those provided under a specific section of the Act. It also includes amendments to Section 2723 of the Act related to subsections (a) and (c). Additionally, ERISA amendments are mentioned in Subpart B of part 7 of the Act. ERISA amendments are made to Subpart B of part 7 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, adding a new section. \"SEC. 713. STANDARDS RELATING TO ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES.\" \"In the provision of health insurance coverage, a group health plan must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without requiring prior authorization.\" The group health plan must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider for coverage of obstetric and gynecologic care without requiring prior authorization. The ordering of other gynecologic care by the participating physician is treated as prior authorization by the primary care provider. The group health plan must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider for coverage of obstetric and gynecologic care without requiring prior authorization. The plan cannot deny women eligibility based on avoiding coverage requirements, and cannot provide monetary incentives to women. The section prohibits the plan from providing monetary incentives to women to accept less protection, or penalizing providers for following the requirements. The imposition of these requirements is considered a material modification in the plan. The plan must provide a summary description of any modifications within 60 days of the first plan year they apply. Group health plans can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. State laws for health insurance issuers that offer more protection are not preempted. Health insurance issuers must comply with State laws that offer greater protections to enrollees than federal regulations. Amendments to section 731 of the Act include referencing section 713(f) and removing a reference to section 711. Amendments to section 732(a) of the Act involve inserting a reference to section 713 and updating the table of contents. Standards relating to access to obstetrical and gynecological services are addressed in section 2752 of the Public Health Service Act. The provisions of section 2706 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market. Health insurance issuers must comply with notice requirements similar to those for group health plans under ERISA. The section does not preempt state laws that provide greater protections to enrollees in connection with group health insurance coverage. It amends section 2762 of the Act by adding a reference to section 2752(c). The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) of Public Law 104-204 apply to group health plans and health insurance coverage in the individual market starting January 1, 1998. The amendments made by Public Law 104-204 apply to group health plans and health insurance coverage in the individual market starting January 1, 1998, with exceptions for group health plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the enactment of the Act. Any plan amendment made under a collective bargaining agreement to comply with new requirements added by subsection (a) will not terminate the agreement."
