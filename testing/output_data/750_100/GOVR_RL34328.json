It includes provisions for research funding and support for early career scientists. The America COMPETES Act authorizes increased research budgets for DOE and NSF, early career grants, ARPA-E for energy technology research, and new Discovery Science Institutes at DOE National Laboratories. It also includes education programs to recruit and train K-12 STEM teachers. The DOE, NASA, NSF, and ED offer programs to earn STEM degrees with teacher certification, enhance STEM teacher skills, and provide student-focused STEM programs such as Math Now, grants for science and math schools, AP/IB courses, scholarships, and mentoring. New STEM education activities include a summer program focused on mathematics. The DOE, NSF, and White House are implementing various programs to promote STEM education and innovation, including summer educational programs, graduate fellowship programs, and initiatives to foster innovation and competitiveness. These efforts are crucial for the nation to maintain economic growth and competitiveness. To maintain economic growth and competitiveness in a global economy, U.S. companies need to engage in trade, retain market shares, and offer high-quality products and services. Scientific and technological advances play a crucial role in creating new goods, services, jobs, and capital, as well as increasing productivity. These advances can help offset potential disadvantages in capital and labor costs by improving the quality and efficiency of production. Various factors such as scientific advances, government activities, firm organization, and serendipity can influence technological progress. The organization of firms, government policies, and serendipity impact technological progress and U.S. competitiveness. Two main policy approaches are direct measures like budget outlays and indirect measures such as financial incentives. The U.S. has used a combination of these approaches since World War II to enhance competitiveness. The Steelman report post-WWII expressed concerns about future competition. The 1970s saw a peak in interest in U.S. competitiveness as experts worried about competition from Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries. The United States had lost market share in various industries, raising concerns about declining technological superiority. The U.S. lost market share in R&D-intensive goods to Japan, with lower productivity growth, fewer scientists and engineers, and declining patent grants. Some attributed this to falling R&D expenditures compared to Europe and Japan. The U.S. responded to falling behind in R&D compared to Europe and Japan by passing several acts, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, the Bayh-Dole Act, and the Federal Technology Transfer Act. Additionally, the SEMATECH consortium was established to advance the U.S. semiconductor industry. The U.S. responded to falling behind in R&D compared to Europe and Japan by passing several acts, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, the Bayh-Dole Act, and the Federal Technology Transfer Act. A test facility and conduit for new technological advances for the U.S. semiconductor industry was created, along with additional congressional actions focused on increasing corporate spending on research and development. The Small Business Development Act established a set-aside of federal R&D funds to support work in innovative small firms. Competitiveness concerns continued until the mid-1990s when the U.S. economy and technological innovation improved. In response to falling behind in R&D compared to Europe and Japan, the U.S. passed acts like the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 and the Bayh-Dole Act. The nation saw improvements in its economy and technological innovation, leading to success in industries like Internet applications, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. Today's competitiveness concerns focus on globalization and federal science and engineering research funding. The debates surrounding federal science and engineering research funding, STEM education quality, and the number of Americans obtaining science and engineering degrees are ongoing. The impact of globalization on American companies, workers, and families is both positive and negative, with many U.S. companies relying on international markets for sales and employing more foreign workers than domestic. This integration with the world economy can enhance productivity in the United States. The integration with the world economy can boost productivity in the United States, leading to higher living standards and incomes. However, increased trade with low-wage countries raises concerns about job loss and lower wages for American workers. Technology and a global labor supply are key factors driving today's economic globalization. The America COMPETES Act addresses the increase in global labor supply and government policies reducing trade barriers. It authorizes direct measures and committees to address these issues. Some believe that current federal funding for basic science and engineering research is insufficient for technological progress and job creation. The America COMPETES Act aims to boost technological progress and create new industries and jobs by increasing federal funding for basic research in key fields. It also focuses on making the U.S. labor pool more competitive globally. The America COMPETES Act aims to enhance technological progress and job creation by increasing federal funding for research in key fields. It addresses concerns about the lack of American students proficient in STEM subjects and low numbers pursuing post-secondary STEM degrees. The act includes measures to improve STEM education and encourage more students to pursue advanced STEM classes and degrees. The America COMPETES Act authorizes meetings, studies, and committees to identify actions for the United States to undertake, such as studying costs faced by U.S. businesses in innovation. Other legislative initiatives encourage industry to invest more in research and development, promote joint research activities, facilitate technology transfer, and provide incentives for quality improvements. The Act had strong bipartisan support. Some experts support actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness, while others have doubts about the proposed actions in the America COMPETES Act. Competitiveness can vary based on perspectives like individual firms, multinational corporations, or domestic labor, focusing on trade and ability to compete. The focus of competitiveness for individual domestic firms lies in trade and their ability to compete for market share against imports or foreign firms in export markets. The U.S. trade balance in advanced technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002. The U.S. trade balance in high technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002. From 2002 to 2005, the trade deficit in high technology products grew from $16.6 billion to $43.6 billion. Despite the deficit, many high technology imports are from U.S. companies that assemble products overseas. The growing trade deficit in high technology products, particularly electronics, has led to concerns about policy scrutiny. For U.S. multinational corporations with production facilities abroad, competitiveness is measured by their ability to compete for market share globally. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined sharply after 2000, impacting the competitiveness of these firms. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined sharply after 2000, rebounding to $184 billion by 2006. Domestic labor defines competitiveness as the ability to compete against foreign firms in export markets or within the United States, focusing on job creation and key measures like employment and wages. The United States is a major player in foreign direct investment, with U.S. firms investing $249 billion abroad in 2006. While some see this as beneficial, concerns exist about displaced workers and lower wages. Most of the investment is in high-income developed countries, leading to a restructuring of the economy. Most economists believe that direct investment abroad by U.S. firms is a result of restructuring in manufacturing industries and does not necessarily lead to job losses or lower incomes for Americans. The National Science Foundation (NSF) faces challenges in determining the science and engineering workforce and the jobs created in these fields. NSF categorizes science and engineering occupations into five broad groups, but this classification may not cover all individuals with science and engineering degrees. For example, a chemist who teaches. The National Science Foundation (NSF) categorizes science and engineering occupations into five broad groups, but this classification may not cover all individuals with science and engineering degrees. Some professionals use their science and engineering knowledge in occupations such as teaching, managing manufacturing plants, patent law, and medicine. Others apply their S&E training in non-S&E roles like writing, sales, finance, and law. The National Science Foundation (NSF) categorizes science and engineering occupations into five broad groups, but this classification may not cover all individuals with science and engineering degrees. Some professionals use their science and engineering knowledge in occupations such as teaching, managing manufacturing plants, patent law, and medicine. The science and engineering workforce could be considerably larger than government analyses suggest, with estimates ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006 according to the National Science Board (NSB). The most relevant number may be around 17.0 million. The National Science Board (NSB) suggests that in 2006, there were around 17.0 million individuals with at least one degree in a science and engineering field, or 21.4 million including related fields like health or technology. These numbers reflect the various ways science and technical knowledge are utilized in the United States, differing from other data sources like NSF, U.S. Census Bureau, and BLS. The National Science Board (NSB) reported in 2006 that there were 17.0 million individuals with science and engineering degrees. Another data source from NSF shows 12.9 million workers in 2003 reported needing a bachelor's degree level of STEM knowledge. Statistical analysts struggle to account for the need for STEM understanding in all workers and those in new technology-related jobs. Computerization has shifted employment tasks towards high-level skills, reducing the demand for routine tasks. The model can explain 60% of the demand shift favoring college labor from 1970 to 1998. The number of workers in science and engineering occupations grew significantly, 7.7 times larger in 2000 than in 1950. STEM growth rate in the 1990s was over three times that of the overall labor force. The STEM workforce saw significant growth in the 1990s, with a growth rate over three times that of the overall labor force. Recent data from BLS shows a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce since 2000. However, science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with computer-related occupations expected to account for approximately 65% of this growth. The demand for science and engineering occupations is expected to grow, with above-average growth in life sciences, social sciences, and related fields. Unemployment in S&E occupations was 1.6% in 2006. Compensation for most STEM occupations is higher than the U.S. labor force, with similar growth rates. These projections only consider strictly defined S&E occupations and not the wider range of jobs S&E degree holders often pursue. The growth rate in compensation for STEM workers is similar to that of professions and higher than all workers in 2005. Recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients saw a 15% increase in real salary from 1993 to 2003. Median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after graduation were $65,000, higher than non-S&E degree holders at $49,000. Variance exists among STEM occupations, fields, and sub-fields. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures of competitiveness do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness, especially in the global economy. Factors like foreign affiliate sales, global supply chain fragmentation, and lack of inclusion of services and intangibles are not considered in current assessments. Trade balance is no longer as useful a measure, and competition now involves more than just domestic companies. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures of competitiveness are outdated in today's global economy. They suggest additional factors like pension funds, real estate, healthcare benefits, and purchasing power to understand individual prosperity. The America COMPETES Act is mentioned as a potential solution. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve prosperity through individual efforts by emphasizing the importance of STEM knowledge for all Americans, addressing the lack of proficiency in K-12 students, and promoting enthusiasm for STEM among students through teachers with STEM degrees. It also highlights the need for more Americans to obtain degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The United States needs more Americans to pursue STEM degrees to ensure a workforce capable of driving innovation and new industries. STEM graduates are versatile and can work in various fields beyond their specialty. Research in science and engineering is crucial for U.S. competitiveness and economic growth, but current funding levels are inadequate. Additional federal funding for basic science and engineering research is crucial for enhancing U.S. competitiveness and creating new industries and jobs. This is supported by analyses such as the OECD's PISA scores comparing U.S. students' performance in STEM education internationally. American students scored below the OECD average in science and mathematics literacy in 2006. Middle school math teachers in the US are not as well prepared as those in other countries, contributing to lower scores for American students. The US also has low rates of STEM degree production compared to non-STEM degrees globally. According to NSF data, STEM degrees accounted for 16.8% of all first university degrees awarded in the United States in 2002, compared to an international average of 26.4%. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the National Science Foundation developed a research and development satellite account to estimate the impact of R&D investment on U.S. economic growth. R&D investment accounted for 5% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2004, and 7% between 1995 and 2004. Some question the extent of U.S. benefit from federal research investments and the influence of the federal government in STEM education. Some question the effectiveness of federal investments in research and STEM education, doubting if they will lead to job creation for all Americans. There are concerns about whether these actions alone can enhance U.S. competitiveness, as other factors also play a role. Additionally, there are doubts about the necessity of taking action to improve U.S. competitiveness, with some questioning if science and engineering research are even issues. Some analysts question the need for additional scientists and engineers in the United States, citing doubts about current workforce projections and low salaries in STEM occupations. Concerns also arise about the quality and number of scientists and engineers in China and India. Issues include potential oversupply of scientists and engineers, management of increased research funding, and challenges faced by agencies receiving funds. The need for additional scientists and engineers in the United States is questioned due to doubts about workforce projections and low salaries in STEM occupations. Concerns also arise about the quality and number of scientists and engineers in China and India. Policymakers are considering direct and indirect measures to address funding challenges faced by agencies like NIH. Direct measures include increased funding, while indirect measures involve tax policy changes. Supporters of direct government assistance believe resources should focus on promising technologies, while others argue that the market is superior to government intervention in technology development. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006 during his State of the Union address, which responded to the need for additional scientists and engineers in the United States. Supporters of direct government assistance believe resources should focus on promising technologies, while others argue that the market is superior to government intervention in technology development. The America COMPETES Act and the ACI were introduced to address concerns about the United States' ability to compete economically in the future due to insufficient investment in science and technology research. Many provisions of ACI were included in the America COMPETES Act, such as increased research funding at NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, as well as STEM education programs like Math Now and the AP/IB program. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding increases for these agencies. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding increases for the NSF, NIST laboratories, DOE Office of Science, ARPA-E, and Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. It also encourages executive agencies to allocate a percentage of their basic research budget to high-risk projects and emphasizes the importance of funding NASA at authorized levels. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding increases for NSF, NIST laboratories, and DOE Office of Science over FY2008-2010, with potential doubling of funding beyond 2010. Advocates call for increased research funding in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science based on the National Academies' report. The National Academies committee developed a storm report calling for a 10% annual increase in federal investment in long-term basic research over the next seven years. This is deemed necessary due to stagnant funding in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences for the past 15 years. Agencies are less likely to support high-potential high-risk research when funding is flat, leading to overlooked proposals. The National Academies committee recommended a 10% annual increase in federal investment in long-term basic research over seven years due to inadequate funds for high-quality proposals. Corporations are unlikely to fill this gap as they fund little basic research, which is riskier than shareholders prefer. The committee also considered the NSF Authorization Act of 2002, which authorized doubling NSF's research budget over five years, and expanded this recommendation to other federal agencies. The committee recommended a 10% annual increase in federal investment in long-term basic research over seven years. The Administration has not explained why it chose a 7% annual rate for doubling research activities over 10 years. Funding for federally funded science is limited but crucial for economic competitiveness. The National Academies' 2005 report \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm\" emphasized the importance of increased funding for basic research in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering to enhance the nation's economic competitiveness. The report suggested reallocating existing funds or seeking new funds to support these areas due to limited federal funding for science programs. The Administration's response to limited federal funds for science was the American Competitiveness Initiative, proposing to double budgets for NSF, NIST, and DOE's Office of Science over ten years. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes NASA's participation in promoting innovation, economic competitiveness, basic research, and STEM education. The Congress emphasizes the need for robust funding of NASA to support U.S. innovation and competitiveness. Concerns have been raised about the balance and insufficient funds in the President's FY2008 budget for NASA's Vision for Space Exploration. The Congress emphasizes the need for robust funding of NASA to support U.S. innovation and competitiveness. Concerns have been raised about insufficient funds for NASA's Vision for Space Exploration and other important initiatives. A National Research Council report suggests that NASA is being asked to do too much with too little resources, questioning the agency's priorities and sustainability. The America COMPETES Act also highlights the need for a reevaluation of NASA's tasks and resources. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of allocating funding for high-risk, high reward research projects to address technological and scientific challenges. This provision aims to support transformative research that involves multidisciplinary work and novel ideas, addressing concerns about current federal research funding review mechanisms. The National Science Board (NSB) and the National Institutes of Health recognize the challenges faced by transformative research projects that do not align with traditional funding models. Investigators are hesitant to submit innovative ideas due to low success rates, prompting the development of new funding mechanisms like the Pioneer's Award. The Pioneer's Award was developed in response to concerns about funding for transformative research at NSF. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes the need for revolutionary and cutting-edge research, but reports highlight a lack of dedicated funds for this purpose. The Foundation is directed to review current practices to enhance support for transformative research. The Appropriations Committees direct the Foundation to review current practices supporting transformational proposals and provide reports on addressing this area. $10 million of NSF's budget is designated for a new program emphasizing transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E as a new federal organization in DOE. The COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E, a new federal organization in the DOE with the goal of enhancing economic and energy security through developing technologies to reduce energy imports, greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and lead in advanced energy technologies. ARPA-E aims to achieve this through revolutionary energy technology projects. ARPA-E, based on the DARPA model, aims to accelerate technological advances in areas where industry may not invest due to uncertainty. The concept for ARPA-E was inspired by the National Academies report, proposing the DARPA model for other parts of the federal research system. Several initiatives have been proposed in the past to create a civilian technology agency or corporation for advanced research, including in the 100th and 101st Congresses and by the National Academy of Sciences in 1992. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore also suggested a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies in 1993. A civilian advanced research agency, ARPA-E, was proposed to support research on renewable technologies and fuels. It aims to bring excitement to energy research, focus on transformational research, and utilize an ARPA-like organization. The report proposed the creation of an ARPA-like organization to support research on renewable technologies and fuels, with funding starting at $300 million in the first year and increasing to $1 billion per year over five to six years. This organization would bridge gaps between basic energy research, development, and industrial innovation, serving as a model for improving science and technology transfer in other essential areas for future prosperity. ARPA-E would start with $300 million in the first year, increasing to $1 billion annually over five to six years. The program's effectiveness would be evaluated at that point. National Academies committee members emphasized the importance of not jeopardizing basic research funded by the DOE's Office of Science. They suggested that the organization and mission of ARPA-E should be determined through consultation with experts from the scientific and engineering communities. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish multidisciplinary Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories to apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations, in consultation with experts from the scientific and engineering communities. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories to focus on critical emerging technologies. These Institutes aim to train science and engineering students, develop educational curricula, conduct research with higher-education partners, and collaborate with industrial partners to develop innovative technologies. The goal is to reshape the nation's engineering research and education by providing opportunities for DOE National Laboratories to work with universities in areas like nanoscience and microsystems. Proponents argue that reshaping the nation's engineering research and education is necessary to address challenges in global markets, national security, energy sustainability, and public health. This task requires collaboration between the federal government, states, industry, foundations, and academia. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs to recruit more teachers and enhance the skills of current STEM professionals. The America COMPETES Act focuses on recruiting and enhancing STEM teachers, supporting students in STEM education through various initiatives, with an emphasis on outreach and mentoring for women and minorities. It includes programs for establishing specialty high schools, experiential learning opportunities, and internships. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes recruiting and enhancing STEM teachers, supporting students through initiatives like specialty high schools, experiential learning opportunities, internships, and summer institutes to improve teacher content knowledge. It also includes the appointment of a Director for STEM Education at the Department of Energy and a graduate research fellowship program. The curr_chunk discusses the role of an interagency liaison for K-12 STEM education, a graduate research fellowship program called Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE), and new grant programs at the Department of Education for STEM teacher training and professional development. The curr_chunk discusses programs to improve STEM education, including a one-year master's degree program for STEM professionals, Math Now for math instruction, and the AP/IB Program to expand access to advanced coursework for low-income students. Increased support for existing NSF programs including the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, Math and Science Partnerships program, STEM talent expansion program (STEP), and Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program to improve STEM education in high-need schools. The America COMPETES Act includes programs to improve STEM education at undergraduate and secondary school levels, provide graduate research fellowships, and promote innovative models in graduate education. These programs will be managed by the DOE and its National Laboratories, marking a shift in their role in K-12 STEM education. The Administration has opposed some of the DOE-managed STEM initiatives. The Administration has opposed DOE-managed STEM initiatives in K-12 education, including Specialty Schools in Math and Science, Experiential-based Learning Opportunities, Summer Institutes, and National Laboratories Centers of Excellence. Proponents argue that interacting with DOE scientists and engineers can inspire teachers and students in math and science education. DOE specialty schools for math and science are public secondary schools for state residents. Public secondary schools for math and science in each state aim to enhance students' academic performance in STEM subjects. Advocates believe these schools can serve as hubs of excellence, attracting top students and teachers. The America COMPETES Act allows for summer internships at DOE national laboratories for middle and high school students. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM subjects. Proponents argue that these programs make a significant impact on education quality. DOE National Laboratory Centers of Excellence in STEM education support teachers in utilizing national laboratory resources. The America COMPETES Act authorizes STEM education programs at DOE national laboratories to assist teachers in high-need public secondary schools. The Administration opposes establishing school-based centers, citing resource diversion, while proponents argue that these programs inspire teachers and students. The America COMPETES Act authorizes STEM education programs at DOE national laboratories to assist teachers in high-need public secondary schools. The Administration opposes increasing funding for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and establishing funding for the Laboratory Science Pilot program. NSF is responsible for promoting quality math and science education to keep the U.S. competitive in the 21st century. Math and science educators are crucial for keeping the U.S. competitive in the 21st century. Increasing the number of qualified K-12 math and science teachers is essential for fostering a new generation of innovators. The National Academies' Rising Above the Gathering Storm report emphasizes the need to enhance undergraduate education for future science and engineering workforce. An additional $5,000,000 is allocated for the Robert Noyce Scholarship program to support STEM undergraduate students. The Noyce program aims to recruit STEM undergraduate students and professionals to become K-12 math and science teachers. It provides grants to higher education institutions for scholarships and stipends in exchange for service in high-need school districts. This program, along with ED's Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow, supports the development of qualified educators to enhance the future science and engineering workforce. The Noyce program aims to recruit STEM students and professionals to become K-12 teachers. It is based on successful programs like UTeach and California Teach, which better prepare teachers for the classroom. The program is considered radical for training teachers in science and math departments instead of education departments. Universities involved have had to change their traditional viewpoint. The Noyce program aims to recruit STEM students and professionals to become K-12 teachers, changing universities' traditional viewpoint. It also authorizes a new program at NSF for professional science master's degree programs emphasizing practical training for high-need fields. Professional Science Master's (PSM) programs aim to meet industry workforce needs by providing advanced training in science or mathematics along with workplace skills valued by employers. Developed with industry guidance, these programs typically include two years of academic training, internships, and cross-training in emerging or interdisciplinary areas. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program awards grants to partnerships to enhance STEM instruction by improving school laboratories and providing professional development for teachers. The National Research Council found that high school laboratory experiences are poor for most students, especially in schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new programs in the Department of Education, including the Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program to increase STEM teachers. The Math Now program aims to increase the number of STEM teachers by providing grants to institutions of higher education. It focuses on encouraging undergraduate students pursuing STEM degrees to also pursue teacher certification, and offers a part-time master's degree program for current teachers to enhance their STEM knowledge and teaching skills. The goal is to improve math instruction through research-based tools and professional development. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve math instruction by providing research-based tools and professional development for teachers. It includes provisions for the establishment of a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. President Bush responded by creating a National Science and Technology Committee (NSTC) on Technology subcommittee. The America COMPETES Act established a National Science and Technology Committee (NSTC) on Technology subcommittee to respond to the act. It also mandated the convening of a National Science and Technology Summit to assess the U.S. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics enterprises. This summit took place in August 2008. Additionally, the act directed the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to align the Administration's R&D budget priorities with the summit's conclusions and recommendations. Furthermore, the act required OSTP to develop principles for communication and openness in science and technology. The America COMPETES Act mandated the OSTP to develop principles for communication and openness in science and technology. In response, the Bush Administration OSTP sent a memorandum to federal agencies emphasizing the importance of robust and open communication of scientific information for advancing science and informing society. The Federal government is committed to a culture of scientific openness, fostering the exchange of ideas and information. NASA's science communications policy serves as a model for other agencies, allowing employees to speak to the press and public about their work. Exceptions exist for privileged information. Actions designated for OSTP by the America COMPETES Act are outlined. Actions designated for OSTP by the America COMPETES Act include a study on barriers to innovation, National Technology and Innovation Medal, Semiannual Science, Technology, and Mathematics Days, study of service science, national coordination of research infrastructure, and a sense of Congress on innovation acceleration research. A hearing was held on the Nomination of Dr. John Holdren as OSTP Director, and his nomination was confirmed on March 19, 2009. Dr. Holdren's nomination as OSTP Director was confirmed on March 19, 2009. During his testimony, he emphasized the importance of ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress, regardless of political implications. If confirmed, he stated this would be one of his highest obligations. Dr. Holdren emphasized the importance of ensuring unbiased scientific advice to the President and Congress, including working with federal agencies to prevent censorship or distortion of scientific information. The America Competes Act mandates the open communication of data and results from federal scientists. President Obama issued a memorandum on Scientific Integrity in 2009, assigning OSTP the responsibility for ensuring integrity in the federal government's involvement with scientific research. This includes clarifying policies for disseminating research results and providing training to managers, researchers, and public information staff. Within 120 days of the memorandum, the Director will develop recommendations for Presidential action to ensure scientific integrity in the executive branch. This includes selecting candidates based on knowledge, credentials, experience, and integrity, establishing rules for scientific process integrity in agencies, and ensuring accurate dissemination of scientific information. The agency should follow well-established scientific processes, including peer review, when considering scientific or technological information in policy decisions. Agencies must make scientific findings available to the public, except for restricted information. Each agency should have procedures to ensure the integrity of scientific information used in policy decisions, including whistleblower protections. The Director must be informed to make recommendations to the President as per the memorandum. Agencies must work with the Director to develop interim procedures for scientific decision-making integrity. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL34736 and Table 2 on FY2008 and FY2009 appropriations for America COMPETES Act programs. A review of funding for America COMPETES Act programs in FY2009 shows that some programs were funded at authorized levels, while others were funded below or not funded. For ARPA-E, the FY2009 appropriation exceeded the authorized amount. Future funding levels for these programs are uncertain. The funding levels for America COMPETES Act programs in FY2009 varied, with some funded below or not at authorized levels. Uncertainty exists regarding future funding, especially for programs related to research or education. The alignment of budget proposals between administrations has made it challenging to determine the status of these programs. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request did not realign existing programs with the America COMPETES Act. Insufficient evidence shows that new America COMPETES Act programs are funded. Institutes Protecting America's Competitive Edge Graduate Fellowship Program, Distinguished Scientist Program, ED Advanced Placement & International Baccalaureate Program, Math Now Summer Term Education Program, Math Skills for Secondary Skill Students, Advancing America Through Foreign Language Partnership Program, Mathematics and Science Partnership Bonus Grants, NSF Laboratory Science Pilot Program are some of the programs under consideration for FY2010 funding as Congress deliberates the appropriation for America COMPETES Act programs. The Obama Administration requested funding for most programs at levels below that authorized, citing FY2009 funding from ARRA. The America COMPETES Act, if approved as requested, would fund federal R&D programs at the highest levels in U.S. history. Some programs newly authorized in the act have never been funded, raising questions about their future funding. The Act provides authorization levels only through FY2010, with uncertainty about funding for subsequent years. The America COMPETES Act aims to invest in innovation through research and development to improve the competitiveness of the United States. Indicators can help assess the success of the act, although cause and effect are challenging to analyze due to various influencing factors. The United States currently holds the top spot in international competitiveness rankings. The America COMPETES Act aims to maintain the United States' top spot in international competitiveness rankings by evaluating its ability to compete with other countries through various mechanisms. When evaluating innovation and competitiveness, it is important to consider that there are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness. Various indicators of innovation activity exist, but simply adding them together may not accurately assess innovation or a nation's competitiveness. Other factors like necessity or serendipity can also play a significant role. The ability to evaluate the quality of an innovation and its impact on quality of life and economic growth is limited and can vary depending on the perspective of a company or individual. Innovation and its impact on economic growth are complex and can vary depending on perspective. Increased spending on research and development does not guarantee new technologies or innovation. Market demand, perceived need, and minor product alterations can drive innovation regardless of R&D. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities all play a role in funding R&D and innovation. The America COMPETES Act focuses on federal funding for basic research, but the industrial sector also plays a crucial role in technological innovation. University-industry cooperation is essential for bridging the gap between research and industry. It is important to note that U.S. R&D funding is largely defense-related, unlike other countries. Non-defense R&D funding in other countries differs from the U.S., where a significant portion is defense-related. Analyzing industry R&D reveals varying investment patterns, such as the allocation between research and development and funding in different sectors like electronic equipment or transportation. Patent data may indicate innovation levels, but not all outcomes of R&D can be patented. The focus of government policy is on creating an environment for innovation to flourish, leading to competitiveness. The number of scientists and engineers may not reflect a nation's innovative capacity, as new industries can be developed by individuals with or without college degrees. There are no guarantees that any specific action will result in innovation or enhanced competitiveness. The United States aims to be competitive in innovation with other nations by monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of its policies. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness will play a key role in measuring the impact of policy actions. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness oversees the implementation of public laws and initiatives to promote innovation, advises on global competitiveness trends, identifies opportunities for improvement, develops metrics to measure progress in innovation, and evaluates research and education programs like ARPA-E. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness oversees the evaluation of research and education programs like ARPA-E and the Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. Federal research programs are evaluated based on quality, relevance, and performance criteria. Agencies use a merit-based, competitive process to determine funding for research activities, graduate students, and distinguished scientists. The DOE summer institutes and ED STEM programs evaluate their impact on STEM teaching skills, teacher participation, and student achievement. The act focuses on increasing the number of new STEM teachers in schools, promoting diversity in STEM teaching, bringing STEM professionals into teaching, and retaining participating teachers. It also includes provisions for annual evaluations to assess impact on student achievement. The curr_chunk discusses evaluating U.S. competitiveness through indicators like the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard. The WEF report ranks countries based on data and surveys, while the OECD report provides insights on science, technology, and industry. The OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard report in Figure 5 analyzes innovation by regions and industries, trade competitiveness, and productivity using input and output indicators such as economic trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages. Different audiences are interested in various output indicators monitored by organizations like the BEA, BLS, U.S. Census Bureau, and National Science Foundation. The NSF, BLS, and BEA monitor output indicators regularly. The BEA is conducting an analysis on R&D's contribution to GDP growth. Input indicators like education quality, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity are also monitored. These reports provide insight into policy areas needing attention in the United States. The United States needs to focus on policy areas related to education quality, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity. Despite being ranked number one overall in competitiveness, the US does not rank first in all input/output indicators. Key sub-indicators include quality of primary education (28th), quality of math and science education in higher education (45th), and capacity for innovation (9th) out of 131 countries. The United States needs to focus on policy areas related to education quality, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity. The quality of math and science education in higher education ranks 45th, capacity for innovation ranks 9th out of 131 countries. Analysis of state-level competitiveness is available, with indicators influenced by the America COMPETES Act. The Milken Institute uses 77 unique indicators in five major components to assess competitiveness. The Information Technology and Innovation Institute, Alera, and Suffolk University's Beacon Hill Institute use various factors to assess competitiveness, such as high-tech jobs, R&D expenditures, and STEM degrees. The America COMPETES Act is an authorization act that requires subsequent appropriation for new programs and increases in existing programs. The 110th Congress provided FY2008 appropriations. The 110th and 111th Congress provided appropriations for various programs like ED's Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow, NIST's Technology Improvement Program, DOE's ARPA-E, and NSF's PSM program. Some America COMPETES Act research and STEM education programs received funding in FY2009, while others did not. As Congress deliberates the FY2010 budget, an issue is whether America COMPETES Act programs will receive appropriations. Some programs newly authorized in the act have never been funded, raising concerns about their establishment. The act provides authorization levels only through FY2010, and now that some programs have been funded, policymakers are observing the impact to determine if the act addresses concerns effectively. The America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69) originated as the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007 and the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act in the 110th Congress. It is being observed by policymakers to determine its impact on U.S. competitiveness and investments in R&D and STEM education.
