    "content": "The level of pay for congressional staff is determined by the chair and ranking Member of Senate committees, who set job titles, pay rates, and resources for staff. Congressional pay data is of interest for assessing costs, setting pay levels, and comparing with other federal government systems. The pay levels of congressional staff are determined by Senate committees. Data on congressional staff pay is based on official Senate reports and collected by LegiStorm. Annual data by fiscal year is also provided for analysis. This report provides annual data on Senate committee staff compensation by fiscal year, including pay data for 13 staff position titles since FY2001. Position titles were identified through a two-step process, with 25 titles assessed for data availability. In a study on Senate committee staff compensation, 25 titles were initially assessed for data availability. Twelve titles used by six or fewer panels were excluded, and pay data was collected for the remaining 13 positions. Annual pay data needed to be available from at least five committees for each position to be included. Data for no more than two staff per committee were collected if multiple staff held the same job title. Staff had to hold the position for the entire fiscal year and not receive pay from any other source. Data collected for this report tabulates every recorded payment ascribed in the LegiStorm data to staff working in House committee offices for the entire fiscal year. The pay data may differ from stated annual salaries due to the inclusion of overtime, bonuses, or other payments in addition to base salary. Staff must hold their position for the entire fiscal year and not receive pay from any other congressional employing authority. Pay data for staff in personal offices of Senators and Members of the House is also available in CRS Report R44322. The pay of congressional staff in Senators' and Members' personal offices is available in CRS reports. Data may not represent all positions due to title assignments and concerns about accuracy. The pay data for Senate committee staff positions can vary in representativeness based on the titles assigned. Two categories of positions emerge: those usually held by one staff member per committee, and those that may have multiple staff members. Pay information for the former is likely highly representative, while data for the latter may be a sample. The pay data for Senate committee staff positions may not be fully representative as it is more likely a sample of staff in those positions rather than complete data. Pay data does not consider factors like education, work experience, or job duties. Aggregation of pay by job title assumes staff with the same title have similar tasks. Congressional employing authorities have wide discretion in setting employment terms. Congressional employing authorities have wide discretion in setting the terms and conditions of employment, leading to differences in duties and pay levels for similarly titled staff. An older edition of the Senate Handbook notes the variability in job duties among individuals with the same title. Tables in this section offer background information on Senate pay practices, comparative data, and detailed information for each position, including maximum payable rates for Senate committee staff since 2001 in both current and constant 2016 dollars. Tables in this section provide cumulative percentage changes in median pay for 13 positions, Members of Congress, and salaries under the General Schedule in Washington, DC. Tabular pay data for each Senate committee staff position is also included, along with graphic displays showing pay from three perspectives. Between FY2011 and FY2015, median pay changed by up to 16.93% in constant 2016 dollars, with displays showing pay comparisons over different intervals and distributions of pay in $10,000 increments. Between FY2011 and FY2015, median pay changes ranged from a 16.93% increase for professional staff to a -16.48% decrease for staff assistants. Comparatively, Members of Congress saw a -5.10% change and General Schedule, DC, saw a -3.19% change in pay over the same period. From FY2006 to FY2015, pay changes ranged from a 22.01% increase for senior counsels to a -26.72% decrease for staff assistants. Between FY2001 and FY2015, median pay changes for staff positions ranged from a 30.88% increase for systems administrators to a -26.67% decrease for staff assistants. Out of the seven positions with available data, five saw pay increases while two saw declines. Comparatively, Members of Congress experienced a -10.40% change in pay during the same period.
