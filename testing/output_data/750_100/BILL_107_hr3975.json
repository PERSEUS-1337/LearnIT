FINDINGS.\" Summarized chunk:\nThe Congress finds that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is predicted to become the worst infectious disease in history, surpassing past deadly outbreaks. The gap in HIV transmission from mother to child between rich and poor countries is widening, endangering progress in child health. The HIV/AIDS epidemic threatens to reverse progress in child survival in developing countries, with UNAIDS predicting a potential 100% increase in child mortality by 2010 in the most affected regions. The National Intelligence Council estimates a dramatic increase in AIDS orphans worldwide, potentially tripling in the next 10 years, leading to economic decay, social fragmentation, and political destabilization in volatile societies. The economic costs of infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, could reduce gross domestic product by 20 percent or more by 2010 in some sub-Saharan African nations. Despite discouraging statistics on HIV/AIDS spread, some developing nations like Uganda and Senegal have shown progress. Some developing nations like Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand have implemented successful HIV prevention programs, reducing infection rates. United States financial support for global medical research and disease containment has significant benefits.
