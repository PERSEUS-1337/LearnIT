    "content": "The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, mandates that vessels transporting cargo between U.S. points must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. It protects U.S. shipyards, carriers, and sailors but is debated for increasing costs and limiting ship availability. The Jones Act has been a prominent issue in recent Congresses, linked to Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the sinking of the ship El Faro in 2015, and discussions on domestic oil and gas transportation. Its effectiveness in achieving national security goals is under scrutiny, with a call for a national maritime strategy. The Jones Act of 1920, a law requiring U.S.-built, owned, and crewed vessels for domestic cargo transport, was a restatement of a long-standing restriction dating back to 1789. In May 2018, the Office of Management and Budget sought public input on modifying or repealing federal regulations to enhance efficiency in the maritime sector. In 1789, Congress enacted laws imposing lesser duties on domestically built and owned vessels. By 1817, only U.S.-built vessels owned by U.S. citizens could register as U.S. vessels. In 1886, the prohibition on foreign-owned vessels transporting domestic cargo was extended to include passengers. The U.S. had a shipbuilding advantage due to ample timber supplies. During the late 1800s, the U.S. lost its shipbuilding advantage to Scotland and England as wooden sailing ships were replaced by iron steamships. Congress debated how to address the decline in U.S. vessels in foreign trade, with proposals for foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag. Opponents argued that higher costs of U.S. crews would hinder a resurgence in trade carried by U.S. vessels. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels for domestic voyages. In the late 1800s, Congress considered bills allowing foreign-built ships in domestic trade but tightened coastwise transport regulations instead due to high U.S. crew costs. In 1891, a shipper loaded merchandise on a foreign-flag ship from New York to Los Angeles via Antwerp, Belgium, to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels. Despite extra charges, freight costs were lower than using a U.S.-owned ship. This practice was found legal by the court. In 1891, a shipper legally used a foreign-flag ship to transport goods from New York to Los Angeles via Antwerp, Belgium, to save costs. Congress later amended laws to prevent shippers from routing cargo through foreign ports to avoid coastwise laws. U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. Senator Wesley Jones of Washington amended the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 to require Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle. The Jones Act required Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle by amending coastwise laws to cover shipments \"by land and water\" between \"U.S. points.\" The debate on the relative cost of building ships in the U.S. versus foreign countries was part of the discussion leading up to the Act's passage. Congress had previously requested annual reports on this subject in the Shipping Act of 1916. The Jones Act aimed to promote American merchant marine by allowing American merchants to acquire ships at the lowest possible price to compete globally. This would lead to more ships under the American flag. The Jones Act aimed to promote American merchant marine by allowing American merchants to acquire ships at the lowest possible price to compete globally. This would lead to more ships under the American flag. In contrast, if American merchants are restricted to buying ships only from American builders for coastwise trade, U.S.-built ships will cost more than foreign-built ones, as shown in a 1922 government report on shipbuilding. The cost differential between U.S.-built ships and those from foreign yards has increased over the years. In the 1950s, U.S. shipyard prices were double, by the 1990s they were three times, and today they are estimated to be four to five times higher. This price difference is a concern for Department of Defense officials overseeing military sealift ships. The military has found it unaffordable to build sealift ships domestically and will instead purchase more used vessels. The cost differential between U.S.-built ships and foreign-built ships has increased over the years. U.S. shipyards are not competitive in terms of price or vessel characteristics. U.S.-flag ships have higher operating costs, estimated to be over $6 million per ship per year compared to foreign-flag ships. This cost includes crewing, insurance, and maintenance. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed the sale of surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined key maritime policy goals for national defense and commerce growth. A 2011 study by MARAD found that U.S.-flag ships had significantly higher operating costs compared to foreign-flag ships, with the cost differential increasing over time. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the importance of a well-equipped merchant marine for national defense and commerce growth, aiming for privately owned U.S. vessels to fulfill these roles. This reflected the U.S.'s emerging power status at the time, especially during World War I when European nations utilized their ships. The Jones Act of 1920 aimed to establish a U.S. merchant marine to reduce dependency on foreign vessels. It applies to domestic waterborne shipments, requiring a majority of the crew to be U.S. citizens. The Jones Act requires the master, officers, and 75% of the crew to be U.S. citizens on U.S.-owned ships. U.S. territories like the U.S. Virgin Islands, America Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are exempt. Puerto Rico is exempt for passengers but not for cargo. Guam requires U.S.-owned and -crewed vessels but not necessarily U.S.-built. The Coast Guard enforces the U.S.-build requirement for vessels. The Jones Act requires U.S. ownership, crewing, and vessel build for coastwise endorsement. Customs and Border Protection determines maritime activity under the act. The Jones Act requires the use of \"U.S.-built\" vessels for domestic shipping, with the Coast Guard defining the criteria for a vessel to be considered U.S.-built. The Coast Guard defines the \"superstructure\" as the main deck and other structural parts above it on a vessel in the United States. Propulsion machinery and certain equipment do not affect a U.S.-build determination, allowing for the import of engines for oceangoing ships from foreign manufacturers. Engines are considered components attached to the hull, not integral parts of the structure. The Coast Guard allows certain parts or components of a vessel to be manufactured abroad as long as they do not compromise the vessel's integrity and are attached in a U.S. shipyard. The weight-based test permits up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components to be imported, including propellers, stern bulbs, bulbous bows, rudders, and watertight closures used in U.S.-built vessels. The Coast Guard permits certain foreign components in the construction of vessels as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Shipyards must confirm with the Coast Guard that incorporating foreign-built components will not disqualify the vessel from the Jones Act trade. The Coast Guard issues determination letters detailing the extent to which foreign components are permissible. The Coast Guard permits foreign components in vessel construction within steel weight limits. Congress directed the Coast Guard to publish determination letters on foreign component allowances. Shipyard unions, calling them \"kit ships,\" sued the Coast Guard in 2007 over their interpretation of the statute. The U.S. District Court sided with the Coast Guard, citing consistency with Treasury Department interpretations dating back to the late 1800s. In the late 1800s, the Treasury Department had jurisdiction over the issue, with U.S. Attorney General interpretations from the early 1900s. Shipyard unions sued over a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder since 2004, continuing to build Jones Act tankers and container ships. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego also partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea since 2006 for vessel designs and materials. Korea procures vessel designs, engineering, and some materials for commercial ships built for Jones Act carriers, potentially undermining the policy objective of domestic shipbuilding independence. Shipyards argue that using foreign components would increase ship costs, reduce orders, and harm the domestic fleet. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships due to CBP exemptions from Jones Act compliance. The Jones Act does not apply to cruise ships serving a U.S. port if they have visited a distant foreign port. This exemption allows foreign cruise ships to operate at U.S. ports without Jones Act compliance. The 1985 rule by the U.S. Customs Service allows foreign cruise ships to visit U.S. ports if they also visit a nearby foreign port. Passengers must stay on the cruise until it returns to the same dock. This exemption from the Jones Act is based on the primary intent of the voyage. Passengers on \"voyages to nowhere\" do not violate the Jones Act as long as the vessel stays within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters. CBP considers these waters as \"U.S. points\" based on Treasury Decision 22275. If the vessel goes beyond 3 miles from shore, it may not be Jones Act-compliant. CBP has determined that vessels beyond 3 miles from shore do not need to be Jones Act-compliant, based on a 1912 Attorney General opinion. However, charter fishing boats must still comply with the Jones Act even in international waters, per a 1936 ruling by the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection. CBP's interpretation of the Jones Act defines a passenger as anyone aboard a vessel who is not a crew member or owner. This includes scenarios like yacht owners entertaining clients or construction companies transporting workers. Compliance with the Jones Act is required in various industries, such as offshore oil operations. The CBP has determined that lightering operations within 3 nautical miles of shore are considered a \"U.S. point,\" requiring Jones Act compliance for vessels. Offshore supply vessels (OSVs) used for oil platforms must also adhere to Jones Act regulations. Regarding OSVs servicing offshore oil rigs, two factors determine Jones Act compliance. U.S. waters extend 200 miles offshore for offshore natural resource activities. Only oil rigs attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points\" within this zone. Some mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) are not attached and use propellers to hold position. In 2008, Congress mandated that OSVs servicing MODUs must be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. Another factor for Jones Act compliance is whether the OSV is transporting supplies or workers to the oil rig or involved in installing necessary equipment. In 2008, Congress mandated that OSVs servicing MODUs must be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. Vessels laying cable or pipeline in U.S. waters do not need to be Jones Act-compliant. OSVs transporting supplies and rig workers must be Jones Act-compliant if the rig is attached to the seabed. Foreign-flagged vessels can be used for installing rig equipment, geophysical surveying, diving inspections, and flotels providing living quarters for construction workers. The Jones Act applies to activities performed by OSVs, but its application to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore is unclear. Wind farm developers follow CBP's interpretations of the Jones Act for OSVs and oil rigs. The nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) hinders offshore wind farm development, especially in deeper water. The Jones Act applies to activities performed by OSVs, but its application to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore is unclear. Wind farm developers follow CBP's interpretations of the Jones Act for OSVs and oil rigs. The nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) hinders offshore wind farm development, especially in deeper water. In Europe, TIVs not only install the towers but also transport the equipment from shore to the offshore site. U.S. wind developers either transport the equipment from foreign countries or use Jones Act-compliant vessels to transport the equipment to the site from a U.S. port alongside non-Jones Act-compliant TIVs to install the equipment. A third CBP interpretation of the Jones Act has been significant in shaping coastal maritime activity. CBP determined that if merchandise is transformed (manufactured or processed) into a new and different product at an intermediate foreign port, then the vessels transporting the original. The Jones Act does not apply to vessels transporting a product that has been transformed into a new product at an intermediate foreign port. This allows foreign-flag tankers to transport the final product between U.S. points, such as from Texas to New York. The Jones Act exemption applies to products transformed into new products at intermediate foreign ports, allowing foreign-flag tankers to transport between U.S. points like Texas and New York. Congress has enacted provisions tightening Jones Act requirements since 1920, with exemptions for certain maritime activities. In 1935, Congress prohibited Jones Act-qualified vessels from being sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign-flag, ensuring they could not be used in U.S. domestic trade again. This protects Jones Act carriers from competition if coastal shipping demand rises. In 1940, towing vessels were included under the Jones Act, covering river tugs, harbor tugs, and salvage vessels operating in U.S. waters. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material is also included. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material, such as dredge spoil or municipal solid waste, requires a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act when no qualified operator is available, such as in passenger travel between Puerto Rico and U.S. ports. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act for certain situations, such as allowing foreign-flag cruise ships and LNG tankers to provide service when no Jones Act-qualified operators are available. In cases of sudden demand for Jones Act-qualified vessels, exemptions have also been made, such as for iron ore transport on the Great Lakes. In the 1940s, Congress exempted iron ore transport on the Great Lakes due to a vessel shortage related to steelmaking for the war effort. In 1951, a similar exemption was made for a bumper grain harvest. In 1996, exemptions were granted for vessels involved in oil spill cleanup operations when there weren't enough Jones Act-qualified vessels available. Additionally, waivers were given for innovative vessel designs used in foreign trade with domestic legs that would fall under the Jones Act. In 1971, Congress exempted river barges used for international voyages from the Jones Act. This exemption is no longer relevant as the technology is no longer in use. In 1965, Congress exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports for international shipments from the Jones Act. This allows foreign-flagged container carriers to reposition their empty equipment along U.S. coastlines. Jones Act-compliant ships are needed for transshipment of loaded international containers. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships for transshipment of loaded international containers, which is not common in the United States. This lack of transshipment services increases the demand for rail and road connections to ports. Congress may authorize exemptions to the Jones Act under certain circumstances. Since 1989, Congress has granted exemptions to the Jones Act for specific vessels identified by name and registration number. These waivers do not specify the reason for the exemption or details about the vessel. At least 133 vessels have been granted waivers in 16 legislative acts, typically found in maritime-related legislation. Since 1989, Congress has granted exemptions to the Jones Act for specific vessels identified by name and registration number, totaling at least 133 vessels in 16 legislative acts. These waivers are often for non-commercial vessels, with some owned by nonprofit entities. One exception was the 2011 waivers granted to three LNG tankers built in the US in the late 1970s. Many vessels require waivers due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements. The Jones Act requires vessels to meet specific ownership requirements, but waivers can be granted for technicalities like missing ownership records. Waivers have been granted for national defense reasons during World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. Congress has the authority to issue waivers in the interest of national defense, which has been used in 1991 and 2011. Waivers for the Jones Act have been granted for national defense reasons during military conflicts and natural disasters. The executive branch has used the \"national defense waiver\" authority for expedited oil shipments in response to wars and conflicts, as well as for fuel resupply after hurricanes. MARAD has a role in checking the availability of waivers. In 2008, Congress gave MARAD the role to check for Jones Act-qualified vessels before granting waivers. National defense waivers have been granted for lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet, allowing foreign-flag vessels to transport radar systems and oil rigs. Custom denied a waiver request in 1992 for a foreign-flag heavy-lift vessel. Customs denied a waiver request to use a foreign-flag heavy-lift vessel to transport replicas of Christopher Columbus's Ni\u00f1a, Pinta, and Santa Maria vessels from Boston to San Francisco, citing the high standard of \"national defense\" justification for not issuing waivers for economic reasons. In 1976, some Members of Congress sought to extend the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands due to concerns about the vulnerability of offshore supply lines. The largest refinery in North America located in the U.S. Virgin Islands supplied petroleum products to the U.S. Northeast on foreign-flagged tankers. In 2018, the United States exported between 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers, imported about 150 million barrels per month from overseas sources on foreign-flag tankers, and shipped about 15 million barrels per month domestically on Jones Act tankers. The U.S. is also exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship while continuing to import LNG by ship, with no LNG being shipped domestically. The Jones Act fleet does not have LNG tankers, and there is a lack of utilization of waivers for LNG tankers. Puerto Rico is seeking a 10-year waiver of the Jones Act to receive bulk LNG shipments from the U.S. mainland. Recent controversies over the Jones Act have focused on oceangoing ships and offshore supply vessels. The Jones Act also applies to ships on the Great Lakes, river barges, harbor tugs, dredging vessels, and passenger vessels. The Jones Act ship fleet has shortcomings compared to other sectors. As of March 2018, the Jones Act-compliant fleet had 99 oceangoing ships, with the largest category being tankers. There were 57 tankers in the fleet, including those carrying Alaskan crude oil and medium-sized product tankers. The dry cargo fleet included 24 small to medium-sized container ships and 7 ships with ramps for carrying vehicles. The Jones Act-compliant fleet includes 24 small to medium-sized container ships, 7 roll on/roll off vessels for vehicles, and 2 dry bulk vessels for commodities like grain and coal. The fleet also has 9 general-cargo vessels for Alaska's coast. The fleet has significantly decreased in size since 1950, with a notable drop in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The U.S. merchant marine experienced a drop in fleet size in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1967, Secretary of Transportation Alan Boyd criticized the industry as \"too small, too old, and too unproductive.\" The Jones Act was called for repeal by the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration, which is unique in modern times. Domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines. Ocean carriers, under the Jones Act, have economic advantages over competitors like railroads and pipelines. They can transport more cargo efficiently without the need for rights-of-way. While slower than other modes, many shippers prefer the lower costs and reliable delivery schedules offered by ships, especially in markets where overland options are limited. The Jones Act fleet primarily serves domestic trade routes to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The Jones Act fleet primarily serves domestic trade routes to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, operating in markets where shippers have little alternative. The Act has not succeeded in meeting the policy goal of sustaining a growing merchant marine. Congress amended the policy goals in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to include providing shipping service on essential routes and having the safest vessels. The Jones Act fleet does not meet the goal of having the best equipped and most suitable vessels, lacking certain ship designs like \"project cargo\" or \"heavy-lift\" vessels. These specialized vessels are essential for transporting oversized equipment and have not been part of the Jones Act fleet for decades. The Jones Act fleet lacks specialized vessels like \"project cargo\" or \"heavy-lift\" vessels, hindering its ability to compete internationally due to higher costs. Two oceangoing dry bulk ships in the fleet are mostly inactive, possibly due to their age of nearly 40 years, double the economic life of global fleet ships. The Jones Act fleet faces challenges due to the age of its vessels, with some ships being nearly 40 years old, twice the economic life of global fleet ships. The lack of LNG tankers and Jones Act-qualified tanker capacity has led to pressure for lifting the crude oil export ban. The U.S. market has developed a unique vessel design called an articulated tug barge (ATB) in response to high costs. An articulated tug barge (ATB) is a unique vessel design used in the Jones Act trades, with over 150 currently in operation. While ATBs are more capable than flatwater barges in handling sea swells, they are still less efficient and reliable than tanker ships due to their slower speed and smaller size. The notch between the barge and tug creates more resistance through the water, increasing the risk of grounding and oil spills reaching shorelines. ATB crews are not qualified to sail sealift ships. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship that sank in a hurricane in 2015, had open lifeboats due to being built in 1975. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the U.S.-flag fleet's condition after the incident. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet after the sinking of the El Faro in 2015. Findings indicate that other vessels in the fleet are also in substandard condition, with some being almost three times older than the average fleet. In February 2019, the crew of the 46-year-old Jones Act containership Matsonia found a crack in the hull, highlighting the maintenance challenges of older ships. Jones Act containership Matsonia discovered a crack in the hull while investigating an oil sheen in Oakland harbor. The Jones Act fleet has become younger due to shipbuilding efforts following the increase in shale oil production and before the lifting of the oil export ban. Compliance with stricter emissions regulations in the North American emission control area necessitated the construction of new ships. Currently, 35 out of 100 oceangoing Jones Act vessels are 21 years old or older, down from 64 ships in 2007. The Great Lakes fleet, however, consists of considerably older vessels. The Great Lakes fleet is older than the oceangoing fleet, with 33 dry bulk ships and large barges carrying iron ore, limestone, and coal. The largest U.S. freighters on the Great Lakes were built between 1972 and 1981, while the second-largest class of ships, around 700 feet in length, is even older, with some originally built in the 1940s or 1950s. Freshwater ships like those on the Great Lakes can have longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels. The Great Lakes fleet is older than oceangoing vessels, with narrower ships due to Soo Locks dimensions. Domestic tonnage has decreased since the 1950s. Canada's fleet, similar in age to the Jones Act fleet, stopped adding new ships due to a 25% import tariff. The tariff was repealed in 2010. Since 2010, over 35 new dry bulk ships have been built for the Great Lakes, but no new ships were added to the Canadian fleet. Thousands of tugs and barges transport dry and liquid bulk commodities on inland rivers, with tonnage dominated by corn, soybeans, and coal. Overall tonnage on the system has been flat or slightly declining since 1990. Since 1990, overall tonnage on the system has been flat or declining slightly. One of the leading barge manufacturers ceased operation in April 2018 due to decreased demand for coal deliveries by barge. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. Congress amended the Jones Act in 1988 to include any valueless material as \"merchandise\" transported domestically by vessel. The Jones Act amendment in 1988 required dredge spoil to be transported in Jones Act-qualified vessels, increasing dredging costs. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a larger volume of material dredged from U.S. harbors due to limited dredging vessels, rising costs of fuel, steel, labor, and stricter environmental regulations. The cost of fuel, steel, and labor, along with stricter environmental regulations, are factors contributing to cost increases in dredging. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading European firms, with European hopper dredges having three to four times the capacity of the entire U.S. hopper fleet. The U.S. fleet is older compared to the European fleet. When the Army Corps bids harbor work, one U.S. firm is often the sole bidder. Insufficient dredges can cause delays in dredging projects. Mobilization and demobilization costs can be significant in the U.S. market. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels to transport their dredge fleets. The offshore supply vessel fleet in the Gulf of Mexico consists of about 1,800 vessels, with annual construction averaging 32 vessels over the last decade. Foreign-built vessels are used for construction in deeper waters due to the lack of similar vessels in the Jones Act fleet. These vessels require dynamic positioning propulsion systems to work in deep waters. The Jones Act fleet lacks vessels for installing wind towers in deep waters, posing challenges for commercial aspirations and national security. Congress has designated other fleets for sealift support since 1920, but the shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises concerns about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. The Jones Act mariner pool's ability to crew a reserve sealift fleet is in doubt. Congress directed the development of a national sealift strategy in 2014, which has yet to be issued. Jones Act oceangoing ship crews could support military sealift, with mariners typically having six months of shore leave per year. The Ready Reserve Force (RRF) consists of government-owned cargo ships kept on standby for military sealift purposes. The Jones Act crew of oceangoing ships, part of the Ready Reserve Force (RRF), consists of about 3,380 merchant mariners, which is 29% of the total mariner pool needed for the government-owned reserve fleet. The remaining mariners would come from the U.S.-flag privately owned international fleet and the Military Sealift Command fleet. MARAD estimates there is a sufficient commercial mariner pool to crew the reserve fleet. MARAD estimates that there is a sufficient commercial mariner pool to crew the reserve sealift fleet during a surge lasting up to 180 days. However, a more prolonged sealift effort would start to entail crew rotations, leading to a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners. This shortage has been a consistent issue for decades, even when the mariner pool was larger in the past. For example, in 2004, the Department of Defense Transportation Command found a similar shortfall when the mariner pool was 16,900 and the RRF consisted of 59 ships. The RRF, established in 1954, currently has 46 ships. In 1991, the mariner pool was 25,000, but now it is 16,900. The Jones Act aims for a commercial fleet that can provide sealift during wartime. Other fleets like the RRF, MSC, and MSP have been created for military sealift, mostly using foreign-built ships. The RRF, established in 1954, consists of 46 ships on standby with a skeleton crew of 600 mariners, requiring an additional 1,200 mariners once activated. MSC fleet, controlled by TRANSCOM, has about 50 ships carrying military cargoes, mostly crewed by civilian mariners. MSP ships, established in 1996, receive a $5 million operating subsidy per vessel per year. The U.S. maritime industry receives an operating subsidy of about $5 million per vessel per year for American crews and government cargoes. Jones Act operators must use more costly U.S.-built ships, while the military sealift fleet uses foreign-built ships. MARAD advocates for the industry, and the military is to prioritize MSP ships over MSC ships. The sealift fleet could be required to be built domestically, sharing the higher cost nationally. This would increase the mariner pool for sealift support and benefit U.S. shipyards. Sealift ships could be designed to military specifications, enhancing their effectiveness. The military seeks cargo ships with flexible capabilities, including ramps or onboard cranes for unloading cargo at underdeveloped ports. The majority of the military sealift fleet consists of product tankers, Ro/Ro ships, and container ships for carrying various cargo types. This preference for versatility conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialization. The military's preference for versatile cargo ships with ramps or onboard cranes conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger ships driven by cost efficiency. General cargo and break-bulk ships with onboard cranes have been replaced by container ships without cranes, leading to potential challenges for commercial mariners in foreign ports. The largest container ships require deeper water than many ports can provide. The trend towards specialized and larger ships in the commercial fleet conflicts with the military's preference for versatile cargo ships with ramps or onboard cranes. Commercial carriers are installing engines to minimize fuel costs, which limits the speed capabilities needed for military sealift ships. Stringent sulfur emission regulations have led to the adoption of LNG-fueled engines or scrubbers, impacting cargo space and military utility. Engine crew licensing is specific to engine types. The Jones Act contributes to military sealift by preserving a shipyard industrial base with the knowledge and skills to build and repair ships. U.S. shipyards build only a few oceangoing ships per year, impacting the military's ideal vessel designs and crew skill sets. The Jones Act helps maintain a shipyard industrial base in the U.S. that builds a limited number of oceangoing ships per year, impacting vessel designs and crew skills. Shipyards face gaps in orders for container ships, with one yard reporting low employment and no vessels under construction. Smaller vessels like tour boats, ferries, and barges are also built, with around 1,000 barges constructed annually. The government-owned sealift fleet, averaging 44 years old, lacks sufficient large dry docks for repairs, delaying readiness to sail. Some reserve fleet ships have failed safety inspections due to rusted hulls, making them unseaworthy. The Navy's plan to recapitalize the reserve fleet includes building new vessels in domestic shipyards, repairing ships in the current fleet to extend their service life, and purchasing used, foreign-built ships. Repairing the vessels has been more expensive and time-consuming than projected, leading to consideration of accelerating the purchase of foreign-built ships. The Jones Act and Tariff Act of 1930 aim to support U.S. shipyards by imposing duties on repairs done on U.S. flag ships in foreign yards. Despite the added costs, many U.S.-flag international trading ships opt for repairs abroad due to lower overall expenses compared to domestic shipyards, as confirmed by a U.S.-flag operator in 2018."
