    "content": "Antitrust doctrine focuses on promoting competition to protect consumers, with no set rules on acceptable competition levels or limits on market growth. While there are laws against monopolization and unfair acts in commerce, the emphasis is on maintaining marketplace competitiveness. In the context of antitrust law, \"monopoly\" and \"monopolist\" are descriptive terms for a single entity controlling a market. The absence of \"guilty behavior\" by a monopolist means there can be no finding of \"monopolization.\" The Rule of Reason in antitrust law balances anticompetitive actions with procompetitive effects. In antitrust law, determining if a monopolist has unlawfully monopolized a market involves assessing if the entity is a monopolist and if it has unlawfully controlled the relevant market. This assessment considers both product- and geographically-based markets. The legal obligation of a monopoly entity to deal with competitors is not clearly defined, especially in cases of monopolist ownership of an \"essential facility.\" The Supreme Court has not recognized a doctrine regarding this obligation. Recent antitrust prosecutions of Microsoft and Intel by the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission highlight the ongoing debate. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission's cases against Microsoft and Intel illustrate the difference between monopoly and monopolization in antitrust law. Monopoly is defined as the power to control prices or exclude competition, with the focus on consumer benefits from competitive markets. The impact on excluded competitors is only relevant in terms of its effect on competition. The antitrust injury requirement obligates complainants to show that the challenged conduct has had an actual adverse effect on competition in the relevant market. The antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors, and there is no concept of \"no fault\" monopolization in US antitrust law. Courts have differed over the years on the market share required for monopolization since the Sherman Act was passed in 1890. The Sherman Act of 1890 does not automatically equate monopoly power to monopolization without evidence of guilty behavior. The concept that monopoly size does not necessarily mean unlawful monopolization was emphasized by the Assistant Attorney General in 1998. In 1998, the Assistant Attorney General clarified that antitrust analysis focuses on specific competitive harms of a merger, not just its size. The key factor in reviewing mergers is whether they will harm consumers, not just the sheer size of the companies involved. The focus of antitrust analysis is on specific competitive harms of a merger, not just the size of the companies involved. The Sherman and Clayton Acts prohibit monopolization and mergers that may lessen competition or create a monopoly. The Rule of Reason doctrine, established in 1911, allows for flexibility in antitrust laws regarding monopolization. It considers the balance between anticompetitive actions and potential procompetitive effects. The outcome of being charged with attempted monopolization or actively monopolizing a market hinges on how the market is defined. A defendant would prefer a broad definition of the product and geographic market to potentially lower their proportion of the market. The broader the geographic market definition, the less likely the alleged monopolist will be found guilty. The determination of whether a defendant is a monopolist or engaged in attempted monopolization depends on how the market is defined. A broad geographic market definition makes it less likely for the alleged monopolist to be found guilty. Trademarked or patented products giving lawful monopoly may not automatically classify the owner as a monopolist in a specific market. The courts use a subjective \"test\" rather than a specific market share threshold for determining monopolization. The Supreme Court has discussed the significance of market share in determining monopoly status. A 90% share could constitute a monopoly, while 60-64% might not be enough, and 33% definitely is not sufficient. Market share calculation is crucial in assessing monopoly status. In order to be found guilty of \"monopolization\" or \"attempted monopolization,\" one must first be determined to be a \"monopolist\" by possessing the power to control prices or exclude competition. Simply having monopoly power is not enough to support a monopolization charge; there must also be evidence of willful acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power. Courts evaluate business conduct to distinguish between lawful and unlawful monopolist behavior, considering factors like legitimate business purpose and predatory actions. The antitrust laws aim to protect competition, not individual competitors. The viability of individual competitors is relevant to marketplace competitiveness. Allegations of monopolization require proof of predatory conduct and intent to achieve monopoly status. Determining the relevant market is crucial. The Spectrum Sports Court emphasized the importance of determining the relevant market in assessing monopolization. Courts consider the defendant's ability to impact competition in that market. The Supreme Court's 1919 ruling in United States v. Colgate & Co. states that a monopolist can choose who to deal with unless it engages in anti-competitive behavior. The Sherman Act does not restrict a trader or manufacturer's right to choose who they will deal with, as long as there is no intent to create or maintain a monopoly. This principle remains unchanged even when patent or copyright laws are involved, according to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The antitrust legality of a situation involving a genuine monopolist's actions affecting competition in an adjacent market depends on the monopolist's position vis-a-vis competitors. Whether the monopolist must deal advantageously with entities in an adjacent market also hinges on whether their actions aim to extend a lawful monopoly, possibly granted through patents or copyrights. In cases like Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc. and In re Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation, courts analyzed monopolists' actions in adjacent markets. The legality depends on extending a lawful monopoly through means other than original market position. In Image Technical Services, the ISOs alleged Kodak tied the sale of repair parts to service, violating antitrust laws by extending its monopoly. The Supreme Court ruled lower courts must determine if Kodak's actions were anticompetitive. In Image Technical Services, the court determined Kodak's monopoly power in the market for photocopier parts allowed it to unlawfully tie service agreements to the purchase of repair parts. A jury confirmed this misuse of power, leading to an affirmed injunction. The appeals court affirmed the injunction in the Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation, upholding the grant of summary judgment to Xerox. The court emphasized that antitrust laws do not negate a patent holder's right to exclude others from patent property. The court affirmed the injunction in the Independent Service Organizations Antitrust Litigation, stating that antitrust laws do not override a patent holder's right to exclude others from patent property. Kodak's approach to analyzing antitrust legality emphasized that a patent may confer the right to exclude competition in multiple markets, as long as there is no illegal tying, fraud, or sham litigation involved. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) faced a case involving unfair treatment of commuter airlines by The Official Airline Guides publisher, leading to a court rebuke for ruling against the publisher under Section 5 of the FTC Act. The Commission found no intent to create a monopoly in this case. The FTC did not find any purpose to create or maintain a monopoly in the case involving The Official Airline Guides publisher. The Commission acknowledged that its decision may contradict the Colgate doctrine but expressed concerns about giving the FTC too much power to interfere with a monopolist's business judgment. The FTC can require a monopolist to deal with non-competitor entities for competitive reasons, as seen in the Official Airline Guides case. The Colgate doctrine still holds relevance in assessing a monopolist's duty to deal advantageously with others in adjacent markets. This concept has been present since the Sherman Act was enacted in 1890. Since the Sherman Act in 1890, the \"essential facilities\" doctrine has developed in antitrust law. Courts have consistently ruled that a monopolist must provide access to crucial facilities that cannot be easily duplicated by competitors. An example is the United States v. Terminal Railroad Association case, where access to a vital terminal in St. Louis was required for potential competitors. The concept of an \"essential facility\" requires monopolists to provide access to crucial facilities that cannot be easily duplicated by competitors. This was exemplified in cases such as United States v. Terminal Railroad Association and MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T, where access to essential facilities was mandated to allow competition in various industries. The essential facilities doctrine requires firms controlling crucial facilities to provide access on nondiscriminatory terms. Curtis Trinko challenged Verizon for not adequately sharing its network facilities, which could extend monopoly power from one market to another. Verizon faced a lawsuit for violating antitrust laws by not sharing its network facilities as required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, hindering competition from other carriers. The Court rejected Trinko's arguments regarding Verizon's exclusionary behavior towards competitors, emphasizing the regulatory scheme of the Telecommunications Act and the limitations of antitrust immunity. The Court analyzed the established antitrust standards of monopoly status, monopolization, and attempted monopolization, citing the \"Colgate doctrine\" on a businessman's right to choose who to deal with. It distinguished previous cases using the \"essential facilities\" doctrine, noting Aspen was not applicable to Trinko's case. The Supreme Court distinguished previous cases like Aspen and Terminal Railroad in the Trinko case, emphasizing that Verizon had violated a duty imposed by the act but not any antitrust laws. The 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines highlight the importance of the \"monopoly\"/\"monopolization\" enforcement dichotomy. The Merger Guidelines emphasize the \"monopoly\"/\"monopolization\" dichotomy in antitrust enforcement. They inform the business community of the agencies' philosophy and framework for reviewing proposed mergers, stating that mergers should not enhance market power. Harmful mergers will be challenged, but there is a larger universe of mergers that may be permissible. While \"competitively harmful\" mergers will face challenges, the focus is on competitive harm rather than size in merger decisions. Recent cases involving Microsoft and Intel illustrate the distinction between monopoly power and active monopolization in antitrust enforcement. The Department of Justice's suit against Microsoft highlighted the company's monopoly power in the market for personal computer operating systems. The DOJ filed a suit against Microsoft for engaging in anticompetitive activities to protect its Windows monopoly and extend it into other software markets. This included tying other Microsoft software products to Windows and exclusionary agreements with competitors. The FTC charged Intel Corporation for engaging in exclusionary agreements to restrict competitors from providing services or resources. The Commission acted to restrain Intel's conduct violating the Federal Trade Commission Act, not because of its monopoly status. Intel, as a monopolist, can compete by producing better products but cannot illegally prevent other firms from challenging its dominance. Intel has used its monopoly power to impede innovation and stifle competition by denying necessary technical information to certain customers. Judicial determination of \"monopoly\" status does not automatically create an obligation for the monopolist to deal with competitors. A monopolist's obligation to deal with other entities or consumers is not automatically created by its monopoly status. This obligation may only arise if the monopolist has unlawfully obtained or exploited its monopoly position, violating antitrust laws. The duty to deal with competitors of a lawful monopolist is governed by the Colgate doctrine, allowing market participants to choose their commercial relationships. The \"essential facilities\" doctrine states that a monopolist must provide necessary components to competitors if they cannot reasonably obtain them. In Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Trinko, the Supreme Court questioned the validity of the \"essential facilities\" doctrine in antitrust law, particularly in the context of regulated entities. The Court stated that a regulated entity's violation of a regulatory statute requiring the sharing of specific facilities does not automatically constitute an antitrust violation without evidence of a violation of antitrust laws."
