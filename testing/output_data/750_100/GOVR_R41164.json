    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grant and loan programs, split between the NTIA/DOC and RUS/USDA. NTIA received $4.35 billion for a competitive broadband grant program, including infrastructure grants, public computer capacity expansion, and grants for broadband service adoption. The NTIA grant program, Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP), allocated $2.5 billion to RUS/USDA for broadband grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations. The law requires 75% of the area served by eligible projects to be rural, defined as areas not within cities or towns with populations over 20,000 or urbanized areas adjacent to cities with populations over 50,000. RUS's broadband grant and loan program, Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP), was established. The Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP) allocated $2.5 billion to RUS/USDA for broadband grants. P.L. 111-226 rescinded $302 million of unobligated BTOP money. Two rounds of ARRA broadband funding were announced in 2009 and 2010. All ARRA broadband funds were awarded by October 1, 2010. This report focuses on the distribution of ARRA broadband funding. The first funding round for the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP) was announced on July 1, 2009, with grants and loans falling into different project categories such as last mile and middle mile. Up to $1.2 billion in grants were available for infrastructure projects consisting of last mile and middle mile. The Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP) offers funding for infrastructure projects like last mile and middle mile. Grants are available for public computer centers and sustainable broadband adoption. BIP projects include last mile remote area, last mile nonremote area, and middle mile. Grants and loans are available for these projects. The Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP) offers funding for infrastructure projects like last mile and middle mile, with grants available for public computer centers and sustainable broadband adoption. On September 9, 2009, NTIA and RUS released data on applications received during the first round application period, with over 2,200 applications requesting nearly $28 billion in funding. The total amount of federal funding requested was seven times the amount available in the first funding round. In January 2010, NTIA and RUS announced the final round of ARRA broadband funding, totaling $4.8 billion. Changes were made based on feedback from the first round, with separate NOFAs for BTOP and BIP. Applicants could apply to either program, not both. NTIA/BTOP focused on... BTOP and BIP were two options for ARRA broadband funding. NTIA/BTOP focused on middle mile projects, while RUS/BIP focused on last mile projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants for middle mile projects. BIP removed the \"Remote Last Mile\" category and offered a standard grant/loan combination for all projects. Eligible projects had to cover \"unserved\" areas. In the second round of BIP projects, the requirement for eligible infrastructure projects to cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas was eliminated. Projects had to cover at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service at 5 Mbps in 50% of the area. BTOP projects required an eligible entity, completed application, and a 20% nonfederal match. Factors like unserved areas, remoteness, and speed were considered during evaluation. BIP introduced three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and. In the second round of BIP projects, the requirement for eligible infrastructure projects to cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas was eliminated. Projects had to cover at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service at 5 Mbps in 50% of the area. BIP added three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. NTIA received 867 applications for second round funding, totaling $11 billion in requested federal funding. RUS received 776 applications requesting nearly $11.2 billion in federal funding. In the second round, RUS received 776 applications requesting $11.2 billion in federal funds, including 30 middle mile applications totaling $845.88 million. NTIA and RUS combined received 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion, which is 26% fewer applications and 21% less funding than the first round. RUS also received 27 Satellite Projects, 51 Technical Assistance, and 2 Rural Library Broadband applications. As of October 1, 2010, all BTOP and BIP award announcements were completed, totaling $7.5 billion in federal funding for 553 projects. This included 233 BTOP projects ($3.9 billion) and 320 BIP projects ($3.6 billion), with $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. Awards data breakdown includes project categories, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution of funding. Table 2 and Table 3 breakdown awards data by project category and program. 51% of broadband infrastructure funding went to middle mile projects, while 49% went to last mile projects. Last mile projects received 93% of loan funding. Deployment of broadband infrastructure is a key focus. Deployment of broadband infrastructure includes various technologies such as fiber, wireless, cable modem, DSL, and satellite. 56% of funded projects are fiber-based, with fiber projects accounting for about two-thirds of all infrastructure projects. Last mile project technologies consist of 47% fiber, 23% DSL, 17% wireless, 6% multiple, 3% cable modem, and 1% satellite. The funding for broadband infrastructure projects includes various technologies such as fiber, wireless, cable modem, DSL, and satellite. 56% of projects are fiber-based, with last mile projects utilizing fiber, DSL, wireless, multiple technologies, cable modem, and satellite. State-by-state breakdown of funding is shown in tables, with projects needing to be completed within two years. In FY2011, the Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office. The Continuing Appropriations Act added $20 million for BTOP oversight. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure BTOP grants' impact on broadband availability and adoption. The 112th Congress will oversee NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor broadband projects funded by the Department of Interior's National Business Center. The FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Congress may consider the future of broadband grant and loan programs based on funding patterns, trends, and the success of BTOP and BIP projects. The 112th Congress will oversee NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor broadband projects funded by the Department of Interior's National Business Center. Evaluating the successes and failures of funded BTOP and BIP projects could provide insights for future broadband grant and loan programs within a national broadband policy framework."
