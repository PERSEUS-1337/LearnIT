    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pre-K for USA Act.\" It includes findings related to the Act. The United States ranks 25th in early learning enrollment, with studies showing that access to high-quality prekindergarten programs leads to academic success and cost savings. Prekindergarten attendance linked to lower drug problems, felonies, and arrests, higher GPAs, college attendance. 40% of districts lack pre-K, over half offer only part-day programs. Texas missed out on $118.48 million in Federal funding for pre-K expansion. Reports indicated that in 2011, the Texas legislature cut $5.4 billion in education funding, including $200 million in grants for expanding prekindergarten programs. In response, some local governments funded full-day prekindergarten programs, prompting a need for direct federal funding for prekindergarten programs in certain localities. SEC. 3. PREKINDERGARTEN DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will award competitive grants to increase capacity for high-quality prekindergarten programs. Grants will be awarded for up to 3 years and applications can be submitted by Governors, chief executive officers of States, local educational agencies, or other local government entities. To receive a grant under this Act, a government entity must submit an application to the Secretary of Education. States must consult with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care when developing their grant applications. Eligibility for a grant under this Act requires a matching requirement from the State, local educational agency, or other local entity. To receive a grant under this Act, a State or local government entity must provide non-Federal matching funds equal to at least 20% of the grant amount. This can be done through State funding, local funding, private contributions, or in-kind contributions. The Secretary may waive or reduce matching funds required for a grant application if extreme financial hardship is demonstrated. (e) Subgrants may be awarded to eligible local entities by a State, local educational agency, or other local government entity that received a grant under this subtitle to carry out grant activities. Subgrantees must comply with the requirements of this Act. Double-dipping prevention measures prohibit the Secretary from awarding a subgrant to a local educational agency or local government entity for a program in a fiscal year if the State has already provided funding for it.
