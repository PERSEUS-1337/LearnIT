    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, falling from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000. The majority of job losses occurred after November 2008, with a small uptick in employment in November 2009. Despite this, the number of jobs on employer payrolls fell the following month. Private and public employers have since increased aggregate employment, with the number of jobs rising to 130,470,000 in July 2010. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been the most affected by job losses during the economic downturn. The construction industry saw job losses before the recession began in December 2007. Employment in the service-providing sector peaked in December 2007, with some industries like education and health services adding workers. However, job losses in other service industries outweighed these gains. The financial activities industry also began losing jobs before the economic downturn, reflecting the trend in construction due to the housing market collapse. The financial activities industry, like construction, has been impacted by the housing market collapse. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, job growth may not immediately rebound. In past recessions, sustained job growth took three to five months to occur. In past recessions, sustained job growth typically occurred within three to five months. However, after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, job growth was delayed by 12 and 22 months respectively. Congress has often directed funds to infrastructure projects to create jobs in response to recessions. Other methods, such as public service employment and employment tax credits, have been used less frequently. Public works historically involved heavy and civil construction activities like road and bridge building. Today, it also includes green economic activities and green jobs, which utilize renewable resources and produce energy-efficient goods. Despite numerous studies, a consistent definition of green jobs is lacking. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, with a focus on job creation estimates and models used to calculate the number of jobs nationwide and by state dependent on demand in the construction industry and other industries. The discussion focuses on estimating the number of jobs created by green economic activities and the caution needed when using these estimates. Interest in job creation arises during economic downturns and when policymakers compare stimulus options or shift expenditures between federal budget categories. An input-output (I-O) model is often used to estimate the number of jobs created by economic activities. It shows the interrelationships between industries and how the dollar value of a sale is distributed across industries. This model reflects the amount of the purchased product that comes from final and supplier industries. An input-output (I-O) model is used to estimate job creation by economic activities, showing industry interrelationships and distribution of sales value. It reflects the amount of product coming from final and supplier industries, converting output requirements to employment needs based on industry productivity estimates. Total employment for a specific demand is linked to the industry producing the final product. Employment requirements tables show the number of jobs supported by economic activity, expressed as jobs per billion dollars spent. It is similar to an I-O table, displaying the direct employment in various industries for each billion dollars spent. The construction industry supports employment in various sectors through direct and indirect spending. An employment requirements table helps estimate the impact of expenditures on different industries. Input-Output models freeze technology and productivity, affecting the job-generating potential of economic activities. The job-generating potential of economic activities can vary over time due to technological advancements and changes in productivity. Estimates of job creation are often based on expenditures, but the purchasing power of money can fluctuate with changing price levels. Input-Output models may overestimate job creation as they assume unlimited resources and do not account for factors like plant capacity. The job-generating potential of economic activities can vary over time due to technological advancements and changes in productivity. Estimates of job creation based on expenditures may fall short due to capital and labor constraints. Input-Output models may overstate domestic employment impact if inputs are imported and do not differentiate between full-time and part-time jobs. Estimates of job creation based on economic activities may vary depending on the industries involved. A comprehensive estimate includes direct, indirect, and induced jobs. Direct jobs are those directly related to the activity, while indirect jobs are those supported by the activity. Induced jobs result from the economic activity's impact on overall consumer spending. The multiplier effect of job creation from economic activities depends on how much additional money earned by workers is spent versus saved, with estimates varying widely. This added spending can create indirect and induced jobs, influenced by economic conditions like labor availability and inflation rates. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides estimates on the employment impact of federal spending on roads, with varying multipliers used in job creation studies. The FHWA's 1997 analysis estimated that $1 billion in federal-aid highway expenditures supported 47,575 jobs, with a recent update in 2007 indicating that $1.25 billion expenditure created jobs. The FHWA's recent update in 2007 shows that $1.25 billion in highway construction expenditure, with $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from state government, could support 34,779 jobs. If a state match is not required, then $1 billion in Federal funds supports 27,800 jobs. The number of jobs has decreased over time due to increases in input prices like asphalt and diesel fuel. The estimate breaks down to 9,536 construction-oriented jobs per billion dollars of federal spending on highways. The FHWA's recent update in 2007 shows that $1.25 billion in highway construction expenditure could support 34,779 jobs, with $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from state government. This includes 9,536 construction-oriented jobs per billion dollars of federal spending on highways, with jobs in supporting industries and induced jobs also contributing to the total estimate. The FHWA's recent update in 2007 shows that $1.25 billion in highway construction expenditure could support 34,779 jobs. The job estimate utilizes the national average mix of construction materials and labor inputs, but specific projects and local utilization ratios can alter the estimated number of jobs supported. Different projects like road resurfacing, bridge building, or commuter rail projects may require varying combinations of materials and workers. Employment figures have been used to justify including highway spending in economic stimulus packages, although highway funds typically spend out slowly, with only 27% of a project completed on average. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment requirements tables for assessing the impact of policies. These tables are based on official I-O tables developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis every five years. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the latest national I-O table from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, updated to reflect 2006 technologies and labor productivity, to create an employment requirements table for the construction industry. The construction industry is divided into three main subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. Around 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion spending in construction. The construction industry relies on $1 billion in spending, creating 6,925 direct jobs. The discrepancy in job figures between BLS and FHWA may be due to various factors like industry definition and data sources. BLS data does not account for other construction types like public school construction. The BEA produces estimates of employment, earnings, and output dependent on additional spending in various industries. The survey information on construction activities was last updated a few decades ago. The BEA provides estimates of employment, earnings, and output based on additional spending in different industries. The number of jobs supported by $1 billion in the construction industry varies by state due to differences in industry mix and earnings. Estimating jobs dependent on green infrastructure activities is challenging due to the lack of separate identification in the NAICS system for green industries. The system currently disaggregates the electric utility industry into different sources of energy production. The NAICS system lacks separate identification for green industries, making it challenging to estimate jobs dependent on green infrastructure activities. Renewable sources like wind, solar, and biomass are grouped under the \"other\" category, which complicates job estimation for activities like wind energy production and biofuel production. Retrofitting in the construction industry also lacks a unique category, hindering accurate job estimation for activities like installing energy-efficient systems. Retrofitting in the construction industry requires a different mix of inputs compared to building from scratch, posing challenges for accurate job estimation in green job creation analyses. One study commissioned by the Center for American Progress addresses this issue by explaining that conventional input-output tables do not recognize renewable sources like wind, solar, and biomass, making it difficult to estimate jobs in these sectors. The researchers addressed the challenge of estimating green jobs by creating synthetic industries like biomass, combining various sectors to account for renewable sources not recognized in conventional input-output tables. Studies on green job projections often present estimates based on different sets of data. Studies often develop employment projections based on differing sets of assumptions and time horizons, such as the shift from coal to wind and geothermal power generation. Some reports may include induced employment, but this is not always clear. Results from analyses related to a particular state may not be generalizeable to other areas due to different industry mixes and inputs availability. Many green economy studies lack clear articulation of assumptions and methodologies for job creation estimates, making review difficult. Some studies were not originally intended to quickly stabilize or increase jobs during a recession. Job creation estimates from organizations proposing green economy strategies to stimulate the labor market are briefly described. The September 2008 report, Green Recovery: A Program to Create Jobs and Start Building a Low-Carbon Economy, commissioned by the Center for American Progress, outlines strategies to stimulate the labor market. The report estimates that almost 2 million jobs could be created through a 10-year program. A two-year $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" could create or preserve over 1.5 million jobs. Federal spending of $46 billion would go towards public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and smart electrical grid development, with the rest in the form of tax credits for building retrofits. Some green activities can deliver results within a year, while others may take longer. The Apollo Alliance proposed The Apollo Economic Recovery Act in December 2008 as part of a 10-year $500 billion program to create 5 million green-collar jobs. The initiative aims to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs through federal spending of about $50 billion. Job creation figures are based on estimated spending-to-jobs relationships. The proposed allocation of federal funds includes $10 billion for improving the electric transmission grid (131,000 jobs), $8 billion for road and bridge repairs (278,000 jobs), and $8 billion for replacing aging buses and trains with clean-energy vehicles (37,600 direct jobs in manufacturing and 167,000 indirect jobs). Congress was concerned about tracking job creation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The 111th Congress addressed timely tracking of job creation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by requiring entities receiving ARRA appropriations to report estimates of direct jobs created and retained by infrastructure projects. Recipients of recovery funds had to submit required information in October 2009. Federal agencies must post reports on websites 30 days after each quarter. The Office of Management and Budget provided guidance for preparing reports, including job estimates. The Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office were tasked with reviewing job estimates within 45 days. Based on self-reporting, 633,342 jobs were saved from ARRA appropriations. Based on self-reporting, 633,342 jobs were saved through ARRA appropriations. OMB revised its guidance on jobs saved to remove the need for subjective judgment by recipients. The updated guidance defines jobs created or retained as those funded by the Recovery Act. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded in Q4 2009 and 682,370 in Q1 2010. The Council of Economic Advisers submits quarterly reports on ARRA's impact on employment and economic indicators. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) issues quarterly reports on the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) on employment and economic indicators. The first report in September 2009 estimated that ARRA may have added around one million jobs to employer payrolls in August 2009. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) was tasked with assessing the number of jobs created or saved by direct government investments under ARRA. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increased employment by 600,000 to 1.6 million through tax cuts and outlay increases by September 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increased employment by 1.0-2.1 million jobs through December 2009, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) may have raised employment by 2.2-2.8 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2010, according to reports by the CEA and CBO. The CEA's fourth quarterly report estimated that ARRA could have increased employment by 2.5-3.6 million in the second quarter of 2010. The CEA estimated that public investment outlays under ARRA could have increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 and by over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter of the year."
