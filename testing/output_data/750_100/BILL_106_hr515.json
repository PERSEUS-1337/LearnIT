    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act\". The Congress finds that in the 10 years from 1987 through 1996, nearly 2,200 children in the United States aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings. The United States leads in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related death. The United States has a significantly higher rate of unintentional firearms-related deaths for children under 15 compared to other industrialized countries. Additionally, a large number of children are treated for nonfatal unintentional gunshot wounds in US hospital emergency rooms annually. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that unintentional gunshot wounds involving children in California often involve handguns. Another study in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine discovered that children as young as 3 years old have the finger strength to fire most commercially available handguns. Firearms in the United States lack minimum safety standards, despite public support for regulation. Components and safety locks for guns are involved in interstate commerce. Many trigger locks and similar devices currently available are inadequate in preventing accidental firearm discharge or children from accessing the firearms. Regulation of handgun discharge protection products. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of injury to children. Minimum safety standards will be set for these products to ensure they meet necessary requirements. The Secretary will establish standards for handgun discharge protection products to prevent children from operating a handgun. Products must be permanently installed and require a key or combination for removal. The Secretary will establish standards for handgun discharge protection products to prevent children from operating a handgun. The standard required by subsection (b) shall consider using test protocols related to poison prevention packaging standards. The Secretary must issue the final standard within 12 months of the enactment of this Act, and it will take effect 6 months after issuance. SEC. 4. ORDERS; INSPECTIONS. The Secretary has the authority to issue orders prohibiting the manufacture, sale, transfer, or delivery of a handgun discharge protection product that violates the Act. They can also require the recall, repair, replacement, or refunds for products found in violation. The Secretary can issue orders to prohibit the sale of products violating the Act and require notice of risks, conformity with regulations, and product repairs. The Secretary can take various actions to enforce compliance with the Act, including repairing, replacing, refunding, recalling, or submitting a plan for implementation. Additionally, inspections are conducted to ensure adherence to the Act and its regulations. The Secretary has the authority to enter places where handgun discharge protection products are manufactured, stored, or transported for inspection purposes under the Act. SEC. 5. UNLAWFUL ACTS. Beginning 30 days after a final standard is issued, it is unlawful for licensed manufacturers or importers to sell handguns without a discharge protection product, and for licensed dealers to sell handguns without the protection product supplied by the manufacturer or importer. An exception is made for sales to departments or agencies. The curr_chunk can be summarized as: \"Transfer of a handgun to a government department or agency.\" SEC. 6. WARNING LABELS FOR HANDGUNS. Inclusion of Warning Labels In Handgun Packaging requires a label with a specific statement to be displayed on the packaging and materials. Children are attracted to handguns and can operate them, leading to severe injuries or death. Always keep handguns locked away and unloaded to prevent child access. The warning label on handgun packaging must stand out from other printed materials, similar to regulations in effect as of January 1, 1998. Handguns cannot be sold without accompanying packaging or descriptive materials. The warning label on handgun packaging must stand out and be affixed by a method prescribed by the Secretary. This section will take effect 60 days after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\nLicensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers must report any information supporting the conclusion that a child suffered a gunshot wound from a handgun they sold, resulting in death or serious injury.\n\nSEC. 8. ENFORCEMENT. The Secretary can impose civil penalties up to $10,000 for violations of the Act and revoke federal firearms licenses for violations.

This remedy is in addition to other legal remedies available under common law or Federal/State law. Private individuals can bring legal action in any United States district court to enforce this Act, restrain violations, and seek attorney's fees. Compliance with this Act does not exempt anyone from liability under common law or State statutory law. The Secretary's failure to take action authorized under this Act is not admissible in litigation. Criminal penalties may be imposed on individuals who knowingly violate provisions of this Act regarding handgun discharge protection products. Individuals who violate provisions of this Act regarding handgun discharge protection products may face fines, imprisonment up to 2 years, or both under title 18, United States Code. SEC. 9. NO EFFECT ON STATE LAW. This Act does not override State laws unless they conflict with it.
