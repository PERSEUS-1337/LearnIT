Congress finds that two-thirds of mothers with children under 6 years old are in the workforce, over 10 percent of children under 6 have a disability, and children in low-income communities have a higher incidence of disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities in a natural environment, and special education preschool services must be provided. The General Accounting Office reports limited availability of infant care, special needs care, and care during nonstandard hours, especially in low-income communities. Children with disabilities face barriers in accessing child care programs due to myths, stereotypes, and staff lacking knowledge about disabilities. The purpose of this Act is to increase quality child care for children with disabilities by addressing barriers such as stereotypes and lack of staff training. SEC. 3 amends Section 658E(c) to include families with children with disabilities. SEC. 4 focuses on activities to improve the quality of child care. Section 658G (42 U.S.C. 9858e) is amended to include activities for children with disabilities, requiring states to allocate at least 5 percent of funds for this purpose. The amendment to Section 658G requires states to allocate a minimum of 5 percent of funds for activities that increase quality child care for children with disabilities, including training and technical assistance for child care providers and state licensing agencies. State licensing agencies guide child care providers and parents on collaborating to implement the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, providing technical assistance for including children with disabilities in child care settings. Training for child care directors and staff on using assistive technology for children with special needs and disabilities, as well as leadership skills development for inclusive child care programs. Assistance provided for State and local child care resource and referral agencies to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Grants for recruitment and retention of qualified staff through scholarships for child care. Grants are provided for scholarships to child care staff working with children with and without disabilities to pursue degrees or training in child development, increase salaries for staff with relevant degrees, and retain qualified child care providers. The Secretary provides grants and low-interest loans to public agencies and nonprofit organizations for projects that increase the availability of inclusive child care programs, child care for infants, and child care during evenings and weekends. SEC. 5. REPORTS. Amended to include disability status. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term 'child with a disability' is defined in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. An 'inclusive child care program' is a program that serves children with and without disabilities. An 'inclusive child care program' serves children with disabilities and children without disabilities together, with no more than 50 percent of the children enrolled being children with disabilities."
