    "content": "More than 53,000 commercial vessels travel the world's waters, regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws to prevent pollution and protect marine resources. However, there are gaps in regulations, enforcement, and geographic jurisdiction. The cruise industry, representing a small fraction of the global shipping fleet, has drawn public attention to its environmental impacts. Despite its significant economic contributions to the U.S., concerns about its environmental effects persist. The worldwide cruise industry has grown significantly since 1990, with an average annual growth rate of 7.4%. In 2010, cruises hosted 14.3 million passengers on over 230 ships, mostly foreign-flagged. Six companies own nearly 95% of passenger ships in U.S. waters, adding new, larger, and more luxurious vessels each year. The cruise ship industry has seen a significant increase in ship size over the past two decades, with ships now averaging over 1,050 feet long and weighing more than 130,000 tons. Safety and health concerns are key issues for the industry, as cruise ships are like \"floating cities\" producing large volumes of waste. The cruise ship industry generates significant amounts of waste, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water during a one-week voyage. If not properly treated and disposed of, these wastes can pose risks to human health and the environment. Environmental advocates have raised concerns about the adequacy of existing laws for managing these wastes. The 2000 GAO report highlighted weak enforcement of environmental laws in the cruise ship industry. It revealed 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag cruise ships in U.S. waters between 1993 and 1998. Most cases involved oil or oil-based product discharges, ranging from a few drops to hundreds of gallons. The 2000 GAO report found 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag cruise ships in U.S. waters between 1993 and 1998. 72% were accidental, 15% intentional, and 13% undetermined. Cruise ships accounted for 4% of all illegal discharges by foreign-flag ships during the study period. Several cases led to criminal prosecutions and large fines. In 2000, environmental groups petitioned the EPA to address pollution by cruise ships, leading to a study on cruise ship discharges and waste management. In December 2008, the EPA released a cruise ship discharge assessment report in response to the petition. The EPA released an assessment report in response to a petition regarding cruise ship pollution. The report summarized waste streams and findings from data collection activities, identified options to address ship discharges, and discussed international and domestic laws regulating cruise ship pollution. The report discusses federal and state legislative activity on cruise ships in Alaskan waters and other states. Cruise companies have implemented waste management plans to improve environmental operations, with environmental groups pushing for stronger regulations. Legislation in the 109th and 110th Congresses aimed to enforce stricter standards for controlling wastewater and other discharges from cruise ships. Similar legislation was proposed in the 111th Congress, but no action was taken. Cruise ships produce various waste streams that can harm the marine environment, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste, as well as air pollutants. Improper treatment and disposal of these wastes can pose risks to human health. Cruise ships are a source of pathogens, nutrients, and toxic substances that can harm human health and aquatic life. While they represent a small portion of the shipping industry, the large number of passengers and crew on cruise ships means that sewage, graywater, and solid waste are of greater concern. Cruise ships concentrate activities in specific coastal areas, such as Florida, California, New York, Galveston, Seattle, and Alaska, leading to significant local environmental impacts. Blackwater, sewage from toilets and medical facilities, contains harmful bacteria, viruses, and nutrients that can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. The viral contamination of fisheries and shellfish beds poses risks to public health due to sewage nutrients promoting excessive algal growth, leading to oxygen depletion and harm to aquatic life. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage and graywater containing various pollutants like bacteria, detergents, and oils. Untreated graywater from cruise ships contains pollutants like oil, grease, metals, organics, and petroleum hydrocarbons. EPA and Alaska state sampling found high levels of fecal coliform bacteria in cruise ship graywater. Cruise ships produce 67 gallons/day/person of graywater, with potential environmental impacts due to nutrient concentrations. Cruise ships generate a significant amount of solid waste, including glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics. This waste can be hazardous and if it enters the ocean, it can become marine debris, posing a threat to marine life, humans, coastal communities, and industries. Cruise ships manage solid waste through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling, but up to 75% of solid waste may still not be effectively managed. Cruise ships generate a significant amount of solid waste, including glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics. Marine life can be harmed by waste disposal at sea. Each cruise ship passenger produces two pounds of solid waste daily. Large cruise ships can generate up to 8 tons of waste in a week. Cruise ships produce a large amount of solid waste, with about 8 tons generated during a one-week cruise. 24% of the solid waste from vessels worldwide comes from cruise ships. Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board, but hazardous wastes are also produced from various on-board activities. Port reception facilities can be strained when cruise ships off-load garbage. Hazardous waste generated on cruise ships includes discarded chemicals, medical waste, batteries, fluorescent lights, and paints. These materials contain substances like hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and solvents, posing a threat to marine organisms if not managed properly. Oil leaks from engine and machinery spaces on ships mix with water in the bilge, posing threats to marine life and human health. Bilge water may also contain solid wastes, pollutants, and chemicals from engine cleaning activities. Large vessels generate significant amounts of toxic chemicals and waste streams, including oily bilge water, which can harm marine life if discharged. To maintain ship stability and safety, bilge spaces need to be regularly flushed and pumped dry. Bilge water on large vessels needs to be extracted of oil before being discharged to prevent pollution. Faulty separators or bypassing them can lead to untreated oily bilge water being released into the ocean, harming marine life. Cruise ships have faced environmental violations for this issue. Cruise ships, tankers, and cargo carriers use ballast water for stability during transport. This water is taken on in coastal waters and discharged at the next port, containing biological materials. Ballast water discharge contains various biological materials, including non-native species that can harm aquatic ecosystems and industries. Invasive species from ballast water are a significant source of economic and environmental risks in U.S. marine waters. The introduction of pest mollusks to U.S. aquatic ecosystems costs about $2.2 billion annually. Cruise ships contribute to the problem, but there is limited industry-specific data. Further research is needed to understand their role in introducing non-native species. Cruise ship air pollution comes from diesel engines burning high sulfur fuel, emitting harmful pollutants classified as human carcinogens by the EPA. EPA recognizes emissions from marine diesel engines as a likely human carcinogen, contributing to air pollution and failing to meet air quality standards. Ocean-going vessels are significant contributors to nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States. Ships also emit greenhouse gases, making them important sources of pollution. Ships are a major source of greenhouse gas pollutants, contributing to global carbon dioxide emissions. They also emit black carbon and nitrogen oxides, impacting climate change. States and localities are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of commercial marine vessels on regional air quality, both at sea and when docked in port. Cruise ships, despite being a small fraction of the world shipping fleet, can have significant local impacts on air quality in coastal areas they frequent. Shipboard incinerators burn garbage and waste, potentially releasing toxic emissions. Waste management on cruise ships is regulated by various international protocols and U.S. laws, but there is no single governing law. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards, including the MARPOL 73/78 protocol for preventing pollution from ships. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must comply with these regulations. Annex I of the MARPOL 73/78 protocol deals with regulations for preventing oil pollution from ships, while Annex II covers measures for controlling pollution by noxious liquid substances. The Convention's six Annexes provide an international framework for addressing pollution from ships, but require ratification and implementation by sovereign states to effectively protect the marine environment. Annex III contains standards for packing, marking, labeling, and notifications to prevent pollution by harmful substances. Annex IV addresses pollution of the sea by sewage. Annex V covers disposal of garbage, including plastics, and specifies distances and methods. Annex VI sets limits on emissions from marine vessels and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone-depleting substances. Compliance with these Annexes is voluntary. The ratification process for IMO standards can be lengthy, requiring a total number of member countries representing at least 50% of the world's gross tonnage. Parties can propose amendments to the six Annexes, with Annex VI being the most recent to take effect in May 2005. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI, but has not taken action on Annex IV. The flag state of a ship is responsible for compliance with the Annexes. The flag state of a ship is responsible for certifying compliance with MARPOL's pollution prevention standards, including Annex IV. IMO has established various conventions addressing issues like ballast water management and safety codes. Each nation enacts domestic laws to implement the conventions and pledges to comply with related laws of other nations. In the United States, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements these regulations. The United States implemented MARPOL regulations, including Annex VI on air pollution, in April 2006. Congress approved legislation in July 2008 for EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard to regulate Annex VI standards (P.L. 110-280). Amendments to strengthen MARPOL Annex VI were negotiated internationally before this legislation was enacted. The United States implemented MARPOL regulations, including Annex VI on air pollution, in April 2006. Congress approved legislation in July 2008 for EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard to regulate Annex VI standards. APPS applies to all U.S.-flagged ships worldwide and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard enforces regulations to implement APPS separately from other environmental laws. Implementing MARPOL is challenging due to the international nature of maritime shipping. The international nature of maritime shipping poses challenges in implementing MARPOL regulations. Countries can verify compliance and detain noncompliant ships. The United States enforces its laws against foreign-flagged ships for pollution incidents within its jurisdiction. Coordination with flag states is required for incidents outside U.S. jurisdiction. The report highlighted the need for better coordination between the Coast Guard, State Department, and flag states regarding procedures for cruise ships. In the United States, multiple agencies have jurisdiction over cruise ships, with the Coast Guard and EPA having regulatory responsibilities, and the Department of Justice handling law violations. The Department of State represents the US at international maritime meetings and treaty negotiations. The United States is responsible for pursuing foreign-flag violations in international treaty negotiations at the IMO meetings. Other federal agencies like NOAA and APHIS have limited roles in reporting on marine debris and ensuring quarantine inspection and disposal of food-contaminated garbage. States and localities may also have responsibilities. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the main U.S. law regulating pollutant discharges into water bodies, including cruise ship discharges. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program controls pollutant discharges from point sources like vessels. Sewage discharges from cruise ships are exempt from certain regulations under the act. Under the Clean Water Act, sewage discharges from cruise ships and vessels are exempt from certain regulations. Section 312 of the act prohibits untreated sewage dumping into US navigable waters within 3 miles of shore. Cruise ships must comply with this prohibition, enforced by EPA and the Coast Guard. Vessels with toilets are required to have marine sanitation devices to prevent untreated sewage discharge. EPA oversees the implementation of these regulations. The EPA and Coast Guard regulate marine sanitation devices (MSDs) to prevent untreated sewage discharge from vessels. MSDs are designed to hold or treat sewage before discharge, with Type II and Type III MSDs used on large vessels like cruise ships. Type II MSDs treat waste chemically or biologically to meet fecal coliform limits before discharge. Coast Guard regulations cover MSDs under 33 CFR Part 159. Type III MSDs store wastes and do not treat them; waste is pumped out later and treated in an onshore system or discharged outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs use chemicals to disinfect raw sewage prior to discharge and must meet performance standards for fecal coliform bacteria. Regulations do not require ship operators to sample, monitor, or report on their effluent. The MSD regulations, revised since 1976, do not require ship operators to sample, monitor, or report on their effluent discharges. Critics highlight deficiencies in the regulatory structure affecting cruise ships and other large vessels. Unlike the NPDES permit program, which regulates various pollutants, the MSD rules only cover bacterial contaminants and suspended solids. NPDES permit holders must comply with sampling, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, which are lacking in the MSD regulations. The Coast Guard has been criticized for poor enforcement of Section 312 requirements in inspecting cruise ships for compliance with MSD rules. The GAO reported that inspectors rarely have time to check sewage treatment equipment, limiting their ability to detect violations of environmental laws. The Coast Guard's focus on safety during inspections of large cruise ships is hindered by limited time and staff availability, as well as the lack of surprise in inspections. Since the September 11 attacks, the Coast Guard has shifted resources towards homeland security activities, potentially reducing resources for vessel inspections for MSD compliance. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring ships to have sewage treatment plants, comminuting systems, or holding tanks. While it is not mandatory in U.S. waters due to non-ratification, its requirements are minimal compared to U.S. rules for MSDs. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring certified sewage treatment systems or holding tanks. Within three miles of shore, sewage must be treated by a certified MSD, while between three and 12 miles, maceration or chlorination is sufficient. Beyond 12 miles, sewage discharges are unrestricted, with vessels allowed to follow less stringent requirements in certain jurisdictions. In U.S. waters, cruise ships must comply with Clean Water Act regulations. Some ships in Alaskan waters use Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for sewage treatment, which are effective in removing various substances but less so for dissolved metals and nutrients. Section 312 addresses sewage discharge. In U.S. waters, cruise ships must comply with Clean Water Act regulations, including addressing sewage discharge. Section 312 allows states to establish no-discharge zones for vessel sewage, prohibiting the discharge of treated and untreated sewage into certain waters. States must apply to the EPA for NDZ designation based on the need for environmental protection and the availability of pumpout facilities for sewage removal. No-discharge zones (NDZ) can be established by states under Section 312 of the Clean Water Act to prevent the discharge of sewage from vessels into specific waters. These zones are designated based on environmental importance and the availability of pumpout facilities. NDZ have been used in 26 states, including inland states, and for special waters like the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Boundary Waters Canoe area in Minnesota. The EPA identified options to address sewage from cruise ships, including revising discharge standards, restricting discharge within a certain distance from shore, requiring testing of wastewater treatment equipment, and imposing reporting requirements on cruise ship operators. Under current federal law, graywater is not defined as a pollutant and there are no separate federal effluent standards for graywater discharges. The Clean Water Act only includes graywater in its definition of sewage for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes. Alaska state law mandates treatment of graywater before discharge. The Clean Water Act does not define graywater as a pollutant, and there are no federal effluent standards for graywater discharges. Alaska state law requires graywater treatment before discharge. EPA issued a general permit for large commercial vessels, including cruise ships, with restrictions on graywater discharges. NOAA can designate National Marine Sanctuaries to restrict graywater discharges to protect sensitive ecosystems. NOAA regulations restrict discharges from cruise ships in marine sanctuaries like Monterey Bay and the Florida Keys. EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. Cruise ship solid waste discharges are governed by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) prohibits the dumping of garbage from the United States into ocean waters without a permit. EPA issues permits for regulating sea disposal, excluding dredged material which is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Cruise ships do not need an MPRSA permit to discharge solid waste beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) does not require a permit for cruise ships to discharge solid waste under U.S. jurisdiction. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) prohibits the discharge of garbage within certain distances from shore and applies to all vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Coast Guard administers inspection programs in U.S. waters to ensure port facilities can handle solid waste from cruise ships. EPA reports discharges of solid waste and plastic, prompting evaluation by the IMO to amend MARPOL. Options to address solid waste include improving on-board garbage handling technologies and implementing stronger waste management plans. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management from generation to disposal, imposing requirements on generators, transporters, and treatment facilities. Options to address solid waste from cruise ships include stronger waste management plans, prohibiting discharge of incinerator ash into U.S. waters, and expanding port reception facilities. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) imposes management requirements on generators, transporters, and treatment facilities for hazardous waste. Waste is considered hazardous if it is ignitable, corrosive, reactive, toxic, or listed as industrial process waste or discarded commercial products. Treatment facilities must have permits and comply with EPA regulations. Cruise ship operators may be subject to RCRA rules as generators or transporters of hazardous waste. Issues for the cruise ship industry include proper identification of hazardous waste. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) imposes management requirements on generators, transporters, and treatment facilities for hazardous waste, including proper identification and compliance with EPA regulations. Cruise ships generate hazardous wastes from various activities onboard, such as cleaning, painting, and passenger services, and must store them until offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA. Cruise ships may be subject to RCRA regulations for managing hazardous wastes generated from operations like maintenance and passenger services. It is unclear if they are classified as large or small generators of hazardous waste, leading to uncertainty about the applicable regulations. Some cruise companies argue that cruise ships should be classified as \"conditionally exempt small-quantity generators\" of hazardous waste, which would entail less stringent requirements. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) could potentially apply to hazardous substance releases from cruise ships, but it has not been utilized in response to such incidents. CERCLA mandates immediate notification to the National Response Center of hazardous substance releases from vessels above regulatory thresholds. EPA has identified 500 hazardous wastes and set rules for reportable quantities, starting as low as 1 pound. The Clean Water Act prohibits hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships into navigable waters. EPA has identified options for addressing hazardous wastes in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. Options for addressing hazardous wastes from cruise ships include establishing standards or BMPs to decrease contaminants, prohibiting discharge of hazardous materials into U.S. waters up to the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone, increasing inspections on cruise ships, and inspecting authorized facilities that receive cruise ship hazardous wastes. Section 311 of the Clean Water Act applies to cruise ships and prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances into U.S. navigable waters. Coast Guard regulations prohibit discharge of oil within 12 miles from shore, unless passed through a 15-ppm oil water separator. Beyond 12 miles, oil can be discharged if the content is less than 100 ppm. Vessels must maintain an Oil Record Book to record disposal of oily residues and discharges overboard. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL Annex I concerning oil pollution, applying to all U.S. flagged ships and foreign flagged vessels in U.S. waters. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land, except under limited conditions. Most cruise lines are foreign registered, limiting the impact of APPS regulations. The APPS regulations have limited applicability to cruise ship operations, as most cruise lines have policies restricting discharges of machinery space waste within three miles from shore. The EPA identified options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships, including establishing standards, researching alternative lubricants, treating effluents to meet standards, establishing penalties for noncompliance, banning discharge into U.S. waters, or revising inspection practices. In January 1999, conservation organizations petitioned EPA to repeal its 1973 regulation exempting ballast water discharge, arguing that it should be regulated as the \"discharge of a pollutant\" under the Clean Water Act's Section 402 permit. The EPA rejected a petition in September 2003 to regulate ballast water discharge as a pollutant under the Clean Water Act's Section 402 permit program, citing long-standing agency policy and ongoing federal activities for controlling invasive species in ballast water. Efforts to limit ballast water discharges by vessels were primarily voluntary until 2004. Efforts to regulate ballast water discharge were primarily voluntary until 2004, when all vessels with ballast water tanks were required to have a management plan. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit to challenge EPA's exemption of ballast water discharges from CWA permitting. A federal court ruled in favor of the groups in 2005, ordering EPA to set aside the regulation by September 30, 2008. The ruling was upheld on appeal in July 2008. The court ruling in response to environmental groups' challenge to EPA's permitting exemption for ballast water discharges also applies to other vessel discharges like graywater and bilge water. EPA issued the Vessel General Permit in December 2008, covering large recreational and commercial vessels, including tankers, freighters, barges, and cruise ships. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) applies to pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length and ballast water discharges from commercial vessels under 79 feet. It covers approximately 175 U.S. and foreign flagged cruise ships and extends to waters of the United States within the 3-mile territorial limit. EPA identified 26 types of waste streams in the permit. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) covers pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length and ballast water discharges from commercial vessels under 79 feet. It includes aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil and grease, metals, and toxic pollutants. Best management practices (BMPs) described in the permit control most waste streams from vessel operations. Control of ballast water discharges relies on existing Coast Guard requirements and specific practices, especially in Pacific nearshore areas. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) regulates pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length and ballast water discharges from commercial vessels under 79 feet. Best management practices (BMPs) control waste streams from vessel operations, including ballast exchange practices in Pacific nearshore areas. The VGP does not cover sewage discharges or toxic wastes from passenger services on cruise ships. Cruise ships are subject to detailed requirements for certain discharges, such as graywater. Cruise ships are subject to detailed requirements for certain discharges, such as graywater and pool and spa water, with BMPs and numeric effluent limits for fecal coliform and residual chlorine. Operational limits are also in place for graywater discharges in nutrient-impaired waters. The 110th Congress considered legislation for a uniform national approach to address aquatic nuisance species from ballast water discharge. The 110th Congress considered legislation (S. 1578 and H.R. 2830) for a uniform national approach to address aquatic nuisance species from ballast water discharge. Some groups opposed the legislation due to concerns about preempting states from enacting stricter ballast water management programs and the lack of citizen suit provisions. No further action was taken on this legislation. The Clean Air Act is the main federal law addressing air quality concerns, requiring EPA to set health-based standards for ambient air quality and national emission standards for sources of air pollution. Cruise ship emissions were unregulated until 2003 when EPA established standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels. In 2003, EPA established emission standards for large vessels like tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships flagged in the United States, following a settlement with the environmental group Bluewater Network. These standards align with international regulations for nitrogen oxides. This rule marked the first time emissions from ocean-going vessels were regulated by EPA. In 2003, EPA established emission standards for large marine vessel engines under Section 213(a) of the Clean Air Act, with plans to further regulate very large marine engines and vessels in the future to align with international efforts through the IMO. The EPA established emission standards for large marine vessel engines in 2003 under the Clean Air Act, with plans to regulate very large marine engines and vessels in the future to align with international efforts through the IMO. Environmental groups criticized EPA for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, but the rules were upheld in June 2004. The 110th Congress enacted legislation to implement MARPOL Annex VI to control air pollution from vessels, prompting the IMO to adopt similar standards in October 2008. EPA may consider including foreign vessels in future rulemaking for more stringent standards. In October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to Annex VI to establish new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards, supported by the United States. In December 2009, EPA promulgated changes to the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines, aligning with IMO requirements and establishing emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The EPA rule, similar to Annex VI requirements, applies to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged vessels. Foreign vessels must comply with nitrogen oxide limits under MARPOL Annex VI. The IMO approved a U.S. request to designate U.S. Caribbean waters as an ECA, subjecting ships to stricter regulations if a treaty amendment is approved by July 2011. The EPA rule, similar to Annex VI requirements, applies to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged vessels. Foreign vessels must comply with nitrogen oxide limits under MARPOL Annex VI. If approved by July 2011, ships in the designated area would face stricter emission limitations for sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter starting in 2014. Various laws and regulations apply to different geographic areas, with the Clean Water Act defining navigable waters, the contiguous zone, and the ocean as distinct entities. President Reagan signed a proclamation in 1988 extending the territorial sea of the United States to 12 nautical miles from the baseline. This proclamation did not affect the geographic reach of the Clean Water Act. The contiguous zone, as defined in the CWA, extends from the baseline to not beyond 12 miles. President Clinton's 1999 proclamation extended U.S. authorities' enforcement rights at sea to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the traditional 12-mile contiguous zone. This did not change the statutory definitions, so the territorial sea remains 3 miles wide and the contiguous zone extends from 3 to 12 miles. The CERCLA law incorporates the Clean Water Act's definitions of \"territorial seas\" and \"contiguous zone.\" The CWA defines the \"ocean\" as any portion of the high seas beyond the contiguous zone, while the MPRSA defines \"ocean waters\" as the open seas lying seaward beyond the baseline. Limits of jurisdiction are crucial in defining areas of authority. Limits of jurisdiction are crucial in defining areas where specific laws apply, such as the Clean Water Act's standards for sewage discharges from vessels into navigable waters and the requirements for NPDES permits for point source discharges. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also addresses discharges of oil and noxious substances into navigable waters. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) regulate discharges of oil, noxious substances, garbage, and plastics into navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The MPRSA also governs ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline. Jurisdictional complexities arise from varying definitions of distances from shore and the use of U.S.-flagged vessels for ocean dumping. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has raised concerns due to a significant increase in passengers during the 1990s. Nautical miles are used for distances at sea and in aviation, being 15% longer than international miles. In July 1999, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced federal criminal charges and agreed to pay $6.5 million for knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances in Alaska. They admitted to a fleet-wide practice of releasing oil-contaminated bilge water, part of an $18 million total federal plea agreement for environmental violations in multiple locations. Public concern over Royal Caribbean's actions increased. Public concern over Royal Caribbean's violations in Florida, New York, and California led to a program in December 1999 to identify cruise ship waste streams. Voluntary sampling in 2000 showed that most ships' waste treatment systems did not meet U.S. Coast Guard standards, with fecal coliform levels far exceeding the limits. This raised regional interest in the issue, coinciding with attention to Alaska problems and the passage of federal regulations. In December 2000, federal legislation was passed to address Alaska cruise ship waste issues, setting standards for vessels with 500+ passengers and prohibiting untreated sewage discharge in Alaskan waters. EPA was authorized to regulate sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships until specific regulations are issued. Cruise ships in Alaska waters must adhere to specific regulations for sewage discharge, including limits on fecal coliforms and total suspended solids. Vessels with advanced treatment systems can discharge treated sewage and graywater within one mile from shore and at speeds less than 6 knots. The legislation imposes strict effluent standards for vessels in Alaska waters, including limits on fecal coliforms, total suspended solids, and residual chlorine concentrations. Vessel operators must conduct sampling, data collection, and recordkeeping to comply with Coast Guard oversight. Regulations were issued in 2001 with procedures for sampling, testing, and penalties for violations. EPA is responsible for enforcing Title IV of the law. EPA conducted a multi-year project to evaluate treatment systems for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska. Wastewater samples were taken from four cruise ships in 2004 and 2005 to assess onboard waste generation and treatment system performance. Results were summarized in the 2008 Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report. EPA also distributed a survey questionnaire in 2004. In 2004, EPA distributed a survey on sewage and graywater treatment devices for large cruise vessels in Alaska. Collaborating with the state, EPA conducted a study in Skagway Harbor in 2008 to estimate the effectiveness of wastewater treatment systems on docked cruise ships. Results show that these systems are effective in treating various pollutants. In 2001, Alaska enacted its own law (AS 46.03.460-AS 46.03.490) setting standards for blackwater and graywater discharge from ships, aligning with federal legislation. Sampling requirements for all ships were implemented, along with effluent standards for large cruise ships. Effluent standards for graywater discharges by large cruise ships took effect in 2003, with small ships given three years to comply. A scientific advisory panel was established to evaluate the law's effectiveness in addressing cruise ship impacts on the Alaskan environment and public health. Large ships have either installed advanced wastewater treatment systems or met the effluent standards. As of 2006, 23 out of 28 large cruise ships in Alaskan waters have installed advanced wastewater treatment systems, improving the quality of discharged wastewater. Small ships, however, have not upgraded their systems, leading to consistent discharge of pollutants exceeding state standards. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative requiring cruise lines to pay a $50 head tax per passenger, corporate income tax, and fines for wastewater violations. New environmental regulations for cruise ships were mandated, including a state permit for all discharges of treated wastewater. Tax revenues will benefit local communities affected by tourism. The citizen initiative in Alaska imposes taxes on cruise lines to compensate for environmental harm and fund local communities. Some cruise lines have stopped operating in Alaskan waters in response to the initiative. Opponents argue it could harm Alaska's competitiveness in tourism. Alaska enacted legislation (HB 134) to give the Department of Environmental Conservation more time to implement stringent wastewater treatment standards and created a scientific review board. Other states have also taken action to regulate cruise ship discharges. Maine enacted legislation (Maine LD. 1158) governing discharges into coastal waters, applying to large cruise ships with advanced wastewater treatment systems required after January 1, 2006. Maine enacted legislation governing discharges into coastal waters for large cruise ships with advanced wastewater treatment systems required after January 1, 2006. Ships must comply with discharge and recordkeeping requirements under federal Alaska cruise ship law and obtain a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection. The state also applied to EPA for designation of No Discharge Zones to prohibit blackwater discharges into state waters. EPA approved the state's NDZ request for Casco Bay in June. California enacted several bills in 2004 to regulate cruise ship discharges in state waters. These include bans on treated wastewater, graywater, waste incinerators, sewage sludge, oil bilge water, and hazardous wastes from photo-processing and dry cleaning operations. California enacted several bills in 2004 to regulate cruise ship discharges in state waters, including bans on various types of waste. In 2006, California S.B. 497 mandated ballast water performance standards and deadlines for removing invasive species from ballast water by 2020. Other states like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii have agreements with the industry to adhere to waste management practices. In 2001, an agreement between industry and Florida required cruise lines to eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles off the coast, report hazardous waste annually, and undergo environmental inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard. In 2004, Washington, Northwest Cruise Ship Association, and Port of Seattle signed an MOU allowing treated wastewater discharge into state waters and prohibiting untreated discharge. The MOU signed in 2004 allowed treated wastewater discharge into state waters and prohibited untreated discharge from cruise ships. Environmental advocates criticize voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement, but states argue they can impose stricter requirements. In 2009, the Department of Ecology reported that most cruise ships visiting Washington complied with the MOU to stop discharging untreated wastewater. The 2009 report found that most cruise ships in Washington complied with the MOU to stop discharging untreated wastewater. The state argues that having voluntary agreements in place helps protect water quality and gather data on vessels and waste treatment equipment. Pressure from environmental advocates and the industry's desire to promote a positive image have led to initiatives from the Cruise Lines International Association. Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) has adopted waste management practices for their global operations, following regulations from IMO and U.S. EPA. Guidelines mandate proper discharge of graywater and blackwater, hazardous waste disposal, and implementation of Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems. The cruise industry has adopted waste management practices in accordance with IMO and U.S. EPA regulations, including Safety Management System plans. They are also collaborating with environmental groups to develop technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water management. Environmental groups prefer enforceable standards over voluntary ones. The Conservation and Tourism Alliance announced conservation efforts in four areas to protect biodiversity in coastal regions, including improving wastewater management on cruise ships, working with local governments to protect natural and cultural assets, raising awareness among passengers and crew, and educating vendors to reduce environmental impacts. CLIA and CI collaborated on a joint initiative in 2006 to develop a map integrating cruise destinations in the Caribbean and Mediterranean, two important biodiversity regions. In 2006, CLIA and CI partnered to create a map incorporating sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts to protect marine ecosystems. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. committed to retrofitting its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, setting an example for the industry. The company's efforts to improve practices after federal enforcement actions in the 1990s resulted in RCCL paying $27 million in criminal fines for environmental violations. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in areas such as laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight. More assessment is needed to determine if current steps are adequate, and bringing these issues to national priority for resources is a challenge. The challenge is to determine if existing laws and regulations adequately address cruise ship pollution management, especially regarding graywater. Legislative changes may be necessary to fill gaps and strengthen requirements, as certain waste streams are excluded or not effectively regulated. EPA's 2000 white paper highlighted the need for improvements in this area. Investigations in Alaska found significant contamination of cruise ship graywater with fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and plastics. Graywater from galley and sink waste tested higher for fecal coliform than sewage lines. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear, uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended establishing a new statutory regime with uniform discharge standards and waste management procedures for large passenger vessels. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed similar concepts but did not progress in Congress. The legislation would amend the Clean Water Act to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters, including the Great Lakes, except in compliance with prescribed effluent limits. It would require cruise ships to treat wastewater wherever they operate and authorize federal enforcement authority. The legislation would prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters, require wastewater treatment, and authorize federal enforcement. Passenger fees would fund EPA and Coast Guard implementation. Environmental advocates support the legislation, while industry groups argue it unfairly targets a small percentage of ships with already high environmental standards. Some states have passed similar regulations. Congress may need to develop federal legislation to regulate cruise ship discharges, harmonizing differences in state approaches. EPA has been assessing the need for additional standards for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships, but has not yet proposed any rules. EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in December 2008. The EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in December 2008, which examines various waste streams from cruise ships and discusses current federal actions to address them. The report identifies options to manage cruise ship discharges but notes that EPA has not determined the necessity, feasibility, or legal authority to implement these options. The EPA has not determined the legal authority to implement options for managing cruise ship discharges, including harmonizing jurisdictional terms, defining \"cruise ship,\" and updating regulations for improved technology. Research is needed to understand waste quantities generated by cruise ships. Research is crucial to understanding the waste generated by cruise ships, the impacts of their discharges and emissions, and the potential for new control technologies. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the importance of research in identifying the harm caused by vessel pollution and prioritizing resources to address significant threats. They recommended research on the transport of pollutants in the marine environment and the impacts of stationary discharges from small passenger vessels. The curr_chunk discusses the impacts of vessel pollution on sensitive ecosystems, including coastal areas and coral reef systems. It also mentions the need for research on vessel air emissions in ports and inland waterways. EPA's 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report suggested research options such as establishing a nationwide monitoring program. The curr_chunk discusses the need for a nationwide sampling, testing, and monitoring program to gather data on the environmental effects of cruise ship discharges. The 2000 GAO report highlighted the inadequacy of current laws and regulations in enforcing standards for cruise ship discharges. The GAO calls for increased federal oversight of cruise ships by the Coast Guard and other agencies to ensure compliance with pollution prevention standards, maintenance of equipment, and proper off-loading of waste. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing federal programs related to cruise ship pollution, but concerns remain about the adequacy of its resources for oversight. The adequacy of the Coast Guard's resources for vessel inspections has been questioned by the GAO and others, especially in light of its expanded responsibilities for homeland security. Possible options for enforcement and compliance include improving monitoring, rewarding passengers for detecting illegal activities, and allowing state personnel to inspect cruise ship pollution control equipment. The GAO recommended improving enforcement of cruise ship pollution control by allowing state personnel or a marine engineer onboard to observe waste treatment practices. The Coast Guard should work with the IMO to ensure member countries respond to pollution cases referred to them and follow up on alleged pollution cases outside U.S. jurisdiction."
