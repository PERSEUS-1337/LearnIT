    "content": "The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" establishes a grant program for gifted and talented students under Chapter B. This program includes authorized activities for supporting these students. The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" recognizes that gifted and talented students require specialized services to fully develop their capabilities, regardless of cultural, racial, or socioeconomic background. Some of these students may have disabilities or English as a second language, and many come from historically underrepresented groups. Elementary and secondary school teachers receive training to meet the needs of students with diverse backgrounds, including those who are gifted and talented. These students have already mastered a significant portion of the material before the school year begins. Most teachers are trained to support students with diverse backgrounds, but often lack training for gifted and talented students. Public schools are the main resource for high-ability students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Gifted education programs should be provided by qualified professionals. Gifted education programs in public schools, provided by qualified professionals, are essential for equal educational opportunities. Parents and families play a crucial role in developing appropriate services for gifted students, requiring access to information, research, and support. There is currently no Federal requirement for identifying gifted students. To address the disparity in services for gifted students, some States and local agencies allocate resources while others do not, leading to varying laws, funding, and accountability mechanisms. This lack of consistency highlights the need for a Federal requirement to identify and serve the approximately 3,000,000 gifted students in the nation, crucial for meeting future economic and national security needs. The United States needs more students to achieve higher levels of education, especially highly capable students who can perform innovative and creative work to secure the nation's position globally. The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in the US on international assessments like TIMSS is among the lowest in the world, highlighting the need for improvement in physics and advanced mathematics education. In 1990, the United States allocated very little funding for challenging programs for gifted students in physics and advanced mathematics. The Secretary may award competitive grants to states if the appropriated amount is between $7,500,000 and $57,500,000. The Secretary may award grants to State educational agencies for developing gifted and talented education programs and providing educational services and materials. The State educational agencies can award grants to local educational agencies for developing or expanding gifted and talented education programs and providing direct educational services and materials. Grant funds can be used for various activities including providing direct educational services to gifted and talented students. Grant funds provided under this chapter can be used for compacting, modified curriculum, acceleration, independent study, and dual enrollment. However, funds cannot be used for purchasing or upgrading technological hardware. A State educational agency receiving a grant under this chapter may use up to 10 percent of the funds for dissemination of program information, technical assistance, monitoring and evaluation, and parental education support. The State educational agency can use up to 50 percent of funds for administrative costs under the State gifted education program. \"SEC. 5467A. ALLOTMENTS TO STATES.\" From the amount available for this chapter, the Secretary reserves 1/2 of 1 percent for programs in schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The remaining funds are allotted to states based on their populations aged 5 through 17. The Secretary reserves 1/2 of 1 percent of funds for programs in schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. States receive allotments based on populations aged 5 through 17. States not applying for an allotment will have their funds reallocated to other states. \"SEC. 5467B. STATE APPLICATION.\" To be eligible for a grant under this chapter, a State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary with assurances that funds will be used to support gifted and talented students from diverse backgrounds, including those with limited English proficiency and disabilities. The State educational agency must use funds to make grants to local educational agencies on a competitive basis. Funds received should only supplement, not supplant, state and local funds for gifted and talented students. The State educational agency must provide matching funds equal to at least 10 percent of the grant funds. The State educational agency must provide matching funds equal to at least 10 percent of the grant funds and develop program assessment models for accountability and effectiveness. The Secretary will approve a State's application if it meets the requirements of this section. \"SEC. 5467C. DISTRIBUTION TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES.\" A State educational agency must allocate at least 90% of funds to local educational agencies for grants to carry out authorized activities. Funds are distributed through a competitive process ensuring equitable distribution by geographic area within the State. Grants awarded by the State educational agency must be of a certain size. A State educational agency must award grants in an amount sufficient to meet the needs of the students to be served. SEC. 5467D. LOCAL APPLICATIONS. To be eligible for a grant under this chapter, a local educational agency must submit an application to the State educational agency. The application must include an assurance that funds will be used to support gifted and talented students from diverse backgrounds, including those with limited English proficiency and disabilities. The local educational agency must describe how they will meet the educational needs of gifted and talented students, including training personnel. Funds received must supplement, not replace, existing funds for these students. The State educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing the number of students served and activities supported with funds under the Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003. The report should also include measures taken to comply with specific sections. The Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003 allows recipients of funds to serve gifted students alongside those with similar needs. Grants under this act must ensure equitable participation of private school students and teachers, including in professional development programs. The Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003 defines 'gifted and talented' based on applicable State law or definitions by the State or local educational agency if no State law exists. The term 'State' is defined as each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. If a State does not have a law defining the term 'gifted and talented', it will have the meaning given in section 9101. Authorization of Appropriations for fiscal years 2004 through 2010 is set at $170,000,000, with $7,500,000 allocated for chapter A and the remainder for chapter 2.

In the context of authorizing appropriations for fiscal years 2004 through 2010, amendments are made to the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program, including changes to section 5461 and 5464 of the Act."
