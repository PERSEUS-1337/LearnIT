    "content": "Risk adjustment is the process of adjusting payments to health insurance plans based on the risk characteristics of enrollees. For example, if women's healthcare costs are $100 more than men's, insurers could be paid $100 more for women to prevent gender bias in enrollment. Risk adjustment in healthcare payment involves paying insurers $100 more for women than men to reflect their different expected health expenditures. Insurers use sophisticated models that consider factors like age, geography, health status, and family size to ensure fairness in enrollment. However, these models do not account for all differences in expected costs. Risk adjustment models in healthcare payment do not fully explain differences in expected spending. The report discusses how CMS pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage, how risk scores for MA enrollees are generated and change over time, and potential issues with risk adjustment and audits. Medicare Advantage offers private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B. Medicare Advantage (MA) is a managed care option for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B. Health plans receive a capitated monthly payment from CMS to provide all required Medicare benefits, regardless of actual service usage. Plans are at-risk if costs exceed payments, but can retain savings if costs are lower. Payments to MA plans are based on estimated costs of providing Medicare services. Payments to MA plans are determined by comparing each plan's bid for covering Medicare benefits to a benchmark set by the federal government. If the bid is above the benchmark, the plan receives a base rate equal to the benchmark; if below, the plan receives a base rate equal to its bid. CMS also adjusts payments to private plans based on various factors. CMS adjusts payments to private plans based on the characteristics of the Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in each plan, such as age, gender, and health history. The MA risk adjustment methodology uses demographic and health factors from a base year to adjust payments in the following year. CMS adjusts payments to private plans based on beneficiary characteristics like age, gender, and health history to estimate next year's health care expenditures. Factors such as age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability are considered in determining the risk adjustment for MA plan payments. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) adjusts payments to private plans based on beneficiary characteristics like age, gender, and health history. Health status is incorporated into payments through diagnosis using ICD-9-CM codes, which physicians submit for Medicare reimbursement. There are over 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes used to denote signs, symptoms, injuries, diseases, and conditions. The ICD-9-CM codes, totaling over 13,000, are mapped into diagnostic groups and condition categories. These categories have a hierarchy based on clinical severity and cost, with only the most significant manifestation of a disease being coded for payment purposes. For example, Ischemic Heart Disease codes are organized into the Coronary Artery Disease hierarchy, ranging from Acute Myocardial Infarction to Coronary Atherosclerosis/Other Chronic Ischemic Heart Disease. The hierarchical coding system in ICD-9-CM ensures that the most costly form of the disease dictates reimbursement. Only 70 out of 189 hierarchical condition codes are used in the current CMS model, focusing on chronic codes that best predict costs. Beginning in 2012, 87 HCC codes will be incorporated into the model, with Table B-1 showing these codes and their factors. Figure 2 illustrates the conversion of ICD-9-CM codes to HCC codes for a hypothetical 76-year-old female with various diagnosed conditions. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC, as shown in the figure. The HCC model incorporates 87 codes since 2012, converting ICD-9-CM codes to HCC codes for diagnosed conditions. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC, as shown in Figure 2. Some conditions like chest pain and ankle sprain are excluded from the CMS model as they are not chronic or short-term illnesses. The HCC model uses 87 codes to predict next year's expenditures based on diagnosed conditions. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC, as some conditions are excluded for not being chronic or short-term illnesses. The model is additive, with risk factors estimated for each condition and summed up to determine the beneficiary's total risk score. This score is then multiplied by the MA plan's base rate for risk adjustment. The risk score is multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to calculate the risk-adjusted base payment. An empirical study shows that having two or more conditions can result in higher costs due to interaction effects. For example, healthcare costs for someone with diabetes and congestive heart failure are higher than expected from just adding the costs of each condition. The CMS-HCC model incorporates interaction effects between certain diseases and disability, leading to higher healthcare costs for individuals with both conditions. This adjustment accounts for the higher or lower costs of enrolling Medicare beneficiaries with specific demographic characteristics or diagnoses in MA plans. The CMS-HCC model is a linear regression model that adjusts the cost of enrolling Medicare beneficiaries based on diagnoses and demographic variables. It includes interactions between certain diseases and permanent disability, using actual claims data for Medicare Parts A and B. The model has been refined over the years to determine relative risk factors for each variable used in payment calculations. The CMS-HCC model adjusts Medicare beneficiary costs based on health care and demographic variables, with coefficients recalculated periodically using current claims data. Risk scores can be standardized to reflect costs compared to average beneficiaries, with scores above 1 indicating higher costs. CMS uses risk scores to adjust payments to plans based on health status and demographics, aiming to reflect likely costs for treating Medicare beneficiaries. The goal is to predict average expenditure variations, not individual expenses. CMS uses risk scores to adjust payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on health status and demographics. For new enrollees without 12 months of Part B eligibility, rates are determined by age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, not diagnoses. CMS collects information from Medicare Advantage plans to update the risk score of beneficiaries, transitioning from RAPS to EDPS for more detailed data. This shift allows CMS to retain diagnostic information for updating risk scores and payments directly from plan data. The risk scores for Medicare Advantage payments are updated twice a year based on data from physician and hospital facilities. Errors in age, gender, disability status, and Medicaid eligibility can impact payment calculations. Error in health status information provided to CMS by Medicare Advantage plans is auditable to ensure accuracy in risk-adjusted payments. CMS conducts RADV audits to verify risk-adjusted payments claimed by Medicare Advantage plans. Previously, audits only targeted sampled enrollees, but in 2011, CMS proposed extrapolating error rates to entire plan contracts, aiming for $2.27 billion in savings over five years. In 2010, CMS released a methodology for auditing plan data and identifying payment errors at the contract level. In February 2012, CMS finalized the payment error calculation methodology for Medicare Advantage plans. Audits are conducted at the contract level, with potential recoveries likely to be problematic for some plans. CMS engages in a three-step process for audits: sampling, medical record review, and error rate determination. CMS conducts audits for Medicare Advantage plans through a three-step process: sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. The sample size of 201 enrollees is drawn from eligible beneficiaries enrolled in the MA contract in January of the payment year, meeting specific criteria. The CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans by sampling 201 enrollees from eligible beneficiaries in the MA contract. Criteria include non-ESRD status, non-hospice, continuous Medicare Part B coverage, and at least one risk adjustment diagnosis leading to CMS-HCC assignment for risk-adjusted payments. The CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans by sampling 201 enrollees from eligible beneficiaries in the MA contract. Enrollees are divided into three equal groups based on risk scores, with 67 enrollees randomly selected from each group for validation HCCs. Sampling weights ensure each group is represented. Sampling weights are used to ensure that each sample of eligible enrollees in a Medicare Advantage plan represents the group they were drawn from. Enrollees are ranked by risk score and divided into high, medium, and low strata, with an equal number randomly selected from each group. The weight for each sampled enrollee is 14.925, and these weights are used to scale-up the sample payment error findings to the entire population. The MA plan is then informed of the enrollees selected for audit. The MA plan is informed of eligible enrollees selected for audit and their HCC codes. Plans must provide evidence from medical records to substantiate each HCC code within 12 weeks. CMS contractor reviews records to confirm diagnoses for risk-adjusted payments. The MA plan must provide evidence from medical records to support HCC codes within 12 weeks. If the plan disagrees with the initial CMS contractor's findings, it can appeal for a review by CMS Administrator. Payment errors for each enrollee can result in either overpayment or underpayment. Underpayments must be found in the initial medical record that validates the audited CMS-HCC. Enrollee-level payment errors are corrected based on supported HCCs from RADV medical record reviews. Payment errors can result in overpayments or underpayments, with underpayments needing validation in the initial medical record. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is calculated by multiplying the total payment error for each sampled enrollee by their sampling weight. The weighted enrollee payment errors are then summed to determine the MA contract's estimated payment error. The payment recovery amount for each audited MA contract is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval. The audited MA contract's payment error is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval, adjusted by a fee-for-service (FFS) adjuster to address documentation standards differences. The payment error calculation involves selecting 201 eligible enrollees per contract for review. The audited MA contract's payment error is determined by selecting 201 eligible enrollees for review. Errors are identified and extrapolated to the contract, with a 99% confidence interval calculated for the estimated plan error. The estimated plan level error across all enrollees is $1,187.50. In a hypothetical example, a confidence interval from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50 indicates a payment error certainty of over 99%. If the interval includes $0, the recovery amount is limited to $0. If not, a fee-for-service adjuster modifies the lower bound for reimbursement. The recovery amount is capped at $0 if the FFS adjuster would lead to a negative recovery, meaning no extra payment to MA plans from RADV audits. Concerns have been raised about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage, with variations in actual costs for beneficiaries with the same HCC code. Plans may reduce efforts according to Brown et al. (p. 33). Plans in Medicare Advantage may enroll beneficiaries below average cost into their plan to experience lower expenses while being reimbursed at average rates. MedPAC is concerned about special needs plans enrolling high-cost individuals. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) expressed concerns about the audit process and the CMS risk adjustment model in Medicare Advantage plans. They highlighted the lack of validation for Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments. The American Academy of Actuaries raised concerns about the lack of validation for Medicare fee-for-service data used in the CMS risk adjustment model for Medicare Advantage plans. They emphasized the inconsistency in how risk adjustment factors were developed and applied, noting that the resulting premiums may not reflect the actual enrollees' risk profiles. The audit process proposed for Medicare Advantage data would only apply validated factors, which differ from those used in the risk adjustment model. This discrepancy could lead to inadequate payments for certain conditions like diabetes. The risk score factor associated with diabetes may be understated due to lower-cost patients in the data, leading to inadequate payments. Data inconsistency could result in systematic underpayment, undermining the risk adjustment system's purpose. The Health Practice Council is concerned that the modified payment methodology may not accurately reflect the risk profile of enrollees in affected MA plans, potentially leading to payment inequities. The notice of final calculation methodology for MA plans includes a fee-for-service adjustment to the recovery amount to address concerns about payment inequities. Risk adjustment aims to compensate MA plans for enrolling sicker or healthier Medicare beneficiaries, but concerns have been raised about using unverified Medicare fee-for-service data for risk adjustment coefficients. The risk adjustment coefficients for Medicare Advantage plans are generated using accuracy. Some plans are concerned about financial risk from RADV audits. The history of Part C risk adjustment payments to private plans under Medicare is briefly described in the appendix. The appendix briefly describes risk adjustment models used for Medicare private plan payments, showing the year each model was in use and the percentage of variation in individual expenditures predicted. The models aim to explain the range of spending by Medicare beneficiaries, from healthy individuals with minimal expenses to those with significant healthcare costs. The risk adjustment models used for Medicare private plan payments aim to predict beneficiary spending based on their characteristics. The R2 quantifies how much variation in expenditures the model explains, ranging from 0 to 1. The Average Adjusted Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) model has an R2 of 0.0077, indicating it explains 0.77% of the variation in beneficiary expenditures. Subsequent models used by CMS have increased the percentage of variation explained. The most recent model used by CMS can explain approximately 12.5% of the variation in beneficiary expenditures. Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) model includes demographic variables like age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status. The demographic data of Medicare beneficiaries 65 and over with employer-sponsored insurance explain less than 1% of expenditure variation. Private plan enrollees were healthier than original Medicare enrollees, leading to higher payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology by January 1, 2000. The Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model was used from 2000 to 2003, considering beneficiary health status and the worst principal inpatient diagnosis. Despite explaining more expenditure variation than the AAPCC model, PIP-DCG had limitations. The PIP-DCG model, used from 2000 to 2003, had limitations such as not counting illnesses with high expenditures that didn't lead to hospital admissions. The phase-in schedule for the model was held at 90% demographic-only method/10% PIP-DCG method through 2003 to soften the financial impact on M+C organizations. Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model, incorporating information from hospital inpatient and outpatient. The CMS-HCC model considers severity of illness, multiple diseases, and interactive effects to explain 10% of beneficiary expenditures. It incorporates data from various healthcare settings and is detailed in \"Risk Adjustment Under\". The CMS-HCC model, detailed in the \"Risk Adjustment Under Medicare Advantage\" section, has been updated annually to reflect changes in ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and recalibrated with recent data. Version 12 increased the explained variation in Medicare expenditures from 10% to nearly 11%, while Version 21 includes updates to diagnosis codes and underwent a major clinical recalibration. Version 21 of the CMS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices. These updates increased the predictive power of the model to approximately 12.5% and it is slated to be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans."
