    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Stopping Illegal Obamacare Subsidies Act\". It limits auto-enrollment in health plans under American Health Benefit Exchanges until inconsistencies outlined in a June 2014 report are resolved by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. SEC. 3. PROCESS FOR APPLICATIONS WITH INCONSISTENCIES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will make public the steps for resolving inconsistencies in eligibility for healthcare programs within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will make public the methods used to monitor progress in resolving inconsistencies for the Federal Exchange and State Exchanges. Premium assistance tax credits and reduced cost-sharing programs will be suspended for the 2015 plan year and will only resume after certain conditions are met. The sharing programs will resume after the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration and the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services confirm that all inconsistencies related to invalid social security numbers have been resolved. Requests for additional information may be required if applicant information contains inconsistencies. During an inconsistency period in the State or Federal Exchange, individuals may be enrolled in a qualified health plan but cannot participate in certain assistance programs. The Secretary can request additional information within 90 days if inconsistencies are found. An individual who cooperates with a request for additional information and is later determined eligible for certain programs will retroactively receive benefits for the inconsistency period. Failure to submit requested information may result in withdrawal from the premium assistance credit program. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the reduced cost-sharing program under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will result in disenrollment if information is inaccurate. Re-enrollment in a qualified health plan with correct details is required during the next open enrollment period. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"inconsistencies\" refer to differences in self-attested information provided by an applicant for health plan enrollment and the data received from the Federal Data Services Hub or other sources, including citizenship and income. The term \"inconsistency period\" refers to a 90-day period following the notice of an inconsistency sent to the applicant, which may involve citizenship, income, employer-sponsored coverage, incarceration status, or other factors affecting eligibility for financial assistance programs under the Affordable Care Act."
