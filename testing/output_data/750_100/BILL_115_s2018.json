    "content": "The \"American Family Act of 2017\" establishes a fully refundable Child Tax Credit by eliminating the existing credit and inserting a new section 36C in the Internal Revenue Code. The \"American Family Act of 2017\" establishes a fully refundable Child Tax Credit under section 36C of the Internal Revenue Code. The credit allows for $3,000 for each qualifying child over 6 years old and 120% of the dollar amount for each qualifying child under 6 years old. The Child Tax Credit under section 36C of the Internal Revenue Code allows for $3,000 for each qualifying child over 6 years old and 120% of the dollar amount for each qualifying child under 6 years old. The credit amount is reduced based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeding a certain threshold amount. The threshold amount for the Child Tax Credit is $110,000 for joint returns, $75,000 for individuals not married, and $55,000 for married individuals filing separately, determined by marital status under section 7703. The Child Tax Credit's applicable amount is calculated based on the credit allowable under subsection (a) divided by $20 multiplied by the total number of qualifying children. The Child Tax Credit defines a qualifying child as a dependent under 19 years of age, with an exception for certain non-citizens. There is also an inflation adjustment for each taxable year. Inflation Adjustment for the Child Tax Credit increases the $3,000 amount annually based on the cost of living adjustment. If the increase is not a multiple of $50, it will be rounded. The Child Tax Credit amount is adjusted annually for inflation, increasing the $3,000 threshold based on the cost of living adjustment. Any increase that is not a multiple of $50 will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. Identification requirements must be met for qualifying children to claim the credit. The Child Tax Credit amount is adjusted annually for inflation, with identification requirements for qualifying children. No credit is allowed if the taxpayer's identifying number was issued after the due date, or if the taxable year is less than 12 months. Additionally, no credit is allowed for taxpayers who improperly claimed credit in prior years. No credit allowed under this section for any taxable year in the disallowance period, which is 10 years after a fraud determination. Taxpayers are not allowed to claim credit under this section for 2 taxable years after a final determination of reckless or intentional disregard of rules. If denied credit due to deficiency procedures, no credit is allowed for that taxable year. Taxpayers must provide necessary information to demonstrate eligibility for the credit under subchapter B of chapter 63. The credit allowed for a taxable year will be reduced by any advance payments received for that year under section 7527A. If advance payments under section 7527A for the taxable year exceed the credit allowed, the tax imposed by this chapter will be increased by the excess amount. A new section is added to Chapter 77 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for advance payment of the credit. \"SEC. 7527A. ADVANCE PAYMENT OF CHILD TAX CREDIT.\" The Secretary will establish a program for advance monthly payments of the child tax credit to eligible taxpayers, with limitations on the total amount per taxpayer for the taxable year. The Secretary will establish a program for advance monthly payments of the child tax credit to eligible taxpayers, with limitations on the total amount per taxpayer for the taxable year. The excess amount determined under subsection (a) of section 36C for the taxpayer, minus the estimated tax imposed by subtitle A, reduced by allowable credits, as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish a program for advance monthly payments of the child tax credit to eligible taxpayers, with limitations on the total amount per taxpayer for the taxable year. The program shall make reasonable efforts to apply the limitation of section 36C(b) with respect to payments made under it. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. \"Subchapter A of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code is amended by inserting after section 36B the following:\" Sec. 36C.
