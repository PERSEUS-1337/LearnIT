    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011, with restrictions on new programs. On April 15, 2011, an omnibus funding bill for the balance of FY2011 was signed, providing $659.9 billion for DOD activities. The DOD appropriations bill for FY2011 provided $659.9 billion for all DOD activities except military construction, a reduction of $18.2 billion from the President's request. The bill also allocated $17.8 billion for DOD's military construction budget, a reduction of $2.2 billion from the President's request. Additionally, $4.4 billion in reductions were applied to broad categories of spending. The DOD appropriations bill for FY2011 provided $659.9 billion for all DOD activities except military construction, with reductions applied to broad categories of spending. This included $2.0 billion rescinded from prior fiscal year funds, $1.5 billion cut proportionately from various programs, $723 million from civilian pay, and $125 million from federally funded research and development corporations. Significant reductions were also made to major weapons programs, with $1.7 billion cut from continued development. The DOD appropriations bill for FY2011 provided $659.9 billion for all DOD activities except military construction, with reductions applied to broad categories of spending. This included significant cuts to major weapons programs, such as $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, $473 million from a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and $325 million from a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. H.R. 1473 partially offset these cuts by adding funds to the request, including $495.0 million for Navy strike fighters, $1.38 billion for National Guard and reserve equipment, and $661.7 million for medical research. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act allocated funds for various programs, including medical research, Israeli missile defense systems, and the Military Career Advancement Account. However, it did not provide additional funding for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The bill authorized $725.9 billion for DOD and defense-related activities, which was $2.7 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported a version of the bill authorizing $725.7 billion for defense-related activities, a reduction of $240.7 million from the Administration's request. The Senate did not act on this version due to opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. On December 9, 2010, the Senate rejected a motion to invoke cloture on the bill, with a vote of 57-40 in favor. A compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) was negotiated by members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, removing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" provision. The bill was signed by the President on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383), supporting President Obama's position. The enacted H.R. 6523 supported President Obama's position by not adding funds to continue production of the C-17 cargo plane. It authorized a 1.9% increase in military pay and $485 million for an alternate jet engine for the F-35 fighter, against the Administration's positions. The FY2011 bill, H.R. 6523, authorized a 1.4% basic pay raise and $485 million for the alternate engine for the F-35. The President's FY2011 budget request included $738.7 billion for national defense, with $733.3 billion in discretionary spending. The FY2011 budget for the Department of Defense included $733.3 billion in discretionary spending, with an additional $5.3 billion in mandatory spending. This budget also allocated $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Administration requested $33 billion in supplemental DOD appropriations for FY2010 war costs to cover the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total amount appropriated for FY2010 war costs to $162.6 billion. The Administration's FY2011 war costs request was $159.3 billion, $3 billion lower than FY2010. The budget shifted focus from Iraq to Afghanistan. An additional $655 million was added for humanitarian relief in Haiti after the earthquake. The DOD relief effort after the Haiti earthquake in 2010 included deploying Navy ships, cargo flights, and military personnel. The FY2011 budget requested a 3.4% increase for the DOD base budget, with real growth in purchasing power. Other \"security agencies\" like the Department of State were also allocated increased spending. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for discretionary programs of security agencies, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. For non-security agencies, the request was $386.4 billion, a 1.5% decrease from FY2010. The DOD base budget for FY2011 was $548.9 billion, $18.2 billion higher than the previous year. The FY2011 DOD base budget request is $18.2 billion higher than the previous year, continuing the upward trend since FY1998. Adjusted for inflation, it would be the third largest budget since the end of the Korean War. The FY2011 DOD base budget request is $18.2 billion higher than the previous year, continuing the upward trend since FY1998. In FY1985 and FY1986, during the Reagan Administration's defense buildup, there were peak budget levels. Defense Secretary Robert Gates stated in 2009 that a 2% real growth rate was needed for investments through FY2015, but the projected annual increases fall short of this target. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap between sustaining the current force and future budgets. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to sustain the current forces with expected future budgets. Real growth in the defense budget is needed, but achieving necessary growth rates is unlikely. The solution involves shifting funds within the budget to support combat forces while reducing spending in other areas. Secretary Gates proposed increasing spending on combat forces by reducing costs in administrative and support activities, aiming to shift funds from \"tail\" to \"tooth\" within the budget to achieve real growth. Secretary Gates aimed to achieve real growth by reducing costs in administrative and support activities, proposing a shift of about $10 billion from support functions to combat units to increase the \"tooth\"-related part of the FY2012 DOD budget request by 3%. Secretary Gates proposed initiatives to reduce the cost of DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in funding for service support contractors, cutting the number of generals and admirals by 50, reducing senior DOD civilians by 150, and eliminating certain departments. Additionally, on September 14, 2010, he announced 23 more initiatives to increase efficiency in DOD contracts for goods and services. Secretary Gates proposed initiatives to reduce the cost of DOD's contracts for goods and services, including implementing an \"affordability target\" for weapons program managers and revising contracting rules to reward efficiency. These changes aim to lower the department's annual contracting budget, which amounts to about $400 billion of its $700 billion annual spending. Some Members of Congress argue that the Administration's projected budget increases may be insufficient, leading to potential cuts in planned acquisition programs. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon highlighted concerns about the impact of minimal real growth in the defense budget on investment and procurement accounts. Some Members object to exempting DOD from the budget freeze on discretionary spending, calling for reductions in unnecessary weapons programs and overseas military deployments to avoid devastating cuts in federal programs. The FY2011 DOD base budget request amounts to 3.6% of the GDP, marking a leveling off of the DOD share of GDP since 9/11. The FY2011 budget sustains previous initiatives with fewer changes to major weapons programs compared to FY2010. The FY2011 budget request reflects the strategy and force planning assumptions from DOD's Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), showing a shift in strategic thinking towards modern warfare needs. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be prepared for various missions, with a focus on ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The DOD must prioritize support for forces engaged in current operations and develop capabilities for counterinsurgency, stability, and counter-terrorism operations. The 2010 QDR recommends near-term initiatives such as increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. It also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade, with potential for more conversions in the future. The 2010 QDR emphasizes that potential adversaries will likely challenge U.S. military capabilities asymmetrically, using unconventional tactics and technologies. This challenges the idea of a conflict spectrum from unsophisticated insurgents to advanced competitors. The 2010 QDR highlights the evolving nature of conflict, with low-end terrorist groups using advanced technologies and near-peer competitors employing indirect means like cyber-warfare. It emphasizes the military's need to operate effectively in cyberspace and strengthen its capabilities to defend cyber-networks. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for the military to strengthen its capabilities in defending cyber-networks. Specific steps include developing a comprehensive approach to DOD operations in cyberspace, increasing cyber expertise within DOD, centralizing command of cyber operations, and collaborating with other agencies for enhanced cyber security. The report also maintains the policy of being able to win two major regional wars simultaneously while prioritizing flexibility and effectiveness in responding to various conflicts. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of preparing U.S. forces to handle multiple missions of different types around the globe, including stabilizing another country, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency missions, and supporting civil authorities after disasters or attacks. China and other potential adversaries are developing an \"anti-access, area-denial\" capability that could target U.S. forces in nearby nations and naval forces close to shore, impacting the U.S.'s ability to project power globally. This capability is crucial for U.S. alliances and stability efforts in various regions, but it comes at a high cost. The cost of power projection capabilities is a reason for the high U.S. defense spending, making U.S. forces vulnerable to various attacks such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and submarines. The QDR recommends countering anti-access strategies with long-range strike weapons and submarines. This includes developing offensive electronic attack capabilities and missile defense measures. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, reflecting a 4.7% increase over FY2000 end-strength levels. This increase follows a reduction in active-duty manpower that began in FY1987 and accelerated during the 1990s. During the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, active-duty end-strength was reduced by about one-third across each service. The end strength of the Army and Marine Corps rebounded since the start of combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, meeting goals three years earlier than planned. Congress authorized a temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength in 2010, reflected in the FY2011 request for an Army end-strength of 569,400. The FY2011 budget included a $1 billion increase for military personnel's basic pay and a 4.2% increase in Basic Allowance for Housing. Congress has typically approved raises in military basic pay higher than the average increase in private-sector pay. The FY2011 budget included a $1 billion increase for military personnel's basic pay, with a 4.2% increase in Basic Allowance for Housing. DOD officials argue that service members are already better paid than 70% of private sector workers, proposing a 0.5% raise instead of 1.9% to allocate funds for reenlistment bonuses and special pays. Military advocacy groups push for the higher increase to bridge the \"pay gap\" between military and civilian peers. The FY2011 DOD funding bills provided a platform for legislative initiatives regarding President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations on openly homosexual individuals in the military. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could affect cohesion and combat effectiveness. Some critics oppose changing the current policy on openly homosexual individuals in the military, citing stress on services due to deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Legislators have introduced bills to repeal the 1993 law and replace it with a nondiscrimination policy based on sexual orientation. President Obama called for repealing the legislation in his 2010 State of the Union Address. The Department of Defense conducted a study on implementing a policy of nondiscrimination against individuals with a same-sex orientation. Secretary Gates opposed repealing the 1993 law until the study was completed. Changes were made to enforcement procedures, requiring only high-ranking officers to initiate investigations and third-party information to be given under oath. Senators Levin and Lieberman wrote to President Obama about the issue. In a letter to President Obama, Senators proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service, pending completion of the DOD review and certification from key officials. The Administration supports the draft amendment to repeal the legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service, despite the ongoing DOD review. The Administration supports repealing the 'don't ask, don't tell' law, despite ongoing DOD review. Federal Judge ruled law unconstitutional, temporarily stayed injunction, Under Secretary issued memorandum. The Secretary of Defense for Personnel issued a memorandum limiting the authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior. The FY2011 budget request included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system, which serves 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through various medical facilities. The system's cost has more than doubled in the past 10 years and is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. The DOD health care system's cost is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015, accounting for 10% of the planned DOD budget. Factors contributing to the rise in costs include an increase in retirees using TRICARE, more frequent use of DOD medical services, legislatively mandated benefit increases, and stagnant fees since 1995. The Bush and Obama administrations proposed fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries, but Congress passed legislation to prohibit them. The DOD health care system's costs are projected to increase annually due to factors like more retirees using TRICARE and legislatively mandated benefit increases. The FY2011 request aimed to increase funding for weapons and equipment procurement while slightly decreasing the budget for research and development within the DOD. Congress is considering ways to control costs while ensuring care for military personnel and retirees. The FY2011 budget proposed a decrease in the proportion of funding going to R&D from 44% to 40%, with a focus on production of major programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The total budget request for FY2011 was $11.2 billion, with $2.3 billion allocated for R&D and $9.0 billion for procurement. The Administration suggested minimal cuts to major weapons programs, reiterating proposed cuts from the previous year that were rejected by Congress. The FY2011 budget request included no funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or an alternate F-35 jet engine, despite Congress adding funding for these programs in 2009. Some Members of Congress have questioned the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which the Administration requested $3.2 billion for in FY2011. The FY2011 budget request included $3.2 billion for the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) program. One controversial element is the proposed new Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). In 2009, efforts to develop 14 manned and unmanned systems tied by a communications network were underway, but the manned ground vehicle component was recommended for cancellation by Secretary of Defense Gates. The Army's Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) program due to concerns about the MGV component not reflecting lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan. The GCV program aims to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017 based on mature technologies and future network capabilities. The Army cancelled the existing competition for the GCV development contract and revised performance specifications. The GCV competition was restarted on November 30, 2010. The Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS) program components are being integrated into the Army's Modernization program for deployment to all 73 Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) by 2025. The effectiveness of these components has not been demonstrated in field exercises. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships, such as attack submarines, destroyers, and Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs). The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships, including attack submarines, destroyers, Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs), amphibious assault ship, Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) ship, and Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV). The Navy's shipbuilding plan for FY2011-FY2015 includes 50 new battle force ships, with half being LCSs or JHSVs. The FY2011 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 276 ships but falls short of the 313-ship plan. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan projects a fleet growth from 284 ships in FY2011 to 320 ships in FY2024, dropping below 313 ships in FY2027, declining to 288 ships in FY2032-FY2033, and then increasing to 301 ships in FY2039-FY2040. The plan would require an average of $15.9 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars, according to the Navy, while a Congressional Budget Office report estimates $19.0 billion per year. The attack submarine and cruiser-destroyer forces are projected to drop below required levels in the latter years of the plan. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan projects fleet growth from 284 ships in FY2011 to 320 ships in FY2024, dropping below 313 ships in FY2027, declining to 288 ships in FY2032-FY2033, and then increasing to 301 ships in FY2039-FY2040. The plan would require an average of $19.0 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars, about 18% more than Navy estimates. The CBO report warns that if the Navy continues to receive $15 billion annually for ship construction, it won't afford all purchases in the 2011 plan. Discussions on Navy's proposed FY2011 budget include issues with next-generation ballistic missile submarines. The Navy plans to procure SSBN(X) submarines as replacements for Ohio-class submarines. The program received significant funding in FY2010 and FY2011 budgets. The first SSBN(X) is expected to be procured in FY2019, with estimated costs of $6-7 billion each. The Navy's plan to procure SSBN(X) submarines as replacements for Ohio-class submarines could strain the affordability of its long-term shipbuilding program by limiting procurement rates for other ship classes during the 15-year period FY2019-FY2033. Options for reducing the cost of the SSBN(X) program or its impact on other Navy shipbuilding programs include procuring fewer submarines, carrying fewer ballistic missiles, designing a smaller missile, stretching out the procurement schedule, and using split funding. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. Congress supported this proposal and the budget also called for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. Additionally, the Navy's planned CG(X) cruiser program was proposed to be terminated as unaffordable. The Navy's proposed FY2011 budget includes ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. The planned CG(X) cruiser program is deemed unaffordable, leading to the proposal of building an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version, starting in FY2016. Flight III DDG-51s will carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) originally intended for the CG(X). The Navy's budget also includes $228.4 million for AMDR research and development. The Aegis ballistic missile defense program, carried out by the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy, aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by FY2015. Concerns have been raised about the growing demand for BMD-capable Aegis ships outpacing the supply, especially with plans to use them for defense in Europe. The Aegis BMD program aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships. Concerns have been raised about the growing demand for these ships outpacing the supply, potentially straining the Navy's ability to provide them for non-BMD missions. Funding for the program comes from MDA's budget, with additional funding from the Navy's budget for BMD-related efforts. The proposed FY2011 budget requested $2,161.6 million for the Aegis BMD program and $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. The FY2011 budget requested funding for the Aegis BMD program and Navy's proposal for the Flight III DDG-51 design. It also requested funds for two Littoral Combat Ships designed for shallow water operations with interchangeable weapons modules. The Navy planned to buy two different versions of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) before selecting one design to build most of the fleet. In 2009, the Navy accelerated its timetable to choose a single design for all LCSs procured in FY2010 and beyond. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over five years, with a rate of two ships per year. The Navy planned to buy two different versions of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) before selecting one design to build most of the fleet. In 2009, the Navy accelerated its timetable to choose a single design for all LCSs procured in FY2010 and beyond. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over five years, with a rate of two ships per year. Navy officials announced a new acquisition strategy to buy 10 ships from each of the competing industry teams. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps face a fighter aircraft shortage due to budget constraints and aging planes. Air Force projects a shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy expects a shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is crucial for DOD's plans to modernize tactical aircraft, with concerns about affordability and potential budget challenges. Congress and observers worry about insufficient funding for acquiring over 100 aircraft, possibly exceeding 200 by 2018. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is essential for DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans, with a total of 2,443 JSFs to be acquired at an estimated cost of over $300 billion. The program is the largest weapon procurement effort for DOD, with additional F-35s to be purchased by U.S. allies. The FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the F-35 program, including research and development funding for the Air Force and Navy. The F-35 program requires over $10 billion per year in acquisition funding as production increases, raising concerns about affordability and potential budgetary challenges for the DOD. The F-35, an affordable aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, is the most cost-effective strategy to avoid shortfalls. The British government plans to reduce their F-35 purchase from 138 to as few as 40, excluding the vertical-takeoff version. The U.S. Marine Corps has been purchasing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter powered by the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the alternative General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine program. Approximately $2.5 billion has been provided for the alternate engine program, with an estimated additional $2.9 billion needed for completion by 2017. The GAO expressed concerns in a letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman. In a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, the GAO stated that the DOD estimate for terminating the F136 alternate engine should be seen as one point in a range of possible costs. Critics argue that budget pressures, not long-term considerations, drove the termination. Some believe single-source engine contracts are the norm, while others point to cost savings and reliability from engine competition on the F-15 and F-16 programs. The cancellation of the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risk, impact on the defense industrial base, and efficiency in DOD's acquisition system. Single-source engine contracts are common, but some argue for cost savings and reliability through competition. The F136 engine development raises concerns about cost control and efficiency in DOD's acquisition system. It also raises issues regarding the impact on the F-35 acquisition program and the operational challenges of supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget includes funding for a new fleet of mid-air refueling tankers. In 2003, the Department of Defense sought to replace its aging fleet of KC-135 tankers with new KC-X mid-air refueling tankers. A competition between Boeing and a team of Northrop Grumman and EADS ensued, with a contract valued at $35 billion. Bidding closed in 2010 with three offerors submitting bids. The bidding for the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker contract closed in 2010 with three offerors submitting bids. Boeing and EADS were the main competitors, with Boeing ultimately winning the contract in 2011. The KC-X acquisition program, involving a lucrative tanker contract, generated significant interest due to its economic impact, job creation potential, and military importance. EADS decided not to challenge Boeing's win of the contract, ending a contentious process marked by previous failed attempts to acquire a new tanker. The history of these attempts is crucial in shaping the requirements and fairness of the new KC-X competition. The Obama Administration replaced the Bush Administration's plan for a land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic with the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA), deploying BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. Similar BMD capabilities could be pursued in other regions like the Middle East and Northeast Asia. The Obama Administration's Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for missile defense includes a $2.27 billion budget request in FY2011. This includes $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing is reduced by nearly 20% compared to FY2010. The FY2011 budget includes $2.7 billion for new facilities due to BRAC Commission moves, with most funding allocated in earlier budgets. Military family housing budget decreased from $2.3 billion in FY2010 to $1.8 billion in FY2011 due to privatization policy. Basic Allowance for Housing for personnel not in government housing has increased over the past decade. The increase in Basic Allowance for Housing for personnel not in government housing over the past decade is partly due to more service members paying rent to private landlords and a policy decision to cover a larger proportion of housing costs. The FY2011 DOD bills provided a vehicle for Members of Congress opposed to the Navy's plan to move one of the five nuclear powered aircraft carriers from Norfolk, VA to Mayport, FL. The DOD's final report on the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review endorses the Navy's desire to establish Mayport as a second homeport. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) supports the Navy's plan to establish Mayport as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port. This decision is driven by the need to mitigate risks and would involve constructing new nuclear support facilities in Mayport, Florida. The move would also shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport, potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Certain Members of Congress from Florida and Virginia have differing views on the proposal to homeport an aircraft carrier at Mayport. The Navy estimates the costs to be $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging. Members from Florida support the proposal citing benefits in mitigating risks to the Navy's Atlantic Fleet CVNs, while members from Virginia express skepticism or opposition. Certain Members of Congress from Virginia have expressed skepticism or opposition to the proposal to homeport an aircraft carrier at Mayport. They argue that the benefits in terms of mitigating risks to the Navy's Atlantic Fleet CVNs are questionable, and the funding could be better spent on other Navy priorities. The Administration's budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam for 8,000 Marines moving from Okinawa, following negotiations between the US, Japan, and DOD. Guam is a mountainous island with an area three times that of the District of Columbia and a population of about 178,000. The planned influx of military personnel, their families, DOD personnel, and supporting contractors could increase the population by as much as 56,000. Additionally, an estimated 25,000 temporary workers may be needed to build the planned facilities, amounting to 14% of the population. The planned influx of military personnel and supporting contractors could increase Guam's population by 56,000, with an additional 25,000 temporary workers needed for construction. Analysts question if Guam's infrastructure can support this surge. The Administration's budget supports the creation of USCYBERCOM to centralize command of DOD networks. The integration of offensive and defensive cyber operations under the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare marked a departure from historical segregation. In 2009, U.S. Cyber Command was established under U.S. Strategic Command for both offensive and defensive cyber operations. The National Security Agency director was nominated to lead the new command for offensive and defensive cyber operations, raising concerns about privacy and militarization of cyberspace. The centralized command aims to standardize DOD cyber practices and operations, focusing on defending DOD networks and providing support to civil authorities. The FY2011 budget request for Air Force Operations and Maintenance included $139 million for U.S. Cyber Command, an increase of $105 million from the previous year. The budget would fund temporary facilities at Ft. Meade, MD. The FY2011 DOD budget request aimed to \"rebalance\" the roles of DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance. The FY2011 NDAA legislation did not include two previously funded DOD programs. The FY2011 NDAA legislation does not include two programs previously funded by DOD, as the Administration requested these controversial items to be included in the Department of State budget. These programs are the \"Section 1207\" program and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. Additionally, in FY2012, the State Department will take responsibility for Iraq police training. The FY2011 NDAA legislation shifts funding for Iraqi police training from DOD to the Department of State, aiming to rebalance roles between the two departments. Despite this, some Pentagon officials suggest maintaining or expanding DOD's role in security assistance. The Administration is reviewing security assistance authorities, with the Senate Armed Services Committee welcoming the process. Secretary of Defense Gates highlighted advising foreign security forces as a key military mission. Secretary Gates emphasized the importance of the military's role in advising and training partner nations, aligning with recommendations from the Quadrennial Defense Review. Admiral Mullen also stressed the need to consider military power as a viable option alongside diplomacy. The Quadrennial Defense Review and Secretary Gates advocate for bolstering civilian capabilities to assist foreign governments in conflict prevention and recovery, emphasizing the integration of defense and diplomacy. The FY2011 DOD budget request maintains control over controversial security assistance programs. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for various security assistance programs, such as the Section 1206 program, Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program, Defense Institution Reform Initiative, and legal instruction for foreign military and government officials. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for security assistance programs, including the Stability Operations Fellowship Program ($5.0 million). Secretary Gates proposed a pooled fund for security assistance involving DOD, State, and USAID, but Congress has not yet acted on this suggestion. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act passed by the House authorizes $725.9 billion for DOD and defense-related activities, $2.7 million less than the Administration requested. The Senate version would authorize $725.7 billion, a reduction of $240.7 million from the Administration's request. The Senate did not act on this version partly due to opposition to a provision repealing a 1993 law. The Senate version of the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act, S. 3454, faced opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The bill was set aside after failing to invoke cloture, but a compromise version (H.R. 6523) was later passed without the controversial provision. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 6523, was signed into law on January 7, 2011, without the controversial provision to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The bill authorized lump-sum totals for various appropriations accounts without specific program allocations. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 6523, authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the active-duty components of the armed services, with a 1.4% increase in military basic pay. The final bill did not include provisions for a 1.9% raise as proposed in the House-passed bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives to recruit and retain highly qualified individuals into hard-to-fill specialties essential in wartime. The Senate committee directed the GAO to review DOD's process for identifying specialties for incentive offers and assess the accuracy of determining housing allowances for service members. The FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military. On May 27, 2011, the House passed an amendment to H.R. 5136 by Rep. Patrick Murphy to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military, contingent on completion of a DOD review and certification by key officials. The House bill included a provision on repealing the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military, focusing on effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention of the armed forces. The Senate also included a similar provision in S. 3454. Senator John McCain argued against Senate action on the bill, stating it was premature. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on a bill that did not include a provision to repeal a law prohibiting military facilities from performing abortions. The bill was criticized for being premature by Senator John McCain. The Senate committee provision to repeal a law prohibiting military facilities from performing abortions did not pass. The enacted version of the authorization bill did not include a House-passed provision for a pilot program allowing officers to pursue mid-career educational programs outside of their service. The final version of the bill includes provisions from a DOD commission on sexual assault in the military, establishing the director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office. The final version of the bill establishes the director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, requiring improved protocols for medical care of sexual assault victims in the military and ensuring access to victim advocates. Confidentiality of victims' communications with advocates, legal assistance, and a hotline are not included in the bill. The bill, H.R. 6523, would authorize the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program, without including increases in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. It also requires the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the feasibility of providing legal assistance to sexual assault victims from military legal counsel. The House-passed H.R. 5136, the Senate Armed Services Committee's S. 3454, and the final enacted version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) all include provisions prohibiting increases in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. TRICARE beneficiaries can now extend coverage to dependent children up to age 26, similar to private health insurance programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The enacted reform bill in April 2010 did not include a provision for a unified medical command under the Defense Health Agency. H.R. 6523 included a requirement for proper documentation of training programs for officers in the medical corps in response to an incident at Fort Hood. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions related to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock, AR in 2009. The House provision not included in the final bill would have provided special compensation to persons killed. The final bill did not include provisions for special compensation for individuals killed or wounded in incidents targeting service members or DOD civilians. It also did not allocate funds for implementing recommendations from a panel analyzing the Fort Hood incident. Both the House and Senate committee supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense. The Senate committee supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense activities, authorizing slightly more than the $10.3 billion requested. Both bills added funds for missile defense, with H.R. 5136 adding $361.6 million and S. 3454 adding $349.1 million. H.R. 6523 specifically authorized $205 million for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells. The bill H.R. 6523 authorized funds for missile defense programs, including $205 million for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system. However, specific allocations for other programs were not detailed in the bill. Funding levels for missile defense programs were outlined in previous bills H.R. 5136 and S. 3454. H.R. 6523 affirms that the New START treaty with Russia does not restrict U.S. missile defense programs. The Administration's plan for defending Europe against ballistic missiles has faced criticism from Russian sources. $2.27 billion was requested in FY2011 for the \"Phased Adaptive Approach\" for Europe's defense, with $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for Aegis ship-borne systems. The final version of the authorization bill requires a DOD report on the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) and places restrictions on the deployment of missile defense systems in Europe until certain conditions are met. The final version of the bill includes restrictions on missile defense system deployment in Europe until certain conditions are met, with provisions for the Secretary of Defense to waive them in the interest of national security. It also authorizes the establishment of a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic. The final version of the authorization bill in May 2010 included statements on missile defense, such as intercepting Iranian ICBMs, developing ground-based interceptors, and maintaining strategic stability with Russia. The final version of the authorization bill in May 2010 did not include provisions from the House bill that would have restricted the reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons below New START Treaty limits until a joint report was submitted to Congress. It also criticized the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review for weakening U.S. security by ruling out the use of nuclear weapons in response to a non-nuclear attack on the United States. The final version of the authorization bill approved $15.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two Littoral Combat Ships, and other vessels. The authorization bill approved $15.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for a research ship, nuclear-powered aircraft carrier U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford, LHA-class helicopter carrier, and refueling of U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. Incremental funding is common for expensive ships, but it is unusual in the congressional appropriations process. H.R. 6523 includes provisions for incremental funding of a helicopter carrier over two years and a report on the Navy's shipbuilding requirements impacted by using cruisers and destroyers with the Aegis anti-missile system for ballistic missile defense. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions to prevent a decline in the size of the fleet, such as blocking the retirement of two large helicopter carriers and limiting the Navy's ship retirements until the fleet reaches a certain size. The Senate committee expressed concerns about the Navy's shipbuilding schedule not meeting the goal of 313 ships and directed assessments on the impact of the plan on the Marine Corps's amphibious operations. The Senate committee raised concerns about the Navy's shipbuilding plan not meeting the goal of 313 ships. They also questioned the feasibility of the Navy's plan to replace Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with a new class of submarines. The new SSBN(X) ships are expected to absorb a large share of the Navy's shipbuilding budgets after 2016, potentially impacting the construction of other planned ships. The final version of the authorization bill approved a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without specifying funding for specific programs. The House-passed provision would have limited Navy spending on the C-17 cargo jet until a report is submitted. Congress added funds to continue C-17 production despite objections from past administrations. The Administration warned of a veto for any bill funding additional C-17s. The Armed Services committees criticized cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike program. The Senate and House services committees criticized cost overruns and delays in the F-35 program. The authorization bill required DOD to create a detailed progress plan. The final bill did not include a House provision to limit F-35 procurement until cost and performance milestones were met. Both versions of the bill authorized $11 billion for F-35 development and 42 plane purchases. The House and Senate bills authorized $11 billion for F-35 development and 42 plane purchases. The House bill rejected a request for an additional F-35, while adding $485 million for an alternate jet engine. The Senate committee's bill did not provide extra funds for a second engine for the F-35. The final bill did not take a specific stance on additional funding for the alternate engine. Secretary Gates reaffirmed his position on the project during a Pentagon press conference on May 20, 2010. In a May 20, 2010, Pentagon press conference, Secretary Gates reiterated his intention to recommend a veto on any defense bill funding the alternate F-35 engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees are concerned about delays in the F-35 program leading to a drop in carrier-borne fighters due to the retirement of older F/A-18s before their replacements are ready. To address this \"strike fighter gap,\" the House passed measures. The House and Senate are addressing the \"strike fighter gap\" by adding funding for additional F/A-18E/F model fighters. The enacted bill does not specify the number of planes authorized. The Navy is required to report to Congress on dealing with the projected gap by extending the service life of current F/A-18s or reducing the number of planes in certain squadrons. The House and Senate are addressing the \"strike fighter gap\" by adding funding for additional F/A-18E/F model fighters. The House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills would authorize $863.9 million for the development of the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker. EADS proposed a tanker based on its Airbus A-330 to compete with Boeing's bid based on its 767 jetliner. The House adopted an amendment requiring DOD to consider any unfair competitive advantage in tanker bids and report to Congress. The House and Senate addressed the \"strike fighter gap\" by adding funding for additional F/A-18E/F model fighters. EADS proposed a tanker based on its Airbus A-330 to compete with Boeing's bid based on its 767 jetliner. An amendment requiring DOD to consider any unfair competitive advantage in tanker bids was not included in H.R. 6523. DOD selected Boeing's tanker design, the KC-46A, and EADS decided not to challenge the selection. EADS decided not to challenge Boeing's selection for the tanker bid. Both House and Senate versions of the authorization bill would deny funding for part of the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which was the successor to the terminated Future Combat Systems program. The authorization bill would also deny funding for the Non-Line of Sight missile. The House and Senate bills would have denied funding for the Non-Line of Sight (N-LOS) missile program and trimmed back the Army's Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Modernization request. The enacted authorization did not specify funding for the BCT program, but both bills would have authorized the $934.4 million requested for the BCT Modernization program. The House Armed Services Committee recommended a less ambitious approach for the new Ground Combat Vehicles (GCV) program, focusing on basic requirements and potential upgrades. They suggested the Army consider upgrading current combat vehicles to meet GCV needs and included a provision in the bill to limit spending until detailed plans are provided. The House Armed Services Committee recommended a less ambitious approach for the new Ground Combat Vehicles (GCV) program, focusing on basic requirements and potential upgrades. DOD reduced its FY2011 GCV funding request to $461 million, which was fully funded in the enacted version of the authorization bill. The bill did not include a provision to bar funds for planning and designing structures at the Naval Station in Mayport, FL for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The House Armed Services Committee directed the GAO to assess the costs of homeporting a carrier in Mayport, FL. H.R. 6523 authorized $176.0 billion for military construction on Guam, with reductions in funding for Marine Corps units redeployment. The final bill approved funds for improving access roads and wharves in Guam but denied funding for a Marine base and facilities for Marine aviation squadrons. It also did not authorize $70.0 million for replacing Guam's military hospital but approved $50.3 million for Air Force projects and $19.0 million for a new National Guard Readiness Center. The final version of the bill did not include a House provision for transferring up to $500 million of DOD funds to Guam. H.R. 6523 requires reports on military facilities and civil infrastructure improvements needed for force redeployment. The final version of H.R. 6523 prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. territory or foreign governments without meeting certain conditions. It also addresses the need for civil infrastructure improvements to accommodate the increase in population due to re-stationed combat forces and construction workers. The final version of H.R. 6523 prohibits transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees without meeting conditions. It also restricts funds for building detainee facilities elsewhere and requires a report on transfer costs and risks. The Administration's DOD appropriations request for FY2011 for the \"Global Train and Equip\" program was $489.5 million, exceeding the $350 million annual limit set by existing law. The House-passed authorization bill aimed to increase the funding ceiling to $500 million, extend program authorization through FY2012, and allocate $75 million to build counterterrorism forces in Yemen. The House-passed authorization bill aimed to increase the funding ceiling for the \"Global Train and Equip\" program to $500 million, extend program authorization through FY2012, and allocate $75 million to build counterterrorism forces in Yemen, contingent on certification by the Secretary of State. The Senate committee-reported bill aimed to designate Yemen as a \"strategic partner\" in combating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. It proposed expanding the Section 1206 program to include support for police agencies, with a $350 million funding cap. Additionally, a separate authority for the Secretary of Defense to provide up to $75 million in assistance was suggested. The final version of the authorization bill authorizes an additional $75 million in assistance to the Yemen Ministry of the Interior counterterrorism unit for operations against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. This funding does not exceed the $350 million ceiling on Section 1206 funding as requested by the Administration. The Senate committee bill authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use up to $150 million of Army funds for the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations in Afghanistan to link military operations with economic elements to reduce violence and restore economic normalcy through strategic business activities. The final version of H.R. 6523 includes provisions related to cybersecurity, directing the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on cyber warfare policy, develop an acquisition process for cyberspace, and implement continuous monitoring of DOD computer systems. The final version of the authorization bill requires the Secretary of Defense to continuously monitor DOD computer networks for security and FISMA compliance, report annually to Congress on cyber attack damages and assess U.S. cyberwar capabilities compared to potential adversaries. The House and Senate did not agree on a FY2011 budget resolution, leading to committees operating under spending caps adopted through other procedures. The House and Senate did not agree on a FY2011 budget resolution, leading to committees operating under spending caps adopted through other procedures. On July 1, 2010, the House adopted a one-year cap on discretionary spending (H.Res. 1493) which the House Appropriations Committee used as the basis for setting 302(b) allocations for each of its subcommittees (H.Rept. 111-565). The Defense Subcommittee received an allocation of $523.9 billion, $7 billion less than the Administration's request for DOD base budget programs. The Senate did not adopt an overall ceiling on FY2011 discretionary spending. The Senate did not adopt an overall ceiling on FY2011 discretionary spending, unlike the House. The Senate Appropriations Committee set \"discretionary guidance\" for subcommittees, with the Defense Subcommittee allocated $522.8 billion, $8.1 billion less than the President's request. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee approved a bill for $671.0 billion, with $513.3 billion for the base budget, a reduction of $7.0 billion from the President's request. The Defense Subcommittee's bill would appropriate $513.3 billion, a reduction of $7.0 billion from the President's request, with $157.7 billion allocated for war costs. The text of the bill and detailed recommendations were not made public, only a summary table and Member earmarks were provided. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 DOD Appropriations bill (S. 3800) with a total of $669.9 billion, including $512.2 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. This bill represented a reduction of $8.10 billion to the President's base budget request and a reduction of $254 million to the request for war costs. DOD was funded through mid-April 2011 by short-term continuing resolutions as an appropriations bill had not been enacted by the start of the fiscal year on October 1, 2010. The House passed bill H.R. 1 to fund federal agencies through FY2011 with $505.2 billion for defense. The Senate debated the bill but it was laid aside on March 9, 2011. The Senate rejected an alternative funding measure by a vote of 42-58, offered by Senator Inouye, which would have provided $503.1 billion for base budget programs. The President signed an omnibus funding bill for the balance of FY2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) on April 15, 2011, incorporating a detailed DOD appropriations bill with similar provisions to the Inouye amendment. H.R. 1473 provided a total of $502.4 billion for the base. The Inouye amendment to H.R. 1 reduced the total DOD funding to $502.4 billion, including military construction and war costs, which was $20.1 billion less than the President's request for FY2011. The reductions in H.R. 1473 were applied to broad spending categories rather than specific areas. The President's request in H.R. 1473 included cuts to DOD funds from prior years, reductions in various program budgets, and cuts to civilian pay and research and development corporations. These cuts were partially offset by additional funds added to the request in some instances. The defense appropriations bill for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 included a total of 5,927 earmarks. Some of the larger additions to the budget request were $495.0 million for Navy strike fighters, $1.38 billion for National Guard equipment, $661.7 million for medical research programs, and $293.2 million for Israeli missile defense. The defense appropriations bill for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 included various earmarks, such as $495.0 million for Navy strike fighters, $1.38 billion for National Guard equipment, $661.7 million for medical research programs, and $293.2 million for Israeli missile defense systems. Additionally, $523.0 million was added to fund innovative research and procurement projects, but no funds were allocated for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The bill lacked an explanatory statement, leaving only brief descriptions in the funding tables for insight into the changes made to the budget request. The House Rules Committee posted funding tables for the defense appropriations bill, which included a 1.4% military pay raise and $162 million for the MyCAA tuition assistance program for military spouses. The Senate committee bill proposed adding $447.0 million to the Defense Health Program. The Defense Health Program saw a net increase in funding, with significant additions for research and development programs focused on breast cancer, psychological health, and traumatic brain injury, as well as cuts to the deployment of THAAD missiles. Additionally, the bill included funding to accelerate production of the Israeli Iron Dome system. The bill provided $205 million to accelerate production of the Israeli Iron Dome system, intended for intercepting short-range rockets and artillery shells. President Obama requested the funds in May 2010, not included in the original DOD budget request for FY2011. For more details on missile defense funding in H.R. 1473, refer to Table A-3 in the Appendix. The bill reduced funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters by $1.38 billion and cut $325.0 million from the development of a mid-air refueling tanker. The winning bidder for the tanker project would be chosen in March 2011, making it unlikely for the budgeted amount to be spent in FY2011. The bill denied funding for the Non-Line of Sight Missile and cut funding for the Ground Combat Vehicle program. The Army cancelled the competition for the new Bradley armored troop carrier design on August 25, 2010, and revised the performance specifications. The GCV competition was restarted on November 30, 2010."
