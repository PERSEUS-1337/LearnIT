Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to establish an Emergency Preparedness Demonstration Program to assist disadvantaged communities. The Director will establish an emergency preparedness demonstration program to help disadvantaged communities improve their capacity for emergency programs through grants or contracts with eligible nonprofit organizations. These organizations can use the funding to research and raise awareness about emergency preparedness in households of disadvantaged individuals in urban and rural areas. The program aims to assist disadvantaged communities in urban and rural areas affected by disasters by promoting emergency preparedness education programs and developing culturally competent materials for awareness. Eligible organizations can receive grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to support these initiatives. Nonprofit organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code can be awarded grants for programs serving disadvantaged communities. Recipients must demonstrate a partnership with a disadvantaged business enterprise and use funds solely for program-related purposes. The grant funds can be used to acquire professional services for research in disadvantaged communities, develop informational materials for emergency preparedness awareness, and establish consortia with national organizations and institutions serving disadvantaged individuals. The grant funds can be used to implement joint projects with institutions serving disadvantaged individuals, including part B institutions, institutions described in specific sections of the Higher Education Act of 1965, and Hispanic-serving institutions. To be eligible for funding under this section, organizations must submit an application to the Director with required information. Definitions include 'disadvantaged business enterprise' as a business entity. A disadvantaged business enterprise is owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals. A disadvantaged community is predominantly populated by disadvantaged individuals. A disadvantaged individual is socially or economically disadvantaged as defined by the Small Business Act. HUBZone has a specific meaning under the Small Business Act. Authorization of Appropriation is granted for fiscal years 2004 through 2007 to carry out the provisions of the Small Business Act."
