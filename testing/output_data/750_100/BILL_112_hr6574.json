    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Servicemember Mental Health Review Act\" and includes findings related to mental health. Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans are then restricted from receiving various disability benefits, making it difficult for them to find employment. The Government Accountability Office found low regulatory compliance in separating Armed Forces members with adjustment disorders. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is needed to ensure veterans are not wrongly separated on this basis. The Government Accountability Office found low compliance in separating Armed Forces members with adjustment disorders. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is necessary to prevent wrongful separation of veterans and ensure access to disability benefits and employment opportunities. The Department of Defense will review military separations based on mental conditions that do not amount to disability. The Department of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within each military department to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review consists of at least five members, including a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist. Each military department will provide administrative and behavioral health support staff for the board. Covered individuals are current and former armed forces members. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is composed of licensed psychologists and psychiatrists, with administrative and behavioral health support staff provided by each military department. Covered individuals are current and former armed forces members who have been separated due to mental conditions. The Secretary of Defense ensures that these individuals are notified of their right to a review by the board. The Secretary of the military department is responsible for notifying covered individuals from the armed forces about their right to request a review by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review. If notification is not received, the individual or their representative can file a request for review. The Secretary of Defense oversees compliance with this notification requirement and reports any failures to Congress. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review reviews the separation of covered individuals from the armed forces. Covered individuals have the right to obtain private counsel for representation during the review process. The Board reviews the findings of psychologists or psychiatrists for each individual. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review evaluates the separation of covered individuals from the military based on psychologist or psychiatrist findings, the decisions of the separation authority, and compliance with separation processes. The review considers records from the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, along with additional evidence presented to the Board. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review considers all evidence, including private mental health records, when evaluating the separation of covered individuals from the military. If the Board proposes a review, consent must be obtained from the covered individual or their representative before proceeding. After completing the review, the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review must provide the claimant with a statement of reasons for their decision. The covered individual can request a reconsideration if new evidence is available. The Board may make recommendations based on its findings. The Board of Review may recommend to the military department concerning a covered individual: \n1. No negative recharacterization or modification of disability rating.\n2. Recharacterization to retirement for disability.\n3. Recharacterization to separation for disability with entitlement to receive severance pay. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review may recommend recharacterization of separation for covered individuals to retirement for disability, separation with severance pay, or separation for convenience of the Government. If a recharacterization to retirement for disability is not recommended, a brief statement of reasons must be provided. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review may recommend correction of military records for covered individuals, effective as of the date of separation. Recommendations and statements will be mailed to the individual or their representative. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend corrections to military records for covered individuals, with adjustments made for any previous lump-sum payments received at separation. This process is governed by regulations set by the Secretary of Defense. The regulations specify deadlines for reviews required by this section. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the chapter. The Secretary of Defense must establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within 90 days of the Act's enactment, as per section 1554b of title 10, United States Code. Regulations for this section must also be prescribed."
