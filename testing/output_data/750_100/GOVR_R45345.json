The key difference for IC whistleblowers is the need to protect classified information. Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) involves reporting violations of law, mismanagement, waste of resources, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. Whistleblower protections in the IC are extended only to those who make lawful disclosures, not covering leaks to the media or foreign governments. The protections do not apply to differences of opinion unless there is a reasonable concern. Whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) do not cover leaks to the media or foreign governments, and do not apply to differences of opinion unless there is a reasonable concern over legality or constitutionality. Protected disclosures can be made following defined procedures that ensure the security of classified information, as outlined in the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) whistleblowing policy and guidance. The Intelligence Community (IC) whistleblower protections, including for contractors, Armed Forces members, and federal employees, have evolved to address gaps in protection against reprisal. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) of 1998 established a process for IC whistleblowers to make complaints. Concerns remain about the transparency of internal processes and adequacy of protections for IC contractors. The Intelligence Community whistleblower protections have evolved over time to address gaps in protection against reprisal. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 and Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19 provided specific protections for IC whistleblowers, with the latter codified in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 and implemented through Intelligence Community Directive (ICD)-120. The Intelligence Community whistleblower protections have evolved over time to address gaps in protection against reprisal. The IC established a PPD-19 implementation policy, and whistleblower protections for members of the Armed Forces assigned to elements of the IC are provided under 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034. DOD Directive 7050.06 outlines implementing guidance for Section 1034. Congress passed P.L. 115-118 in January 2018, amending the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to include provisions for IC contractors. The ICWPA was created in 1998 to assist whistleblowers in the IC excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) was created in 1998 to assist whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community who are excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. It amended previous acts of Congress to enable IC government employees or contractors to report complaints or information to the Inspector General of their agency. This provision was added to ensure the flow of information needed by intelligence committees for oversight. The ICWPA defines formal processes for submitting complaints to protect classified information. The IG must report credible complaints to the CIA Director or agency head, who then reports to congressional intelligence committees. If the IG fails to report accurately, employees or contractors can directly submit complaints to Congress after notifying the IG. The ICWPA provides a process for IC whistleblowers to report complaints to Congress via the relevant IC agency IG, with no specific provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal. The IAA for FY2010 included the first general provisions for whistleblower protection as part of legislation establishing the OIGIC. The Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC), led by the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (IGIC), was established under the IAA for FY2010. Section 103H of the National Security Act of 1947 allowed lawful disclosures to the IGIC for investigating violations of laws, rules, or regulations within the Director of National Intelligence's authorities and responsibilities. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community investigates complaints of violations of laws, rules, or regulations within the Director of National Intelligence's responsibilities. Employee identities are kept confidential unless unavoidable during the investigation or disclosed to the Department of Justice. No reprisals are allowed against whistleblowers. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community investigates complaints of violations of laws, rules, or regulations within the Director of National Intelligence's responsibilities. No reprisals are allowed against whistleblowers, whether federal employees or contractors of IC elements. Employees of the intelligence community, including contractors, can report complaints or information to the Inspector General without fear of reprisal. Protections against reprisals for lawful disclosures to the CIA Inspector General were clarified by Section 425(d) of the IAA for FY2010. PPD-19, signed by President Obama, aims to protect whistleblowers with access to classified information. PPD-19, signed by President Obama on October 10, 2012, provides protections for intelligence community employees with access to classified information, safeguarding them from reprisals for lawful disclosures made to specific authorities. PPD-19 protects intelligence community employees who make lawful disclosures to specific authorities from reprisals that could affect their access to classified information or result in personnel actions. PPD-19 protects IC employees who make lawful disclosures from reprisals. The process includes a review by the IC element Inspector General to determine if a personnel action was in reprisal. The IG makes recommendations for corrective action, which the agency head must consider. The agency head is not required to accept the Inspector General's recommendations for corrective action. IC agencies must certify to the DNI that they have a review process allowing employees to appeal actions related to access to classified information without fear of retaliation. PPD-19 allows whistleblowers to request an external review by an IG panel chaired by the IGIC if the agency review process is exhausted. If the panel rules in favor of the employee, the agency must consider the panel's recommendations. The IGIC must report annually to congressional intelligence committees on determinations and recommendations, as well as IC element head responses. PDD-19 mandates training for employees with access to classified information on whistleblower protections. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA provides statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against reprisal actions. IC whistleblowers are protected from reprisal for lawful disclosures to designated individuals or entities, including the Director of National Intelligence, Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, and congressional intelligence committees. Section 601 of Title VI provides these protections without specific mention of safeguards. Section 601 of Title VI protects IC whistleblowers from reprisal for lawful disclosures to designated individuals or entities, while Section 602 provides protections against retaliatory revocation of security clearance for government employee whistleblowers. ICD-120, Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection, provides guidance for protecting whistleblowers in the government from reprisal, including retaining current employment status pending appeal. It does not allow for judicial review or private right of action and does not mention contractors. Protections under ICD-120 include safeguards against reprisal for whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community, allowing for appeals on security clearance decisions and maintaining employment status during the process. This provision covers IC employees, contractors, and members of the Armed Forces. The whistleblower protection provisions in ICD-120 include safeguards against reprisal, allowing for appeals and maintaining employment status. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code also provides protections for members of the Armed Forces against retaliation for protected communications. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code does not address protection of classified information in making protected communications by members of the Armed Forces. It allows communication with various entities but lacks specifics on protecting classified information. The curr_chunk discusses the protection of Armed Forces members making protected communications, specifying prohibited personnel actions and enabling the DOD to mitigate hardship. It also mandates periodic updates during investigations and prescribes standards for investigations and training for Inspectors General staff. The curr_chunk discusses inconsistencies in whistleblower protection for contractors in the intelligence community, with efforts in Congress to address the gap in coverage. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 in response to gaps in protections for IC contractors under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The bill aimed to safeguard IC employees from retaliation for making protected disclosures, including a process for lodging complaints. On March 18, 2015, Senator McCaskill introduced S. 794 to extend protections for contractor employees on contracts with IC elements who make whistleblower complaints. The bill did not progress further. In January 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118 amending the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act to provide protections for IC contractor employees. Section 1104 of the National Security Act of 1947 amended existing whistleblower protections to enable IC contractors to make lawful disclosures to designated individuals or entities, providing unambiguous protections for IC contractors similar to those for IC employees under Title VI of the IAA for FY2014. Section 110 provides clear protections for IC contractors who make lawful complaints against retaliatory personnel actions, covering a wide range of issues including violations of federal laws, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, and abuse of authority. Section 110 of the DOD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2015 provides protections for IC contractors who make lawful whistleblower disclosures against retaliatory actions, including violations of federal laws, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, and abuse of authority. These protections extend to contractors of the FBI and the Intelligence Branch, similar to protections for IC employees under Title 50, U.S. Code. The DOD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (H.R. 4870) redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC. The funds supported hiring investigators and support staff to enhance the IGIC's ability to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse, addressing an underfunded capability for responsive follow-up on whistleblower complaints."
