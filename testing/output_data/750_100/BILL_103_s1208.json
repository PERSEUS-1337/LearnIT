    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Independence Hall Commemorative Coin Act\". The Congress finds that historic buildings in Philadelphia, including Congress Hall and Independence Hall, were cared for by local government units before the Federal Government took over. The Federal Government, through the National Park Service, now maintains historic sites like Congress Hall and Independence Hall in Philadelphia. Financial constraints have hindered the government from meeting the capital needs of these sites. Minting a commemorative coin is proposed to help fund the preservation and maintenance of these historic buildings. The proposed solution to fund the preservation of historic buildings like Congress Hall and Independence Hall in Philadelphia is to mint a commemorative coin. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue up to 1,000,000 $1 silver coins with a specific weight, diameter, and composition. The design of the coins will feature the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, symbolizing national shrines of liberty. Each coin will display its value and inscriptions. The $1 silver coins issued by the Secretary of the Treasury will have a design featuring the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, with inscriptions including the year \"1994\", \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The coins will be legal tender as per section 5103 of title 31, United States Code. The Secretary will obtain silver for the coins from stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. The design for the coins will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. SEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF THE COINS. The coins authorized under this Act may be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single Mint facility for up to one year after enactment. SEC. 7. SALE OF THE COINS. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value, a surcharge, and the cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a discount as well. A surcharge of $7 per coin is required for all sales. SEC. 8. General waiver of procurement regulations for goods or services needed for this Act. Compliance with equal employment opportunity laws is still required for contracts under this Act. SEC. 9. Distribution of surcharges. The Secretary collects surcharges from coin sales under this Act. 50% goes to the Treasury to reduce the national debt, and 50% goes to the Independence Hall Preservation Fund for capital improvements and other needs at Independence National Historic Park. The Independence Hall Preservation Fund uses surcharges from coin sales to meet various needs deemed appropriate by the Directors, fostering respect for Independence National Historic Park. SEC. 10.
