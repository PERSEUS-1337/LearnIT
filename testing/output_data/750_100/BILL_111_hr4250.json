    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and purpose. The \"Medicaid DSH Integrity Act\" serves as a critical funding source for safety net hospitals providing care to the poor and uninsured. Reporting and auditing requirements added in 2003 ensure transparency in DSH fund utilization. The Medicaid DSH funds are used to assist hospitals serving low-income individuals. Changes in auditing regulations have narrowed the scope of DSH payments for many States, without altering the definition of DSH-eligible. The Congress did not intend to change the definition of DSH-eligible costs or limit DSH payments under the existing program. New regulations could reduce DSH payments to safety net providers by millions of dollars. SEC. 2. REVISION OF MEDICAID DSH AUDITING AND REPORTING REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with States and disproportionate share hospitals, will not enforce changes in policy related to the calculation of limits under the Medicaid DSH program. An interim final rule will be published to revise the auditing and reporting regulations. The new interim final rule will revise Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations to correct policy changes, provide guidance for implementation, and include regulatory changes described in subsection (b) of the Code of Federal Regulations. The new interim final rule will include regulatory changes related to defining costs of services for individuals with no health insurance and clarifying that nominal payments do not constitute health insurance or third-party coverage. CMS allows States to use their own definition of allowable costs in their Medicaid plan as long as it does not exceed Medicare principles. The audit requirement for inpatient and outpatient hospital services will be interpreted consistently. CMS will revise the General DSH Audit and Reporting Protocol to allow the use of overall or departmental cost-to-charge ratios. Section 455.304(d)(2) of title 42 will also be revised. CMS will revise section 455.304(d)(2) of title 42 to allow alternative methodologies for determining actual costs, including trending forward costs from prior years. Additionally, the amendment to section 1923(j) of the Social Security Act will change the effective date to 2008. The Act defines key terms such as CMS, Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations, Medicaid DSH program, and Secretary."
