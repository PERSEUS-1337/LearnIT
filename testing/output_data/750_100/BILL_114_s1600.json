    "content": "The \"Judicial Redress Act of 2015\" extends Privacy Act remedies to citizens of designated countries. The \"Judicial Redress Act of 2015\" allows covered persons to bring civil actions against agencies for violations of covered records, with remedies similar to those under the Privacy Act. The \"Judicial Redress Act of 2015\" allows covered persons to bring civil actions against designated Federal agencies for violations of covered records under title 5, United States Code. The remedies available under this section are exclusive, and covered persons have the same rights and limitations as individuals under the Privacy Act when pursuing civil remedies. The Attorney General, in agreement with other key officials, can designate a foreign country as a \"covered country\" for civil remedies under the Judicial Redress Act of 2015. The United States has entered into an agreement with a foreign country that provides privacy protections for information shared to prevent criminal offenses. The Attorney General can designate a country that effectively shares information for the same purpose. The Attorney General can revoke the designation of a foreign country as a \"covered country\" if it is not complying with the agreement on sharing information to prevent criminal offenses. The Attorney General determines if an agency is a designated Federal agency for information transfer purposes. The Attorney General can only designate the Department of Justice or its components without the head of the relevant agency's approval. The Attorney General may designate an agency as a \"designated Federal agency or component\" for information exchange with a covered country. The Attorney General can designate a country or regional economic organization as a \"covered country\" for information exchange if it is in the law enforcement interests of the United States. The determinations made by the Attorney General must be published in the Federal Register and are nonreviewable. The Attorney General designates \"covered countries\" for information exchange in the interest of US law enforcement. Determinations made are published and not subject to review. The US District Court in DC has exclusive jurisdiction over claims under this section. Definitions include \"agency\" and \"covered country.\" The term \"covered person\" refers to a non-individual citizen of a covered country, and \"covered record\" has the same meaning as a record under section 552a of title 5, once transferred by a public authority or private entity within a country or regional economic organization. The term \"individual\" in this context refers to a person as defined in section 552a(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code. A designated Federal agency or component is a federal agency designated under subsection (e) for the purpose of preventing, investigating, detecting, or prosecuting criminal offenses. The Act preserves privileges and does not require disclosure of classified information. The district court can review agency submissions in camera and ex parte. The Act will take effect 90 days after enactment."
