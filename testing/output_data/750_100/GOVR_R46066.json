Commitment to NATO's mission in Afghanistan and counterterrorism was also renewed. NATO officials highlighted the alliance's achievements and the importance of strong U.S.-European relations. The United States has been the driving force behind NATO since its creation in 1949, evolving from a defense organization focused on deterring the Soviet Union to a globally engaged security alliance. The leaders also agreed to assess China's impact on NATO and transatlantic security, and to initiate a new reflection process to strengthen NATO's political dimension. The London meeting highlighted the importance of strong U.S.-European relations within NATO. Some European allies question the Trump Administration's commitment to NATO and criticize its unilateral approach to foreign policy issues. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg acknowledges tensions within the alliance but emphasizes continued transatlantic cooperation. The Trump Administration affirms commitment to NATO and highlights increased funding for U.S. force presence. At the London meeting, NATO leaders emphasized commitment to increasing defense spending and readiness, including declaring space as an operational domain. They also reaffirmed support for NATO's mission in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts. Critics attribute funding increases to renewed Russian aggression. NATO leaders reinforced their commitment to ongoing missions in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts. They also discussed the implications of China's growing investment in Europe. Efforts to renew NATO's focus on territorial defense and deter Russian aggression have included deploying troops to Baltic States and Poland, increasing military exercises in Central and Eastern Europe, and establishing new NATO command structures. In London, NATO allies announced progress on initiatives to enhance readiness, including the Four-Thirties Readiness Initiative proposed by the US in 2018. This initiative aims to have 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons, and 30 naval combat vessels ready for use within 30 days by the end of 2019. Some analysts question the effectiveness of NATO deterrence initiatives. Some analysts question the effectiveness and sustainability of NATO deterrence initiatives. Allies like Poland and the Baltic States urge more forces deployment for deterrence, while others like Germany, Italy, and France emphasize a dual-track approach combining deterrence with dialogue. Allies advocate for a dual-track approach to Russia, combining deterrence with dialogue. Concerns about violating the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act limit permanent troop deployments in NATO countries post-Soviet Union. Progress in cyber defense and space declared as new operational domain in London. NATO has formally declared space as a new operational domain and has taken measures to protect NATO networks from cyberattacks. They have established Cyber Rapid Reaction Teams and announced plans for a new NATO Cyberspace Operations Center in Brussels to integrate allies' national cyber capabilities into NATO missions. The new NATO Cyberspace Operations Center in Brussels integrates allies' national cyber capabilities into NATO missions, focusing on incorporating cyber defense into all levels of planning and operations. NATO also aims to counter hybrid warfare threats through enhancing strategic communications, developing exercise scenarios, and coordinating with the EU. NATO leaders agreed to establish counter-hybrid support teams to assist allies in preparing against and responding to hybrid threats. NATO deployed teams to assist allies in countering hybrid activities, with a focus on enhancing telecommunications infrastructure resilience and declaring space as an operational domain. This reflects NATO's consensus to strengthen defense and deterrence in all areas, including space. NATO aims to strengthen defense and deterrence in all areas, including space, where allies own about half of the estimated 2,000 satellites in orbit. Stoltenberg emphasizes a defensive approach in line with international law, ruling out weapon deployment in space. Concerns arise over China's reaction to NATO's declaration. The Trump Administration pushes allies to increase defense budgets to ensure equitable distribution of responsibilities within the alliance. President Trump has pushed for increased defense spending by European allies in NATO over the past five years to ensure equitable distribution of responsibilities within the alliance. Critics worry that his criticism of insufficient defense spending could harm NATO cohesion and credibility. NATO members informally agreed in 2006 to allocate at least 2% of GDP to national defense budgets. NATO allies agreed in 2014 to allocate 2% of GDP to defense budgets annually and 20% to procurement and research. European allies and Canada have increased defense spending by $130 billion since 2014, with a projected rise to $400 billion by 2024. Since 2014, NATO allies have increased defense spending, with a projected rise to $400 billion by 2024. In 2019, 9 allies are expected to meet the 2% guideline, and 16 allies are expected to meet the 20% benchmark for spending on major equipment. President Trump criticizes NATO members for not reaching defense-spending targets, including Germany, which currently spends 1.38% of GDP on defense and plans to reach 1.5% by 2024. Many, including Germany, argue that allied contributions to NATO missions and military capabilities are as crucial as defense spending levels. It is suggested that a focus on defense outputs, such as military capabilities and effectiveness, should be prioritized over defense inputs like budget size. The alliance's target is for each member to allocate at least 20% of their national defense expenditure to new equipment and research. Secretary General Stoltenberg emphasizes a broad approach to measuring contributions, including \"cash, capabilities, and contributions.\" This approach considers factors beyond the 2% of GDP defense spending metric to align with NATO's strategic objectives. In London, allied leaders approved a U.S. proposal to adjust contributions to NATO's common funds, with the U.S. and Germany seeing changes in their shares. The U.S. share of NATO's common-funded budgets was about 22% in 2018, followed by Germany, France, and the UK. The approved proposal aims to reallocate contributions to better align with NATO's strategic objectives. In London, allied leaders approved a U.S. proposal to adjust contributions to NATO's common funds. The U.S. and Germany would each have about 16% share, aligning with NATO's strategic objectives. The allies renewed commitment to NATO's training mission in Afghanistan, despite speculation of U.S. forces drawdown. NATO launched the Resolute Support Mission in 2015 to assist Afghan security forces, with troop levels steadily increasing. As of February 2020, about 8,500 troops contributing to RSM were from NATO members and partner countries. NATO allies, including the United States, Germany, the UK, Italy, Georgia, and Romania, contributed troops to the Resolute Support Mission (RSM) in Afghanistan. NATO leaders welcomed agreements between the United States and Afghanistan, as well as the United States and the Taliban, for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan. Secretary General Stoltenberg mentioned adjustments, including troop reductions, would be conditions-based. NATO reaffirms commitment to Afghanistan and support for Afghan forces. European allies want close coordination on drawdown plans. President Trump urges NATO to expand counterterrorism efforts. NATO leaders launch new initiatives to address terrorist threats from MENA region. NATO has launched new initiatives to counter terrorism and address instability in the MENA region, including the NATO Training Mission in Iraq, the Package on the South partnership activities with countries like Tunisia and Jordan, and the NATO Regional Hub for the South in Naples, Italy. Aerial surveillance aircraft have been deployed to assist in the fight against the Islamic State. Several factors have limited enhanced NATO engagement on security challenges in the MENA region, including allies' belief that the EU should lead Europe's response to terrorism and migration issues. France has advocated for strong European responses but opposes a larger role for NATO. Some allies also disagree on the appropriate response to security challenges in the region. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress have urged NATO to assess the security implications of growing Chinese investment in Europe and counter potential negative impacts on transatlantic security. U.S. officials are concerned about China gaining a strategic foothold in Europe through unfair trade practices, investments in key industries, sensitive technologies, and infrastructure. U.S. officials are concerned about Chinese investment in critical infrastructure and telecommunications, especially 5G networks. NATO allies are updating baseline requirements for civilian telecommunications to address risks associated with cyber threats and foreign ownership. The EU is working on common guidelines for 5G network contracting decisions, but individual national governments will still have the final say. US officials have cautioned European allies against using Chinese 5G equipment due to security concerns, leading some allies like the UK and Germany to set national security requirements for companies bidding on 5G contracts. The UK government announced on January 28, 2020, that \"high-risk vendors\" like Huawei would be excluded from sensitive parts of 5G networks and critical national infrastructure. Other countries, such as Poland and Czech Republic, have also expressed concerns about Huawei's involvement in their telecommunications sector. Despite U.S. worries about China's influence in Europe, Administration officials remain optimistic about the situation. Administration officials are optimistic about US-Europe cooperation on security and economic issues posed by China. Analysts suggest joint pressure on China would be more effective. North Macedonia joined NATO as the 30th member on March 27, 2020, after delays due to elections in some member states. The U.S. Senate approved U.S. ratification of NATO on October 22, 2019, amid heightened tension and divergent views within the alliance on various issues. Disagreements on how to respond to these issues have led to questions about NATO's strategic direction and future. President Trump's criticism has also been a point of contention. President Trump's criticism of NATO and lack of transatlantic coordination on Syria and Afghanistan have undermined the alliance. Allies in London agreed to strengthen NATO's political dimension through consultation. Secretary General Stoltenberg appointed a group of 10 for this purpose. Secretary General Stoltenberg appointed a group of 10 experts to strengthen NATO's political role and unity. Cochaired by Wess Mitchell and Thomas De Mazi\u00c3\u00a8re, the group aims to increase consultation and coordination among Allies. Concerns have been raised about President Trump's criticisms potentially damaging NATO cohesion and credibility. President Trump has criticized European allies for not meeting NATO defense spending targets and questioned the value of NATO to the United States. Despite previous U.S. Presidents urging allies to increase defense spending, Trump's criticisms have been more severe and have raised doubts about the U.S. commitment to NATO. However, in London, Trump reaffirmed his Administration's commitment to NATO and European security, including increased funding for U.S. defense activities in Europe. Some NATO member states argue that there is a growing divergence between the United States and its allies. Some NATO member states argue that the growing divergence between the United States and European allies on key foreign and security policy issues has hindered cooperation in NATO and exposed strategic rifts within the alliance. Concerns have been raised about the lack of U.S. coordination on policy in Syria, leading to the U.S. drawdown of forces in 2019 enabling Turkey's military operations against Kurdish forces in the country. In November 2019, French President Macron criticized NATO for lacking coordination in strategic decision-making, citing the U.S. drawdown of forces in Syria and Turkey's subsequent military operations against Kurdish forces as examples of the alliance's \"brain death.\" In response to Macron's criticism of NATO's lack of coordination, President Trump defended the alliance, while some NATO members have criticized Turkey for its military operations in Syria and planned deployment of a Russian air defense system. Turkey's NATO membership has been called into question by policymakers. Turkey has been a NATO member since 1952 and has participated in various NATO missions, with NATO investing in military facilities in Turkey. NATO members have provided air defense support to Turkey since 2013. Secretary General Stoltenberg acknowledged Turkey's security concerns but urged restraint during a visit in 2019. Turkey has invoked NATO's support on three occasions since 2012. Since 2012, Turkey has invoked NATO's Article 4 three times due to perceived threats from Syria. In February 2020, NATO allies expressed solidarity with Turkey against air strikes in Idlib. NATO has provided air defense support and surveillance to Turkey along the Syrian border since 2013. NATO allies have been providing air defense support and surveillance to Turkey along the Turkish-Syrian border since early 2013 in response to a Turkish request for assistance. Despite some doubts from allies following Turkey's military actions in northern Syria in 2019, Italy withdrew its air defense system from Turkey in December 2019. Secretary General Stoltenberg has expressed concerns about Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 air defense system but emphasized that Turkey can still participate in NATO's integrated activities. Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 air defense system is a concern for NATO, with some allies suggesting Turkey be excluded from NATO's defense systems. While the North Atlantic Treaty does not allow for action against a member without consent, the US and other allies could adjust their cooperation with Turkey, such as changing contributions or participation in activities. On October 14, 2019, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper urged NATO allies to take diplomatic and economic measures in response to Turkey's actions. European leaders, like French President Macron, emphasize the need for coordinated European defense capabilities independent of NATO. EU has been working on its Common Security and Defense Policy to enhance its foreign policy and crisis response abilities. The EU is working to bolster its common foreign policy, strengthen its ability to respond to security crises, and enhance European military capabilities through initiatives like the European Defense Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg supports further EU defense integration and cooperation. The EU is focusing on defense integration and cooperation within NATO, with efforts to avoid duplication of NATO capacities and complement NATO initiatives. The Trump Administration has concerns about restrictions on U.S. defense companies in pan-European military projects. Supporters highlight that PESCO projects were identified in consultation with NATO. Several projects identified in consultation with NATO focus on enhancing military mobility across Europe, a key NATO priority. Congress has consistently shown strong support for active U.S. leadership of and support for NATO, despite some criticisms from individual members. During the Trump Administration, congressional support for NATO has been questioned at times. During the Trump Administration, congressional support for NATO has been reaffirmed through legislation and high-level meetings, demonstrating the importance of the alliance despite criticisms. In commemoration of NATO's 70th anniversary, Congress has shown consistent support for the alliance despite disagreements over President Trump's impact on NATO. Some argue that Trump's criticism has led to increased defense spending by NATO members, while others counter that his questioning of NATO's utility is concerning. Critics argue that President Trump's criticism of U.S. allies and NATO has damaged relationships, undermined credibility, and could embolden adversaries like Russia. They also criticize the lack of coordination with allies on security policies. Despite disagreements, most Members of Congress support robust U.S. leadership in NATO. Many Members of Congress support robust U.S. leadership in NATO to address potential threats posed by Russia and advocate for enhanced military responses to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Some Members question whether NATO should take action against allies like Turkey for policies that could threaten alliance security. Key questions regarding NATO's future include addressing its strategic value. Key questions regarding NATO's future include addressing the strategic value of the alliance to the United States, its leadership role within NATO, the need for a new strategic concept reflecting current security threats, capacity to address security threats in the Euro-Atlantic region, consequences of member states' failure to meet defense spending targets, and assessing U.S. force posture. The curr_chunk discusses assessing European allies' willingness to contribute to NATO deterrence efforts, options to sanction allies jeopardizing security, NATO's commitment to enlargement, and developing a strategy towards China."
