According to findings, an estimated 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 American women have received breast implants over the last 35 years. In 1999, 82,975 women had breast reconstruction following mastectomies and 167,318 received breast implants for cosmetic purposes. American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes. FDA received adverse reaction reports for silicone gel-filled and saline-filled breast implants from 1985 until January 2000. Women need complete information about the health risks and advantages of breast implants to make informed decisions. Silicone breast implants have never been FDA approved; saline implants consist of a saline solution in a silicone envelope. The FDA approved saline breast implants in 2000 despite high complication rates. After three years, 43% of augmentation patients and 73% of reconstruction patients experienced complications. 40% of reconstruction patients needed additional surgery due to complications and device failure. In 1998, the FDA investigated a breast implant manufacturer for manipulating research data. The FDA approved saline breast implants in 2000 despite high complication rates and manipulation of research data by manufacturers. A 1997 Mayo Clinic study showed that 1 in 4 women required additional surgery within 5 years of receiving implants. The investigation into the manipulation of research data remains open. In 2000, FDA research found that 70% of women with breast implants had at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years, with silicone migration in 21% of cases. The relationship between free silicone and disease progression is unknown. The influence of silicone breast implants on the expression of anticollagen antibodies was found to be statistically significant, indicating potential serious implications from their use. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study highlighted local complications as the primary safety concern with silicone breast implants. The safety concerns of silicone breast implants include potential complications such as connective tissue or autoimmune diseases. Studies have shown higher rates of lung and brain cancer among breast implant recipients. Evidence of silicone migration in women has also been reported. Researchers in rheumatology found evidence of silicone migration in women with ruptured or leaking silicone breast implants, leading to severe local inflammation and complications in the axilla, arm, or abdominal wall. Once silicone gel escapes the implant, it can trigger significant pathological responses in some individuals. Studies, including one in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, suggest that silicone breast implants may pose challenges. Silicone breast implants can hinder accurate mammograms by masking up to 40% of breast tissue, delaying breast cancer detection. Women considering breastfeeding should be aware of potential silicone passing into breast milk from implants, with unknown effects on infants. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants, ensure women receive accurate information, and urge the FDA to conclude its investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by a manufacturer. This Act does not affect any existing regulations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Act promotes research on breast implant health effects, ensures accurate information for women, and urges FDA investigation into manufacturer wrongdoing. It does not impact existing regulations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding silicone breast implant availability for reconstruction, correction of deformities, or replacement for ruptured implants. The Act calls for an update on existing breast implant research funded by the National Institutes of Health and adds a new section to the Public Health Service Act for breast implant research. The Director of NIH appoints a Department of Health and Human Services official as the National Institutes of Health coordinator for breast implant research, coordinating research efforts across various Institutes. The Director of NIH establishes study sections for various Institutes to review research grant applications on breast implants and ensure high-quality research. The Director of NIH conducts or supports research on the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, including a clinical study on women with implants for at least eight years. The study differentiates between women receiving implants for mastectomy, reconstructive, or cosmetic purposes. A study on women with saline and silicone breast implants for reconstructive or cosmetic purposes will focus on local complications like capsular contracture, leakage, and rupture. The study will also evaluate atypical symptoms, silicone migration, neurological dysfunction, and immune system irregularities. The Director of NIH will annually report the results of this study to Congress. The Food and Drug Administration will intensify postmarket research on saline breast implants based on recommendations from their panel. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will report to Congress on the implementation status of these recommendations at regular intervals. Expansion and intensification of activities regarding silicone breast implants at the Food and Drug Administration. To ensure accurate information on silicone breast implants, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will expedite investigations into wrongdoing by manufacturers and update consumer materials within 90 days of this Act. The FDA must promptly address issues with breast implants and provide public access to aggregate data on reported problems. Manufacturers of silicone breast implants must regularly update package inserts with accurate information on complications and ruptures. Manufacturers conducting clinical studies on silicone breast implants must ensure clinical investigators provide prospective patients with the FDA's breast implant booklet and informed consent documents at the initial consultation. Manufacturers conducting clinical studies on silicone breast implants must amend the informed consent protocol to provide women with information on how to report problems or concerns, inclusion criteria for the trial, and a toll-free Consumer Information number. Additionally, they should appoint a special patient information panel. Appoint a special ad hoc patient information panel to review breast implant information and advertisements annually. Panel includes breast implant recipients, bioethicists, rheumatologists, and oncologists with experience in clinical care and research."
