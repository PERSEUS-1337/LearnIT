    "content": "Human history began in Africa, with human ancestors evolving into homosapiens around 200,000 years ago. Small bands of modern humans migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, becoming ancestors of all human populations. The Bantu people of West Africa started expanding their settlement area 2,500-5,000 years ago from a base in present-day Nigeria or Cameroon. The Bantu people originated in present-day Nigeria or Cameroon and eventually became the predominant group in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan languages are also present in the Sahel grasslands and eastern Africa, with origins possibly in the Nile valley. The term \"Nilotic\" is no longer favored by scholars due to intermingling with Bantu speakers. By 500 BC, the Bantu people in southern Africa mastered iron smelting, leading to successful agriculture and expansion. European explorers in the 15th century found African farmers growing various crops, including bananas from contacts with the Indian Ocean region. After the discovery of America, African farmers quickly adopted New World crops like maize and peanuts. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans lived in farming communities across the continent, with some pastoral communities in dry regions like Kenya's Rift Valley. Large towns and cities had not developed due to the risk of diseases from parasites. Human populations outside Africa largely escaped diseases, allowing for easier city development. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were absent in pre-colonial Africa. Similar languages and cultural practices were widespread, but Africans did not perceive a shared identity. Africans in pre-colonial times had loyalties to extended families, clans, and patron-client relationships rather than large ethnic groups. Powerful chiefs emerged, consolidating authority through conquest and alliances to form African kingdoms. The Atlantic slave trade began in 1441 when a man and a woman were captured on the coast of Western Sahara and taken to Portugal. Between 10 million and 13 million people were taken from Africa during the 400 years of the trade. Between 10 million and 13 million people were taken from Africa during the Atlantic slave trade, with most going to Brazil and the Caribbean. The peak of the trade occurred in the eighteenth century, with annual totals reaching 100,000 in some years. In 1807, the British parliament voted to end the slave trade, and the Royal Navy intercepted more than 1,600 ships off Africa's coasts over the next 60 years. The Royal Navy intercepted over 1,600 ships and freed 160,000 captives off Africa's coasts in the next 60 years. Despite efforts, many ships evaded patrols, and slavery continued until its abolition in the Americas in the 1850s and 1860s. U.S. participation in the slave trade was banned in 1807 and reinforced in 1819. European traders conducted the Atlantic slave trade by purchasing slaves from African owners with guns and alcohol. The Atlantic slave trade involved purchasing slaves from African owners with goods like guns and alcohol. Slavery was common in Africa, where captives from wars, criminals, and kidnap victims were enslaved. Historically, slaves in Africa were often integrated into families or local armies with less harsh treatment than in the New World plantations. The slave trade in Africa was associated with turmoil and warfare, fueled by the exchange of slaves for guns. This instability led to constant warfare, loss of millions of people, and psychological damage. The psychological damage from political instability in Africa weakened the continent, making it vulnerable to European colonization. By 1870, European powers began partitioning Africa, despite the potential for indigenous political entities to develop into nation-states. For example, the kingdom of Ashanti in West Africa had a strong central government, advanced infrastructure, and well-defined boundaries. The kingdom of Buganda in East Africa had a powerful king, a strong army, and growing trade, becoming the chief naval power on Lake Victoria. Secondary empires, relying on European military technology, were emerging in Muslim societies, promoting the spread of Islam in sub-Saharan Africa. Islam had been spreading slowly in West Africa through trans-Saharan trade contacts. In West Africa, Islam spread through trade and Arab immigration, leading to the establishment of a vast Islamic empire centered on Sokoto in modern Nigeria. Meanwhile, in East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar and Egypt were expanding their power, with Egypt's influence reaching into central Africa by 1876. By 1876, Victoria was on the path to an empire extending into central Africa. In southern Africa, the Boers, descendants of Dutch, Huguenot, and German settlers, established a conservative empire by defeating the Zulu with modern weapons and tactics. They migrated inland to avoid British cultural influences after Britain took control of the Cape during the Napoleonic wars. The European scramble for Africa halted the development of indigenous political entities in the region, with British forces ending the last resistance in Somalia in 1920. By then, all of sub-Saharan Africa, except for Ethiopia and Liberia, was under European control. Ethiopia successfully resisted Italian ambitions. The European scramble for Africa led to the colonization of most of sub-Saharan Africa, except for Ethiopia and Liberia. Ethiopia thwarted Italian ambitions but was unable to oust them from Eritrea. Advances in medicine and military technology played a significant role in the colonization process. The European colonization of Africa was facilitated by advances in military technology, such as machine guns and modern artillery, giving them a significant advantage over African forces. Despite some resistance from African groups like the Ashanti, Zulu, Boers, Herero, and peoples in French West Africa, many Africans chose not to resist the colonial invasion due to Europe's military superiority. Initially, European leaders were hesitant to seize African territory, doubting the potential financial gains. In Britain, France, and Germany, imperialists and nationalists pushed for African expansion despite initial reluctance due to doubts about financial gains. Anti-slavery activists, missionaries, and business interests also played a role in advocating for direct rule in Africa, especially in southern Africa where diamonds and gold were discovered. In 1871, gold was found in Kimberley, South Africa, and in 1885 on the Witwatersrand near Johannesburg. The colonial powers valued Africa's agricultural potential, with Germany seeking raw cotton in Tanganyika. King Leopold II of Belgium hid his profit motives behind humanitarian concerns while building a vast empire with Henry M. Stanley. Leopold, a British-American explorer, built a vast empire in the Congo River basin by persuading local chiefs to sign treaties at the Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885. His International Association of the Congo (IAC) gained recognition, supported by Britain and Germany to counter French influence in Africa. Leopold also secured endorsement from U.S. President Chester Arthur for his plans. The Berlin conference established rules for acquiring colonies in Africa, limiting colonization to major powers like Britain, France, and Germany. Portugal also gained territories in Angola and Mozambique. By World War I, Britain emerged as the dominant power in Africa with colonies from southern Africa to Egypt. The United States did not have colonies in Africa, but the U.S. Navy assisted the American Colonization Society in settling former slaves on the West African coast in 1820. The settlers declared independence as the Republic of Liberia in 1847, with Americo-Liberians using firearms in subsequent decades. The Americo-Liberians used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples and extend their control into the hinterland after declaring independence as the Republic of Liberia in 1847. This expansion has been compared to European colonization and contributed to the violent disintegration of Liberian society in the late twentieth century. In 1980, indigenous soldiers killed the Americo-Liberian president, William Tolbert, leading to a decade of political violence, human rights violations, and a 6-year civil war. The effects of the colonial era on Africa and its peoples, similar to the slave trade, are a subject of scholarly study. The consequences of Leopold's rule in Congo were clearly negative, with widespread abuses including forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation as a policy tool. The situation in Congo became an international scandal, leading to the Belgian government's intervention. The Belgian government intervened in Congo in 1908, removing the colony from Leopold's control and implementing reforms. The colonial era in British and French-controlled territories improved infrastructure, public health, and education through Christian missions. Limited opportunities for higher education and employment in the modern sector were also present. Limited opportunities for higher education, travel, and employment in the modern sector empowered African leaders like Kenya's Jomo Kenyatta and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, who studied abroad and later became presidents of their respective countries. European investment in Africa was limited, and colonial governments expected colonies to be self-sufficient in terms of development, heavily influencing the economy. After independence, many African countries were still influenced by colonial economic policies, leading to a dependence on exporting primary products for manufactured goods. This reliance on primary products has contributed to Africa's economic challenges, as prices have not kept up with manufactured goods in the post-colonial world. Colonial governments did not prioritize democracy, hindering the development of democratic traditions in Africa. The colonial state in Africa was authoritarian and not focused on developing democratic traditions. Political rights and independence movements faced repression, setting precedents for post-colonial rulers. Popular participation in politics was limited until the end of the colonial period when elections began. Britain and France discouraged political involvement for most of the colonial era. During the colonial era, Britain and France worked closely with local chiefs and big men to obtain labor and tax revenues. This cooperation with traditional authorities contributed to issues of corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism in independent Africa. Colonial practices also intensified ethnic divisions by emphasizing language and cultural differences among African peoples. During the colonial era, Europeans encouraged Africans to view the world in terms of \"tribes\" and \"nations,\" ruling indirectly through \"tribal chiefs.\" Africans advanced their interests by working through tribal organizations, strengthening tribal loyalties. The colonial era encouraged tribal loyalties among Africans, leading to ethnic divisions that fuel violent politics in Africa today. Colonial partition imposed artificial boundaries, hindering transport between African countries. The colonial era in Africa imposed bureaucratic colonial states, suppressing indigenous political arrangements. The end of colonialism after World War II weakened Britain and France, hastening the decolonization process in Africa. The end of colonialism after World War II weakened Britain and France, hastening decolonization in Africa. The war aims of western powers emphasized democracy and resistance to aggression, aligning with Africa's nationalists. The United Nations Charter committed colonial powers to developing self-government in their territories. After World War II, African nationalists organized opposition to colonial regimes influenced by European intellectual currents and socialist ideas. Nkrumah and others were inspired by W.E.B. DuBois and the struggle for social justice. British policymakers recognized the need for independence in African colonies by the late 1940s. After World War II, African nationalists opposed colonial regimes influenced by European ideas. Britain granted independence to India in 1947, foreseeing African independence in the distant future. France aimed for assimilation of its colonies into a greater France, with some Africans becoming French citizens through education. Nationalist sentiments grew across Africa, leading to uprisings like the Mau Mau in the early 1950s. In the early 1950s, African countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya gained independence from colonial powers like Britain and France. Guinea shocked President Charles de Gaulle by choosing independence over close association with France in 1958. In 1960, independence movements led to the emergence of 14 independent countries in French-held Africa, including Guinea. Belgium granted independence to the Belgian Congo in the same year. In southern Africa, independence was delayed due to substantial white populations opposing majority rule, leading to armed struggles for freedom in some countries. In 1965, Rhodesia declared independence from Britain, leading to UN sanctions and a civil war. Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980. Guerrilla wars erupted in Angola and Mozambique in the 1960s, with independence achieved in 1975 after a coup in Portugal. Namibia also saw armed struggle for independence from South Africa. In Namibia, independence from South Africa was achieved in 1990 after a U.N.-supervised election. In South Africa, the National Party came to power in 1948 and implemented apartheid, leading to protests and resistance in the late 1960s and 1970s. In the late 1960s and 1970s, violent resistance against apartheid in South Africa led to harsh government repression. In the 1980s, the white-controlled government faced international isolation and began secret discussions with the ANC for a majority-based system. In the late 1960s and 1970s, violent resistance against apartheid in South Africa led to harsh government repression. In the 1980s, the white-controlled government began secret discussions with the ANC on a majority-based system. ANC leader Nelson Mandela was freed from prison in February 1990, and constitutional negotiations concluded in November 1993. Universal-suffrage elections were held in April 1994, and Mandela became President in May of that year. In May 1963, African states signed the Charter of the Organization of African Unity to promote solidarity and improve living standards. However, problems emerged with civil war in the former Belgian Congo from 1960-1964. Sub-Saharan Africa experienced political instability with military coups and civil wars in the 1960s. Economic growth declined significantly in the following decades, with negative growth rates in the 1980s. In the 1970s and 1980s, many African countries were governed by authoritarian regimes, leading to civil wars and economic decline. Drought in 1982-1984 exacerbated the situation, causing high death tolls in war-torn countries like Ethiopia and Sudan where international aid couldn't reach the hungry. The impact of the colonial era on Africa's post-independence problems includes ethnic divisions and authoritarian rule. Colleges and universities were established late in African colonies, leaving a small indigenous elite to face the challenges of independence. Independent Africa also faced a significant population increase from 1950 to 1990. During the Cold War, Africa saw a significant increase in the number of arms entering the region, fueling conflicts in countries like Ethiopia, Angola, and Mozambique. The Soviet Union and its allies provided most of these arms to Marxist regimes, while the United States supported anti-Soviet authoritarian regimes in countries such as Zaire, Sudan, and Liberia. Critics argue that this competitive involvement in the Cold War strengthened anti-democratic governments on both sides. During the Cold War, Africa saw an increase in arms supply, fueling conflicts in countries like Ethiopia, Angola, and Mozambique. This competitive involvement tended to strengthen anti-democratic governments on both sides, marked by corruption. France's active engagement in Africa aimed to maintain great power status through a \"special relationship\" with former colonies, seen as its exclusive hunting ground. France capitalized on language ties for influence. France's special relationships with former colonies in Africa, particularly Zaire and Rwanda, brought military and economic assistance, with French troops stationed at African bases. French businesses gained privileged access to trade and investment opportunities. Critics argued that French policy perpetuated corrupt regimes, while defenders claimed it contributed to stability and development. France reduced military and financial commitments in Africa after the Socialist Party's victory in 1997. Scholars in the late 1980s and early 1990s focused on African state weaknesses hindering development. The weak states in Africa were unable to drive societal change and economic growth due to corruption within state institutions. Personal ambitions of leaders, ethnic favoritism, and patrimonialism diverted resources to ruling cliques, police, and military. Academic discussions on the \"failed state\" in Africa were prevalent, with media coverage of famine and conflict in countries like Somalia and Sudan. Despite a growth spurt in the mid-1990s, overall GDP growth from 1990 to 1998 was only 2.0% per year, lower than the population growth rate of 2.6%. In the early 1990s, Africa experienced positive developments with the end of the Cold War and significant changes in South Africa, leading to hopes for a better future. Many anticipated that a stable South Africa would become an \"engine of growth\" for the sub-Saharan region. By the mid-1990s, several African countries in the sub-Saharan region were making progress in free market economic reforms, leading to GDP growth rates exceeding population growth rates. Political reforms were also underway in authoritarian states due to demands for democratization. National political conferences were held, representing diverse interests in Africa's civil society, including human rights organizations. In the mid-1990s, political reforms in Africa led to the representation of various interests in civil society, including human rights organizations and political parties. Elections were held in countries that were previously one-party states, garnering positive reactions from analysts. Despite initial hopes for political freedom, some observers have been disappointed with the progress since then. The democratic hopes of the early 1990s in Africa have faded due to disappointment over the manipulation of the electoral process by authoritarian leaders. Some countries like Kenya, Gabon, and Cameroon have been labeled as \"pseudo-democracies\" by experts like Larry Diamond. Richard Joseph expressed his disappointment in 1998, stating that Africa's democratic opening resulted in \"virtual democracies.\" Events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire have been discouraging for advocates of democratization. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a military coup in 1999 and exclusion of a qualified candidate from elections in 2000 led to ethnic and religious divisions. In Zimbabwe, the situation is similarly challenging. The 2000 elections in Zimbabwe resulted in a divided country along ethnic and religious lines, with opposition gains overshadowed by political violence. Criticism arose over government tactics in acquiring white-owned farms, leading to concerns about the rule of law. Sub-Saharan Africa's AIDS epidemic worsened, with over 25.3 million infected individuals in the region, accounting for more than 70% of the global total. The AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa is severe, with over 70% of global infections. Uganda and Senegal have seen success with prevention campaigns, but overall infection rates in Africa are high. Mortality rates are increasing, with an estimated 17 million deaths already. Armed conflicts in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries, have hindered development and created refugee crises. Various countries have troops in Congo, leading to fears of wider war. Conflict is also occurring in Angola, Sierra Leone, Sudan, and other nations, while Africa's economic performance remains disappointing. Sudan and other African countries are experiencing economic stagnation, with GDP growth rates below population growth rates. South Africa's economy is also struggling to grow, hindering its ability to stimulate economic expansion in the region. Sub-Saharan Africa is described as marginalized in global trade and investment, leading to concerns about the continent's economic future. The U.S. National Intelligence Council's study in 2000 predicted that Africa's political and economic prospects are dim for the next few years due to demographics, disease, and poor governance. Most African states will miss out on global economic growth, with only a few countries faring better. Sub-Saharan Africa is at risk of increasing international marginalization. The U.S. National Intelligence Council's study in 2000 predicted that Africa's political and economic prospects are dim due to demographics, disease, and poor governance. Sub-Saharan Africa's problems are compounded, leading to ethnic tensions and conflicts, but some argue against Afro-pessimism, highlighting a new reality of governments becoming more accountable to citizens. An International Monetary Fund Issues Brief in December 2000 acknowledged two decades of economic stagnation and little progress in poverty reduction in Africa. Despite this, the brief remained optimistic, stating that economic policy reforms have laid the foundation for an economic renaissance in sub-Saharan Africa. President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa has also promoted the idea of an African Renaissance. The African Renaissance concept has been endorsed by various leaders, including President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and then-U.S. Ambassador James Joseph. The 1990s saw political themes of reconciliation and democratization, with successful transitions in South Africa and Nigeria. In the 1990s, Africa saw successful transitions to democracy in countries like South Africa and Nigeria. Nigeria, with a population of over 120 million, ended military rule in 1999. The wave of elections in Africa has set precedents for further democratization, despite economic disappointments. Optimists believe that with economic policy reforms, improved governance, and international support, many African countries could see significant GDP growth rates, leading to higher per capita incomes and improved quality of life. Debt relief and support for poverty reduction programs are seen as crucial in this process. Africa's natural resources, including newly-discovered oil deposits, also play a significant role in its economic development. The Clinton Administration's policy towards Africa had an Afro-optimist tone, with President Clinton making an extensive trip to Africa in 1998. He spoke of an \"African Renaissance\" and emphasized democracy, peace, and prosperity as the essence of a new Africa. President Clinton's visit to Africa in 1998 emphasized democracy, peace, and prosperity as the essence of a new Africa. He acknowledged economic problems and conflicts but highlighted growing economies fueling transformation. In 2000, he visited Nigeria to support its democratic transition and praised its cooperation with the United States. During President Clinton's visit to Africa in 2000, he emphasized the importance of cooperation in combating international crime, leadership in regional peacekeeping, and combating the African HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Clinton Administration highlighted Africa's potential as a U.S. trading partner, emphasizing the growing importance of oil imports from the region. Officials stressed that Africa was already supplying 16% of U.S. oil imports and was projected to surpass the Persian Gulf as a U.S. supplier within the decade. The Clinton Administration endorsed the African Growth and Opportunity Act, highlighting various U.S. interests in Africa such as preventing weapons proliferation, preserving environmental resources, and combating drug trade and terrorism. They also launched initiatives like the Leland Initiative to improve Africa's internet access. The Clinton Administration launched initiatives like the Leland Initiative to improve Africa's internet access and the LIFE Initiative to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and worldwide. These initiatives involved various U.S. agencies beyond the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development, boosting their Africa-related efforts. The Clinton Administration boosted Africa-related capabilities through initiatives like the Leland Initiative and the LIFE Initiative. However, challenges arose after U.S. soldiers were killed in Somalia, leading to hesitation in sending peacekeepers to Rwanda during the genocide. President Clinton later admitted to Rwandans that action was not taken quickly enough. As a result, the Administration aimed to strengthen Africa's peacekeeping capabilities. The Administration aimed to strengthen Africa's peacekeeping capabilities through initiatives like the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) and a \"train and equip\" program for Nigerian battalions. U.S. officials played mediator roles in African conflicts, with the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea being a notable success. However, ongoing conflicts in Africa remained a source of frustration for policymakers. Trade results during the Clinton years in Africa were mixed, with U.S. imports growing at a slower rate than overall imports, and exports growing at a slower rate than all U.S. exports. Most trade was with a few countries, mainly oil producers and South Africa, with petroleum accounting for over half of imports. African trade made up about 1% of U.S. totals in 1999. In 1999, African imports and exports accounted for about 1% of U.S. totals. U.S. investment in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly in the petroleum sector, was around 1.2% of total U.S. foreign direct investment in 1998. U.S. firms had significant investments in Africa, such as Southwestern Bell's share in the South African telecommunications industry and Caterpillar Inc. dealerships in 15 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa gained importance in U.S. foreign policy in 1958 with the creation of a Bureau of African Affairs. The Eisenhower Administration established a Bureau of African Affairs in the Department of State. Africa policy has been a subject of controversy over the years, with debates on whether administrations were doing enough on issues like apartheid in South Africa and African development. The Eisenhower Administration faced its first African crisis in 1960 with the Congo rebellion, supporting the deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force to prevent Soviet exploitation. The Kennedy Administration supported a U.N. peacekeeping force in Africa and approved funding for a controversial dam in Ghana. They also began pressing for reforms in white regimes in southern Africa and backed a U.N.-sponsored arms embargo against South Africa in 1963. During the Johnson Administration, US Africa policy focused on Congo (Zaire) with covert aid to suppress rebellions. Mobutu Sese-Seko became president with US backing. Limited military assistance was given due to concerns of \"another Vietnam\". In the Nixon and Ford Administrations, the focus shifted to southern Africa. During the Nixon and Ford Administrations (1969-1977), the Africa policy focus shifted to southern Africa and the upheavals in Angola, Mozambique, and Rhodesia. Political controversy arose over policymakers' perceived sympathy towards white minority regimes. Henry Kissinger believed the Soviet Union was pursuing \"ruthless opportunism\" and \"adventurism\" in Africa, influencing US Africa policy. Kissinger criticized Congress for banning further involvement in Angola in 1975, accusing them of avoiding confrontation with Soviet expansionism. During the Carter Administration (1977-1981), there was a new emphasis on human rights in U.S. foreign policy, leading to advocacy for majority rule in Zimbabwe, independence for Namibia, and criticism of apartheid in South Africa. The Administration also pushed for reforms in Zaire, but Cold War considerations continued to influence Africa policy. The Carter Administration did not intervene in the Liberian coup in 1980, possibly due to reports of human rights violations and corruption discrediting the regime. There were concerns about Soviet and Cuban gains during this time. During the Carter Administration, the U.S. responded to Soviet and Cuban influence in sub-Saharan Africa by forming ties with Somalia, leading to the Ogaden War in 1977-1978. Cuba and Ethiopia launched a successful counteroffensive against Somalia, averting a potential crisis. During the Reagan Administration, there was strong support for covert aid to UNITA in Angola, with a publicly-acknowledged program launched in 1986 after Congress repealed prohibitions. Chester Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, favored this approach. During the Reagan Administration, Chester Crocker favored a policy of \"linkage\" to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for independence for Namibia. Despite political opposition, a regional peace agreement was achieved in 1988 under U.S. leadership. In 1986, Congress enacted sanctions legislation over President Reagan's veto to push for political change in South Africa. The George H.W. Bush Administration directed their efforts towards Africa policymaking from 1989-1993. During the George H.W. Bush Administration (1989-1993), policymakers focused on the Horn of Africa. In 1991, they successfully managed a peaceful transition in Ethiopia to prevent upheaval. However, Somalia faced clan violence, drought, and famine, leading to a humanitarian disaster by 1992. As a result, before leaving office, Bush sent U.S. troops for a multi-national humanitarian intervention, credited with saving thousands. During the George H.W. Bush Administration, a multi-national humanitarian intervention in Somalia saved thousands from starvation despite the loss of American lives in 1993. The Bush Administration also pushed for reforms in Africa to promote democracy and economic liberalization. In 2000, the African Growth and Opportunity Act aimed at boosting U.S. trade with Africa became law. Under the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-264), Congress authorized $300 million in FY2001 and FY2002 for a comprehensive HIV/AIDS effort worldwide. The FY2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations (P.L. 106-429) provided $300 million in Development Assistance for HIV/AIDS, with over half expected to go towards African programs. In previous years, Congress enacted acts such as the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act (P.L. 105-385) in 1998 to promote African food security and the African Conflict Resolution Act (P.L. 103-381) in 1994 to assist in resolving African conflicts. In 1990, the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) was created by Congress to protect Africa aid levels post-Cold War. In 1992, the Horn of Africa Recovery and Food Security Act (P.L. 103-274) was passed to set policy objectives for U.S. assistance in the Horn region. In 1986, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (P.L. 99-440) to set policy objectives for the United States in South Africa and provide sanctions to improve the lives of black South Africans. In 1985, Congress passed an emergency appropriation for African famine relief (P.L. 99-10) following media coverage of famine in Ethiopia and Sudan. The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 repealed the Clark Amendment. The Development Cooperation Act of 1985 repealed the Clark Amendment, which prohibited aid for military operations in Angola. The Byrd Amendment, sponsored by Senator Harry F. Byrd, Jr. of Virginia, partially exempted the U.S. from U.N. sanctions on Rhodesia by prohibiting the enforcement of the trade embargo on critical materials like chromium and nickel.
