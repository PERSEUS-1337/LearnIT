The term \"person\" includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, and federal entities. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. A \"steel jaw leghold trap\" is a device designed to capture an animal by snapping closed upon the animal's limb. PROHIBITED ACTS AND PENALTIES.
