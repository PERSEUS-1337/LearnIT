The Children's Health Equity Act of 2001 allows for up to 4 state waivers to utilize Title XXI funds to boost Medicaid children's enrollment. Definitions in the Act include terms like \"child,\" \"child health assistance,\" \"enhanced FMAP,\" and \"Federal medical assistance percentage.\" The Children's Health Equity Act of 2001 allows for state waivers to boost Medicaid children's enrollment using Title XXI funds. Definitions in the Act include terms like \"poverty line,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State child health plan.\" The Secretary can approve up to 4 waiver applications for states meeting specific requirements to receive payments under subsection (d). One requirement is that the state has the highest income eligibility standard allowed under Title XXI of the Social Security Act as of January 1, 2001. The State plan under Title XXI of the Social Security Act as of January 1, 2001, provides benefits to all children in the State who meet eligibility standards on a statewide basis without imposing any waiting list for children with family income at or below 200 percent of the poverty line. The State plan under Title XXI of the Social Security Act provides benefits to all children in the State meeting eligibility standards without waiting lists for those with family income at or below 200 percent of the poverty line. The State must implement at least 4 policies related to child health assistance under the plan, including using a uniform application form for eligible children. The State plan under Title XXI of the Social Security Act ensures benefits for eligible children without waiting lists, with no asset test for eligibility and 12-month continuous enrollment. The State plan under Title XXI of the Social Security Act ensures benefits for eligible children without waiting lists, with no asset test for eligibility and 12-month continuous enrollment. For children eligible for medical assistance under section 1902(a)(10)(A) of the Act, the State implements the same verification policies for initial eligibility determinations and redeterminations. The State plan under Title XXI of the Social Security Act ensures benefits for eligible children without waiting lists, with no asset test for eligibility and 12-month continuous enrollment. The State uses the same verification policies for initial eligibility determinations and redeterminations, including face-to-face interviews, forms, and frequency. Additionally, the State provides for automatic reassessment of eligibility for children under titles XIX and XXI. The State also outstations enrollment staff at facilities defined as disproportionate share hospitals for processing applications for benefits under title XXI and children under title XIX. Facilities designated as disproportionate share hospitals and Federally-qualified health centers are eligible for payment under specific sections of the Social Security Act. This payment authorization applies to states with approved waivers that meet certain requirements. The Secretary will pay the State from its allotment under the Social Security Act an amount for each fiscal year based on total medical assistance expenditures for children under title XIX. The Secretary determines total medical assistance expenditures for children in the State for fiscal year 1995, calculating any increase in expenditures. The bonus amount for a fiscal year is calculated based on the total amount determined under subparagraph (C) and the difference between the enhanced FMAP and the Federal medical assistance percentage for that State. Children described in this context are specified for paragraph (1)(A). Children described in this paragraph are those eligible and enrolled for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act, including children with family income exceeding the highest eligibility level under the State plan but would be considered disabled under section 1614(a)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act. Children eligible for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act, including those with family income exceeding the State plan's highest eligibility level but considered disabled under section 1614(a)(3)(C) of the Act, may receive supplemental security income benefits. States with approved waivers may receive payments under section 2105(a) of the Act. The State's expenditures under section 2105(a) of the Social Security Act for a fiscal year are prioritized in the following order: first for items in paragraph (1)(A), second for items in paragraph (1)(B), third for payments authorized under subsection (d)(1), and fourth for items in paragraph (1)(C) of the Act. The State's expenditures under section 2105(a) of the Social Security Act are prioritized in a specific order, with the fifth priority being for items described in paragraph (1)(D) of the Act."
