    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to define terms related to telemedicine, including \"asynchronous store and forward\" and \"distant site\" for health care providers. A marriage and family therapist intern or trainee can provide health care services via a telecommunications system at an originating site. Synchronous interaction refers to real-time communication between a patient and a health care provider at a distant site. Telehealth is the delivery of healthcare services and public health through technology to diagnose, consult, treat, educate, and manage patient care remotely. It includes synchronous interactions and asynchronous transfers. Prior to delivering healthcare via telehealth, the provider must inform the patient, obtain consent, and document it. Patients can still receive in-person care if they agree to telehealth first. Non-compliance constitutes unprofessional conduct. (e) This section does not change the scope of practice for healthcare providers or allow the delivery of healthcare services in unauthorized settings. (f) Laws on patient confidentiality and medical information rights apply to telehealth interactions. (g) This section does not apply to patients in correctional facilities. The governing body of a hospital may grant privileges and verify credentials for telehealth providers based on medical staff recommendations. This allows hospitals to authorize telehealth services. Section 4980.43 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require applicants to complete 3,000 hours of experience over 104 weeks, with a maximum of 40 hours per week and at least 1,700 hours of supervised experience after obtaining a qualifying degree.

Up to 150 hours of conjoint therapy credited as two hours of experience for each hour provided. The curr_chunk states that a maximum of 375 hours of experience in providing counseling services via telehealth is required, with a focus on working with elders and dependent adults with limitations. This requirement applies to hours gained from January 1, 2010 onwards. All applicants, trainees, and registrants must be supervised to ensure counseling is in line with their training. Supervised experience can only be gained as an employee or volunteer, with compliance to laws and regulations. Experience must be gained as an employee or volunteer, not as an independent contractor. An intern must provide W-2 tax forms or a letter from their employer verifying volunteer work when applying for licensure. Supervision must include one hour of direct contact per week in each work setting, except for experience gained as an independent contractor. A trainee must have one hour of direct supervisor contact for every five hours of client contact, with a maximum of six hours of supervision per week. Additional supervision is required for individuals with more than 10 hours of client contact per week after obtaining a qualifying degree. Direct supervisor contact is defined as one hour per week of face-to-face contact on an individual basis or two hours per week in a group of up to eight supervisees. The contact must occur within the same week as the hours claimed and in segments lasting no less than one continuous hour. (6) Interns in certain settings can use videoconferencing for supervisor contact. Supervisor must ensure client confidentiality. (7) Supervisor must monitor all trainee experience as per regulations. (8) Six hours of supervision per week can be credited starting from January 1, 2009. A trainee can receive credit for supervised experience in a mental health counseling or psychotherapy setting that meets specific criteria, including oversight to ensure compliance with requirements and not being a private practice owned by certain licensed professionals. An intern can gain supervised experience in a mental health counseling or psychotherapy setting that meets specific criteria and oversight requirements. They cannot work in a private practice until registered as an intern. Employers should provide fair remuneration to interns, who must be supervised by a licensee in a private practice setting. The supervisor must meet specific requirements outlined in the regulations. Alternative supervision arrangements can be made during the supervisor's absence. All individuals must register as interns with the board to receive credit for postdegree supervised experience towards licensure, except when working in a private practice. Postdegree experience can be credited towards licensure if the applicant applies for intern registration within 90 days of receiving their qualifying degree. Trainees, interns, and applicants must not receive payment from patients or clients, only from their employers. Trainees, interns, and applicants must perform services at their employer's place of business under supervision. They can also provide services via telehealth within authorized scope and regulations. Trainees and interns using telehealth must not have any financial ties to their employers' businesses. Trainees, interns, or applicants receiving up to $500 per month for expenses incurred while providing services in a lawful work setting other than private practice are considered employees, not independent contractors. Applicants may be audited to verify expense reimbursements. Each educational institution and supervisor should consider encouraging students, interns, and trainees to undergo counseling or psychotherapy as appropriate. Assistance in locating affordable counseling services should be provided if desired by the applicant."
