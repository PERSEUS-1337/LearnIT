The Act defines key terms such as \"Agreement,\" \"Animas-La Plata Project,\" and \"Dolores Project\" in relation to the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988. The Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-585) defines the term \"Tribe\" or \"Tribes\" as given in the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE COLORADO UTE INDIAN WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1988. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 is amended to include the construction of a reservoir with a storage capacity of 260,000 acre-feet as part of the Animas-La Plata Project. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 is amended to include the construction of a reservoir with a storage capacity of 260,000 acre-feet as part of the Animas-La Plata Project. This project aims to allocate water to the Southern Ute Tribe and the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe, with an average annual depletion not to exceed 16,525 acre-feet of water each. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 is amended to allocate water to various entities, including the Navajo Nation, San Juan Water Commission, and Animas-La Plata Conservancy District, with specified annual depletion limits for each. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 is amended to allocate an amount not to exceed 2,600 acre-feet of water to the Navajo Nation and other Tribes. Tribal construction costs for the Animas-La Plata Project are nonreimbursable, while nontribal water capital repayment obligations will be satisfied by the San Juan Water Commission with a payment of $8,600,000. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 is amended to allocate water to the Navajo Nation and other Tribes. Tribal construction costs for the Animas-La Plata Project are nonreimbursable, while nontribal water capital repayment obligations will be satisfied by the San Juan Water Commission with a payment of $8,600,000. The Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District will contribute $4,400,000, and the State of Colorado will provide $16,000,000 as part of their cost-sharing obligation. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 is amended to allocate water to the Navajo Nation and other Tribes. Tribal construction costs for the Animas-La Plata Project are nonreimbursable. Tribal water allocations from the project shall be nonreimbursable until used by the Tribe or pursuant to a water use contract. The annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs for municipal and industrial water allocation of the Tribe are nonreimbursable. Repayment of a pro rata share is required when the water allocation is first used by the Tribe or pursuant to a water use contract. The Tribe must start repaying its share of construction costs for the Dolores Project and bear the annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs. Additionally, the Animas-La Plata Water remaining supplies can be requested by the Tribe. The Secretary shall provide water allocations to the Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District of Colorado and the La Plata Conservancy District of New Mexico, with specified annual depletion amounts. The Secretary shall provide water allocations to the Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District of Colorado and the La Plata Conservancy District of New Mexico, with an average annual depletion limit of 780 acre-feet. Additional depletions may be permitted in accordance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, with allocations made among beneficiaries based on an agreement. Upon request of the State Engineer of New Mexico, the Secretary will transfer water rights to fulfill the New Mexico purposes of the Animas La-Plata Project. The April 1996 Final Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement and the February 19, 1996 Final Biological Opinion of the Animas-La Plata Project are considered adequate to meet requirements under the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act do not apply to the amendments made to the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, the construction of specified facilities, and the approved depletion of 57,100 acre-feet of water. Final Settlement: Providing water to Tribes as per this section constitutes the ultimate resolution. This subsection does not impact the construction of facilities or water use not specified and approved in the biological opinion. Final Settlement: Tribes' water rights on the Animas and La Plata Rivers will be settled according to this section. The Tribes retain rights to water on other streams and rivers in the Agreement, can participate in the Animas-La Plata Project, receive water allocated for tribal use, and acquire water rights under Colorado law. The Attorney General of the United States will file necessary instruments with the District Court, Water Division Number 7 in Colorado to amend the final consent decree as per the amendments in the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998. SEC. 4. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION; TREATMENT OF CERTAIN FUNDS. The amendments made by this Act to section 6 of the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement of 1988 do not affect the applicability of other provisions of the Act or the Secretary of the Interior's obligation to deliver water from the Dolores Project and complete construction of facilities on the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation. The Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts from 1992 to 1995 are referenced, along with the treatment of the uncommitted portion of the cost-sharing obligation of the State of Colorado. The uncommitted portion of the cost-sharing obligation of the State of Colorado, as mentioned in the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988, can be used to fund components of the Animas-La Plata Project not covered in the Act."
