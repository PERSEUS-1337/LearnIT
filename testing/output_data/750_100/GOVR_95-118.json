    "content": "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established by ERISA to protect pensions of participants in private sector defined benefit plans. PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, but not defined contribution plans like 401(k)s. In FY2018, PBGC insured about 25,000 DB pension plans covering 37 million people and paid benefits to 1.4 million individuals. PBGC is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans and provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. Most workers in plans taken over by PBGC receive their full pension benefits. Among participants in multiemployer plans that may require financial assistance in the future, 49% have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee, while 51% have benefits exceeding it. PBGC, a government-owned corporation, is overseen by a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor, with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury as other members. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with Senate approval. Additionally, ERISA establishes a seven-member Advisory Committee. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141) made changes to the governance structures of PBGC, including setting the PBGC Director's term at five years, requiring the Board of Directors to meet at least four times a year, and establishing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate within PBGC. The PBGC is required to be self-supporting and receives no appropriations from general revenue. Its revenue comes from premiums set by Congress, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from companies. Some Members of Congress are hesitant to provide financial assistance to PBGC. The PBGC is self-supporting and funded through premiums, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from companies. Sponsors of pension plans pay premiums to PBGC, including flat-rate and additional premiums based on plan underfunding. Terminated plans pay a per-participant premium for three years. Sponsors of single-employer DB pension plans pay various premiums to PBGC, including flat-rate and variable-rate premiums based on plan underfunding. Terminated plans pay a per-participant premium for three years after termination. DB pension plans pay annual premiums to PBGC based on plan termination, with a flat-rate premium of $1,250 per participant for three years. Multiemployer plans pay $29 per participant in 2019. PBGC only covers DB plans meeting IRS qualification requirements. DC plans like 401(k) are not insured by PBGC. To receive tax benefits, a pension plan must meet IRC Section 401 requirements. Employer contributions are tax-deductible, and plan earnings are not taxable to participants. When receiving income from the plan, it is taxed as ordinary income. The plan must be permanent, provide definite benefits, and not favor highly compensated employees. Pension plans must meet IRC Section 401 requirements to receive tax benefits, including providing definite benefits and not favoring highly compensated employees. Plans excluded from PBGC insurance include governmental, church, and certain professional plans with fewer than 25 participants. PBGC operates separate reserve funds for single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated, underfunded single-employer DB pension plans. Assets are placed in a trust fund operated by PBGC, and participants receive benefits from PBGC. In the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent multiemployer DB pension plans when assets are insufficient to pay benefits. An employer can voluntarily terminate a single-employer plan. An employer can voluntarily terminate a single-employer plan in either a standard or distress termination. PBGC may involuntarily terminate an underfunded plan if the sponsor is unable to fund its pension obligations. A company may voluntarily end its pension plan if the plan's assets are sufficient to cover benefit liabilities. PBGC does not pay benefits in such cases, but confirms termination requirements have been met. Benefit liabilities include all benefits earned by plan participants. Benefit liabilities for plan participants include vested and nonvested benefits, early retirement supplements, and subsidies. Assets in excess of benefit liabilities may be used to purchase annuity contracts or provide lump-sum distributions. In lump-sum distributions, excess assets can be recovered by the employer through an asset reversion, subject to an excise tax. The tax rate is 20% if a qualified replacement plan is established, otherwise 50%. Underfunded plans in distress terminate into PBGC receivership. PBGC makes payments for benefit liabilities under terminated plans using assets from the plan and recovered from employers. If assets are insufficient, a distress termination can occur under specific criteria. PBGC may terminate a plan if members of the controlled group have filed for bankruptcy, or if the employer is unable to continue business without reorganization. The PBGC can terminate a pension plan if certain conditions are met, such as bankruptcy filings by members of the controlled group or the employer's inability to continue business without reorganization. The termination requirements were established by SEPPAA in 1986 and modified by subsequent acts to ensure that underfunded plan liabilities remain the responsibility of the employer unless strict financial need standards are met. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits when due, has a substantial owner who received a distribution over $10,000, or if PBGC expects an unreasonable increase in long-run loss. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits when due, has a substantial owner who received a distribution over $10,000, or if PBGC expects an unreasonable increase in long-run loss. A federal court may order termination of the plan to protect the interests of participants, avoid unreasonable deterioration of the plan's financial condition, or prevent an unreasonable increase in PBGC's liability. PBGC became the trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans from FY1974 through FY2016. Following a distress or involuntary termination, the plan's sponsor and every member of that sponsor's controlled group are liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. The liability is joint and several, meaning that each member of the controlled group can be held responsible for the entire liability. Upon distress termination, the plan sponsor and its controlled group are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall, payable in cash or negotiable securities. Failure to pay may result in a lien on the employer's property. If the sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited. When an underfunded plan terminates, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited. The benefits PBGC pays depend on the statutory limit on guaranteed benefits, the terminated plan's assets, and recoveries from the employer. PBGC guarantees vested retirement benefits and certain death, survivor, or disability benefits at the date of plan termination. The PBGC guarantees monthly retirement benefits, with certain conditions for early retirement benefits. Contingent benefits are guaranteed if the triggering event occurs before plan termination, with a phased-in guarantee period under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The PBGC guarantees maximum benefits for participants in single-employer pension plans, with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019. This amount is adjusted annually and can be decreased if benefits start before age 65 or if the plan offers non-standard payment forms. The PBGC guarantees maximum benefits for participants in single-employer pension plans, with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019. The benefit is increased if a participant begins receiving the benefit after the age of 65. Table 3 shows examples of PBGC's annual maximum benefit for individuals who begin receiving benefits at different ages and in different payment forms. The reduction in the maximum guarantee for benefits paid before the age of 65 is 7% for each of the first 5 years under age 65, 4% for the next 5 years, and 2% for the following 10 years. The reduction in the maximum guarantee for benefits paid in a form other than a straight-life annuity depends on the type of benefit, survivor's benefit percentage, and age difference between participant and spouse. Only \"basic benefits\" are guaranteed, including benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and benefits for survivors. Vested benefits are insured, with retirees receiving an average monthly benefit of $606 in FY2015. Over 80% of PBGC recipients in single-employer plans trusteed by PBGC received benefits according to a 2008 study. Assets of terminated plans are allocated to pay benefits based on a priority schedule. Participants may receive reduced benefits, with an average reduction of 28%. PBGC pays a portion of unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on recovered assets. Participants in single-employer plans trusteed by PBGC mostly receive their full benefits. In multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency without the need for plan termination. A plan is considered insolvent when available resources cannot cover plan benefits for the year or when the sponsor determines resources will not be sufficient to pay future benefits. PBGC may provide loans to multiemployer plans if available resources are insufficient to pay benefits, with loans rarely repaid. Repayment terms apply if the plan recovers from insolvency, but only one plan has repaid financial assistance. PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans, with a different guarantee ceiling than single-employer plans. The benefit guarantee limit for participants in multiemployer plans is determined by multiplying a flat dollar rate by years of service. For a participant with 30 years of service, the guaranteed limit is $12,870. PBGC estimated in 2015 that 79% of participants in multiemployer plans receiving financial assistance received their full benefit. Among multiemployer plans, 79% of participants receiving financial assistance get their full benefit, but only 49% would in plans needing assistance in the future. Ongoing plans have larger benefits than terminated ones, indicating potential benefit reductions for future PBGC-assisted plans. PBGC's financial status is often measured by its net financial position. PBGC's financial status is measured by its net financial position, which was -$51.4 billion at the end of FY2018. Assets were $112.3 billion, liabilities were $163.7 billion. Main assets include the trust fund and revolving funds, while main liabilities are estimated. PBGC's financial status is measured by its net financial position, which was -$51.4 billion at the end of FY2018. The main liabilities are the estimated present values of future benefits payments in the single-employer program and future financial assistance to insolvent plans in the multiemployer program. PBGC has had an end of fiscal year deficit each year since FY2002, with the single-employer program having a deficit of $23.3 billion by the end of 2004 due to large and expensive plan terminations. The PBGC reported a deficit of $23.3 billion in FY2004, with the single-employer program showing a surplus in FY2018. The multiemployer program is projected to become insolvent in FY2025, with a less than 1% chance of solvency in FY2026. Both programs are considered high-risk by the GAO, with approximately 825,000 participants receiving monthly payments in FY2015. In FY2015, 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC. The average monthly payment was $536, with retiree payees receiving $606 on average and beneficiary payees receiving $307. Approximately 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment, averaging $2,054. PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus in FY1996 for the first time, peaking at $9.7 billion in FY2000. In FY2018, PBGC's single-employer program had a surplus of $2.44 billion, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. Financial assistance was provided to seventy-eight multiemployer plans from FY1995 to FY2018. The financial condition of the multiemployer insurance program has been deteriorating, with a deficit that increased from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017 before decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. Approximately 62,300 multiemployer plan participants received financial assistance in FY2018, with 27,800 expected to receive benefits in the future. The deficit of the multiemployer insurance program increased from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017 before decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. PBGC's budgetary cash flows are based on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and trust and revolving funds. Trust fund assets come from pension plans PBGC oversees, while revolving funds contain plan sponsor premiums and trust fund transfers for participant benefits. The PBGC manages assets of terminated pension plans in a nonbudgetary trust fund, with investments in U.S. Treasury securities. The trust fund's assets are not included in the federal budget or balance sheet. Private-sector money managers handle the assets based on PBGC's investment policy, with a 30% allocation to equities and 70% to fixed income. Total trust fund investments amount to $70.2 billion. The PBGC manages assets in a nonbudgetary trust fund with investments in U.S. Treasury securities. Trust fund investments totaled $70.2 billion at the end of FY2018. ERISA authorized seven revolving funds for PBGC, but only three are used. Revolving funds contain premiums from pension plan sponsors and transfers from the trust fund to pay benefits. Investments in revolving funds are exclusively in U.S. Treasury securities, with assets totaling $1.8 billion at the end of FY2018. The PBGC manages assets in a nonbudgetary trust fund with investments in U.S. Treasury securities totaling $70.2 billion at the end of FY2018. The revolving funds' assets were $33.2 billion for Fund 1, Fund 2, and Fund 7 combined. Increases or decreases in the revolving funds impact on-budget federal receipts and outlays, with gross outlays including benefit payments and administrative expenses, and receipts including premiums, interest on federal securities, and reimbursements from the trust fund. Some stakeholders criticize recent PBGC premium increases as they are seen as increases in federal revenue. In its FY2017 Projections Report, PBGC estimated its financial condition over the next 10 years, projecting a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years. The report indicated the multiemployer program is likely to run out of money in FY2025. Policymakers criticize PBGC premium increases, feeling they offset federal spending and may discourage employers from maintaining DB pension plans. PBGC projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years. There is a high probability of the multiemployer program becoming insolvent before FY2025, with a $53.8 billion exposure to future financial assistance. Premium levels may not be enough to support insolvent plans, potentially exhausting PBGC's ability to guarantee benefits. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to sustain through premium collections only, avoiding the need for financial assistance from PBGC. Insolvent plans would be required to reduce benefits to levels that could be sustained through premium collections only. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a new joint select committee to address concerns about the solvency of multiemployer pension plans. PBGC indicated uncertainty about how benefit suspensions and plan partitions under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act would impact their financial assistance. The Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans was tasked with improving pension plan solvency and PBGC. However, no report with recommendations was released by the deadline. Historical data on single-employer and multiemployer program premium levels is provided in tables A-1 and A-2."
