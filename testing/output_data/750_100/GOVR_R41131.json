    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Congress rejected proposals to terminate the program in previous budgets. In FY2011, the Administration's budget proposed to terminate the alternate engine program for the F-35 fighter. Congress eliminated funding for the program, leading to the end of the F136 engine development by General Electric and Rolls-Royce. The Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine as the winner of the JSF competition in 2001. DOD plans to purchase 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. In FY1996, Congress mandated the development of an alternate engine for the F-35, resulting in the creation of the F136 engine by General Electric and Rolls-Royce. The F135 and F136 engines were designed to be interchangeable without modifying the F-35 airframe. Despite initial attempts to terminate the alternate engine program in FY2007, Congress restored funding due to potential cost savings from competition. The alternate engine program for the F-35 was terminated by DOD in 2011 after Congress rejected funding for it. Supporters of the termination argued that developing a second engine would significantly increase costs for the F-35 program. The F-35 program office stated that a cost increase due to production economies of scale would reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured, potentially leading to cuts in future capabilities and force structure. Procuring a second engine would increase F-35 life-cycle operation and support costs, posing challenges for maintenance on aircraft carriers. Having a second engine is deemed unnecessary to sustain international interest in the F-35. The F-35 program does not require a second engine to maintain international interest, as key buyers are already committed due to the aircraft's capabilities and cost. Congress accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets, including powerplants and airframes. While there is a risk of fleet grounding with a single airframe design, this is a known issue that has been managed in the past. The F-35 program does not need a backup engine as risks of fleet grounding are acceptable to Congress and DOD. Development of the F135 engine has progressed enough to not require an alternate engine program. Fixes for past test failures have been identified and implemented. Opponents argue that terminating the alternate engine program does not comply with FY2008 defense regulations. Terminating the alternate engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter does not comply with FY2008 defense regulations requiring the development and procurement of 2 propulsion system options. The development and competitive production of a second engine for the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) is essential to avoid grounding the entire fleet in case of engine problems. Having a second engine option would allow for competition in procurement and support, potentially reducing costs compared to a sole-source procurement. Having a second engine for the F-35 is crucial to avoid fleet grounding in case of engine issues. Competition in procurement and support can reduce costs compared to sole-source procurement. It would also lead to better engine performance, increased reliability, and improved contractor responsiveness. Two production lines would allow for quicker production surges and maintain competition in future tactical aircraft engine development. The F-35 program could benefit from having a second engine in production to sustain international interest and maximize exports. Potential foreign buyers would prefer having a choice in engines and competition in production to lower costs. The alternate engine program was terminated by DOD in 2011. The F136 engine program, developed by General Electric and Rolls-Royce, was terminated in 2011. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for work related to the F-35 program. Over $200 million worth of F136 hardware is located in 17 facilities. The $7.3 billion funding for the F-35 program included $6.1 billion for F135 System Development and Demonstration work. The F135 SDD contract cost increased to $6.7 billion by September 2009, with $0.8 billion in cost growth and $1.1 billion for expanded work scope. The General Electric/Rolls-Royce alternate engine team received $2.4 billion for SDD work for the F136 engine. Between FY1995 and FY2009, $1.7 billion was allocated for SDD work on the F136 engine. The F136 team did not work on STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were developed under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. The F136 SDD contract had fewer test hours and ground test engines. The government operated under continuing resolutions until the final FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act was enacted on April 15, 2011. During the period of a continuing resolution in FY2011, the government faced questions about funding for the alternate engine program. The CR set DOD spending at FY2010 levels, including base budget and military construction, with reductions for BRAC funding not requested in FY2011. During the FY2011 continuing resolution, the alternate engine program was funded at FY2010 levels until a stop-work order was issued on March 24, 2011. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified about the funding situation at a hearing on February 3, 2010. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified that Congress added $1.8 billion for the program, with an additional $2.9 billion projected over the next five years. He stated that having a second engine would provide little advantage to taxpayers as most customers would only buy one engine. The Marine Corps and Navy planned to use only one airplane due to limited logistics space. The Air Force plans to use only one airplane due to limited logistics space. The F135 engine program is progressing well with 13,000 hours of testing completed out of 14,700. The F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing, and there are concerns about encountering similar development problems as the first engine. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley mentioned that the benefits of a second engine are not clear. The Air Force is hesitant about investing in a second engine for the F-35 due to uncertainties regarding the costs and benefits. General Norton Schwartz highlighted the advancements in engine technology over the years as a reason for not needing an alternate engine like the F-15 and F-16. The Air Force is cautious about investing in a second engine for the F-35 due to uncertainties about costs and benefits. General Norton Schwartz emphasized advancements in engine technology as a reason for not needing an alternate engine like the F-15 and F-16. General Schwartz commented on funding for the alternate engine on October 12, 2010, expressing concerns about the potential impact on the number of F-35s available for the Air Force and the Department of Defense. Rolls and GE are confident in their product's success but should invest more in the $1.9 billion bill for taxpayers. Adm. Roughead supports a single engine for carriers, while Gen. Cartwright questions the need for an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, suggesting more Predators instead. The Air Force is hesitant about a second engine for the F-35 due to cost uncertainties and General Schwartz's belief in engine technology advancements. The question of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter revolves around the cost of developing and maintaining a second engine infrastructure for competition. The upfront investment needed for a competitive alternative must be weighed against potential long-term benefits in terms of lower prices induced by competition. The Administration believed the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter was no longer needed as a hedge against failure. The Office of Management and Budget stated that financial benefits from competition were small due to high costs, leading to estimated near-term savings of over a billion dollars. At a May 20, 2009 hearing, GAO testified that competitive pressures could yield savings to offset costs over the JSF program's life. An additional investment of $3.5 to $4.5 billion may be required for the JSF alternate engine program, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent. A competitive strategy could result in savings exceeding that amount across the engine's life cycle. The \"Great Engine War\" of the 1980s resulted in significant savings for acquisition and operation costs, with a total of about 21 percent in overall life cycle costs. Nonfinancial benefits of competition include better performance and increased reliability. Cost has been a major issue in the alternate engine debate, with proponents pointing to cost growth in the F135 engine. Proponents of the alternate engine argue that a competitor is needed to control costs, citing a 24% cost increase in the F135 engine. Secretary Gates acknowledged cost growth in developmental aircraft but stated that the issues with the engine are manageable with additional funding for program risk reduction. Fixing engine problems is manageable, not worth funding a second engine. DOD created a Joint Assessment Team in July 2009 to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure for the F135 engine. The team's charter includes understanding production costs, drivers, projections, and developing a plan for cost and affordability. DOD has not granted CRS access to the information. The Pentagon conducted a study on adding a second engine to the F-35 Lightning II program, finding that the costs would be similar to sticking with a single-source plan. This supports the Defense Department's decision to reject proposals for a competitive engine acquisition strategy. The estimated costs were projected to be equivalent to a sole-source scenario, as explained in a memo sent to lawmakers on Feb. 25. The JSF 'Alternate Engine Cost/Benefit Analysis' memo sent to lawmakers on Feb. 25 concluded that the potential cost savings from two competing F-35 engine programs do not justify the need for a second engine. Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for additional engines, flight testing, and production improvements for the F135 engine in February 2011. The JSF 'Alternate Engine Cost/Benefit Analysis' memo concluded that the potential cost savings from two competing F-35 engine programs do not justify the need for a second engine. Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for additional engines, flight testing, and production improvements for the F135 engine in February 2011. Approximately $400 million of this funding was allocated for engine improvements, with a focus on parts specific to the vertical-lift F-35B. About a third of the planned improvements are required to meet the original propulsion-system specification, while two-thirds aim to exceed the specification and enhance the design's robustness. Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act directed three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program. The Cost Analysis Improvement Group (CAIG), Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), and GAO conducted cost analyses of the F-35 engine program in 2007. They had differing conclusions on financial break-even points for an alternate engine program but agreed on non-financial benefits like fleet readiness and international relations. The CAIG study analyzed engine competitions for the Air Force F-16 and Navy/Marine Corps F/A-18 programs, as well as the sole-source procurement of the Pratt & Whitney F-119 engine for the F-22. The study favored a dual-source approach and assumed positive cost performance for the second F-35 engine provider (General Electric/Rolls-Royce). The CAIG study estimated that a second F-35 engine provider would match the pricing of the initial provider in 2014, with a 5% immediate price decrease and a steeper cost reduction for subsequent engines. A 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs over the program's lifetime was needed to break even. The CAIG study found that a 25.6% reduction in engine procurement costs would be needed for the DOD to break even on the alternate engine development program by 2040. The study suggested that competing engine operations and support contracts would be necessary to achieve these savings, but expressed skepticism about reaching the target. The CAIG study highlighted the growth potential in the F-35 engine, estimating weight growth between Critical Design Review and Initial Operational Capability. Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine was nearing its temperature limits, requiring modifications for increased thrust compared to the F136 engine. The IDA study examined engine competition for the F-16 and F/A-18 programs, estimating a 11% to 18% savings with an F-35 engine competition. An alternate engine program for the F-35 would cost $8.8 billion in constant FY2006 dollars. The IDA study concluded that it would not be feasible to recoup the $8.8 billion investment costs of an alternate engine program for the F-35 through procurement-cost savings alone. To break even on an NPV basis, a 40% procurement-cost savings would be needed, which was deemed unrealistic. The study suggested that if engine O&S contracts were also competed, the required savings would decrease to 18%. The lack of historical data on linking procurement and O&S costs was noted as a challenge in estimating potential O&S savings. The study highlighted contractor responsiveness as the primary motivation for the Great Engine War. The study emphasized contractor responsiveness as the main driver behind the Great Engine War. It suggested that having an alternate engine for the F-35 could prevent the entire fleet from being grounded due to engine issues. The study indicated that increased industry responsiveness to engine upgrades could significantly improve fleet readiness. Cost savings of 10.3% to 12.3% would be needed for the alternate engine program to break even, with potential savings of up to 20% from past engine competitions. The study concluded that financial savings of up to 20% have been seen in past engine competitions. It is believed that the alternate engine program will break even by the late 2020s. Despite marginal financial benefits, the DOD's program management advisory group recommended continuing the alternate engine program for its non-financial benefits. The size of the F-35 production run can impact reaching a calculated break-even point. The size of the F-35 production run can affect reaching a break-even point for an alternate engine program. U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on procurement numbers and engine choices play a significant role in determining the production run size, which can change over many years due to international security factors. The F-35 production run size is uncertain due to changes in international security and defense budgets. GE/Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney made offers to build F136 and F135 engines at fixed prices after initial lots, with differing contract types. The DOD declined a fixed-price offer from GE/Rolls-Royce for F135 engines. Pratt & Whitney and DOD agreed on a fixed-price contract for F135s for F-35s in Low Rate Initial Production Lot IV, with costs 16% lower than the previous lot. A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2006 outlines production, sustainment, and development of the JSF. The Section III Scope of Work for the JSF Air System includes production of the JSF Air Vehicle with propulsion systems F135 and F136. The MOU for JSF System Development and Demonstration includes development of primary and alternate propulsion systems, subject to funding availability. The PSFD MOU provision for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 remains valid, contingent on U.S. and partner nation funds availability. The Department will uphold its JSF SDD and PSFD MOU obligations, despite the exclusion of F136 in RDT&E funding requests. There are no plans to amend the MOUs, regardless of the U.S. FY10 authorization and appropriation process. Other European countries, like the Netherlands, have firms involved in F135 production. European countries, including the Netherlands, have firms involved in both the F135 and F136 programs. The position of partner nations on the need for the second engine may change based on their economic interests. British Secretary of State for Defence supported the F136, expressing concerns about the long-term costs of canceling the second engine. The F135 engine for the JSF program experienced failures during ground testing due to \"high-cycle fatigue,\" delaying the first flight of the F-35B aircraft. Malfunctions delayed the first flight of the F-35B aircraft by a month or two, with engine failures leading to a reported cost overrun of up to $850 million in the F135 program. Pratt & Whitney identified a worn bushing as the cause of damage to an F135 engine during testing. The F136 engine also encountered three test incidents. The F136 engine encountered three test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor, impact damage to turbine blades, and damage to fan and compressor. GE initiated design changes to address issues, while some F135 engines were replaced due to a possible misassembly issue. Pratt & Whitney confirms that a 'small number' of F135 test and production engines have been replaced with spares since March due to a possible misassembly issue identified in a ground-test engine at Arnold Engineering Development Center in Tennessee. Further checks revealed the same problem in other engines. In July 2009, then-JSF program manager criticized Pratt & Whitney for quality control deficiencies. Heinz criticized Pratt & Whitney for quality control issues leading to a 24% increase in F135 costs. Pratt & Whitney defended, stating only a few parts had high scrap rates, with some reaching 70-80% yield rate. William Begert, VP of business development, refuted claims of a 50% scrap rate, citing a 97% success rate for the total engine. A General Electric F136 engine exceeded thrust requirements in testing. Pratt & Whitney plans to test a higher-thrust F135. The decision to continue or terminate the alternate engine program is a key issue for Congress. The alternate engine program's funding sources, including Congressional appropriations from existing F-35 program funds and DOD topline increases, may impact other DOD programs if funds are reallocated within F-35 budget lines. The alternate engine program's funding sources could impact other DOD programs, potentially reducing the number of F-35s procured. Funding the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine from within the existing JSF budget may result in fewer F-35s over the next five years. Congress may need to decide whether to continue the alternate engine program at the expense of F-35 procurement. The alternate engine program's funding sources could impact other DOD programs, potentially reducing the number of F-35s procured. DOD's Joint Assessment Team found that fielding and supporting two F-35 engines would cost about the same as one engine due to past appropriations. An additional $2.9 billion over six years is needed to develop the F136 engine for competition. The $2.9 billion needed to develop the F136 engine for competition does not have a detailed estimate and could vary based on different assumptions. Supporters of the F136 engine point to a study showing the upfront cost of development. The upfront cost of developing the F136 engine may be balanced over the program's life by savings from competition, a point of disagreement in studies. Competition provides a check on cost growth and influences contract negotiations. Congress must decide which assumptions to believe. The F136 engine development cost may be offset by competition savings. Congress must weigh the risk of a single engine type for F-35 fleet grounding against the benefits of a second engine option. Marine Corps grounded Harriers in 2000 due to engine issues. The Marine Corps grounded 106 AV-8B Harriers in July 2000 due to a faulty engine bearing causing a crash. Engine issues accounted for 18% of Navy groundings from 1997 to 2006 and led to the Air Force standing down two fleets between 1990 and 2006. DOD argues that terminating the F136 alternate engine program poses minimal operational risk, citing past decisions to pursue alternate engines for other aircraft when dissatisfied with existing engines. They claim that current conditions do not warrant the need for a second engine option. The DOD argues that advanced software and technology can reduce operational risks by allowing engines to diagnose their own condition and notify pilots of impending failures. This advanced warning could give pilots time to land before a failure occurs, leading to more efficient maintenance procedures. Operational and logistical issues may complicate the use of multiple engines even if the costs are the same as supporting one. The Navy and Air Force face operational and logistical challenges in using multiple engines due to limited facilities and space constraints. Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz expressed concerns about the practicality of having an alternate engine solely for the Air Force, as other entities like the Navy and European partners are unlikely to operate two engines. The Air Force has experience supporting multiple engine types for single-airframe fleets with the F-16 and F-15. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for one service or the entire F-35 buy. General Electric's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engines could be affected if the F136 engine is terminated. General Electric's strong position in the market for commercial aircraft engines and its involvement in building and maintaining engines for military aircraft, including the F400 series for Navy and Marine Corps aircraft. The debate revolves around whether the Pentagon should fund GE to compete with Pratt for future fighter aircraft engines. General Electric's strong position in the commercial engine market was highlighted in a CAIG study. The study compared General Electric's production of 1,000 commercial engines in 2007 to Pratt & Whitney's production of 220 engines. General Electric derives 15% of its business from military engines, while Pratt & Whitney derives 50% from military engines. The study raised concerns about General Electric's ability to design and produce fighter engines if the F136 program was terminated. The CAIG study of 2007 warned that ending the F136 engine program could hinder General Electric's ability to compete for military engine contracts and disrupt the F-35 engine spare parts supply chain. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 engines may create uncertainty for suppliers. The termination of the F136 engine program could disrupt the F-35 engine spare parts supply chain and hinder General Electric's ability to compete for military engine contracts. Maintaining competition between the F135 and F136 engines may create uncertainty for suppliers, but studies suggest that the U.S. industrial base may not be irreparably harmed if the F136 engine is terminated. The termination of the F136 engine program raises concerns about DOD placing all fighter engine production with a firm lacking commercial market presence. An IDA study suggested that the U.S. industrial base would benefit from an active F136 program. Some argue that the Great Engine War participants believe in the importance of competition. The termination of the F136 engine program raises concerns about DOD placing all fighter engine production with a firm lacking commercial market presence. The Great Engine War competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney improved engine development. Congress may consider the industrial policy implications of choosing one or two engines. The F-35's engine must be competitively developed and procured, with language preserving existing F136 engines and allowing contractor-funded research and development. No funds for F-35 propulsion system improvements can be used unless competitive procurement is ensured. The F-35's propulsion system must undergo performance improvements, defined as increasing airflow volume or thrust for better takeoff and vertical load bring back. Competitive development and production are required for these improvements. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system to ensure its restart after idleness and long-term sustainment. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the preservation and storage of F136 propulsion system property to ensure its restart and long-term sustainment. This includes identifying costs of restarting development, allowing for use by contractors for research and development, and identifying any necessary contract modifications or funding. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the preservation and storage of F136 propulsion system property to ensure its restart and long-term sustainment, including identifying costs, allowing for contractor use, and determining necessary contract modifications or funding. None of the authorized amounts for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program may be used for destroying or disposing of the property. A report must be submitted to the congressional defense committees within 45 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report to Congress on the plan for the preservation of F136 propulsion system property. The committee supports the contractor's efforts to continue development and testing of the system despite the program's cancellation by the Department of Defense. The committee supports the competitive alternative to the F136 program for the Joint Strike Fighter, emphasizing better engine performance and operational readiness. The Administration objects to limiting funds for performance improvements to the F-35 propulsion system. The committee supports competitive development and production of the F-35 Lightning II propulsion system. The Administration objects to limiting funds for performance improvements to the system, citing potential destabilization of the program. Section 215 could delay main engine development and impact the viability of the short takeoff and vertical landing variant. The Administration objects to continuing the extra engine program for the F-35 Lightning II, citing unnecessary expenses and potential veto if included in the final bill. They also oppose a new requirement for storing and preserving property developed under the F136 program, stating it would add costs and be burdensome. The Senate passed S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language prohibiting funds for the F136 engine research, development, test, and evaluation. The Senate passed S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language prohibiting funds for the F136 engine research, development, test, and evaluation. The conference report on H.R. 1540 included language regarding preservation of F136 assets, with the Secretary of Defense developing a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract. The Senate passed S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language prohibiting funds for the F136 engine research, development, test, and evaluation. The conference report on H.R. 1540 included language regarding preservation of F136 assets, with the Secretary of Defense developing a plan for the disposition of property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract. The current chunk discusses the long-term sustainment, repair, and disposal of property related to the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program, outlining specific criteria for handling and storing identified property either at government facilities or contractor sites. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for handling property acquired under the F136 propulsion system development contract, including identifying necessary contract modifications and funding. No funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program can be used for destroying or disposing of this property until a report is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to the congressional defense committees within 120 days detailing the plan for maximizing the benefits of the investment in the F136 engine. The House passed H.R. 2219 without funds for the F-35 alternate engine, and the Senate Appropriations Committee later reported on this issue. The committee report accompanying H.R. 2219 did not include funding or language for the F-35 alternate engine. The 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, also had no funds for the alternate engine. The Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference made no references to the program. Appendix A details the legislative history of the F-35 alternate engine program from FY1996-FY2010. The appendix provides final bill language and committee and conference report language from FY1996-FY2010 for the F-35 alternate engine program, previously known as the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act authorized funds for the JAST program and required a report on the program. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act required a report on the JAST program and limited the obligation of funds until the report is submitted. $7 million was allocated for competitive engine concepts for the program. The report also included requirements for the JAST program and other combat aircraft. The Senate report questioned the program's ability to meet needs. The Senate report (S.Rept. 104-112) raised concerns about the JAST program's ability to meet the needs of the three services and directed the inclusion of two separate approaches to reduce program risk. It also mandated the evaluation of at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies. The conferees echoed these concerns and directed the Under Secretary of Defense to ensure adequate engine competition in the program plan. The conferees directed the Secretary of Defense to ensure adequate engine competition in the JAST program plan and to include plans for competitive engine programs and demonstrator aircraft in the required report. Authorization of funds for competitive engine concepts was recommended, including $7.0 million. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on the JAST program emphasized the importance of supporting competitive propulsion programs to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The committee directed the Secretary of Defense to evaluate at least two propulsion concepts from competing engine companies for the full scale, full thrust aircraft demonstrators. The House Appropriations Committee report on the JAST program highlighted the challenges in developing new fighter engines, citing dissatisfaction with engine performance in early model F-14s and F-15s/F-16s. The Navy upgraded F-14s with an Air Force engine, while the Air Force spent over a billion on engine improvements. The House Appropriations Committee report on the JAST program noted challenges in developing new fighter engines, citing dissatisfaction with engine performance in early model F-14s and F-15s/F-16s. Over a billion dollars was spent to bring a second engine manufacturer for future Air Force fighter aircraft. The new engine for the F-22 is undergoing a redesign due to technical problems. The JAST program aims to build a common aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, but has selected a single unproven power plant design. Given past engine performance difficulties, this decision is deemed unwise. The Committee believes it is imperative for the JAST program to actively pursue an engine design from a second manufacturer and has provided an additional $20,000,000 only for this purpose. The committee directs that remaining competition funds for the JAST program be rebaselined to ensure integration into the preferred weapons system concept. The DOD Appropriation Act (H.R. 3610 / P.L. 104-208) included funding for the program, with an increase recommended by the House Appropriations Committee. The Committee recommends $602,100,000 for the Navy account to accelerate development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. This increase is part of a program to develop a demonstrator engine and integrate it into selected weapon systems contractor concepts. In 1998, the Secretary of Defense must report to Congress on the production and fielding sequence of joint strike fighter variants. The report must include a certification of sufficient funding for an alternate engine development program. The House Armed Services Committee discussed the JSF program in their report on H.R. 1119. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about the lack of funding for the alternative fighter engine in the 1997 FYDP for the JSF program. They emphasized the importance of a fully developed and flight-tested AFE to reduce program risks and control costs. The Secretary of Defense was directed to provide a funding report by February 15, 1998. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on the JSF program recommended an increase in funding for the alternative engine, emphasizing the need for a fully developed and flight-tested AFE to reduce program risks and control costs. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a $28.0 million budget increase for the alternative engine program in the FY1999 Defense Authorization Act. This was to accelerate the program with the Department's support in fiscal year 1999 and beyond. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a budget increase for the alternative engine program to accelerate the naval variant of the JSF. The committee noted the timely submission of Department of Defense priorities and plans, but expressed concerns about the continuous delays in demonstrating the alternate engine in a JSF airframe. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a budget increase of $15.0 million to accelerate the development of an alternative engine for the JSF due to continuous delays in demonstrating the engine in a JSF airframe. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a budget increase of $15.0 million to accelerate the development of an alternative engine for the JSF program. The committee expressed concerns about the Department's funding levels not enabling cost-efficient and timely completion of the effort. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a budget increase of $15.0 million to accelerate the development of an alternative engine for the JSF program. The committee expressed concerns about the Department's funding levels not enabling cost-efficient and timely completion of the effort. Meanwhile, the Department is conducting other jet engine development efforts in PE 27268F as part of the aircraft engine CIP, with a requested funding increase of $66.6 million to reduce backlog of proposed engineering tasks for currently fielded engines. The committee does not prioritize this program over the development of a new state-of-the-art alternative engine for JSF. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a budget increase of $15.0 million for accelerating the development of an alternative engine for the JSF program. This funding is directed towards the acceleration of alternate engine development for JSF, with a total recommended budget of $130.2 million in PE 27268F and $265.4 million in PE 63800F. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a budget increase of $15.0 million for accelerating the development of an alternative engine for the JSF program, bringing the total Air Force authorization to $250.4 million. This funding aims to reduce risk and accelerate the development of the alternate engine for the joint strike fighter. The conference report on the FY2001 Defense Authorization Act discussed concerns about additional contractor funding required for the JSF program. Both competing contractors realize the significance of winner selection, but the conferees are opposed to industry making unreimbursed investments beyond what is required. The conferees require industry to make additional investments in the JSF program beyond existing agreements, including funding for risk mitigation projects like the alternate engine. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 4205 discussed the JSF program and concerns about the \"winner take all\" strategy. The committee supports the continuation of the JSF alternate engine program to ensure the health of the fighter aircraft engine industrial base in any proposed restructure of the acquisition program for JSF. The committee recommends funding to accelerate the development of the alternate engine for the JSF program to reduce risk to production and fielding. They support an increase in funding for this purpose, totaling $299.5 million in PE 64800F, $131.6 million in PE 63800N, $296.0 million in PE 64800N, and $144.5 million in PE 63800F. The Senate Appropriations Committee report on the JSF program discussed the Alternate Engine Program (AEP) and emphasized that no funds should be diverted from the existing AEP plan. The FY2002 Defense Authorization Act conference report also addressed the JSF program. The report on S. 1438 discusses the JSF program and expresses concerns about technical risks associated with the aircraft engine. It emphasizes the need to integrate the alternate engine within the EMD program before full rate production. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 2586 also addresses the JSF alternate engine program and funding allocation. The budget request for the JSF program included $769.5 million for the engineering and manufacturing development phase, but no funds were allocated to reduce development schedule risk for the alternate engine common hardware components. The JSF program aims to develop a family of aircraft for the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and allies with commonality among variants to minimize life cycle costs. The JSF joint program office has encouraged two engine manufacturers to collaborate on co-developing propulsion components for the F-119 engine and the F-120 alternate engine. The committee recommends an increase of $10.0 million in funding to reduce development schedule risk of the JSF alternate engine common hardware components. The committee recommended an increase of $10.0 million to reduce development schedule risk of the JSF alternate engine common hardware components. Additionally, the FY2003 DOD Appropriations Act allocated $29,750,000 for the Joint Strike Fighter Interchangeable Engine Program to maintain two competing engine programs for the Joint Strike Fighter. The FY2004 Defense Authorization Act also supported this initiative. The committee recommended an increase of $56 million for the JSF program to continue the development of the interchangeable engine on its original schedule. The report emphasized the importance of making the engine available for competitive procurement as early as possible to avoid a two-year delay. The Department of Defense should adjust the Future Years Defense Program to restore the original interchangeable engine schedule. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern over a $56 million reduction in research and development for the F136 Interchangeable Engine in fiscal year 2004. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends a $56 million cut to the Joint Strike Fighter program, excluding the F136 engine program. They also suggest restoring the cut to the F136 Interchangeable Engine program in fiscal year 2004. The Committee has added $20,000,000 to the F136 Interchangeable Engine program for risk reduction in the JSF program. Congress mandated funding for an alternate engine program to maintain competition for the JSF engine. The JSF Joint Program Office is working on interchangeable engines. The committee directs the JSF JPO to compete for interchangeable engines, maintaining PW F135 and GE F136 interchangeability. The FY2006 Defense Authorization Act mandated funding for engine competition in the JSF program. The committee ensured funding for the JSF competitive engine development program in the FY2006 budget despite some military services' attempts to eliminate it. They believe a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF would be cost-effective and operationally efficient. The Secretary of Defense, along with the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force, are expected to remain committed to developing competitive engines for the JSF. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 5122 / P.L. 109-364) mandates the development of two interchangeable propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft by two separate contractors throughout its life cycle. The Secretary is prohibited from making modifications to the acquisition program for the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft that would change the propulsion system, unless specific conditions are met, including notification to congressional defense committees and submission of required reports. Funds are appropriated for the independent cost analysis of the Joint Strike Fighter engine program by the Comptroller General, a federally funded research and development center, and the Cost Analysis Improvement Group of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The analysis will cover alternatives for the aircraft using the F135 engine only. The Joint Strike Fighter program is considering alternatives for the aircraft's propulsion system, including using the F135 engine only, a firm-fixed price contract for a selected propulsion system, or a competitive engine selection process. Reports on these alternatives are due by March 15, 2007. The Secretary of Defense, Comptroller General, and CEO of the research center will submit reports on cost analysis for the Joint Strike Fighter program's propulsion system alternatives by March 15, 2007. Reports will include key assumptions, methodology, and a comparison of life-cycle costs. The reports on cost analysis for the Joint Strike Fighter program's propulsion system alternatives will include a comparison of life-cycle costs, estimates of manpower required, flight hours needed for engine maturity, total engines expected to be procured, and evaluation of benefits beyond cost like improved performance and technology innovation. The curr_chunk discusses acquisition strategies for engines for tactical fighter aircraft, including past programs for the F-15, F-16, F-18, and F-22 aircraft. It also compares experiences under past sole-source acquisition programs and the potential impact of canceling the F136 competitive engine on the military engine industrial base and the Department of Defense's capabilities. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of canceling the F136 competitive engine on the military engine industrial base and the Department of Defense's ability to make competitive engine choices for future combat aircraft systems. The report required by paragraph (3) must include certifications regarding access to sufficient information for informed judgments. The curr_chunk defines lifecycle costs for defense acquisition programs, including engine procurement and estimates of routine engine costs. The House Armed Services Committee report on the JSF program is also discussed. The budget request for the Department of the Air Force and Department of the Navy includes funding for the development of the joint strike fighter (JSF), also known as the F-35. The request does not allocate funds for research and development of a second aircraft tire source for the JSF or for an alternate JSF engine. The JSF alternate engine program is working on the F136 engine as an alternative to the planned F135 engine. The committee expressed the need for a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF in the National Defense Authorization Report for Fiscal Year 2006. They were disappointed that the budget did not include funds for an alternate JSF engine beyond 2006. The Under Secretary of Defense acknowledged the benefits of a second supplier during a hearing in March 2006. The committee requested the Government Accountability Office to review the Department of Defense's analysis on terminating the JSF alternate engine program due to high financial costs. The GAO witness reported that the analysis only focused on potential savings for engine acquisition and did not fully consider savings from competition for support services. The committee concurs with GAO's observation that potential savings from competition for maintenance and operations over the engine's lifecycle should be considered. They recommend an increase of $408.0 million to continue the JSF alternate engine program for fiscal year 2007. Additionally, a provision is recommended to obligate not less than $408.0 million for the program. The committee recommends allocating $408.0 million for the continued development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. They also propose a provision for independent analyses of the JSF alternate engine program to be conducted by March 15, 2007. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on S. 2766 emphasizes the need for modernization and transformation of the armed forces to confront irregular warfare threats. The Department has already made significant progress in this area since 2001, even during times of war. The committee supports the Department's transformational activities, including authorizing funds for the construction of eight ships totaling $12.1 billion and promoting coordinated joint development, procurement, and operation of unmanned systems. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on S. 2766 emphasizes the need for modernization and transformation of the armed forces to confront irregular warfare threats. The report authorizes funds for various defense programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter engine development, Army's Future Combat Systems program, and science and technology programs. The committee highlights the importance of developing capabilities for coalition operations and addresses past concerns about engine competition in the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Senate Armed Services Committee report emphasized the need for modernization of the armed forces and authorized funds for defense programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter engine development. The committee expressed concerns about the Department's proposal to eliminate the F136 alternate engine, citing operational and financial risks of relying on a single engine provider for multiple missions. The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized funds for defense programs, including the Joint Strike Fighter engine development, to address operational and financial risks. The committee recommended provisions for the development of the interchangeable engine and sustaining the program with two competitive propulsion systems. The committee recommends continuing the development of the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems or entering into a firm-fixed-price contract for a selected propulsion system. Pratt & Whitney was the sole provider of engines for certain aircraft in the past due to engine problems leading to aircraft loss and degraded readiness. Congress directed the Department of Defense to develop and produce an engine to compete with Pratt & Whitney engines for certain aircraft due to engine problems. The competition resulted in improved performance, reduced risk, increased readiness, lower cost of ownership, and over $4.0 billion of cost savings. Congress consistently supported a competitive engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter. In 1996, Congress supported a competitive engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter, the largest acquisition program in Department of Defense history. Concerns were raised about relying on a sole engine supplier for a single-engine aircraft, posing operational and financial risks. Total JSF deliveries could exceed 4,000 aircraft worldwide, with significant propulsion business opportunities. The committee criticized the Department for not conducting a full life cycle analysis on the termination of the F136 engine, which they believe would have shown significant cost savings through competitive engine procurements. The committee recommended conducting independent life cycle cost analyses for the Joint Strike Fighter engine program to ensure that savings from competitive engine procurements will offset the cost of completing the F136 engine development. The Secretary of Defense, a federally-funded research and development center (FFRDC), and the Comptroller General will conduct independent life cycle cost analyses of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program with two competitive propulsion systems. This is to compare the costs of developing and sustaining the program with two engines versus proceeding with only one engine. The Comptroller and FFRDC must certify that they had sufficient information for informed judgments on the costs of the alternatives. The committee is concerned that the Department of Defense did not consider all costs when terminating the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. They believe having competitive propulsion systems would reduce operational risk and increase confidence. The committee recommends an increase in funding for the development of competitive propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter, specifically the F136 interchangeable engine. This is in line with the goal of reducing operational risk and achieving more affordable life cycle costs. The conference report on H.R. 5631 discussed additional funding of $170,000,000 for the development of the F-136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Under Secretary of Defense is directed to sponsor an independent cost analysis, preferably by the Institute for Defense Analyses. The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) will conduct an analysis comparing costs of the F-135 and F-136 engines, evaluating potential savings, and assessing industrial base effects. The analysis must be submitted to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007. The Institute for Defense Analyses will conduct a cost analysis comparing the F-135 and F-136 engines to determine potential savings and industrial base effects. The Department of Defense is directed to fund the development of both engines in the fiscal year 2008 budget submission. The Committee recommends an additional $200,000,000 for the development of the F-136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. An independent cost analysis of the engine program will be conducted by a federally funded research and development center. An independent cost analysis of the F-136 engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter will be conducted, including a comparison of costs, evaluation of potential savings, and effects on the industrial base. The analysis will be submitted to congressional defense committees by March 15, 2007, in support of required studies in the National Defense Authorization Act, 2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 5631 discusses the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and expresses disappointment in the lack of funding for the second engine source in the fiscal year 2007 budget request. The Committee believes it is premature to cancel the second engine source based on past experience with the F-16 Fighter program engine competition. The Senate Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 5631 expresses disappointment in the lack of funding for the second engine source in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The Committee recommends additional funding for competition in order to procure the best value engine at the lowest price, citing past success with the F-16 Fighter program engine competition. SEC. 213 of H.R. 4986 / P.L. 110-181 requires funds for developing a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter, ensuring annual expenditure for 2 options to promote competitive production. H.R. 4986, a revised version of H.R. 1585, aims to develop a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter. The House Armed Services Committee report highlighted the need for funding the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135. The committee recommended funding the F136 engine as a competitive alternative to the F135 for the Joint Strike Fighter. Congressional defense committees also supported increasing funding for the JSF competitive propulsion system. The committee recommended funding the F136 engine as a competitive alternative to the F135 for the Joint Strike Fighter. A federally funded research and development center provided an independent lifecycle cost analysis of the JSF propulsion system, including a competitive engine program by March 15, 2007. Subcommittees held a hearing on March 22, 2007, with witnesses from the Department of Defense, the Institute for Defense Analyses, and the Government Accountability Office, to discuss the findings. The studies were inconclusive on the financial benefit of developing a competitive propulsion system. The committee recommends funding the F136 engine as a competitive alternative to the F135 for the Joint Strike Fighter program. Studies identified significant non-financial factors favoring a two-engine competitive program, including better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The committee recommends an increase of $480.0 million for the JSF competitive propulsion system program. The committee recommends $1.8 billion in PE 64800N and $1.9 billion in PE 64800F, with $240.0 million allocated for the competitive JSF propulsion system program. Additionally, a provision is recommended to require the Secretary of Defense to develop and procure a competitive propulsion system for the JSF program. The committee recommends funding for the competitive JSF propulsion system program, with plans to complete development by fiscal year 2012. The Senate Armed Services Committee report discussed a proposed legislative provision regarding this requirement. The committee recommends funding for a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program, with plans to complete development by fiscal year 2012. This provision would require the Secretary of Defense to allocate necessary funds for research, development, and procurement. The budget request for the JSF propulsion system in fiscal year 2012 included $1.7 billion in PE 64800N and $1.8 billion in PE 64800F. There were no funds allocated for the development of a competitive JSF propulsion system, which is being developed as the F136 engine to provide an alternative to the current F135 engine. The Department of Defense, Comptroller General, and a research center conducted independent cost analyses of the JSF propulsion system, including a competitive engine program. Results were inconclusive on financial benefits, but non-financial factors were highlighted. The committee recommends an increase of $480.0 million for the JSF competitive propulsion system program, citing better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness as key factors. The Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 3222 recommended an increase of $200 million for F-35 production enhancements and $480 million for the development of an alternative engine for the aircraft. The report recommended $480 million for the development of an alternative engine for the aircraft, ensuring a competitive base for engine production. The fiscal year 2008 budget request includes no funding for the F-136 engine within the Joint Strike Fighter program, but the Committee recommends $480 million for this effort. The Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2007 directed the Department of Defense to fund the development of both the F-135 and F-136 engines in the fiscal year 2008 budget request. The Committee made program adjustments to fully fund the F-136 engine development program in fiscal year 2008. The fiscal year 2009 requirement for the F-136 engine is estimated to be $350 million, and the Committee directs the Department of Defense to fully fund this program in the fiscal year 2009 budget submission. The Senate Appropriations Committee report on H.R. 3222 in fiscal year 2009 discusses the JSF program and expresses disappointment in the lack of funding for an alternative engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Committee believes that engine competition leads to better performance and lower costs based on past experiences with the F-16 Fighter program. The Committee recommends additional funding for competition in the development of the F-35 engine to ensure the best value engine at the lowest price, leading to overall savings in the fighter program. The Department of Defense is directed to continue funding the development of both engines in future budget submissions. The House Armed Services report on the JSF program highlighted the lack of funds for a competitive JSF propulsion system in the budget request. Additionally, it mentioned funding for F-35 advance procurement but no funds for advance procurement of competitive JSF propulsion system components. The committee recommended increases for the JSF competitive propulsion system in two consecutive years, with support from other congressional defense committees. Despite the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, funding for the competitive JSF propulsion system was not included in the budget request. The committee expressed disappointment that the Department of Defense did not include funds for the competitive propulsion system for the JSF in the budget request, despite the requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The committee was disappointed that the Department of Defense did not allocate funds for the competitive propulsion system for the JSF in the budget request. Witnesses provided an update on the JSF propulsion system cost analysis, the competitive engine program performance, and the additional year of development. The GAO Director testified on the Department of Defense's compliance with the subcommittees' request. The Department of Defense testified that program savings of 9 to 11 percent could recoup initial investment costs, slightly lower than the GAO's 2007 report. The USD (AT&L) did not update their analysis from the previous year, stating no significant changes to the program had occurred. The committee believes that a competitive propulsion system for the JSF offers long-term savings. The currently planned F135 engine experienced hardware failures in 2007 and 2008, resulting in delays to the first flight of the F-35 STOVL variant. The committee supports a competitive JSF propulsion program for long-term benefits, despite acknowledging test failures in the F135 engine development. They believe that a two-engine competitive program will lead to improved engine performance, contractor responsiveness, industrial base strength, engine reliability, and operational readiness. The committee recommends $1.8 billion for the competitive JSF propulsion system program, including an increase of $247.5 million in PE 64800F and $1.8 billion in PE 64800N. They also suggest $167.9 million for advance procurement of long-lead components for F-35 aircraft. The Department of Defense is urged to comply with section 213 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 for continued development and procurement. The Senate Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program and the budget request for advanced procurement for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Congress directed the Department of Defense to develop a competitive propulsion system for the JSF aircraft. The Senate Armed Services Committee report recommended increasing funding by $35.0 million for long lead items for the F-136 engine to begin competition with the F-135 engine in 2012. The budget request for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program included $1,532.7 million in PE 64800N and $1,524.0 million in PE 64800F. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended increasing funding for the competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program by $215.0 million in PE 64800N and $215.0 million in PE 64800F, in response to the Department of Defense's failure to comply with the law directing the development of a competitive propulsion system. The report discusses the funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, including $1,524.0 million in PE 64800F. Congress has added $820.0 million for the competitive F136 engine to ensure fair competition. The Department of Defense froze the technology baseline of the F135 engine to incorporate the best configuration and technology available. The Department should invest in a program for the F135 and F136 engine programs to drive technology insertion and provide efficient engines. The committee recommends an increase of $430.0 million for the development of the F-136 engine to maintain a level playing field. The committee recommends an increase of $35.0 million in PE 64800F for F135 engine technology development in the FY2009 DOD Appropriations Act. The bill includes no funding for the continued development of the F-136 engine as an alternate engine within the Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2010 Defense Authorization Act includes funding for the development of the F-136 engine as an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Secretary of Defense is directed to fully fund the engine development and procurement efforts in the FY2010 budget submission. The Senate amendment in the FY2010 Defense Authorization Act increases funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. It also prohibits funds for an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 until the Secretary of Defense certifies that it will reduce costs, improve readiness, and not disrupt the F-35 program. The House bill includes a provision to limit obligations for the F-35 research, development, test, and evaluation program until certain conditions are met. This provision aims to ensure that the program is not disrupted and does not result in the procurement of fewer F-35 aircraft. The House bill includes provisions related to F-35 procurement costs and a competitive propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense is required to include necessary funding for the F-35 in annual budget requests. The conferees authorize the budget request for 30 F-35 aircraft in Aircraft Procurement, Navy, and Aircraft Procurement, Air Force. They also approve an increase of $430.0 million in RDT&E for F136 engine development and $130.0 million in Aircraft Procurement, Air Force, for F136 engine procurement. The Secretary of Defense is expected to ensure sufficient annual funding for the development and procurement of two engines. The House Armed Services Committee recommends a net reduction of $122 million in Navy aircraft procurement funding for F-35Bs and Cs, with a reduction for one aircraft and an addition for the F136 alternate engine. The House Armed Services Committee recommends a net reduction of $67 million in Air Force procurement funding for F-35As, including reductions for one aircraft and initial spares, and increases for the F136 alternate engine and spares. The House Armed Services Committee recommends a net reduction of $67 million in Air Force procurement funding for F-35As, including reductions for one aircraft and initial spares, and increases for the F136 alternate engine and spares. Additionally, there are increases in funding for F-35 spares and support equipment, Air Force advance procurement funding for the F136 alternate engine, and Navy and Air Force research and development funding for the F-35 program. The House Armed Services Committee recommends a net reduction of $67 million in Air Force procurement funding for F-35As, including reductions for one aircraft and initial spares, and increases for the F136 alternate engine and spares. H.R. 2647 contains two sections related to the F-35 alternate program: Section 218 limits the obligation of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds until certain conditions are met, and Section 242 concerns the alternate engine program. Section 218 states that not more than 75 percent of the funds for the F-35 Lightning II program may be obligated until a certain date. The House Armed Services Committee recommends a net reduction of $67 million in Air Force procurement funding for F-35As, including reductions for one aircraft and initial spares, and increases for the F136 alternate engine and spares. Section 218 limits the obligation of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds until certain conditions are met, stating that not more than 75 percent of the funds for the F-35 Lightning II program may be obligated until a certain date. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (P.L. 110-417; 122 Stat. 4376) requires the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual plan and certification for fiscal year 2010. Section 242 emphasizes the need for sufficient funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in the annual budget request. The Secretary of Defense is required to include a request for funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in the annual budget. This is emphasized in the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that the budget for the F-35 Lightning II includes funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system. This requirement is outlined in the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, with specific obligations for annual funding. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 mandates funding for the development and procurement of competitive propulsion systems for the F-35 Lightning II. This includes ensuring continued development and competitive production for the propulsion system. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections, and a repeal of a section in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is mentioned. Development funding for the F-35 program includes support for the competitive F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The committee has recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system in recent years. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, expressing disappointment in the Department of Defense for not complying with the requirement to include funds for this purpose in the budget request. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, expressing disappointment in the Department of Defense for not including funds for this purpose in the budget request. The F135 engine development program for the F-35 has experienced significant cost growth since its inception in 2002, with development costs increasing by $1.872 billion, or 38 percent, by the end of 2008. Additionally, there has been a 38 to 43 percent increase in F135 engine procurement cost estimates. Between December 2005 and December 2008, there was a significant increase in F135 engine procurement costs for the F-35C and F-35A variants, with estimates rising by approximately 38 to 43 percent. The F-35B engine procurement costs also grew by around 47 percent during the same period, attributed to both the F135 engine and the F-35B's lift fan. In contrast, the F136 engine program did not experience any cost growth, with the pre-EMD contract completed in 2004 without any cost increases. The F136 EMD contract awarded in 2005 had a cost estimate of $2.486 billion. The F136 EMD contract was awarded in 2005 with a stable cost estimate of $2.486 billion. The committee questions the Department's decision not to include an F-35 competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests, citing F135 cost growth and test failures leading to schedule delays. The committee strongly supports the continuation of the competitive F-35 propulsion system program, citing non-financial factors such as better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, and increased engine reliability. They recommend a total increase of $463.0 million for the program's development. Additionally, they suggest an aggregate increase of $140.0 million for the procurement of four F136 engines. The Administration objects to additional funding for the F-35 alternative engine program, citing delays in fielding the Joint Strike Fighter capability. The Administration opposes additional funding for the F-35 alternative engine program, citing delays in fielding the Joint Strike Fighter capability. They argue that the current engine is performing well and that expenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and impede the progress of the overall program. The alleged risks of a fleet-wide grounding due to a single engine are exaggerated, as the Air Force operates several fleets on a single-engine source. Additionally, the Administration objects to the limit on the obligation of overall JSF development funding to 75% of the amount. The Administration objects to the limit on overall JSF development funding to 75% until all funds for the alternative engine program are obligated. The President's advisors would recommend a veto if the final bill disrupts the F-35 program. Division D of the FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends a $141.45 million increase in Navy research and development funding for the F-35 program. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends a $141.45 million increase in Navy research and development funding for the F-35 program, with $219.45 million allocated for the F136 alternate engine and a $78 million reduction for excess management reserves. Additionally, there is a net increase of $141.45 million in Air Force research and development funding for the F-35 program. Section 211 of S. 1390 emphasizes the continued development of a competitive propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, with a focus on developing a competitive propulsion system for the aircraft. The Secretary of Defense must certify sufficient funds for this development before 90% of the allocated funds can be obligated. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, specifically for the development and procurement of the F136 competitive propulsion system. The committee aims to ensure the continuation of the system development and demonstration program in fiscal year 2010, with plans for completion by fiscal year 2012. The budget request includes significant funding for this purpose. The budget request included funding for the JSF program but no funds for the F136 program. The committee believes it is in the nation's best interest to continue developing the F136, despite inconclusive study results on financial benefits. The committee recommends an increase of $438.9 million for continuing the JSF competitive propulsion system program, citing significant non-financial factors such as better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, and increased engine reliability. The committee approved additional funding for the F-35 alternate engine in a full-committee markup. Senators voted 12-10 in favor, with Senators Levin, Kennedy, Byrd, and others supporting it. The Statement of Administration Policy on S. 1390 highlighted the importance of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program. The Administration strongly opposes adding $438.9 million for the alternative engine program in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program. They argue that the current engine is performing well with over 11,000 test hours and that the risks of a single engine provider are manageable based on past programs like the F-22 and F/A-18E/F. Spending on a second engine is deemed unnecessary and hinders the progress of the JSF program. The Administration opposes adding funds for the alternative engine program in the F-35 JSF program, citing the current engine's performance and manageable risks of a single engine provider. They argue that spending on a second engine is unnecessary and hinders program progress. The Senate rejected an amendment related to this issue on July 23, 2009. The Senate rejected an amendment (S.Amdt. 1767) to preserve additional research and development funding for an alternate engine program, but later adopted another amendment (S.Amdt. 1627) to remove the added funding and prohibit its expenditure. The Senate adopted an amendment (S.Amdt. 1627) to remove added funding for an alternate engine program and prohibit its expenditure until certain certifications are made by the Secretary of Defense. This aligns with the Administration's proposal to terminate the program. The committees certified sufficient funds for the development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 in FY2010, preserved additional funding for the alternate engine program, restored cuts to helicopter and F-35 program reserves, and reduced funding for the HC/MC-130 aircraft program. The FY2009 supplemental appropriations act allocated $504 million for the aircraft program. S.Amdt. 1767 requires a certification for 90% of funds for the F-35 Lightning II program in FY2010 before obligation. The certification ensures funds for the development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in fiscal year 2010. An additional $282.9 million is allocated for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement. Management reserves for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program are restored. The amount authorized for the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter programs is increased by $78 million each for management reserves. The Joint Strike Fighter program's management reserves are increased by $78 million each for the Navy and Air Force. Additionally, $438.9 million is offset from the Air Force's aircraft procurement budget for the HC/MC-130 recapitalization program. S.Amdt. 1627 aims to remove restrictions on DOD's obligation of FY2010 F-35 research and development funds. The curr_chunk discusses the certification of funds for the development of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35, prohibiting funding for an alternate engine program until certain certifications are made, eliminating additional research funding for the alternate engine program, and restoring reductions to the UH-1Y/AH-1Z helicopter program and F-35 program management. The curr_chunk discusses limitations on funding for an alternative propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, with a focus on increasing funding for the procurement of UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft and management reserves for the F-35 program. The curr_chunk discusses restrictions on funding for an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program until the Secretary of Defense certifies that it will reduce costs and improve operational readiness without disrupting the program. The curr_chunk discusses additional funding for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft procurement and restoration of management reserves for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The curr_chunk allocates an additional $78,000,000 for the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter program management reserves in the research, development, test, and evaluation budget. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill decreases funding for the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter F136 development by $219,450,000 each. This reduction is derived from the amounts available for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill reduced funding for the Navy and Air Force Joint Strike Fighter F136 development by $219,450,000 each. This decision was outlined in the explanatory statement for H.R. 3326, which was signed into law on December 19, 2009. The explanatory statement allocated $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement, including $35 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. Additionally, $2.073.1 million was designated for Air Force research and development for the Joint Strike Fighter program, with an increase of $215 million for the alternate engine program. Navy research and development funding was also specified in the explanatory statement. The explanatory statement allocated $1,956.3 million for Navy research and development funding for the Joint Strike Fighter program, including $215 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. Concerns persist regarding the progress and cost of the F-35 program, with a Joint Estimating Team reporting delays and increased costs. The Joint Estimating Team has reported delays and increased costs in the F-35 program. Despite this, the Department of Defense insists that the program is on track to meet cost and schedule goals. $6,840,478,000 is allocated for the JSF procurement program, with a directive to procure all 30 aircraft as requested in the budget. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition is tasked with providing the JET findings and recent test program studies. The JET findings on the F-35 program, along with recent studies and causes of cost growth, are to be provided to congressional defense committees by January 15, 2010. The House Appropriations Committee recommends increases in funding for Air Force procurement and Navy research and development for the F-35 program. The House Appropriations Committee recommends an increase in funding for the F-35 program, including an additional $215 million for the Air Force research and development of the alternate engine. The Committee supports realistic budgeting and expresses concern over the termination of programs before realizing benefits to taxpayers. The Committee supports increased funding for the F-35 program, including $215 million for the Air Force's alternate engine research. They believe terminating certain programs prematurely may not yield significant benefits and highlight potential payback from the presidential helicopter and Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine. The Joint Strike Fighter program plans to procure over 2,500 fifth generation stealthy aircraft for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. Originally, there were plans for two engine variants, but cost growth led to the abandonment of the alternate engine program. Currently, all F-35 variants will be powered by the same propulsion engine, raising concerns about future logistics. The Committee is concerned about potential technical problems with the F-35 engine that could ground the entire fleet of aircraft, limiting flexibility in times of crisis. They also highlight the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, which could lead to significant cost savings with over 2,500 aircraft planned for the program. The Department conducted a business case analysis comparing costs of a sole source engine provider to a dual source strategy for the engine program. Despite the costs being similar, the Committee questions the decision not to fund the alternate engine program, considering the significant investment already made. They believe a dual source strategy is the most cost-effective way to acquire the propulsion engine for the F-35 aircraft. The recommendation provides an additional $560,000,000 for the continued development and production of the alternate engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter, as a dual source engine strategy is deemed the most cost-effective method moving forward. The Secretary of Defense is directed to include funding for the alternate engine program in future budget requests. The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $130 million to produce and $430 million to continue the development of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) alternate engine, which was proposed for termination by the President. Expenditures on an alternate engine for the JSF are unnecessary and divert resources from the overall JSF program. The current engine is performing well, and the risks associated with a single engine provider are manageable. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for F-35 alternate engine development in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act. The House Armed Services Committee included $485 million for an alternate F-35 engine in H.R. 5136, with a provision limiting DOD spending until all alternate engine funds are obligated. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for F-35 alternate engine development in the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act. The House Armed Services Committee included $485 million for an alternate F-35 engine in H.R. 5136, with a provision limiting DOD spending until all alternate engine funds are obligated. SEC. 212 of the Act limits the obligation of funds for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program until certification is provided by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. The bill includes a limitation on the procurement of F-35 Lightning II aircraft, with funds for an alternate engine also obligated. Certification is required before DOD can acquire more than 30 aircraft. The bill limits the procurement of F-35 Lightning II aircraft, with funds for an alternate engine also required to be obligated. Certification is needed before acquiring more than 30 aircraft by January 15, 2011. H.R. 5136 requires reprogramming of funds for F136 development, testing of six engines, and completion of 1,000 test hours. The bill also mandates including alternate engine funding in DOD's annual budget submission for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The bill H.R. 5136 mandates including funding for a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the annual defense budget. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program budget includes funds for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense must ensure sufficient annual funding for the development and procurement of two propulsion system options for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft to support competitive production. The Secretary of Defense submitted a budget proposal to Congress for the fiscal year, including funding for competitive propulsion systems for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. H.R. 5136 designated the F-35 engine programs as major subprograms with stricter oversight and reporting requirements. Section 213 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 was repealed. The Secretary of Defense designates engine development and procurement programs for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft as major subprograms with stricter oversight and reporting requirements. The Secretary designates engine development and procurement programs for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft as major subprograms with stricter oversight and reporting requirements. The Secretary shall use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for the subprograms. Following critical cost growth, restructuring of the F-35 program may occur. In fiscal year 2010, reassessment and actions are conducted for the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs. The requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, for a major subprogram designated under subsection (a) are considered met. Actions taken in accordance with this shall meet the requirements of section 2433a only to the extent that designation as a major subprogram would require the Secretary of Defense to. Upon enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense must reassess and take actions for designated major subprograms. If programmatic changes cause costs to increase by a critical threshold, requirements of section 2433a are not considered met. The report accompanying H.R. 5136 includes language on the F-35 alternate engine program, stating the budget request for F-35 aircraft development and procurement. The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is developing the F136 engine as an alternative option. The F136 engine is being developed as a competitive alternative to the F135 engine for the F-35 aircraft. Despite Congress appropriating funds for the competitive propulsion system for the past four years, the Department of Defense has not complied with the requirement to invest in it for the fifth consecutive year. The Department of Defense has chosen not to include funds for the F135 engine development program in the budget request for the fifth consecutive year, despite cost increases noted in the program. The Government Accountability Office reported a 50 percent increase in the estimated cost of the F135 engine development. The Government Accountability Office reported a 50 percent increase in the estimated cost of the F135 engine development, totaling $7.3 billion. The negotiated prices for the F-35B engine and lift fan were 21 percent higher than budget estimates, while the F-35A engine cost was 42 percent higher than budgeted. The Under Secretary of Defense directed a review of the F135 cost structure, with the Joint Assessment Team concluding that contractor improvement plans were credible but challenging, requiring additional investment for cost reduction. The Deputy Secretary of Defense updated the 2007 DOD report on the competitive engine program, stating that an investment of $2.9 billion over six years would be needed to finish F136 engine development for competitive procurement of F-35 engines in 2017. The report also mentioned that long-term costs for a one-engine or two-engine competitive acquisition strategy are the same. The committee questions the Department's decision to exclude a competitive F-35 engine acquisition strategy in its budget requests despite the benefits of better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability, and improved operational readiness. The committee recommends a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program for the F-35, citing the need for improved performance and operational readiness. The F-35 program faced challenges in cost and schedule performance, leading to additional reviews by the Department of Defense. The JET 2 and IMRT conducted independent reviews of the F-35 development program. JET 2 estimated a 30-month delay and $3.0 billion increase in cost, while IMRT identified high production risk. To mitigate risks, the Department of Defense plans to procure an additional F-35C aircraft, set up a software simulation facility, and use three operational F-35s for testing. The Department of Defense plans to delay F-35 development by 13 months and increase costs by $2.8 billion. The Secretary of the Air Force stated that the F-35 program will exceed unit cost thresholds by more than 50 percent compared to the original baseline. The F-35 program is facing cost overruns and delays, with the unit cost exceeding thresholds by more than 50 percent compared to the original baseline estimate. Testimonies before Senate committees highlighted issues such as unprecedented concurrency in development, test, and production activities, late delivery of test aircraft, and failure to adjust. The Joint Strike Fighter program has faced delays in delivering test aircraft and a failure to adjust to reality in developing and testing plans. The Department of Defense plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. The Department of Defense plans to request a total of 550 aircraft, which is over 22 percent of the planned procurement of 2,443 F-35s, before completing developmental testing. Despite findings from various tests and ongoing research and development, the request for 43 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 remains unchanged from projections made in fiscal year 2009. The Government Accountability Office has highlighted significant risks and potential costly changes due to required design alterations as development testing progresses. The committee is concerned about the high F-35 production ramp rate and suggests further reductions until developmental testing is complete. They recommend authorizing the budget request for 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, contingent on the completion of certain milestones by the Department. The committee recommends a provision requiring certification by certain officials before procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The Administration opposes additional funding for the extra engine program and limits on JSF development funding. The committee recommends limiting JSF development funding to 75 percent until funds for FY 2011 are obligated for the extra engine program. Secretary Gates notes that an additional $2.4 billion investment is needed for the extra engine to be viable for the JSF program. The Department does not believe the cost of the extra engine program will be recovered or should be diverted from defense needs. The current engine has performed well with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for the extra engine program, the President's advisors would recommend a veto. The report included a certification requirement before further funding for the alternate engine. The committee recommends a provision that would require the Secretary of Defense to certify that the development of the alternative propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program will reduce costs and improve operational readiness without disrupting the program. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine program. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement regarding the program. The Secretary of Defense must designate an engine development and procurement program as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. This program will be subject to reporting requirements outlined in section 2430a of title 10, United States Code. The Secretary must use the Milestone B decision as the original baseline for the designated subprogram. If restructuring the F-35 aircraft program in fiscal year 2010, actions following cost growth must be taken, including reassessment and reporting based on the original baseline. Based on the original baseline, requirements of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code, for a major subprogram designated under subsection (a) are considered met. Actions taken in accordance with this shall meet the requirements of section 2433a only to the extent that designation as a major subprogram would require reassessment and actions by the Secretary of Defense. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine, with requirements for cost growth thresholds. The subcommittee report allocated $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine program, approved by a vote of 11-5. The House and Senate did not pass a separate defense bill for FY2011, leading to a continuing resolution maintaining spending at FY2010 levels. The Senate version of the Defense Appropriations Act did not include funds for the alternate engine program, but the committee's report spoke positively about it. Funding for the program continued at FY2010 levels until a stop-work order was issued on March 24, 2011. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law on April 15, 2011, provided funding for DOD for the remainder of FY2011, with no allocation for the F-35 alternate engine program. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act did not allocate funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. Congress's interest in this program may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994, involving engines for Air Force F-16 fighters. In the 1970s, frustrations arose with Pratt & Whitney's management of developing the F100 engine for Air Force F-15s and F-16s. Congress funded General Electric's F101 engine (later F110) as an alternate option. Over $376 million was spent on the F110 to compete with the F100, while $600 million was used to enhance the F100's durability and reliability. Annual competitions were used to procure engines for aircraft. The use of annual competitions for procuring engines for an aircraft procurement program was unprecedented and controversial. Proponents believe it produced better engines, on better terms, for less money than purchasing from a single company. Contractor responsiveness was the primary benefit of the competition, generating benefits for DOD in areas such as better contract terms. The Great Engine War resulted in benefits for the DOD through improved contract terms, warranties, and engine quality. Competition led to earlier engine improvements by the incumbent, Pratt & Whitney. The management of the engine competition played a key role in these benefits, with the Air Force demanding cost projections from General Electric and Pratt & Whitney before the contract award. Pratt & Whitney provided six years of cost projections for engine production, support equipment, spare engines, technical data, and dual sourcing data for operations and support (O&S). The Air Force awarded six years of firm-fixed price contracts based on these projections, a new approach compared to previous contracts. This helped avoid potential disruptions in operations. The DOD required contractors to provide plans for dual sourcing critical parts to prevent disruptions in production and protect against price gouging. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter beyond 2011. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter beyond 2011 due to uncertainty in the JSF Program schedules. Despite almost 80% completion, the program was terminated by the U.S. Department of Defense in April, leading to the end of development work by GE and Rolls-Royce. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team has decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter beyond 2011. The program was terminated by the U.S. Department of Defense in April, ending the development work by GE and Rolls-Royce. The FET will fulfill its termination responsibilities with the federal government after 15 years of developing a competitive fighter engine for the JSF. GE and Rolls-Royce have been advocates of defense acquisition reform, offering fixed-price proposals for F136 production engines for the JSF program. They are grateful to Congressional supporters and military experts for backing competition in defense acquisition reform."
