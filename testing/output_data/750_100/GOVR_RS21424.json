    "content": "In enacting the CAA of 1970, Congress differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were deemed difficult to retrofit with new technology, while new sources were required to install state-of-the-art controls to prevent new pollution problems. States had discretion to set emission standards for existing sources of major air pollutants under the CAA of 1970. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act established strict technology-based standards for new sources of air pollutants that may endanger public health or welfare. The EPA sets these standards, known as NSPSs, based on the best demonstrated technology. In areas cleaner than national standards (PSD areas) or dirtier (nonattainment areas), proposed major emissions are regulated. The Clean Air Act requires new sources of air pollutants in both clean (PSD) and dirty (nonattainment) areas to undergo NSR before construction. This process includes obtaining a pre-construction permit with emission limits based on best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate. The issue of RMRR arises because modifications of existing sources are also subject to NSPSs and NSR. The Clean Air Act requires new sources in clean and dirty areas to undergo NSR before construction, with emission limits based on technology. The issue of RMRR arises from modifications of existing sources subject to NSPSs and NSR, defining \"modification\" as any changes to a stationary source. The Clean Air Act requires new sources in clean and dirty areas to undergo NSR before construction, with emission limits based on technology. The issue of RMRR arises from modifications of existing sources subject to NSPSs and NSR, defining \"modification\" as any changes to a stationary source. The CAA defines \"modification\" as any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted. This definition determines which changes in a source are subject to NSPSs and which trigger NSR, focusing on changes that result in an increase in emissions. The EPA's definition of \"reconstruction\" involves replacing components of an existing facility to such an extent that the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost required for a new facility, and it is feasible to meet NSPSs. Litigation has focused on the meaning of phrases like \"physical change\" and \"increase in air pollutant amount\" in the context of NSPSs and NSR regulations. The EPA's definition of \"modification\" includes six exceptions, such as RMRR (maintenance, repair, and replacement), which do not trigger heightened pollution-control requirements. The EPA's RMRR exemption for maintenance, repair, and replacement activities was previously determined on a case-by-case basis. This approach was approved in the WEPCO case, where extensive renovation was needed for generating units. The EPA determined that WEPCO's proposed renovation of its generating units triggered both NSPS and PSD-area NSR, requiring a permit before construction could begin. The Seventh Circuit ruled that the proposal went beyond RMRR, as the extent of the work was substantial and unprecedented. The court found that the work on the plant was substantial and unprecedented, indicating non-routineness due to the project's purpose of \"life extension,\" infrequency, and high cost. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point recently, with CAA enforcement actions filed by the Clinton Administration against electric utilities for exceeding \"routine maintenance.\" President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group also issued recommendations in May 2001. In May 2001, President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group recommended a national energy policy, directing EPA to review the impact of NSR on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity. EPA's June 2002 report to the President emphasized the need to specify certain categories of activities as \"routine maintenance.\" On December 31, 2002, EPA published final regulations affecting how sources calculate emission increases for NSR purposes. EPA also proposed a rule on the same day. The EPA proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception in response to the TVA violating the CAA through projects at its coal-fired power plants. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the EPA's determination in EPA v. Whitman. The Eleventh Circuit found that the CAA was unconstitutional in allowing severe penalties for noncompliance with EPA's ACOs without proof in district court, giving TVA freedom to violate ACOs without fear of penalty. The October 2003 final rule reshaped the contours of the RMRR exception by declaring certain equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR, providing greater regulatory certainty without sacrificing environmental protection. The new rule specifies that replacing components of a process unit with identical ones or their functional equivalents constitutes RMRR if the cost is less than 20%. EPA is not taking action on the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement \"allowance\" at this time. The new rule allows for the replacement of components in a process unit if the cost is less than 20% of the unit's value, without changing its design or emission compliance. This approach expands the circumstances for replacement compared to the previous case-by-case method, which was a source of controversy. The former approach is still available as an alternative, but the new per se approach is expected to be more commonly used due to its higher cost thresholds. The new rule imposes higher thresholds for the per se approach, reducing the need for case-by-case analysis. It does not require additional recordkeeping, relying on existing business records and EPA inspection authority for enforcement. The rule only applies to conduct after its effective date and does not serve as a defense in pending CAA enforcement actions. Several states and environmental groups challenge the EPA's equipment-replacement rule, arguing it exceeds the agency's authority under the CAA. The lawsuits have been consolidated under State of New York v. EPA, with a court granting a stay on the rule pending further review due to demonstrated irreparable harm and likelihood of success by the petitioners. This decision suggests a tough defense for the EPA in the upcoming legal battle. The EPA faces challenges defending its equipment-replacement rule, which has been suspended. The court declined to consolidate the cases but assigned the same panel for related cases."
