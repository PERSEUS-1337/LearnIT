This practice has expanded from white-collar to blue-collar occupations, raising concerns about job loss among U.S. workers. The concern of job loss and foregone employment opportunities among U.S. workers due to offshore outsourcing remains unclear, with some attributing it to the \"jobless recovery\" from past recessions. Despite firms moving work outside the country for decades, the long-term labor market implications are uncertain. Some economists believe offshoring contributes to slow labor market rebound post-recession, causing job dislocations but benefiting the nation overall. Many economists believe offshoring benefits the nation by offering a greater variety of products at lower prices and expanding markets for U.S. firms. However, some question if this applies to services offshoring, suggesting that companies may primarily benefit by increasing dividends and stock prices rather than promoting growth in the U.S. economy. The offshoring of service jobs may have different implications for the labor market and public policy compared to production jobs. Factory workers typically have lower education levels, while administrative and professional workers often have college degrees. This shift in the skill level of offshored jobs raises questions about the impact on the economy. The offshoring of service jobs raises concerns about the impact on college graduates facing a dwindling supply of entry-level jobs. Questions also arise about the adequacy of existing trade adjustment assistance programs for well-educated office workers losing their jobs to offshoring. Congress aims to promote U.S. job growth and assist workers affected by job losses, whether due to economic downturns or shifts in job composition. The offshoring of service jobs raises concerns about job growth in the United States, leading to debates on government intervention and trade policies to support U.S. companies and workers in the international marketplace. The report briefly examines the development of outsourcing by U.S. companies and synthesizes information on offshore outsourcing's impact on U.S. employment since the early 2000s to help policymakers evaluate retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. The overseas relocation of manufacturing work by major U.S. companies began in the 1970s and 1980s in response to competition from Japanese and European corporations. This involved moving production abroad to reduce costs and focus on core missions, leading to outsourcing of jobs and contracting out activities like janitorial services. The 2001 recession prompted U.S. employers to achieve further efficiencies by outsourcing jobs to employees of temporary help agencies, professional services establishments, and independent contractors in the United States, utilizing technological innovations to minimize physical distance between companies. The widespread dissemination of technologies has enabled U.S. firms to extend offshoring to services beyond goods production, including IT and IT-enabled jobs. Other countries have also enhanced their ability to export services, particularly IT services, to the United States and other developed nations. The ability of U.S. firms to export services, especially IT services, to other developed countries has been facilitated by events like the Y2K crisis. Companies in India were utilized to fix code issues, with positive feedback on the quality of their work. Additionally, low-wage foreign nations are producing a large number of well-educated individuals with IT and accounting skills. The globalization of IT services has led to an abundance of skilled individuals in countries like China, Eastern Europe, India, and the Philippines. U.S.-based companies now distribute tasks across borders, not just in manufacturing but also in information and business services. This shift allows for the provision of IT services from non-English-speaking, low-wage nations like Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Jordan, Lithuania, Mexico, Slovenia, Russia, and Ukraine. The globalization of IT services has led to the distribution of tasks across borders, including research, design, management, and IT support. Task fragmentation in service activities has contributed to increased wage inequality in the United States. Technological change and deunionization have also played a role in wage polarization during the 1980s and 1990s. There is no comprehensive database on the number of jobs lost to offshoring. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' series on extended mass layoffs underestimates jobs lost to offshoring, focusing more on large layoffs in manufacturing than service providers. The BLS series has found that few job losses result from work moving away from the United States, with less than 1% of workers affected by offshoring. Forrester Research provides statistics on offshoring of service sector jobs. Forrester Research forecasts that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015, with 1.7 million expected to relocate outside the United States in the first 7 years. This indicates a trend of increasing transfer of service activities overseas. Bhagwati et al. note that Forrester's projected loss of 300,000 jobs per year through 2015 is a small share of total job creation. Researchers have focused on identifying jobs susceptible to being moved abroad and estimating U.S. employment in these offshorable activities. Bardhan and Kroll estimated that about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, representing over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, could be sent overseas. The vulnerability of certain occupational groups to offshoring includes office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and technical writers in industries like information, finance, and professional services. This is due to factors such as telecommuting feasibility, routinized tasks, and significant pay gaps between the US and destination countries. A study by the Brookings Institution projected that only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas would be lost to offshoring between 2004-2015. Five metro areas, including Boulder, CO and San Francisco, CA, were expected to lose slightly more jobs (3.1% to 4.3%) by 2015. In 2015, several metropolitan areas, including Boulder, CO; Lowell, MA; San Francisco, CA; San Jose, CA; and Stamford, CT, were identified as vulnerable to services offshoring due to their high population and concentration of IT jobs. Other areas with potential job losses ranged from 2.6% to 3.0%. The Northeast and West regions were particularly at risk, with cities like Dallas, TX; Minneapolis, MN; and Washington, DC also facing offshoring challenges. Jensen and Kletzer developed a geographically based approach to estimate the share of tradable and nontradable jobs in various industries. About 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was found to be in offshorable industries, with manufacturing and professional services industries being particularly vulnerable to offshoring. Manufacturing had over 12% of employment at risk, while professional services had almost 14%. Jensen and Kletzer analyzed the vulnerability of different service occupations to offshoring based on task content. They identified occupational groups such as computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, and life sciences as having a large share of employment in the most offshorable category. In 2005, Jensen and Kletzer identified service occupations like computer, architecture, legal, and sciences as highly offshorable. Occupations with more bachelor's degree holders were deemed more vulnerable to offshoring. BLS also assessed 515 service occupations, estimating 160 could be susceptible to offshoring. In 2007, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that out of 515 service occupations, 160 may be susceptible to offshoring. Over half of these offshorable occupations are in professional and technical categories, with computer and mathematical science occupations being particularly vulnerable. These 160 offshorable occupations accounted for over one-fifth of total employment in 2007, with slightly faster employment growth and comparatively greater wage growth between 2001 and 2007. Wage growth was higher in offshorable occupations between 2001 and 2007. However, the 33 service-providing occupations most susceptible to offshoring had below average employment and wage growth. The vulnerable group includes office and administrative support occupations with low education requirements and professional occupations with higher educational requirements. Blinder created an index based on occupations. Blinder created an index of offshorability for various occupations, estimating that a majority of occupations and workers are non offshorable, while a minority fall into highly offshorable categories. This analysis included 22.2% of U.S. workers in 2004. Blinder estimated that potentially offshorable jobs in the U.S. could range from 22.2% to 29.0% of all workers, with almost 40 million jobs being at risk. He noted that offshorable occupations are not limited to low-end jobs and do not necessarily correlate with skill level. The correlation between skill and offshorability of jobs is almost zero, contradicting previous research. Blinder and Krueger found that about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable. One in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, with offshorability prevalent in factory and administrative support occupations, as well as in manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services industries. Some believe fears about services offshoring are exaggerated, and executives have room to improve in utilizing offshore talent for productivity gains. In 2006, executives need to learn how to use offshore talent effectively to boost productivity. The management challenge will become more urgent as global salaries rise, reducing cost gains from outsourcing. Some are cautious about moving vulnerable U.S. jobs abroad. Deloitte Consulting predicts outsourcing will no longer be seen as a \"holy grail\" and companies will not outsource just because it's a trend. Organizations will define core functions to keep in-house for knowledge, confidentiality, and control. Some may choose to outsource selectively. Many organizations are re-insourcing key functions, such as Dell returning help services to the United States due to customer dissatisfaction. U.S. firms are also employing IT service providers in the U.S. to fix software produced abroad. Some companies are reshoring call center operations and legal support work to rural low-cost areas in the U.S. Manufacturing has seen employment rebound partly due to reshoring efforts. Some U.S. manufacturers have brought production back from overseas in 2011, attributing the trend to China's shrinking manufacturing wage and cost advantages, long delivery times, rising shipping costs, quality control issues, and intellectual property concerns. Perry provided examples of companies that have returned production and jobs to the United States. Some U.S. manufacturers have brought production back from overseas in 2011 due to various factors. Offshore providers of IT services were able to address security concerns post-9/11, and U.S. airline carriers continued outsourcing maintenance jobs overseas. Global providers of software services have responded to concerns over unrest in some regions by placing more of their clients' work in a variety of countries, including \"near-shore\" markets like Canada and Mexico. Moving work to nearby Canada is seen as a way to reduce potential customer antipathy to offshoring, despite rising labor costs in some Asian nations like India. Despite rising labor costs in countries like India, low wages in nations such as Vietnam continue to attract U.S. jobs. There is a lack of comprehensive data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing. Analyzing job characteristics susceptible to offshoring may overstate job losses, as other factors influencing employers' location decisions are not considered."
