    "content": "Both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism measures. H.R. 1540 passed the House, while S. 1253 and S. 1867 were reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with provisions inserted into H.R. 1540. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be discussed in conference. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills and threatened to veto any legislation that limits the President's authorities in intelligence collection and counterterrorism efforts. The Administration opposes military detention mandates, limits on executive discretion in prosecuting terrorists, and constraints on detainee transfers. This report analyzes House and Senate bills on detainee provisions, comparing their approaches to key issues. Both bills aim to confirm or expand detention policies. The provisions aim to confirm or expand the detention authority granted to the President after 9/11. The Authorization for Use of Military Force authorized the President to use force against those involved in the attacks to prevent future terrorism. Many captured individuals are affected by these provisions. In 2004, the Supreme Court recognized the President's authority to detain enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, as a necessary incident to the Authorization for Use of Military Force. Many individuals captured during U.S. operations have been placed in preventive detention to prevent them from engaging in hostilities or terrorist activities. Some have been tried by military commission, while others have faced terrorism-related charges in civilian court. The Supreme Court's Hamdi decision in 2004 recognized the President's authority to detain enemy combatants, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. Subsequent judicial activity in the D.C. Circuit has focused on habeas petitions by Guantanamo detainees challenging the legality of their detention, with rulings generally favoring the government's position. The D.C. Circuit Court has been supportive of the government's detention authority under the AUMF. It is uncertain if the Supreme Court will review these rulings and endorse them. Congress has not passed any laws to clarify the scope of detention authority under the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit has looked to post-AUMF legislation on military commissions for guidance on who can be detained. The D.C. Circuit Court has supported the government's detention authority under the AUMF, allowing for the detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Most detainees are combatants captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad. Many detainees associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban were captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad and held at Guantanamo Bay or other locations for interrogation. The detention facilities in Parwan, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay are not considered viable options for future captures outside of Afghanistan, leading to ad hoc practices for such cases. Persons arrested in the United States are also subject to detention. In the United States, persons arrested for suspected terrorist activity linked to Al Qaeda are typically prosecuted in federal court rather than placed in military detention under the AUMF. There have been rare instances where individuals were transferred to military custody and labeled as \"enemy combatants,\" including a U.S. citizen arrested for ties to the Taliban and a legal resident alien with no combat zone experience. In rare cases, individuals suspected of terrorist activities linked to Al Qaeda in the United States have been transferred to military custody as \"enemy combatants.\" This included a U.S. citizen with ties to the Taliban and a legal resident alien who had never been to a combat zone but was accused of being an Al Qaeda \"sleeper agent.\" They were eventually transferred back to civil authorities for trial in federal court, raising questions about the legality of their prior military detention. Controversy persists over the appropriate handling of suspected terrorists in U.S. custody. Some argue that suspected terrorists should be held in military custody and tried before a military commission, while others believe they should be transferred to civilian law enforcement for trial in an Article III court. There are also suggestions that executive discretion should be used to decide the best approach for handling suspected terrorists and belligerents in U.S. custody. Decisions regarding the handling of suspected terrorists in U.S. custody are often subject to executive discretion based on the specific circumstances of each case. Disagreements over the appropriate legal model to use have arisen in high-profile cases, such as the transfer of Guantanamo detainees for trial in Article III courts. Funding restrictions imposed by Congress in response to the Obama Administration's plans effectively prevented the transfer of any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. for criminal prosecution in the 2011 fiscal year. The 2012 Minibus extends the prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees for criminal prosecution through FY2012. This restriction effectively limits trial options to military commissions as no civilian court operates at Guantanamo. On July 5, 2011, Somali national Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame was brought to the United States to face terrorism-related charges in a civilian court after being detained on a U.S. naval vessel for two months. Controversy arose over whether he should have remained in military custody abroad or transferred to civilian custody immediately. The Administration faced criticism for bringing civilian charges against individuals arrested by U.S. authorities, sparking debate over whether they should have been detained and interrogated by military authorities instead. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the handling of persons apprehended by U.S. authorities. The 2012 NDAA contains provisions regarding the disposition of persons apprehended by U.S. authorities in the conflict with Al Qaeda. It reaffirms the conflict, imposes restrictions on transferring non-citizen wartime detainees to the U.S., sets conditions for transferring Guantanamo detainees, and mandates military commission trials for foreign nationals involved in terrorist offenses. The White House issued a statement on these provisions before the bill was approved by the House. The White House criticized provisions in H.R. 1540 concerning detainee matters and threatened to veto any version of the bill challenging executive branch authority. S. 1253 authorized detention of certain persons and required military detention for some, with regulated status determinations and periodic review proceedings. The Senate delayed consideration of the bill due to objections from the White House and Senate committees regarding detainee provisions. A new version of the bill, S. 1867, was reported with revised detainee provisions, which were also objected to by the Department of Defense and the White House. The Senate passed S. 1867 with an amendment clarifying detainee provisions, replacing the original language in H.R. 1540. The White House threatened to veto any bill challenging the President's authorities in handling terrorist suspects. The House and Senate versions of the FY2012 NDAA will be reconciled in conference. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities on detainee matters is discussed, including detention authority under the AUMF and practices for detainee cases. Recidivism concerns impact restrictions on detainee transfers. The discussion on detainee transfer restrictions due to recidivism concerns is influenced by the ambiguity of detention authority under the AUMF, which allows for differing interpretations. The Obama Administration outlined its detention authority in relation to persons involved in the 9/11 attacks. The President has the authority to detain persons involved in the 9/11 attacks, including those who supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" in the AUMF raises questions about the breadth of detention authority. The executive's detention authority under the AUMF, particularly regarding \"substantial support,\" raises questions about exceeding its mandate. The Supreme Court's interpretation in Hamdi referenced law of war principles, leading to disputes on indefinite detention for supporting belligerent forces. The government's 2009 brief did not clarify these aspects of detention authority. The Obama Administration's definition of detention authority, similar to the Bush Administration's, requires \"substantial support\" instead of just \"support.\" Court decisions have not clarified the criteria for determining detention eligibility. The Court of Appeals of the D.C. Circuit has relied on proof that a detainee was part of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or an associated force for detention eligibility. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority since 2004. The full parameters of detention authority under the AUMF are still being defined by lower courts. The AUMF does not limit the organizations it covers to just al-Qaida or the Taliban. In Afghanistan, various armed groups fought alongside them. The US has authority to detain individuals to prevent future terrorism, consistent with principles of co-belligerency. The D.C. Circuit rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" The court accepted the government's criteria for membership in an \"associated force\" related to al Qaida or the Taliban. The court rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" It accepted the criteria for membership in an \"associated force\" related to al Qaida or the Taliban. The government's evidence did not support the second and third prongs, so the court did not reach the first. The government defined \"associated force\" as being closely associated with al Qaida or the Taliban, arguing that ETIM is covered by the AUMF. Adopting this definition would require a close operational nexus. The court rejected the government's argument that affiliation with ETIM made a petitioner an \"enemy combatant.\" It accepted the criteria for membership in an \"associated force\" related to al Qaida or the Taliban. The evidence did not establish a close enough connection between ETIM and Al Qaeda to be considered an \"associated force.\" In habeas cases, the term \"associated forces\" has been interpreted to cover armed groups assisting the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, such as \"Zubayda's militia\" and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\"). The habeas court determined that Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\") is an \"associated force\" for AUMF purposes due to evidence of support for attacks against coalition and Afghan forces. The D.C. Circuit also upheld the detention of a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade defending the Taliban. The Administration suggests that groups outside Afghanistan could be considered \"associated forces\" under the AUMF. The AUMF authorizes the use of force against members and raises uncertainty about detention authority for individuals captured outside of Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens. The Supreme Court addressed detention of a U.S. citizen in Afghanistan but not those captured elsewhere. The D.C. Circuit believes the AUMF allows detention of any person. The D.C. Circuit believes the AUMF authorizes the detention of any person functionally part of Al Qaeda, including non-U.S. citizens captured outside the U.S. The Fourth Circuit upheld military detention of a U.S. citizen and resident alien captured in the U.S. as enemy combatants. Detainees were transferred to civilian law enforcement for prosecution before Supreme Court review. The circumstances of detaining a U.S. citizen or person captured in the U.S. under the AUMF authority are uncertain. Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) were established by the Pentagon in response to Supreme Court decisions in 2004 regarding \"enemy combatants\" at Guantanamo. CSRTs determine if detainees are enemy combatants, with the option for transfer if not deemed as such. Enemy combatants not eligible for transfer were dealt with according to domestic and international obligations and U.S. foreign policy. CSRTs confirmed the status of 539 enemy combatants between July 30, 2004, and February 10, 2009. The CSRT process has been largely defunct since 2007, but any new detainees brought to Guantanamo would likely go before a CSRT. This process has only been used for Guantanamo detainees, not those held in Afghanistan. Non-citizen detainees held in Afghanistan have fewer procedural rights compared to those at Guantanamo. While Guantanamo detainees can challenge their detention in federal court, the same privilege does not extend to detainees in Afghanistan. President Obama created task forces to study Guantanamo detention issues shortly after taking office. The Obama Administration implemented a new review system for detainees at Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan, which also applies to the new detention facility in Parwan. The process for determining the status of persons captured in connection with hostilities remains unclear. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 on March 7, 2011, establishing a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees designated for preventive detention or referred for criminal prosecution without conviction. The PRB determines if detention is necessary to protect against security threats. The Executive Order 13567 established a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees for security threats. The Secretaries of State and Defense are responsible for finding suitable transfer locations for detainees not deemed necessary for continued detention. An initial review by the PRB allows detainees to challenge the basis for their detention. The Executive Order 13567 established a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. Detainees can challenge their detention within a year of the order's issuance. The process is discretionary and does not create additional detention authority. Detainees subject to continued detention will have their cases reviewed periodically. Release concerns include potential engagement in terrorist activity post-release. The post-release activities of Guantanamo detainees, including engagement in terrorist activities, have led Congress to impose limits on detainee transfers. Statistics on these activities are limited, with much information classified. While some detainees have been involved in terrorist activities after release, the significance of these actions is debated, impacting policy decisions. The post-release activities of Guantanamo detainees have sparked debate and controversy over policy implications. In 2007, the Pentagon reported that some former detainees engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda after their release, which was challenged by researchers at Seton Hall University. Researchers at Seton Hall University's School of Law Center for Policy and Research raised concerns about discrepancies in DOD data regarding Guantanamo detainees pursuing habeas cases. They disputed the Pentagon's classification of post-release activities as \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement,\" pointing out that the data did not always establish terrorist or insurgent activity before release and suggesting that radicalization during internment could explain post-release behavior. The study found that some ex-Guantanamo detainees engaged in terrorism after release, with 36 confirmed or suspected cases in 2008 and 74 out of 534 prisoners in 2009. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the DNI to disclose this information publicly. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 mandated the DNI to release an unclassified summary on Guantanamo detainee recidivism rates. The report revealed that 13.5% were confirmed and 11.5% suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities out of 598 transferred detainees. The report on Guantanamo detainee recidivism rates stated that out of 150 confirmed or suspected recidivist detainees, 13 are dead, 54 are in custody, and 83 remain at large. Additionally, 2 detainees transferred from Guantanamo since Executive Order 13492 are confirmed and 3 are suspected of terrorist activities. The accuracy of these numbers has been questioned. The report on Guantanamo detainee recidivism rates indicated that around 6% of released detainees posed a threat to the United States or its interests. The discrepancy between the report's estimates and publicly available sources remains unexplained due to classified intelligence data. Despite this, there is a consensus that the number of detainees engaging in terrorism post-release has increased. Section 1031 of H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives on May 26, 2011, defines terms for subtitle D related to detainment. Section 1031 of H.R. 1540, passed on May 26, 2011, defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-U.S. citizens held by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo after March 7, 2011, regardless of AUMF authority. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" in H.R. 1540 refers to non-U.S. citizens held by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo after March 7, 2011, regardless of AUMF authority. It is unclear who might fall under the \"effective control\" of the Department of Defense yet not be in its custody for purposes of the bill. The term may cover situations where detainees are technically under another agency's custody but still supervised by the DOD. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions. The current MCA only permits the death penalty if all commission members vote to convict and agree on the death sentence. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to allow guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, permitting the death penalty if all commission members vote unanimously to approve the sentence. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, authorizes the President to detain captured belligerents, and affirms the use of necessary force under the AUMF. Section 1034 affirms the President's authority to use necessary force under the AUMF in the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, including the detention of belligerents supporting or engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The controversial provision in H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to use necessary force under the AUMF in the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, including the detention of belligerents supporting or engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. Supporters argue it confirms the current armed conflict, while opponents see it as authorizing an expansion of the conflict by including \"associated forces\" without a direct link to the 9/11 attacks. The AUMF in H.R. 1540 is controversial due to its potential expansion of the armed conflict to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda, with some arguing it grants the President broad discretion in using force. Critics are concerned about the removal of limits on identifying parties in the conflict and the inclusion of belligerent parties beyond the executive branch's characterization. The AUMF in H.R. 1540 is controversial for potentially expanding the armed conflict to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda. Critics are concerned about the broad discretion it grants the President in using force and the inclusion of belligerent parties beyond the executive branch's characterization. The requirement for entities in subparagraph 3(B) to engage in or support hostilities seems to require a nexus to armed hostilities. The AUMF in H.R. 1540 is controversial for potentially expanding the armed conflict to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda. Critics are concerned about the broad discretion it grants the President in using force and the inclusion of belligerent parties beyond the executive branch's characterization. The use of the past tense in subparagraph 3(A) could imply entities as belligerents even if their support for Al Qaeda occurred before September 11, 2001, with no impact on the United States. This description of enemy parties is linked to the President's authority to detain individuals for the duration of hostilities. The legislative history of H.R. 1540 suggests that Section 1034 is not intended to authorize a significant expansion of the ongoing conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations, but instead to reaffirm the current interpretation of the AUMF advanced by the executive in habeas litigation involving wartime detainees. The House Armed Services Committee report accompanying H.R. 1540 describes the intent behind Section 1034 as reaffirming the current interpretation of the AUMF. The United States faces an evolving terrorist threat from Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces despite military and diplomatic pressure. The Authorization for Use of Military Force includes the authority to address this ongoing threat, as supported by the Executive Branch's interpretation. The Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force affirms the existing authority without limiting it. The language in H.R. 1540 Section 1034 paragraphs (1) and (2) does not appear to expand the authority to use force beyond what is already permitted under the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit noted that the word \"associated\" in the expansion of authority to use force could supersede the AUMF, leading courts to interpret it plainly. The language in paragraph (3) mirrors that used by Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo for detaining individuals linked to Taliban or al Qaida. The expansion of authority to detain individuals linked to Taliban or al Qaida forces, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US or its partners is a contentious issue. The White House strongly objects to section 1034, arguing that it may lead to different interpretations of the conflict scope. The White House strongly objects to section 1034, stating that it could create confusion about conflict scope. Section 1036 requires a review process for Guantanamo detainees to determine if continued military detention is necessary for national security. This process is similar to one established by Executive Order 13567 but has notable differences. The review process under Section 1036 for Guantanamo detainees requires military officers on the initial panel, sets strict criteria for detention assessment, and limits private counsel assistance. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress within 180 days on establishing a periodic review process for continued detention. This includes a full review every three years for each detainee. The review process for Guantanamo detainees includes a full review every three years by a panel of military officers with expertise in operations, intelligence, and counterterrorism. Detainees undergoing trial or serving a sentence by military commission, or those ordered released by a federal court, are exempt from this review. A full review cannot occur sooner than 21 days after arrival at Guantanamo. The detainee is entitled to be assisted by a \"military personal representative\" with the appropriate security clearance, who advocates on their behalf before a panel. The detainee can present a statement, evidence, respond to questions, and call witnesses. They are provided with an unclassified summary of information the panel will consider before the hearing. The detainee's personal representative is provided with a copy of the government's submission before the hearing. Outside parties, including the detainee's private counsel, may provide a written submission if authorized. The limited annual file review considers new information regarding the threat posed by the individual. The military panel reviews relevant information presented during any military commission case to assess a Guantanamo detainee's continued internment. Factors considered include the likelihood of the individual resuming terrorist activity or reestablishing ties with hostile organizations. The military panel reviews information to assess a Guantanamo detainee's continued internment, considering factors like terrorist activity likelihood, ties with hostile organizations, behavior in custody, threat mitigation, and intelligence value. An interagency review board is required by Section 1036. The interagency review board, consisting of various government agencies, is responsible for reviewing the military panel's recommendations regarding Guantanamo detainees. If the board disagrees with a recommendation, it can reject it by majority vote. If a detainee is recommended for release, the board must find a suitable country for transfer based on various factors. The interagency review board evaluates recommendations on Guantanamo detainees based on factors like control over detention facilities, prosecution prevention of terrorist activities, and humane treatment assurances. Rejected recommendations can be reevaluated or forwarded to the Secretary of Defense for approval. Detainees have no right to seek redress or enforcement. The detainee does not have the right to seek redress or enforcement in any U.S. court. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540, stating it could lead to a presidential veto due to its impact on the periodic review process established by the President's Executive Order. This could limit the advice and expertise of intelligence and law enforcement professionals, affecting the Executive branch's decision-making abilities. Section 1039 limits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody, including those at Guantanamo, into the United States. It hinders the Executive branch's decision-making process and interferes with DOD's detention operations management. The Obama Administration's plan to close the Guantanamo detention facility was met with funding measures from Congress to limit the transfer or release of detainees into the United States. Recent funding limitations, such as those in the 2012 Minibus, now prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the country. The 2012 Minibus (P.L. 112-55) and funding restrictions in House-passed H.R. 1540 prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. These restrictions were motivated by the Administration's plans to transfer detainees for trial in civilian courts, making military commissions the only viable forum for prosecution until the end of FY2012. Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 expands detainee restrictions for FY2012, covering a broader category of detainees than the 2012 Minibus. It applies to non-citizen detainees held at Guantanamo and restricts transfer/release of detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations. The restrictions prevent DOD from transferring wartime detainees into the US but do not limit bringing detainees into the country. The 2012 Minibus restricts detainee transfers for all federal agencies, while House-passed H.R. 1540 limits transfers to the United States. Provisions in H.R. 1540, such as a permanent bar on prosecuting enemy belligerents in Article III courts, may discourage transferring detainees into the country beyond FY2012. The White House strongly opposes Section 1039, which limits the transfer of detainees into the United States. The Obama Administration argues that this measure interferes with executive discretion to prosecute detainees in Article III courts within the country, posing a threat to national security interests and counterterrorism efforts. The White House opposes Section 1039, which limits detainee transfers to the US, arguing it hinders executive discretion in prosecuting detainees in federal courts, impacting national security and counterterrorism efforts. Section 1037 of H.R. 1540 prohibits using funds to construct facilities in the US for Guantanamo detainees, affecting national security interests. The 2012 Minibus includes restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries or entities, except when certain criteria are met. These restrictions do not apply when a court order mandates the release of a detainee. The limitations in Section 1040 are similar to those in the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011. The 2012 Minibus includes funding restrictions similar to those in the 2011 NDAA and 2011 CAA, aimed at preventing recidivism by detainees released from U.S. custody. Supporters believe these restrictions reduce the risk of detainees reengaging in terrorist activities, while critics argue they hinder the executive's ability to transfer low-risk detainees. The 2012 Minibus includes funding restrictions similar to those in the 2011 NDAA and 2011 CAA, aimed at preventing recidivism by detainees released from U.S. custody. The executive's ability to transfer low-risk detainees is hindered by these restrictions. Transfers require certification from the Secretary of Defense to Congress regarding the destination country's status and control over detention facilities. The detainee must agree to ensure the transferred person does not pose a threat to the US, share relevant information, and allow US agencies access if requested. Section 1040 sets certification requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign entities, similar to those in the 2011 NDAA and CAA. An additional requirement is that the receiving entity must allow US authorities access to the transferred individual. The White House opposes restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign governments, arguing that certification requirements hinder the executive's ability to make important foreign policy decisions. The Administration needs flexibility in negotiations with foreign countries. Section 1035 of the legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed national security protocol within 90 days regarding communications of Guantanamo detainees, including limitations, privileges, monitoring procedures, and enforcement measures. The legislation includes provisions for monitoring legal materials and communications of Guantanamo detainees for national security, while preserving detainee privileges for military commission trials or habeas proceedings. It also prohibits DOD funds from being used for family visits to Guantanamo detainees in FY2012 and restricts rights for detainees repatriated to certain countries. The Compact of Free Association provides rights and benefits to citizens of certain countries, facilitating travel to the United States. Repatriation refers to returning a person to their home country, not applicable to former Guantanamo detainees resettled in listed countries. Section 1043 applies to citizens of Micronesia. Section 1043 of the Compact of Free Association applies to citizens of Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands who were detained at Guantanamo and then returned to their country of origin. Section 1042 requires consultation among key officials before prosecuting a non-citizen for certain offenses. Section 1042 of the defense authorization bill requires consultation among key officials before prosecuting a non-citizen for certain offenses, which the White House opposes, claiming it could undermine interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. Section 1046 of the defense authorization bill mandates that foreign nationals involved in terrorism-related conduct must be tried by a military commission. The provision applies to those who commit offenses related to terrorist attacks against the US or its personnel abroad, without defining specific terms. The provision in Section 1046 of the defense authorization bill applies to offenses related to terrorist attacks within the United States or against U.S. government property or personnel abroad. It is unclear if the provision covers prospective attacks that are not carried out, and the definition of a \"terrorist attack\" is not specified. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who attempted to destroy an airliner in 2009, may provide insight into how the provision could be applied to failed attacks. The provision in Section 1046 of the defense authorization bill applies to offenses related to terrorist attacks within the United States or against U.S. government property or personnel abroad. To establish coverage, it must be shown that the attack occurred within the United States or involved U.S. government property or personnel. The offense must be one that can be tried by military commission under the MCA, and the accused must be subject to the jurisdiction of such a commission. The attempted use of an explosive device to bring down a civilian aircraft could potentially fall under this provision. The jurisdiction of military commissions under Section 1042 for offenses related to terrorist attacks involving civilian aircraft is dependent on the connection between the accused and opposing forces in an armed conflict. It must be established that the accused is not a U.S. citizen for the military commission to exercise jurisdiction. The accused must be proven to be a non-U.S. citizen and an unprivileged enemy belligerent to fall under the jurisdiction of military commissions. This definition excludes those who qualify for prisoner of war status under the Third Geneva Convention but includes individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the U.S. or its coalition partners, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. If the offense is connected to hostilities, the accused would likely qualify as an unprivileged enemy belligerent. The bill does not specify how criteria for unprivileged enemy belligerent are determined. Military commissions or Article III courts could make this determination. It is unclear how the bill might impact cases involving terrorism charges. The provision applies to foreign nationals engaged in relevant conduct, likely only those in U.S. custody. This provision could complicate cases involving material support for terrorism. The provision in the bill applies to foreign nationals in U.S. custody and could complicate extradition and trial efforts for terrorism suspects. It may only apply in cases of actual terrorist attacks and does not require government action unless challenged through habeas corpus. The bill applies to foreign nationals in U.S. custody and may complicate extradition and trial efforts for terrorism suspects. It does not preclude trials in Article III courts but states that individuals shall only be tried for certain offenses in military commissions. This provision could potentially be avoided by framing the offense under a terrorism-related provision of title 18, U.S. Code. The bill applies to foreign nationals in U.S. custody and may complicate extradition and trial efforts for terrorism suspects. It does not preclude trials in Article III courts but states that individuals shall only be tried for certain offenses in military commissions. This provision could potentially be avoided by framing the offense under a terrorism-related provision of title 18, U.S. Code. In the event a federal criminal offense is charged, a defendant could challenge the Article III court's jurisdiction based on the language of the provision, potentially leading to a situation where a criminal trial may not be possible. Section 1032 of the bill extends the authority to offer rewards for information on terrorism for two years, up to $5 million. It also changes the reporting requirement to February instead of December. Section 1041 moves the annual reporting requirement to February and mandates quarterly briefings on global Department of Defense counterterrorism operations. Section 1044 approves DOD anti-terrorism efforts, while Section 1045 addresses the need for improved interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to Al Qaeda and strengthen \"at-risk states.\" The President is required to issue planning guidance to identify and analyze geographic areas of concern, set goals, and describe agency roles and capabilities. The guidance must be reviewed and updated as needed, with copies submitted to Congress within 15 days. Agencies involved must enter into a memorandum of understanding. Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" in subtitle D. The Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" in subtitle D of Title X, with provisions similar to S. 1253 but revised language to address Administration concerns. It was passed by the Senate on December 1, 2011, with a clarification amendment regarding legal authority to detain persons captured in conflict with Al Qaeda. The Senate bill S. 1867, passed on December 1, 2011, affirms the authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents under the AUMF. The bill defines \"covered persons\" as any U.S. citizens, lawful resident aliens, or persons captured in the United States. Section 1031(b) defines \"covered persons\" as those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting enemy forces engaged in hostilities against the US. The earlier version of the section in S. 1253 had similar language. The White House objected to language in Senate-passed S. 1867 that could limit detentions to those captured during military operations, rather than persons arrested under other circumstances. Section 1031 of Senate-passed S. 1867 allows for various options for dispositions under the law of war, including detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country. It does not specify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens can be considered \"covered persons.\" S. 1867 allows for detention without trial, trial by military commission, or transfer to a foreign country under the law of war. It does not specify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens can be considered \"covered persons.\" The committee-modified version of S. 1867 aimed to reinforce the executive branch's view of its detention authority under the AUMF, with significant debate on the potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens and persons within the United States. An amendment to bar U.S. citizens from long-term military detention based on enemy belligerent status was considered and rejected. The committee-modified version of S. 1867 aimed to reinforce the executive branch's detention authority under the AUMF. An amendment to bar U.S. citizens from long-term military detention based on enemy belligerent status was considered and rejected. Ultimately, an amendment was adopted to clarify that Section 1031 does not affect existing law or authority relating to the detention of U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens. The Supreme Court in Hamdi recognized that persons captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan could be militarily detained in the conflict with Al Qaeda potentially for the duration of hostilities, regardless of their citizenship. However, the circumstances in which persons captured in other locations may be subject to preventive military detention have not been definitively adjudicated. Section 1031 does not clarify the circumstances in which a U.S. citizen, resident alien, or person captured with the United States may be held as an enemy belligerent in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The revised provision in S. 1867 does not provide additional clarification for terms such as \"substantial support,\" \"associated forces,\" or \"hostilities,\" potentially allowing for a broadening of the scope of the conflict. The revised provision in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the provision applies to \"covered persons\" under section 1031(b), including entities considered to be \"associated forces\" or providing \"substantial support.\" The Administration has not objected to the language but cautions against codifying existing authorities as unnecessary and risky. Congress must be cautious not to create new legal implications. The revised provision in S. 1867 requires Congress to be cautious in codifying existing authorities as unnecessary and risky. The provision in Section 1032 requires military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces, posing some risk. Congress must ensure that the codification of military detention authority does not compromise national security efforts. The revised provision in S. 1867 mandates military custody for certain captured individuals under the control of the United States within 60 days of enactment. This requirement applies to individuals captured during hostilities authorized by the AUMF, excluding U.S. citizens but including resident aliens. Detention is only permitted to the extent allowed by the U.S. Constitution. The revised provision in S. 1867 mandates military custody for certain captured individuals under the control of the United States within 60 days of enactment. This requirement applies to covered persons captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF, defined as individuals who are determined to be associated with al-Qaeda and have participated in planning or carrying out attacks against the United States or its coalition partners. These individuals must be detained by military authorities pending disposition under the law of war. The detainee can be held in military detention until hostilities end, tried before a military commission, transferred for trial by another court, or to a foreign government if transfer requirements are met. S. 1867 applies to members of \"associated forces\" and defines detention authority. The provision in S. 1867 specifies that covered forces are those that \"act in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda.\" It raises questions about whether all members of an associated force would be subject to mandatory detention if they coordinate some activities with Al Qaeda. The provision in S. 1867 raises questions about whether all members of an associated force would be subject to mandatory detention if they coordinate some activities with Al Qaeda. The determination of involvement with Al Qaeda can be based on the specific attack the individual is involved in. Captured Taliban insurgents suspected of dislodging local government officials may not require certification under Section 1033 if no Al Qaeda cooperation is suspected. However, a Taliban member engaged with Al Qaeda in planning an attack would be subject to mandatory detention. Section 1032 would not apply to a \"lone wolf\" terrorist with no ties. The provision in S. 1867 raises questions about the scope of mandatory detention for individuals associated with Al Qaeda. It is unclear what constitutes an \"attack against the United States coalition partners\" and whether it includes acts against civilian targets. The term \"attack\" could be interpreted broadly to cover terrorist acts beyond military operations. The provision in S. 1867 raises questions about the scope of mandatory detention for individuals associated with Al Qaeda, including the uncertainty of what constitutes an \"attack against the United States.\" The term \"attack\" could be broadly interpreted to cover terrorist acts beyond military operations. The application of the law of war to such circumstances is uncertain, especially regarding acts directed against civilian targets. The reference to lawful resident aliens being detained based on conduct in the United States supports a broader reading of \"attack.\" S. 1867 introduces a new requirement for the President to report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, detailing procedures for implementing the provision related to detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda. This includes designating authorized personnel to determine covered persons and preventing disruption of surveillance on individuals not in custody. The new requirement introduced by S. 1867 mandates the President to report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, detailing procedures for implementing the provision related to detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda. This includes designating authorized personnel to determine covered persons and preventing disruption of surveillance on individuals not in custody. Additionally, procedures are outlined for intelligence gathering and transfer of individuals from third countries. The bill requires the President to report to Congress on procedures for detaining individuals associated with Al Qaeda. It is important to consider how these procedures will interact with those under Section 1036, which requires DOD to submit procedures for status determinations for detainees. If Section 1036 procedures are meant to determine detainability under the AUMF, they should occur before determining detention under Section 1032. The bill does not prevent multiple processes for making these determinations. The bill does not prevent the implementation of multiple processes for determining if someone qualifies as a covered person subject to mandatory military detention. This could involve different procedures depending on whether the person is initially in military custody or the custody of law enforcement officials. Constitutional due process requirements would likely be implicated, especially if the detainee is located within the United States. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032, as it could complicate Article III trials and limit counterterrorism tools according to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. Secretary Panetta and the White House strongly object to Section 1032, citing concerns about its scope, limitations on counterterrorism tools, and potential legal controversies. The Administration strongly objects to Section 1032, calling it an unnecessary and legally controversial restriction on the President's authority to defend the nation from terrorist threats. They doubt that committee revisions will fix the fundamental problems perceived. The revised text directs the President to develop procedures to address the risks of mandating military custody, but may cause confusion in counterterrorism operations. Section 1033 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries for another fiscal year. Section 1033 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries for another fiscal year, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence. The Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence must certify that the destination country meets specific criteria before transferring Guantanamo detainees. The Senate bill requires certification from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence before transferring Guantanamo detainees, including sharing relevant information with the United States. Unlike H.R. 1540, the bill does not require the foreign entity to permit U.S. access to the transferred individual. The Senate bill mandates certification from the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Director of National Intelligence for transferring Guantanamo detainees. Section 1033 prohibits transfers to foreign countries with confirmed cases of detainees engaging in terrorist activities, except for those transferred under pretrial agreements or court orders. The Secretary of Defense can waive certification and recidivism requirements. The Secretary of Defense can waive certification and recidivism requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees if alternative actions will be taken to address the underlying purpose of the measures or substantially mitigate the risk. The Secretary of Defense can waive certification and recidivism requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees if alternative actions will be taken to address the underlying purpose of the measures or substantially mitigate the risk. Transfers must be in the national security interests of the United States, with details submitted to congressional defense committees 30 days prior. The transfer restrictions apply to detainees at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. The scope of Section 1033 applies to individuals detained at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. It may also cover foreign refugees at the Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo. The requirements of the section also apply to those subject to mandatory detention under Section 1032. The White House's stance on this remains to be seen. Section 1034 of the 2012 NDAA prohibits the use of DOD funds to construct or modify facilities in the US or its territories for housing individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay under DOD custody. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of transfer restriction provisions in the House-passed version. The 2012 NDAA prohibits detention or imprisonment by the Department of Defense without Congressional authorization. The funding limitation in Section 1034 is similar to previous restrictions and the White House objects to it. The Senate bill does not contain a provision found in the House-passed version. The Senate bill for the 2012 NDAA does not include a provision prohibiting the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States. It allows for transfers to civilian law enforcement for criminal prosecution and does not prevent the release of cleared detainees into the US. The only restriction in the Senate bill is on transferring detainees for continued military detention. The Senate bill for the 2012 NDAA does not prohibit transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US. It allows transfers for criminal prosecution and release of cleared detainees, with the only restriction being on transferring for continued military detention. Section 1035 clarifies procedures for detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. The new review procedures for Guantanamo detainees clarify that periodic reviews are to determine ongoing threat to US security, not legality of detention. The Secretary of Defense has final decision on release or transfer, considering factors like likelihood of terrorist activity resumption or rehabilitation support. The Administration objects to a provision that shifts responsibility for detainee status determination to the Defense Department. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on detainee status under the AUMF within 90 days. The Senate bill includes Section 1031, which raises questions about the determination of detainee status. Procedures for unprivileged enemy belligerents in long-term detention must involve a military judge and the option for military counsel representation. The Senate bill includes provisions for detainees to be represented by military counsel during status determination hearings, regardless of their location. This may provide greater privileges to detainees held in Afghanistan compared to those at Guantanamo. The Senate bill includes provisions for detainees to have military counsel during status determination hearings, regardless of location. It is uncertain how Section 1036 would impact habeas challenges for Guantanamo detainees. The implications of Section 1036 on Guantanamo detainees may vary depending on its interpretation for all detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention under the AUMF. The provision in the Senate bill allows for detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention under the AUMF to have military counsel during status determination hearings. It is unclear how this provision would impact habeas challenges for Guantanamo detainees. The Senate bill allows for detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention to have military counsel during status determination hearings. This raises questions about the process and implications for Guantanamo detainees. The Senate bill allows detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention to have military counsel during status determination hearings. There is a possibility of multiple status determinations for detainees, which may involve transfer or prosecution without the need for a military judge or right to counsel. The status review process under Section 1036 could apply only to detainees already designated for long-term detention, while others may have their status determined through existing administrative review. The White House disapproves of a provision in the Senate bill that allows detainees in long-term detention to have their status determined through existing administrative review processes. This provision is criticized for conflicting with established military procedures for detainee reviews. Section 1037 of the bill permits plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in the House-passed H.R. 1540. The Senate bill does not amend the MCA to include references to capital cases in Section 949i of title 10, U.S. Code."
