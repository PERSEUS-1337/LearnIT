    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If there is a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position, the taxpayer must recognize gain as if the position were sold for its fair market value on the date of the sale. Any gain must be included in the taxable year that includes the sale date. Adjustments will be made for any subsequent gain or loss realized with respect to the position after the constructive sale. The term 'appreciated financial position' refers to any position with potential gain upon sale, including stock, debt instrument, or partnership interest. A 'position' encompasses various interests like futures contracts, short sales, or options. The holding period for such positions is determined as if they were acquired on the date of a constructive sale. For tax purposes, a taxpayer can be considered to have made a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position through actions like short selling, entering into offsetting contracts, or engaging in futures or forward contracts. The taxpayer can trigger a constructive sale by entering into futures or forward contracts, acquiring substantially identical property, or engaging in transactions with similar effects. The term 'constructive sale' excludes transactions where the appreciated financial position is marked to market or involves nonpublicly traded property sold within 1 year of the contract. The contract is entered into, with exceptions for transactions closed by year-end, disregarding appreciated financial positions sold with recognized gain or loss, and other transactions treated as constructive sales if closed before the end of the taxable year. In transactions closed during the last 30 days of the taxable year, a similar transaction cannot be entered into for the following 31 days. Related persons are defined based on specific relationships outlined in sections 267 or 707(b). For tax purposes, certain transactions are restricted if entered into at the end of the taxable year. Related persons are defined based on specific relationships outlined in sections 267 or 707(b). Positions in interest rates are considered substantially identical to debt instruments. Definitions include forward contracts and offsetting notional principal contracts. An offsetting notional principal contract involves paying the investment yield on a property in exchange for reimbursement for any decline in its value. Special rules apply to subsequent sales of appreciated financial positions. For determining constructive sale of appreciated financial positions, if a position is sold or disposed of while the transaction is open, it is treated as entering into a constructive sale immediately after the sale. Trust interests are treated as stock for this purpose. For tax purposes, an interest in a trust actively traded is treated as stock. In the case of a constructive sale of property, the specific property deemed sold is determined as if it were an actual sale, disregarding any prior open sales. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for these rules. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for carrying out the purposes of this section.
