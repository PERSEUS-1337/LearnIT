    "content": "The \"Save America's Jobs Act of 2002\" aims to prevent corporate expatriation to avoid US income tax. The \"Save America's Jobs Act of 2002\" addresses the definition of domestic corporations and partnerships for tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It specifies that a domestic corporation or partnership is one created or organized in the United States or under U.S. law, with certain exceptions outlined by the Secretary. The acquiring corporation in a corporate expatriation transaction is treated as a domestic corporation. A corporate expatriation transaction refers to any transaction involving a nominally foreign corporation. The acquiring corporation is treated as a domestic corporation in a corporate expatriation transaction when it acquires substantially all properties of a domestic corporation and more than 80 percent of its stock is held by former shareholders. In certain cases, a lower stock ownership requirement of 50 percent may apply to a nominally foreign corporation if it lacks substantial business activities compared to the total business. The stock ownership requirement for a foreign corporation may be lower if it has limited business activities and its stock is publicly traded in the US. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' includes a transaction where a nominally foreign acquiring corporation obtains properties of a domestic partnership. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' involves a situation where a foreign acquiring corporation holds over 80% of the stock of the domestic partnership after the transaction. The acquiring corporation must meet specific requirements for a corporate expatriation transaction. Related transactions are treated as one, and stock held by the acquiring corporation's affiliated group is considered. The acquiring corporation in a corporate expatriation transaction shall not include ownership of a nominally foreign corporation. The text chunk discusses the definition of an expanded affiliated group for tax purposes and the modification of corporate tax rates by the Secretary of the Treasury. The amendment made by subsection (a) may result in a net decrease in revenues for a taxable year equal to the net increase in revenue, with tax rates determined by estimates from the Secretary of the Treasury and adjustments made for succeeding years. Effective dates for the amendment are specified. Effective Dates: The amendment applies to corporate expatriation transactions completed after September 11, 2001. It also applies to transactions completed on or before September 11, 2001, but only for taxable years of the acquiring corporation starting after December 31, 2003."
