    "content": "The Act titled \"Equitable Compensation for American Victims of Torture Act of 2009\" aims to provide justice for victims of torture and terrorism. The Congress finds that during the Gulf War in 1991, Americans serving in the Armed Forces were captured, tortured, and subjected to horrendous acts by Saddam Hussein's regime, along with CBS News reporter Bob Simon and cameraman Roberto Alvarez. Many US citizens were detained and beaten following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. During the Gulf War, many United States citizens were detained by Iraq, subjected to cruel treatment, and used as \"human shields\" to prevent military intervention. The Department of State classified Iraq as a state sponsor of terrorism at that time. American POWs and civilian hostages suffered long-term physical and mental damage due to state-sponsored torture and terrorism. During the Gulf War, American POWs were welcomed home as heroes by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Congress passed resolutions condemning Iraq's brutal treatment of captured US service members and demanding adherence to the Geneva Convention. Iraq was held accountable for torture. In 1996, Congress amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow torture victims like American POWs to seek compensation from terrorist countries, including Iraq. On April 4, 2002, 17 Gulf War POWs and their families filed claims in the United States District Court for damages related to their injuries. The District of Columbia seeks compensation for damages from torture and abuse by the Government of Iraq. The POWs involved are Colonel Clifford Acree, Lieutenant Colonel Craig Berryman, Former Staff Sergeant Troy Dunlap, Colonel David Eberly, Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey D. Fox, Chief Warrant Officer 5 Guy Hunter, Sergeant David Lockett, Colonel H. Michael Roberts, Colonel Russell Sanborn, Captain Lawrence Randolph Slade, Major Joseph Small, and Staff Sergeant Daniel. In 2003, a judge awarded damages to former POWs who were tortured by the Government of Iraq, emphasizing the importance of deterring torture of POWs. The recipients of the judgment included Major Joseph Small, Staff Sergeant Daniel Stamaris, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Dale Storr, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Sweet, Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Tice, Former Lieutenant Robert Wetzel, and Former Commander Jeffrey Zaun. Despite a ruling awarding damages to former POWs tortured by Iraq, they have not received payment due to a waiver granted by the President. The United States district court held Iraq liable for taking US citizens hostage after the invasion of Kuwait. On March 20, 2003, the President directed the payment of judgments awarded to former hostages in Hill v. Republic of Iraq from blocked Iraqi accounts. Additionally, an Executive order was issued to confiscate all remaining blocked assets of Iraq for Iraq reconstruction. The Vine v. Republic of Iraq case involves over 200 US citizens held hostage in Iraq, seeking compensation. They are unable to enforce any judgment due to a waiver granted to Iraq by the President under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The United States, as a party to the Third Geneva Convention, cannot absolve Iraq of liability for torturing prisoners of war. The US has a moral duty to protect its Armed Forces and citizens from torture and hostage-taking. The United States is committed to protecting its citizens from torture and hostage-taking, and holding state sponsors of terrorism accountable. If certain cases against Iraq are not settled within 30 days, the President has waiver authority under the National Defense Authorization Act. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 will terminate any waivers granted for cases against Iraq if not settled within 30 days. The cases mentioned are in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Adequate settlement refers to payment by the Government of Iraq or a US depository institution. Payment by a US depository institution under an unconditional guarantee to individuals with claims related to hostage taking, who have not obtained a judgment before the enactment of this Act. The Act provides compensation of $150,000, plus $6,000 per day for hostages subjected to torture, with a maximum limit of $900,000 for individuals with claims related to hostage taking who have not obtained a judgment before the enactment of this Act. The Act offers compensation of $2,500,000, plus $6,000 per day for hostages, with additional payments to spouses, children, and individuals with existing compensatory damages judgments. Compensatory damages in a case involving a hostage include payment of the unsatisfied judgment amount, capped at $1,000,000 or the award amount, and one-third of any excess over $1,000,000. Definitions in this section clarify that a \"hostage\" refers to an individual in this context. The term \"hostage\" refers to an individual seized or detained in the act of hostage taking, with specific definitions provided for \"hostage status\" and \"hostage taking\" in relevant laws. The term \"person\" includes the legal representative of a claimant's estate. \"Torture\" is defined in the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991. \"United States\" refers to the several States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession. A United States depository institution is defined as a financial institution organized under the laws of a State, the District of Columbia, or the United States, including branches of foreign institutions. Section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003, and any authority exercised by the President under this section, are subject to additional provisions. The President's authority under section 1503 and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 did not intend to remove jurisdiction over cases under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 provision applies to cases under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code, despite any waiver for Iraq."
