    "content": "Congress has been grappling with reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for over five years. The Act authorizes various specific Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, such as health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. It also includes provisions for IHS reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid, and other public health programs. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorizes specific Indian Health Service (IHS) programs and includes provisions for IHS reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid, and other health insurance programs. Congress has been working on reauthorizing the IHCIA for over five years, with ongoing negotiations and multiple reauthorization bills introduced. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee reported a bill in 2006, similar to a House bill referred to three committees. A Senate Finance Committee bill amending the Social Security Act regarding Indian health provisions was also reported. Congress is dealing with a multi-billion-dollar issue related to Indian health. Legislative Issues: Congress is facing a multi-billion-dollar problem related to Indian trust funds, with Indian individuals and tribes claiming as much as $176 billion. This has led to lawsuits and the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians within the Department of the Interior. Trust lands total about 56 million acres. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) manages trust lands totaling 56 million acres for tribes and individuals. The funds' asset value is $3.3 billion, with $2.9 billion in tribal accounts and $400 million in Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The Treasury Department oversees the accounts, making payments to beneficiaries. The BIA has faced criticism for its management of trust lands and funds, with past investigations revealing issues such as undocumented asset values and unlinked lands to owners and accounts. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 was enacted to address issues with the management of Indian trust funds and assets. This led to the creation of the Office of the Special Trustee (OST) to oversee trust management reforms. A class action suit was filed by IIM account holders demanding an accounting of their funds and correction of fund mismanagement. Additionally, tribal suits have also been filed. The Cobell case, involving trust fund mismanagement by DOI and Treasury, has led to the reorganization of the BIA and OST. Congressional consideration is ongoing for the settlement of IIM and tribal claims. The district court found breaches in trust duties and ordered DOI and Treasury to bring trust management up to current standards. The final stage of the lawsuit will determine the amount of money in the IIM plaintiffs' accounts, with DOI proposing a historical accounting method while plaintiffs suggest using databases to estimate losses. DOI estimated tens of millions in losses, while plaintiffs' methods show higher losses. The district court has issued orders for the DOI to perform a historical accounting of IIM trust account transactions since 1887, with estimated compliance costs of $12-13 billion. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned these orders twice. Congress has mainly addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings. Congress has addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts. Concerns have been raised about the costs of the lawsuit impacting DOI trust reform implementation. No bills have been introduced to amend the 1994 Act regarding historical accounting obligations. The Cobell lawsuit may jeopardize DOI trust reform implementation and reduce spending on Indian programs. Current costs include ongoing litigation expenses. Future costs could reach $12-$13 billion for historical accounting, a potential settlement amount of $27.5 billion, or over $100 billion estimated by Cobell plaintiffs for IIM accounts. Funding sources include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund.\" The Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund\" may not be enough for a $12-$13 billion settlement. Congress has options like waiting for court actions, delaying an accounting, or directing a settlement. Two bills have been introduced in Congress for an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on S. 1439 in July 2005 and March 28, 2006, to review and recommend changes in Indian trust asset management, increase payments for fractionated individual Indian trust interests, create a tribal trust management project, and require an annual independent audit of all Indian trust funds. H.R. 4322 is pending further committee action after Senate Indian Affairs Committee mark-up of an amended S. 1439 with an $8 billion settlement was withdrawn for more negotiations. DOI, BIA, and OST have proposed administrative changes to implement trust management reform since the 1994 Act. The 1996 trust management reform transferred the management of trust funds from BIA to OST, while trust lands and physical assets remained with BIA. In 2003, DOI reorganized BIA trust management operations, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing lack of consultation. The DOI faced opposition to the reorganization of trust management, with tribes claiming insufficient consultation and undefined OST duties. Previous attempts to stop the reorganization in Congress have failed, and bills proposing changes to DOI and BIA trust management have not progressed. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose reorganizing DOI management of Indian trust assets, pending negotiations. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) regulates gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands, aiming for tribal economic development. IGRA prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, with exceptions for certain tribes. The prohibition on gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988 has exceptions for certain tribes, which critics argue can lead to \"reservation shopping\" and undermine on-reservation economic development. Bills like S. 2078 aim to curb these exceptions. Two bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to eliminate exceptions for gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988. They remove the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allow applications filed before specific dates to proceed. H.R. 4893 adds a geographic limitation, while both bills retain exceptions for tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, and restored tribes with certain limitations. The land claim exception is repealed by H.R. H.R. 4893 and S. 2078 aim to eliminate exceptions for gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988. H.R. 4893 adds a new exception for tribes landless on the date of its enactment, but applies the same limits as for newly recognized tribes. Opponents argue that the bills add new burdens on tribes and that H.R. 4893's requirement for mitigation agreements undermines tribal sovereignty. Native Hawaiians, the indigenous people of Hawaii, are not currently considered Indians under federal Indian law and have no recognized political entity. Congress has authorized federal programs to benefit Native Hawaiians, but supporters of recognition are concerned about the lack of a recognized Native Hawaiian political entity endangering these programs. The lack of a recognized Native Hawaiian political entity endangers federal and state programs for Native Hawaiians, leading to legal challenges claiming the programs are race-based. Legislation in the 109th Congress aims to establish a process for federally recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity, addressing questions about governmental powers and lands at a later stage. Legislation in the 109th Congress aims to establish a process for federally recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity, addressing questions about governmental powers and lands. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity due to its constitutional authority over indigenous native peoples in the United States. They also point to Congress's special relationship with the Native Hawaiian people, similar to that with Indian tribes. Proponents argue that Native Hawaiians have not given up their claims to sovereignty but rather had sovereignty forcibly withdrawn in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, led by Americans in Hawaii with the support of certain U.S. officials and armed forces. Opponents dispute the claim that Native Hawaiians have a single distinct community with cultural and political institutions, arguing that Congress does not have constitutional authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity. They also argue that the United States does not have a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians as it does for Indian tribes. Opponents argue that the United States does not have a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians like it does for Indian tribes. They also believe that recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity based on race alone could set a precedent for other non-Indian groups. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission has raised concerns about racial discrimination regarding Native Hawaiian sovereignty. Some opponents dispute claims about Native Hawaiian sovereignty, arguing that it ended before 1893 due to political rights given to non-Native Hawaiians. Bills like S. 147 and H.R. 309 were considered in previous Congresses, with S. 147 reported by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2005. S. 3064, an amended version, was introduced in 2006 after discussions among congressional offices, the Administration, and Hawaii. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on a motion to consider S. 147 and S. 3064, effectively ending Senate consideration. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee and has not been reported. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on constitutional issues raised by H.R. 309."
