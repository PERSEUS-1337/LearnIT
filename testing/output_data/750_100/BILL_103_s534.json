    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Crop Insurance Fairness Act\" allows for coverage levels exceeding 75% of recorded or appraised average yield. Subsection (a) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to allow the Corporation to insure producers of agricultural commodities in the US against unavoidable causes like drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, winterkill, lightning, and fire. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows insurance coverage for agricultural commodities against various unavoidable causes such as flood, hail, wind, frost, winterkill, lightning, fire, excessive rain, snow, wildlife, hurricane, tornado, insect infestation, and plant disease. Insurance coverage does not extend beyond the period the insured commodity is in the field, with the definition of \"field\" including the environment in which aquacultural species are produced. Insurance coverage for agricultural commodities includes protection against loss in yield, covering 75 percent of the average yield of the commodity on the insured farm for a representative period, with adjustments as prescribed by the Board. The Corporation offers lesser levels of yield coverage, including 50 percent coverage, adjusted based on the average yield set by the Board for farms in the same area. Adjusted yields are determined by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service for each farming unit. The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service establishes adjusted yields for farming units for insurance purposes, which may differ from the Corporation's recorded or appraised yields. Additional insurance coverage may be provided based on the adjusted yield. The Corporation provides additional insurance coverage for increased risk at a determined premium rate to cover losses and establish reserves. Coverage levels exceeding 75 percent are available. The Corporation may offer coverage exceeding 75 percent of the average yield in certain cases where normal yield variations have not led to loss claims. The maximum coverage level available to producers is generally limited to 75 percent. Insurance under this subsection offers coverage exceeding 75 percent of the average yield, with a projected market price option of at least 90 percent. Uninsured losses include neglect or malfeasance by the producer and failure to reseed the same crop in specific circumstances. The Board may limit or refuse insurance based on insurance risks. Insurance shall not be provided on any agricultural commodity in counties where the income from the commodity is deemed unimportant. The Corporation provides insurance for agricultural producers in specific areas bordering counties with crop-insurance programs. They report annually to Congress on their operations and establish a minimum price level for insured commodities. Insurance coverage is offered to producers at a price equal to or lower than the market price set by the Board, quoted in dollars per acre. Late planting coverage is provided. Late planting coverage is offered to producers under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, allowing planting after the final planting date for up to 25 days with a reduction in yield guarantee. Late planting coverage under the Federal Crop Insurance Act allows for planting after the final planting date with reduced yield guarantee. The penalty for delayed planting includes a 1 percent per day charge for the first 10 days, 2 percent per day for the next 15 days, and additional amounts to offset insurer risk. Producers are presumed to have this coverage unless they opt out. Late planting coverage can be waived by producers under the Federal Crop Insurance Act if they notify the Corporation. If late planting coverage would significantly increase premiums, the Corporation will offer it as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage applies if producers are unable to plant a crop due to excess moisture, drought, or other natural disasters, providing them with 50 percent coverage. Producers are eligible for 50 percent coverage of the guaranteed level for the crop. They can choose to plant a substitute crop instead of an insured crop, with the value of the substitute crop offsetting the coverage for the insured crop. Producers are presumed to have prevented planting coverage unless they waive it. Producers can waive prevented planting coverage if it would raise premiums too much. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF PENALTY FOR DE MINIMIS YIELDS. The Corporation will establish a procedure where producers with disaster losses won't have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of production is lower than harvesting costs. SEC. 6. YIELD AVERAGES. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 crop years. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for those covered. The Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 crop years. Transitional yield data may only be used if actual production history is not established for the first 4 crop years. Producers on a farm can use actual production history for crop insurance coverage, or opt for transitional yield data for new parcels of land if approved by the Corporation. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to accommodate producer yield declines from natural disasters, using transitional yield data for new parcels of land. The Corporation uses countywide average yields to establish yields for producers on farms without production records available."
