    "content": "The U.S. teen birth rate has been declining since the 1950s, reaching a record low in 2018. Factors contributing to this decrease include reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives. The influence of any single factor is not fully known. Despite the decline in the teen birth rate, Congress remains interested in the issue due to its social and economic costs. Disparities in teen birth rates persist among different racial and ethnic groups and across states. This report accompanies CRS Report R45183, Teen Pregnancy: Federal Prevention Programs, which discusses Congress's support for programs aimed at preventing teen pregnancy. The teen birth rate and teen pregnancy rate are different. The birth rate refers to live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, while the pregnancy rate includes pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, including live births, abortions, and fetal losses. Birth data are comprehensive, while pregnancy data are estimates based on various reporting systems and surveys by the CDC and Guttmacher Institute. In 2018, there were approximately 3.8 million births in the United States, with about 180,000 (4.7%) to teenagers aged 15 to 19. The CDC tracks birth rates by age, and the U.S. teen birth rate from 1950 through 2018 is shown in Figure 1. The teen birth rate in the United States peaked in 1957 at 96.3 and then declined in most years from the 1960s through the 1980s. From 1991 onwards, there was a significant decline in the teen birth rate, dropping by 72% from 1991 (61.8) to 2018 (17.4). The rate continued to decrease, with the greatest decline occurring in recent years, such as a 58% drop from 2007 to 2018. In 2018, the teen birth rate reached a historical low of 17.4, the lowest since the CDC began collecting data in the 1940s. In 1960, the teen birth rate was highest for teens aged 15 to 17 (43.9 per 1,000) and 18 to 19 (166.7 per 1,000). The 2018 birth rates for 15- to 17-year-olds (7.2 per 1,000) and 18- to 19-year-olds (32.3 per 1,000) were the lowest on record. Repeat teen births declined by nearly 54% from 2004 to 2015. The prevalence of repeat teen births was highest among Hispanic youth, followed by non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white youth. In 2018, the birth rate for unmarried teens aged 15 to 19 was 16.0 per 1,000, compared to 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010. Despite the overall decline in the teen birth rate, rates for certain racial and ethnic groups remain relatively high, with Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens having the highest rates. In 2018, the teen birth rate for Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens was more than double that of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. The teen birth rate decreased for all racial and ethnic groups from 1991 to 2018, with certain groups experiencing larger declines. From 2007 to 2018, birth rates declined for various racial and ethnic groups, with non-Hispanic white teens seeing a 55% decrease, non-Hispanic black teens a 58% decrease, and Hispanic teens a 65% decrease. Despite the larger declines for some groups, the birth rates for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic teens remained higher. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate at 7.2 and Arkansas the highest at 30.4. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state, with Arkansas having the highest rate at 30.4. Eighteen states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19, while ten states had the highest rates of 25 or higher. Rates for the territories ranged from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. Teen birth rates have decreased in each state or territory from 2007 to 2018, with rates ranging from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. Despite the decline in rural areas, teen birth rates remain higher than in urban areas. The U.S. teen birth rate is higher than that of most other industrialized countries, with the U.S. rate of 18.8 being 50% higher than the United Kingdom's rate of 12.6 in 2017. The high teen birth rate in the United States compared to other industrial countries may be influenced by economic conditions and income inequality. Research suggests that contraceptive use among teens is higher in other developed countries. Multiple trends have contributed to the decline in U.S. teen pregnancy and birth rates, primarily due to improved contraceptive use from the 1990s to 2007. The risk of teen pregnancy decreased due to improved contraceptive use, including an increase in condom use, multiple methods of contraception, and decreased sexual activity among younger teens. Recent declines in teen pregnancy risk are also attributed to increasing contraceptive use among sexually active teens, particularly from 2007 to 2014. Broad economic and social variables may influence teen behaviors, such as whether they will abstain from sex or use contraceptives. Behavioral changes may have been driven by factors like expanded educational and labor market opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology. Observers theorize that the long-term downward trend in teen birth rates is attributable to the recession that began in 2007. The decrease in teen births during economic downturns is partly due to teenagers being more careful as they witness their families' economic difficulties. Factors like social media and the internet also play a role in teens' knowledge about sex and birth control, with shows like 16 and Pregnant influencing behavior. The show 16 and Pregnant influenced teens to change their behavior, such as using contraceptives more. Teen birth rates decreased even after the show's peak ratings. Some believe that federal-funded teen pregnancy prevention programs may have contributed to the decline in birth rates. Teen pregnancy has significant costs for families and society, leading to lower education levels and higher poverty rates for teenage parents. Teen parents tend to have lower education levels and higher poverty rates compared to their peers. For example, many teen girls drop out of high school due to pregnancy or parenthood, leading to financial struggles. This lack of education limits their economic opportunities and increases the likelihood of teenage pregnancy. Additionally, a significant number of teen mothers rely on public benefits within the first year after giving birth. Teen mothers often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, leading to poorer outcomes. Teen sexual activity increases the risk of STIs, with adolescents aged 15 to 19 having high rates. Teen childbearing can also result in long-term health issues. Teen childbearing can have negative impacts on the offspring, leading to chronic medical conditions, lower school readiness scores, poor academic performance, early childbirth for females, and incarceration for males. Additionally, teen childbearing has societal consequences, including cost savings to public programs. The Power to Decide estimated cost savings of $4.4 billion from 1991 to 2015 by averting teen births, considering savings to Medicaid for labor and delivery, postpartum care, infant care, and assistance programs like TANF, SNAP, and WIC. Research on decreased or delayed teenage pregnancy and childbearing could provide valuable insights into the impacts on teen parents, their children, and society."
