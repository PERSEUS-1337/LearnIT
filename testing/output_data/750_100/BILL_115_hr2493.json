Congress finds that public confidence in the Federal Government relies on officers and employees avoiding conflicts of interest. This includes nominees or appointees to Senate-confirmed positions who have ties to political entities. Since the 2010 Citizens United v. FEC decision, corporate political spending has significantly increased, with contributions to entities under section 501(c)(4) of the IRS code remaining undisclosed, leading to anonymous spending and potential conflicts of interest. Current financial disclosure requirements do not mandate reporting donations to political action committees or entities under sections 501(c)(4) or 501(c)(6) of the IRS code, leading to potential conflicts of interest. Disclosure to the Office of Government Ethics is crucial for addressing these conflicts through ethics agreements. Ethics agreements can address conflicts of interest between filers and the agency they serve. SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF CONTRIBUTIONS.
