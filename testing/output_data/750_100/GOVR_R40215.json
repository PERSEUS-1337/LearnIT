The 9-11 Commission emphasized the importance of \"institutionalizing imagination\" to address organizational and procedural challenges in the federal government's oversight system. Multiple entities, including Congress, the President, and agencies like the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office, engage in oversight activities within this system.

Agencies oversee their own activities as mandated by Congress, with tools such as monitoring and evaluation utilized. Different perspectives exist on the objectives of oversight. The oversight framework involves multiple perspectives on objectives such as compliance with laws, congressional intent, avoidance of mismanagement and bias, effectiveness, and efficiency in funded activities. The oversight framework involves various perspectives on compliance with laws, congressional intent, avoidance of mismanagement, effectiveness, and efficiency in funded activities. Implementation by agencies, nonfederal recipients, OMB, oversight board, and IGs remains uncertain. Selected oversight provisions in economic stimulus legislation are analyzed in Table 1. References to \"the Act\" in each bill generally pertain to Division A or Division B, not the entire bill."
