    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with a high fatality rate for drivers in this age group compared to older drivers. Teenage drivers aged 16 have a crash rate almost 10 times higher than drivers aged 30-60. Teenage drivers account for over 1/3 of fatalities in crashes they are involved in, with nearly 2/3 of fatalities being other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. According to research, teenage drivers have a significantly higher crash rate compared to older drivers. The presence of peers in the vehicle increases the risk of a crash, with cognitive distractions from cell phones affecting teenage drivers aged 15 to 20. According to research, teenage drivers have a higher crash rate, especially at night. The implementation of graduated driver licensing systems has shown a decrease in fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers. In Michigan and Florida, crashes involving 16-year-old drivers decreased significantly between 1995 and 1999. Between 1995 and 1999, Michigan and North Carolina saw a 25-27 percent decrease in crashes involving 16-year-old drivers after implementing comprehensive graduated driver licensing systems. In California, from 1998 to 2000, teenage passenger deaths and injuries decreased by 40 percent, and at-fault collisions involving 16-year-old drivers declined by 24 percent. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that many states have implemented 3-stage graduated driver licensing systems, but some have not yet implemented other basic safety features. A 2001 Harris Poll shows that 95 percent of Americans support a requirement of 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with an adult. According to a 2001 Harris Poll, 95 percent of Americans support a requirement of 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with an adult. Additionally, 92 percent of Americans support a 6-month learner's permit period, and 74 percent support limiting the number of teenage passengers in a car with a teenage driver and supervised driving during high-risk periods. State graduated driver licensing laws. State graduated driver licensing laws require novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage process before getting an unrestricted license, starting with a learner's permit at 16 years old. Graduated driver licensing laws mandate a 2-stage process for novice drivers under 21, starting with a learner's permit at 16 years old. The second stage includes restrictions such as a minimum duration of 6 months, no cellphone use while driving, no night driving, and remains effective until the intermediate stage or the driver turns 18. The intermediate stage of graduated driver licensing starts after the learner's permit stage, lasting at least 6 months. It prohibits cellphone use, night driving, and driving with more than 1 non-familial passenger. In the intermediate stage of graduated driver licensing, drivers are prohibited from having more than 1 non-familial passenger under 21 years old without a licensed driver over 21 present. This rule remains in effect until the driver turns 18. Additional requirements may be set by the Secretary of Transportation, such as 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training during the learner's permit stage. In the learner's permit or intermediate stage of graduated driver licensing, requirements include training with a licensed driver over 21 and supervision by a licensed driver over 21 while operating a vehicle. During the learner's permit or intermediate stage of graduated driver licensing, an unrestricted driver's license may be automatically delayed for individuals convicted of driving-related offenses like driving while intoxicated, misrepresentation of age, or reckless driving. The Secretary of Transportation will establish regulations for implementing penalties for driving offenses such as reckless driving, not wearing a seat belt, speeding, or other offenses deemed relevant. Regulations will be developed following the notice and comment provisions under section 553 of title 5, United States. Incentive grants will be provided under section 4. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to States in compliance with section 3(a) for the first 3 fiscal years after the enactment of the Act. States must submit an application including a certification by the Governor to be eligible for the grant. The Secretary will review State applications to determine compliance with section 3(a) and award grants to compliant States based on a formula involving appropriated funds and apportionment ratios. Funds from grants awarded under this section can be used for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process, training law enforcement personnel, and publishing educational materials related to State graduated driver licensing laws. Authorization of $25,000,000 annually from the Highway Trust Fund for administrative activities related to State graduated driver licensing laws. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year after the enactment of the Act, the Secretary will withhold 3 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a). In the fifth fiscal year, the withholding increases to 5 percent. During the sixth and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will withhold 10 percent of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a) on the first day of the fiscal year. During the sixth and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will withhold funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a) on the first day of the fiscal year. Any amount withheld from a state on or before the last day of the sixth fiscal year will remain available for distribution to the state until the end of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year. The Secretary will withhold funds from states not complying with section 3(a) until the end of the sixth fiscal year. After the sixth fiscal year, withheld funds may not be distributed to the state. If a state complies before the funds expire, the Secretary will apportion the withheld funds. The Secretary of Transportation will distribute withheld funds to states that comply with section 3(a) once compliance is achieved. The distributed funds will be available for expenditure by the State until the end of the third fiscal year following the year of apportionment. Any unspent funds after this period will revert back to the Treasury. If a State is not in compliance with section 3(a) at the end of the period for which any amount withheld remains available for distribution, the funds will revert back to the Treasury of the United States."
