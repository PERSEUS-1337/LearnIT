    "content": "The \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act\" is the short title of the legislation. The purpose of the Act is to facilitate access to speedy transmissions for networks, e-commerce, and telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets nationwide. It recognized the unique circumstances of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Existing regulations often burden two percent carriers, hindering their deployment of advanced services in less populated regions. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will allow them to allocate more resources to deploying advanced services and competitive initiatives in less densely populated regions of the Nation, benefiting consumers. This Act aims to facilitate this purpose. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and competition in the telecommunications industry by reducing regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. This will improve carriers' flexibility and allow them to redirect resources to increasing initiatives. The Act aims to reduce regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers to improve flexibility and redirect resources to increasing initiatives. SEC. 3. DEFINITION. Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include the definition of a \"two percent carrier\" as an incumbent local exchange carrier with a limited number of access lines. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a \"two percent carrier\" as an incumbent local exchange carrier with a limited number of access lines, which are fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines installed nationwide. SEC. 4. REGULATORY RELIEF FOR TWO PERCENT CARRIERS. Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include reduced regulatory requirements for two percent carriers. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. Failure to do so means the rule cannot be enforced against two percent carriers until evaluated separately. The Commission must evaluate the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers before enforcing rules. No separate evaluation is needed if the rules do not apply to these carriers or if they are exempt. Differentiation based on carrier size is allowed by law. Effective date of this section applies. The provisions of this section apply to any rule adopted on or after the enactment date. \"Limitation of reporting requirements under SEC. 282.\" The Commission is limited in requiring a two percent carrier to file cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports, except for section 224 purposes. The carrier must certify compliance with cost allocation rules annually. This limitation does not restrict the Commission's authority. The Commission has the authority to access information from two percent carriers under specific sections, without any limitations. SEC. 283. INTEGRATED OPERATION OF TWO PERCENT CARRIERS. The Commission will not require any two percent carrier to have a separate affiliate for providing various services, including local and interexchange services, mobile radio services, internet, and other enhanced services. Additionally, the carrier and its affiliates are not required to maintain separate personnel, facilities, departments, or operations. \"SEC. 284. Participation in tariff pools and price cap regulation.\" The participation or withdrawal from a common line tariff by a two percent carrier administered by NECA or any successor shall not obligate the carrier for other study areas. The Commission may require a 60-day notice for participation or withdrawal. The carrier's election is binding for one year. A two percent carrier may choose to be regulated under price cap rate regulation by the Commission for one or more study areas, with the election being binding for one year from the date of the election. \"SEC. 285. DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES BY TWO PERCENT COMPANIES.\" The Commission allows two percent carriers to introduce new interstate telecommunications services with only one day's notice for tariff filing, without needing approval for rate structures. The term 'new interstate telecommunications service' refers to services not previously offered by the carrier. The two percent carrier can introduce a new service that expands service options for ratepayers without prior approval for rate structures. SEC. 286. ENTRY OF COMPETING CARRIER. Pricing Flexibility for Two Percent Carriers: Two percent carriers can de-average rates, file tariffs with short notice, and file contract-based tariffs for interstate services upon certification of competition. This applies even if the carrier is under rate-of-return regulation. The Commission will regulate a two percent carrier as non-dominant and not require tariffing of interstate services if a local exchange carrier or its affiliate is engaged in facilities-based entry within the two percent carrier's service area. A two percent carrier meeting certain requirements can participate in the common line tariff by including its study areas. \"Facilities-based entry\" refers to operations within a two percent carrier's service area. The term 'entry' in the context of a two percent carrier refers to providing local telephone exchange switching and service to at least one unaffiliated customer. A 'contract-based tariff' is a tariff based on a service contract between a two percent carrier and its customers, including terms and renewal options. The contract terms include the term length, service descriptions, minimum volume commitments, contract prices, volume discounts, and other relevant regulations. The contract terms cover classifications, practices, and regulations related to the contract rate, with the term 'service area' defined as in section 214(e)(5). \"SEC. 287. SAVINGS PROVISIONS.\" The Commission's authority under sections 201 through 208 is not restricted. Rural telephone companies' rights are not diminished, and state authority over intrastate communications service is not limited by this part.

If the Commission does not approve or deny an application within 60 days, it will be deemed approved without conditions. The Commission must also consider waiver petitions or requests related to the merger or acquisition. The Commission must allow a two percent carrier to elect under section 284 for local exchange facilities obtained through a merger or acquisition subject to review deadlines. This section applies to applications submitted after the enactment date, and pending applications will be subject to these requirements. The Commission must allow a two percent carrier to elect under section 284 for local exchange facilities obtained through a merger or acquisition subject to review deadlines. Applications submitted after the enactment date will be subject to these requirements as if they had been filed with the Commission on that date. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions for reconsideration or waiver within 90 days. If no action is taken within this period, the relief sought in the petition shall be deemed granted.

Failure to act will result in a stay of enforcement of any rule until the Commission issues an order. Any petitions not acted upon will be considered final orders and can be appealed. The provisions apply to petitions submitted after the enactment date, and pending petitions will be subject to the new requirements. SEC. 7. NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONS. The 60-day and 90-day time periods under sections 310 and 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 do not apply if an Executive Branch agency with national security, law enforcement, or public safety jurisdiction submits a written filing to the Federal Communications Commission. The Federal Communications Commission may be advised by an Executive Branch agency if a petition or application raises national security, law enforcement, or public safety concerns that cannot be resolved within the 60-day or 90-day time period."
