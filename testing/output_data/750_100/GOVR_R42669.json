    "content": "The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply in cases authorized by the Constitution, with older commentaries suggesting that the Act is constitutionally impermissible. Regulations on the use of armed forces during civil disturbances are based on constitutional principles. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply during civil disturbances, except for sudden emergencies and protection of federal property. The Act does not apply when Congress authorizes the military to enforce the law in three ways. The question of whether the President can use implied constitutional powers in these situations remains unanswered by the courts. The government has granted the Coast Guard broad law enforcement responsibilities and passed specific statutes allowing the President to deploy the armed forces during insurrection. General legislation permits the armed forces to collaborate with civilian law enforcement agencies to address individual cases and resolve issues raised by the Wounded Knee cases. The legislation grants authority for military assistance to police, with restrictions on its use. It allows sharing of information acquired during military operations and encourages planning for civilian benefits. Military undercover agents and intelligence collection are permitted only with a nexus to a military purpose. The legislation allows military equipment and facilities to be used for civilian activities with a military purpose. Military personnel can train civilian police, provide expert advice, and operate equipment. The authority is subject to restrictions to protect the military capability of the United States and requires civilian beneficiaries to pay for assistance. The Secretary of Defense must issue regulations to ensure compliance. The Posse Comitatus Act allows military equipment and facilities to be used for civilian activities with a military purpose. Military personnel can train civilian police, provide expert advice, and operate equipment. The Secretary of Defense must issue regulations to ensure compliance and prevent the armed forces from being used solely for civilian law enforcement benefits. The Act does not prohibit the Army from performing military duties that incidentally benefit civilian law enforcement. The Posse Comitatus Act allows military equipment and facilities to be used for civilian activities with a military purpose, such as training civilian police and providing expert advice. The act prohibits \"willful\" misuse of the Army or Air Force, with no clear explanation of this limitation in the legislative history. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the military from performing tasks assigned to civilian government or solely for civilian government purposes. Questions about the Act arise most often in situations like using the armed forces for natural disasters. The Posse Comitatus Act questions arise when the armed forces assist civilian police, with tests developed from disturbances in 1973 at Wounded Knee. The Act prohibits the military from performing tasks assigned to civilian government. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the Army and Air Force from enforcing the law, but does not mention the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or National Guard. Courts have ruled that the Act does not apply to the Navy or Marine Corps, but they are subject to similar restrictions through Department of Defense instructions. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the Coast Guard, which is part of the armed forces under the Department of Homeland Security. When the Coast Guard is part of the Navy during war or by presidential order, it follows Navy directives. The Coast Guard is authorized to perform law enforcement functions, even while part of the Navy. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the Coast Guard, and its law enforcement activities are exempt from restrictions. Questions remain regarding the coverage of the National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, civilian employees of the armed forces, and off-duty members of the armed forces. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the Coast Guard, allowing it to perform law enforcement functions even while part of the Navy. The National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, civilian employees of the armed forces, and off-duty members of the armed forces raise questions about their coverage under the Act. The National Guard is considered part of the Army or Air Force for Posse Comitatus Act purposes when in federal service, and historical reflection suggests it may also be covered when not in federal service. The Posse Comitatus Act's reference to \"posse comitatus or otherwise\" aims to negate the idea that troops could be used to enforce the law as long as they were acting as citizens and not soldiers. The National Guard, as a creature of both state and federal law, has enjoyed the same status as the militia since the Articles of Confederation. Members of the National Guard are considered part of the Army or Air Force for Posse Comitatus Act purposes when in federal service. The Posse Comitatus Act was passed in response to cases where military members were used based on their civic obligations. Courts have ruled that the Act does not apply to National Guard members when not in federal service. The historical perspective on whether the Act extends to soldiers assisting civilian law enforcement while off duty is unclear. The Posse Comitatus Act was not intended to strip service members of all civilian rights and obligations. Recent decisions focus on the nature of assistance provided and whether it is primarily for a military purpose. Civilian employees under the direct command of a military officer are considered part of the armed forces for purposes of the Act. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the involvement of civilian employees under military command. It was enacted to prevent military usurpation of civilian law enforcement responsibilities within the United States and its territories. The Act's authority and restrictions apply to both military and civilian personnel. The Posse Comitatus Act, found in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 271-284, applies in the United States and beyond. It has been used to challenge court jurisdiction, as a defense in criminal cases, to suppress evidence, for civil liability, and to enjoin military actions. Violations are often alleged to exclude evidence in cases. The Posse Comitatus Act is frequently used by defendants to challenge court jurisdiction, suppress evidence, and as a defense in criminal cases. While some cases suggest the need for an exclusionary rule for deterrence, such a case has not yet arisen. Defendants have found the act helpful in proving the lawfulness of government conduct in prosecutions. Defendants at Wounded Knee successfully argued that evidence of possible violations prevented their convictions for obstructing law enforcement officials. However, courts did not dismiss prosecutions based on military involvement violating the act, even when a violation was acknowledged. The Eighth Circuit ruled that a violation of the act could constitute an unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, allowing aggrieved persons to bring a case against federal officers. The Posse Comitatus Act allows aggrieved persons to bring cases against federal officers for constitutional rights violations, but it also provides a defense for the government under the FTCA. Plaintiffs facing violations by state or local law enforcement officers may struggle due to qualified immunity. The Act's significant impact lies in its implications for liability and immunity in cases involving law enforcement officers. The Posse Comitatus Act has a significant impact on law enforcement officers, with the military avoiding involvement in civilian affairs to comply with the act since the founding of the Republic."
