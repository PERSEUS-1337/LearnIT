Over 30 PHAs are currently participating in MTW, managing around $2.7 billion in Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. The program aims to improve cost-effectiveness, promote self-sufficiency, and expand housing options for low-income families. The Moving to Work (MTW) program, established in 1996, manages $2.7 billion in Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher funding and $1.1 billion in public housing funding. The future of MTW is uncertain as current agreements are set to expire in 2018, with calls for earlier changes emerging. Critics argue that MTW agencies have unprecedented flexibilities with little understanding of their impacts on low-income families. The Moving to Work (MTW) program, established in 1996, manages $2.7 billion in Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher funding and $1.1 billion in public housing funding. Supporters argue that the flexibility of the MTW demonstration program has allowed participating Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to serve more families in unique, improved, and cost-effective ways. Conflicting perceptions of the program have led to calls to end, change, or expand it, making it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness or efficiency. The MTW demonstration program was created to test innovations in assisted housing provision. Some argue it should be restructured for this purpose, while others believe PHAs have shown success operating outside traditional regulations. The future of the program is controversial. The MTW demonstration program has influenced reforms in mainstream assisted housing programs. Policymakers may consider lessons from MTW agencies as they contemplate future reforms of federal housing assistance programs. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program was authorized by Congress in 1996 to provide PHAs with flexibility in designing housing assistance for low-income families. The program aims to test new approaches outside of traditional HUD programs like Section 8 and public housing. The outcomes of the program are discussed, along with potential policy options for the future. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program aims to reduce costs, promote self-sufficiency, and increase housing choices for low-income families. The program allows up to 30 PHAs to participate in testing new approaches without specific guidelines, with evaluations conducted for up to 15 agencies to identify successful models for replication. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows PHAs to develop their own policies to achieve objectives such as combining funding streams for housing assistance, waiving statutory requirements, and designing reasonable rent policies to promote employment and self-sufficiency for participating families. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows PHAs to develop their own policies to promote employment and self-sufficiency for participating families. The legislation places limits on the flexibility allowed to MTW agencies, requiring them to serve a specific number and mix of low-income families and meet HUD housing quality standards. HUD is prohibited from issuing waivers for certain provisions of the U.S. Housing Act. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program legislation requires PHAs to seek public input in developing their policies, hold public hearings, and consider public comments in their MTW application plan. The plan must detail how the PHA will use its flexibilities under the program, be approved by HUD, and include annual reports on compliance. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program allows agencies to implement various policies and activities, with annual reports required by HUD. The program's structure was influenced by concerns about public housing administration in the 1980s and 1990s. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program was developed in response to concerns about public housing administration in the 1980s and 1990s. Federal policymakers explored block granting and local management of assisted housing programs to reduce costs and improve management. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program was created to address public housing administration issues in the 1980s and 1990s. There were debates about devolving assisted housing programs to the local level for greater autonomy, but some believed federal regulation was necessary for achieving housing goals. Welfare reform discussions in the 1990s aimed at promoting family self-sufficiency in social welfare programs, including housing assistance. The Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration Program was established in response to public housing administration issues in the 1980s and 1990s. Federal policymakers and housing practitioners believed that market-based approaches could reduce assisted housing costs. HUD announced the program in December 1996, receiving 43 applications from Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and selecting 30 for participation. Selected PHAs negotiated individual MTW agreements with HUD to pursue various policy goals while maintaining existing assisted housing models. The MTW negotiation process with HUD offices was complicated and lengthy, resulting in agreements signed in 1998 or 1999. Due to delays and increased flexibility provided by a housing reform law in 1998, six selected MTW agencies chose not to participate. In 2000, HUD allocated the remaining open spaces to other housing authorities. In 2000, HUD allocated open spaces to housing authorities with more than 2,500 units. The MTW program has expanded beyond the original cap of 30 PHAs, with additional agencies added through acts of Congress. Congress directed HUD to competitively select more PHAs for participation in MTW through various legislative acts. HUD expanded the MTW program beyond the original cap of 30 PHAs through legislative acts, allowing for more agencies to participate. Currently, 35 PHAs are part of the MTW demonstration program, with four more agencies selected by HUD pending final agreements. HUD expanded the MTW program beyond the original cap of 30 PHAs through legislative acts, allowing for more agencies to participate. Currently, 35 PHAs are part of the MTW demonstration program, with four more agencies selected by HUD pending final agreements. HUD has faced criticisms for selecting PHAs with prior poor performance, lack of uniform program structure leading to varied policies, and data system limitations hindering data collection on tenant characteristics. HUD has faced challenges in evaluating the effects of MTW policies on tenant outcomes and program costs due to data collection issues and program design. Reports on MTW are process-oriented and lack comparison of policy results. The Inspector General criticized HUD for insufficient monitoring, and the GAO recommended additional steps for oversight. HUD implemented a standard MTW agreement in 2008 to improve monitoring and oversight of the program. The agreement introduced uniform language and reporting requirements while still allowing agencies flexibility to develop local policies. Participation in the MTW demonstration program was extended until 2018. HUD believes the standard agreement and program extension will facilitate systematic evaluation of agencies' policies in the future. The standard MTW agreement implemented by HUD in 2008 aims to improve monitoring and oversight of the program, allowing for more systematic evaluation of MTW agencies' policies in the future. However, the agreement does not mandate the standardization of performance data, limiting HUD's ability to assess specific policies implemented by MTW agencies. HUD has also started collecting data on tenant characteristics since 2008, which could aid in evaluating MTW policies in terms of tenant outcomes and housing costs. The 2012 GAO review noted HUD's increased efforts to monitor MTW agencies' compliance with program requirements, including undefined terms like \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice.\" HUD plans to require MTW agencies to define \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice\" and provide a template for collecting data on a \"comparable mix of families.\" In a 2011 assessment, HUD found that 91% of individuals served by MTW agencies were low-income. The GAO report found that 91% of individuals served by MTW agencies were low-income, with most agencies serving a similar number of families. HUD's recent initiatives aim to ensure compliance with statutory requirements, but lack standard definitions and a systematic process for evaluation. HUD's oversight of the MTW program has improved, but challenges remain in assessing full compliance. The IG report recommended that HUD improve its oversight of the MTW program before adding more agencies. MTW agencies have implemented various program activities, with some making significant changes while others have made more modest adjustments. MTW agencies have discretion in three policy areas: merging funding streams, level of assistance, and administrative flexibilities. Policies vary due to differences in program scope and scale. MTW agencies have the option to merge their federal funding streams into a block grant, deviating from traditional program operations. The report does not evaluate the effectiveness of these policies. MTW agencies can merge federal funding streams into a block grant, departing from traditional program operations where funding is dedicated to specific programs. This allows for more flexibility in fund usage across programs. The amount of MTW block grant assistance is negotiated, not determined by traditional formulas. MTW agencies have the flexibility to merge federal funding streams into a block grant, allowing for more flexible fund usage. Initially, only six agencies opted for merged assistance funding, but now most MTW PHAs receive it. A 2004 report found that agencies used this flexibility to address financial shortfalls and for cross-program purposes approved by HUD. MTW agencies used funding flexibility to create autonomy from regulatory processes and develop additional support services for tenants, as well as for development purposes that would not have been feasible without merged funding. MTW agencies leveraged block grant assistance for development of low-income housing units, with some agencies converting public housing stocks to new forms of assistance. Notably, Chicago Housing Authority and Atlanta Housing Authority undertook significant redevelopment projects using MTW flexibility. The Chicago Housing Authority and Atlanta Housing Authority utilized their merged funding stream to attract private investment for significant redevelopment projects, replacing deteriorating public housing with new developments in mixed-income communities. The fixed 10-year merged MTW funding stream was crucial in obtaining financing from private investors, allowing for revenue bond financing. Atlanta and other MTW agencies have used merged funding streams to finance the replacement of distressed public housing stock. Agencies like the Keene Housing Authority and the Housing Authorities of Santa Clara and San Jose have converted public housing to project-based voucher developments to leverage additional outside financing. In traditional public housing, project-basing of vouchers is a tool used more widely by MTW PHAs than non-MTW PHAs to leverage additional outside financing. PHAs can reserve a portion of a building for low-income tenants by attaching vouchers to reserved units, with a limit of project-basing up to 20% of tenant-based vouchers. MTW agencies have flexibility in project-basing vouchers, with restrictions on the percentage of units in private buildings and buildings receiving federal assistance. They can convert public housing stock, project-base former public housing properties sold to nonprofits, and serve special populations by project-basing entire buildings. MTW agencies have flexibility in project-basing vouchers, with restrictions on the percentage of units in private buildings and buildings receiving federal assistance. The majority of MTW agencies either currently have housing portfolios with project-based voucher assistance or have plans to begin project-basing vouchers, a much higher rate than non-MTW PHAs. This is in contrast to only about 15% of all PHAs engaged in project-basing vouchers according to a 2010 HUD report. Several MTW activities can impact the level of assistance provided to tenants. MTW agencies have the flexibility to experiment with alternative income calculations and rent structures for housing assistance, but HUD guidance in 2011 now requires them to determine eligibility based on statutory income calculations. MTW agencies with approved alternative income calculations may not be compliant with new guidance. They can no longer use alternative income calculations but can still implement alternative rent structures and set additional conditions for tenants. Industry groups argue that current income calculations for housing programs are overly complicated. Some MTW agencies have experimented with alternative income calculations and rent structures to simplify administration of public housing and Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher programs. Income is defined as income from all sources, and adjusted income is income less statutory exclusions, with annual income examinations required by law. Some MTW agencies have simplified income calculations by limiting exclusions and deductions, and not including income from assets below a certain threshold. In 2011, over half of participating MTW agencies used modified income or asset disregard, and a quarter used modified deductions. There is uncertainty about the future of these policies due to recent HUD guidance. Agencies have also reduced income verification frequency for certain populations. Some MTW agencies have simplified income calculations by limiting exclusions and deductions, and not including income from assets below a certain threshold. 88% of MTW agencies are using an alternate schedule for recertifying tenant income, potentially impacting revenue and subsidy costs. MTW agencies may be choosing to forgo additional revenue or increase subsidy costs, believing the administrative savings or changes in tenant incentives are worth it. There is a lack of data to assess the cost-effectiveness of this approach. Tenants under traditional housing assistance programs pay no more than 30% of their incomes towards rent, with the possibility of PHAs adopting low minimum rent policies. Rent amounts fluctuate based on tenants' income levels, affecting subsidies accordingly. MTW agencies have experimented with various rent structures, including maximum and minimum rents, flat rents, delayed rent increases, stepped rents, and alternative subsidies. Most agencies have their own minimum rent policies, some have tiered rent policies, and others have adopted alternative subsidies. Some MTW agencies have adopted tiered or flat rent policies, and simplified utility calculations for tenant subsidies. Officials believe alternative rent structures encourage work and mimic the private market, making it easier for tenants to understand. MTW agencies have adopted alternative rent structures to simplify administration and encourage work. However, there is a lack of data to evaluate the impact on tenant earnings and out-of-pocket payments. Some agencies have also implemented new requirements for tenants, such as time limits and work requirements. Some MTW PHAs have implemented work requirements and time limit policies to encourage self-sufficiency and serve more families. These policies vary across agencies and often include supportive services for families. Time limits for program participation in MTW agencies range from three to seven years, with various policies in place to decrease administrative burdens and streamline operations without changing the level of assistance families receive. This includes alternative housing quality inspection schedules and reporting requirements. Some MTW agencies have alternative housing quality inspection schedules to reduce staff resources and streamline operations. This includes clustering inspections based on location and implementing risk-based inspections. The risk-based model of inspection for MTW agencies includes less frequent inspections, self-certification of units, and sampling landlord's rental units. Only a few MTW agencies cluster inspections, while 38% inspect less than annually and 19% allow self-certification under certain conditions to meet federal housing quality standards. HUD's 2010 Report to Congress suggests that MTW agencies have adopted alternative HQS inspection procedures to ensure the quality of assisted housing stock in a less burdensome way. However, a full evaluation is needed to compare the effectiveness of traditional inspection procedures with the alternative methods. MTW agencies differ in reporting program information to HUD, submitting Annual MTW Plans and Reports. Non-MTW agencies have more prescriptive plans focused on meeting federal rules. MTW officials believe in the effectiveness of MTW programs. MTW officials interviewed in 2004 believed that MTW reporting requirements encouraged program creativity and strategic planning. They viewed other assisted housing program reporting requirements as merely fulfilling an obligation. MTW agencies had flexibility to implement activities not included in their Annual MTW Plans with specific waivers. Since 2008, MTW agencies must include new activities in their Annual MTW Plans for HUD's approval. This change allows HUD to have more knowledge of MTW agencies' activities and their outcome measurement plans. However, GAO has raised concerns about the self-reporting process in the Annual MTW Plan and Report, which may not be verified. Some MTW agencies have struggled with the new reporting requirements after years of not reporting activities. Despite new reporting requirements, some MTW agencies struggle to report activities after years of non-compliance. HUD's reporting systems lack capacity for MTW-specific data, hindering systematic evaluation of program outcomes. Standardization and improved data collection may enable future evaluations. Despite the lack of verified evidence, observations from tenant advocates, PHAs, and HUD inform policy debates about the MTW demonstration program's impact on tenants and PHAs' operations. Concerns have been raised about the negative effects of MTW policies on assisted housing tenants. The MTW demonstration program's impact on assisted housing tenants is unclear. HUD suggests that MTW has allowed PHAs to provide more housing units, potentially benefiting low-income individuals. However, the program's effects on families remain uncertain. MTW agencies may assist more families by reducing assistance to current recipients, rather than from administrative savings. Some PHAs have policies reducing rental assistance, potentially impacting low-income individuals. Self-sufficiency programs could benefit families long-term, but the impact of time limits and work requirements on needy individuals is unclear. The MTW demonstration program has raised concerns about the impact on needy families' access to assistance and tenants' housing choices. There are reports of reduced access to portability and large-scale demolition of public housing, affecting tenants' lives. Further research is needed to assess the net benefit of MTW discretion for low-income individuals. MTW agencies like Atlanta and Chicago have demolished much of their public housing stock, replacing it with vouchers and mixed-income developments. This strategy is controversial, with tenant advocates objecting to the loss of affordable housing options. Tenant advocates have objected to the large-scale displacement of public housing residents, arguing that it destroys communities and employment networks. Research on the effects of demolition and disposition of public housing, like the HOPE VI program, has shown mostly positive results for tenants. The HOPE VI program has had positive results for tenants who were displaced from distressed public housing, leading to improved health outcomes and living in lower-poverty neighborhoods. However, vulnerable tenants, such as large families or those with disabilities, may not have benefited as much and may require additional services. Data on the cost-effectiveness of MTW agencies in administering housing programs is inconclusive. Supporters of the cost-effective administration of assisted housing programs, including PHA industry groups, some practitioners, and Members of Congress, believe the MTW program has been successful. The popularity of the program is evident as most PHAs choose to renew their participation and more wish to join than there are slots available. Congress has shown support by expanding participation, and HUD officials suggest that MTW agencies are more cost-effective in housing administration. Some low-income housing advocates argue that MTW agencies may not be as cost-effective as believed, impacting funding for other PHAs. Funding levels for MTW agencies are subject to the same decreases as non-MTW agencies, but the impact on their funding if subject to standard regulations is unclear. Supporters of MTW claim that the increased discretion reduces administrative burdens without raising oversight risk. In traditional assisted housing programs, PHAs are held accountable through a regulatory structure that monitors compliance with program rules. This oversight model is seen as necessary to prevent misuse of funds. MTW agencies operate without traditional regulatory oversight, setting their own goals and reporting to HUD. Supporters argue this fosters innovation and focus on outcomes. PHA industry groups advocate for deregulation based on MTW experiences, but monitoring of program funds by MTW agencies is uncertain. The future of the MTW demonstration program is uncertain as current agreements are set to expire in 2018. Some propose expanding MTW into a permanent program, while others suggest limited expansion with changes to address concerns raised by tenant-advocates. HUD will decide whether to renew agreements. The future of the MTW demonstration program is uncertain as current agreements are set to expire in 2018. Critics call for phasing out MTW and replacing it with targeted demonstrations for more meaningful evaluations. Policymakers are debating whether MTW should be a testing ground for reforming rental assistance programs or if some version of MTW is the future of assisted housing. The future of the MTW demonstration program is uncertain as current agreements are set to expire in 2018. Policymakers are considering changing the program to make it more effective, turning it into a permanent and expanded program, or maintaining the status quo. The program aims to design and test various approaches for providing housing assistance, focusing on reducing costs, promoting work and self-sufficiency, and increasing family choice. The Secretary of HUD is tasked with evaluating participating agencies to identify replicable program models. The MTW demonstration program is being evaluated to identify replicable program models. The program's design and implementation have limited its effectiveness, with calls for changes to better serve research-oriented purposes. HUD has proposed expanding the MTW demonstration program to 60 agencies for systematic evaluation, with a focus on targeted selection and high-performing agencies. The HUD proposed expanding the MTW demonstration program to 60 agencies for systematic evaluation, focusing on selecting high-performing agencies for national adoption. This aligns with legislative proposals like the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act and the draft AHSSIA. The MTW program was created as a compromise between transforming rental assistance programs into a flexible block grant program and maintaining existing programs. The MTW compromise allowed for the creation of a new, block grant-like housing program for a small number of PHAs, while maintaining existing programs for most PHAs. The desirability of MTW has led to calls for expansion and making it a permanent program, with proposals to increase the number of eligible PHAs to at least 250. Some have proposed expanding the Moving to Work (MTW) program to include at least 250 eligible Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and making it a permanent program. There have been suggestions to block grant and deregulate federal housing assistance for all PHAs similar to MTW, but these proposals have faced concerns about potential funding reductions and deregulation impacts from industry groups and tenant advocates. Tenant advocates are concerned about deregulation in the Moving to Work (MTW) program, fearing rent increases and unreasonable conditions for tenants. HUD is worried about the capacity of some agencies entering the program, preferring high performers to ensure success. HUD argues that high performers are more likely to succeed in the MTW program due to their proven ability to meet reporting requirements. PHAs should be selected based on evaluation capacity, innovation, and local support. It is uncertain if the current MTW program or a fully deregulated block grant program is suitable for small PHAs. Policymakers have the option to make no changes and maintain the status quo. The Housing Choice Voucher program under the MTW demonstration program may continue as is, with existing agencies having agreements through 2018. Congress could add a few more agencies, and HUD has made some adjustments to address critics' concerns. If unchanged, participating PHAs will carry on with the program. The MTW demonstration program may continue with existing agencies until 2018. HUD and policymakers are considering incorporating reforms from MTW agencies into mainstream programs. Obama Administration and Members of Congress support changes to HUD rental assistance programs based on MTW PHAs' policies. Changes being considered for HUD rental assistance programs include biennial inspections, alternate income documentation, streamlined rent calculation, higher minimum rents, expanded authority for PHAs to replace public housing with project-based assistance, and blending of operating and capital funding. While some reforms based on the MTW demonstration have bipartisan support, controversial policies remain, particularly those related to changing the amount of assistance. Tenant advocates and researchers have concerns about controversial policies in HUD rental assistance programs, including changing assistance amounts and imposing conditions like time limits and work requirements. They question the effects of these policies on tenant outcomes and the overall goals of the demonstration."
