    "content": "Presumptions of service connection for diseases associated with service in the armed forces and exposure to biological, chemical, or other toxic agents under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Project 112. Presumption of service connection for diseases associated with Project 112 is established, allowing for certain diseases to be considered service-connected even without evidence during the period of service. The Secretary can presume service connection for diagnosed diseases related to Project 112 if there is increased exposure to toxic agents during military service. The disease must manifest within a specified period for veterans who participated in Project 112. Veterans who served on active duty and were exposed to chemical or biological warfare tests under Project 112 are presumed to have been exposed to toxic agents associated with their disease. The regulations prescribe a presumption of service connection for diseases associated with exposure to toxic agents during military service, based on sound medical and scientific evidence of a positive association. A positive association exists between exposure to toxic agents during military service and the occurrence of diagnosed diseases in humans or animals. The Secretary considers sound medical and scientific information when making determinations for service connection. The Secretary evaluates reports for determinations based on statistical significance, replication capability, and peer review. A positive association between disease occurrence and exposure to toxic agents is considered if credible evidence outweighs evidence against it. Removal of service connection presumption can occur under certain circumstances. The removal of service connection presumption for a disease under this section allows veterans and survivors to continue receiving compensation or indemnity based on the presumption before the effective date of the removal. The term 'Project 112' is defined in this section. Project 112 is defined as the chemical and biological weapons program conducted by the Department of Defense or other federal agencies from 1963 to 1973, including Project SHAD. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the chapter. Presumptions of service connection for illnesses related to chemical or biological warfare tests or projects are established. Regulations, personnel records, and a report concerning Project 112 are addressed. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must create regulations within 180 days to notify veterans potentially exposed to biological or chemical agents during Project 112. The Secretary of Defense must provide all records of personnel exposed within 30 days. A report must be submitted within 1 year of enactment. The Secretary of Defense, with input from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment regarding Project 112. The report should detail costs, benefits, challenges of finding more Project 112 participants, provide all known information about participants, and address concerns from the Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans, and veterans service organizations. Project 112 is defined as the chemical and biological weapons program conducted by the Department of Defense and other federal agencies from 1963 to 1973, including Project SHAD."
