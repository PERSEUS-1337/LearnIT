    "content": "Both chambers of Congress have passed legislation to reauthorize expiring programs at the FDA and expand the agency's authority. The bills are S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, representing the most comprehensive FDA legislation since 1997. The primary focus is renewing FDA's authority for key user fee programs set to expire. The FDA urged Congress to reauthorize key user fee programs before their expiration at the end of FY2007 to avoid layoffs and funding uncertainty, leading to a hiring freeze and morale issues at the agency. The FDA Commissioner emphasized that funding uncertainty is affecting employee morale, with 30% eligible for retirement. The bills would reauthorize expiring authorities related to pediatric pharmaceuticals, including the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act. Additionally, the bills address various other concerns of Congress and the public regarding FDA regulation of human foods, animal feeds, and cosmetics. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of human drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. Products must be reviewed and approved by the FDA before they can be sold, with postmarket surveillance conducted. The agency can withdraw unsafe products from the market. The FDA has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from the market, including food, drugs, and medical devices. Congressional attention has been drawn to the FDA's performance and funding for its statutory responsibilities. The 110th Congress is focusing on balancing the need for the agency to speed up safe products to market while also correcting or removing unsafe products. The FDA's ability to ensure product safety and protect public health is a key issue for human foods, animal feeds, and other products. Congress has authorized FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers to speed up product approval, but some question the agency's reliance on these fees. Reauthorizing user fee authorities (PDUFA and MDUFMA) is a current focus. Efforts are underway to reauthorize the expiring user fee authorities PDUFA and MDUFMA, which contribute significantly to FDA's revenue and budget. PDUFA and MDUFMA fees make up 87% of FDA's user fee revenue and 19% of its total budget in FY2008. PDUFA was first enacted in 1992 and has been reauthorized twice. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-188) reauthorized the user fee authorities PDUFA and MDUFMA. PDUFA allows FDA to collect fees from drug companies for new product applications, while MDUFMA established user fees for medical device applications. Both acts include performance goals to reduce FDA review times. In 1997, Congress gave FDA a tool, in BPCA, to encourage pediatric drug testing to address the lack of information on appropriate dosage levels and potential side effects of medications for children. This was in response to the challenges faced by clinicians when prescribing medications to pediatric patients. In 1997, Congress enacted BPCA to promote pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity for trials on pediatric populations. FDA's efforts to mandate assessments of new drugs' effects on children were initially halted by courts until Congress passed PREA in 2003, codifying the requirement. BPCA and PREA incentivize and mandate studies on pediatric use of both patented and off-patent drugs. Developing medical devices for children is reported to be less profitable. Developing medical devices for children is less profitable and more challenging than for adults due to fewer children needing devices and their unique physical attributes. There is a critical need for pediatric medical devices to diagnose and treat diseases. Legislation offers incentives for manufacturers to create pediatric devices and gives FDA authority to require postmarket studies for approved devices. The FDA has the authority to require postmarket studies for approved pediatric devices to ensure their safety and efficacy. Adverse effects of medical products may not become apparent until a product is on the market, either due to a long period of manifestation or rarity. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 address these issues. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to strengthen the FDA's data collection system for identifying adverse effects of marketed products and granting new authorities to enforce actions by manufacturers. Medical journals tend to publish positive clinical trial results, leading to underreporting of negative studies by product manufacturers. In 2004, concerns were raised about the safety and effectiveness of FDA-approved biomedical products with undisclosed negative trial results. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 address public access to clinical trial results and FDA's use of advisory committees for expert advice on drugs and medical devices. FDA advisory committees provide recommendations to the FDA on human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, and food. Concerns have been raised about conflicts of interest among committee members, with some reports suggesting bias towards drug approval. Proposed legislation aims to revise FDA's approach to addressing these issues. In 2004, FDA investigated the decline in innovative medical products submitted for approval, noting the challenges in medical product development. The agency called for modernizing scientific tools and utilizing bioinformation to address the issue. The creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation is proposed in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 to support the FDA in utilizing bioinformation for evaluating and predicting the safety, effectiveness, and manufacturability of medical products. The high cost of prescription drugs in the US has led some consumers to seek medications from foreign sources, but current regulations only permit drug manufacturers to import them. The law prohibits drug importation from foreign sources not subject to the same safety standards as FDA-regulated manufacturers. Some lawmakers aim to allow access to lower-priced medications while ensuring safety. S. 1082 includes provisions for regulating importation of prescription drugs, but an amendment requiring HHS Secretary certification may nullify the detailed importation language. The FDA's responsibility for regulating food safety has evolved since 1906, addressing issues with food products and additives. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have raised concerns about both domestic and imported food safety. Provisions in S. 1082 aim to reform food safety, addressing larger issues in the system. The safety provisions in S. 1082 aim to address key issues in food safety reform. The FDA reauthorization and reform bills cover various topics, but not always in the same way. Topics include prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, drug safety, conflicts of interest, importation of prescription drugs, and food safety. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) gives FDA the authority to collect user fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers to expedite the approval process for new drugs. The program, first enacted in 1992, is set to expire on October 1, 2007, unless Congress reauthorizes it. PDUFA aims to shorten the time between a manufacturer's application submission and the FDA's decision on product approval. PDUFA restricted the use of collected funds to new product review and established performance goals for review times. Application review times decreased, and fee revenue raised premarket review activities. Congress gave FDA limited authority to use fees for postmarket drug safety activities in reauthorizing PDUFA in 1997 and 2002. The 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization discussions focus on postmarket drug safety due to recent safety problems with marketed drugs. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007, reauthorizing application, establishment, and product fees for prescription and nonprescription drugs. They expand the use of fees for postmarket safety activities, including adverse event data. Both the Senate and House bills propose using fee revenues of $393 million annually for postmarket drug safety activities, including adverse event data collection systems and improved analytical tools. The House bill includes additional requirements for adverse event reporting to the HHS Secretary and the public, as well as adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent costs. The House bill also exempts certain products and facilities from fees. The House and Senate bills propose using fee revenues for postmarket drug safety activities. The House bill exempts certain products and facilities from fees and adds a new section for assessing fees for drug advertisement reviews. The Senate bill proposes codifying core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, requiring annual reports to Congress and consultation for PDUFA reauthorization. The Senate bill proposes codifying core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, requiring annual reports to Congress and consultation for PDUFA reauthorization. In contrast, the House bill would include reauthorization and report requirements but would not amend the FFDCA to include them. It would also require the Secretary to publicly release negotiation minutes before presenting recommendations to Congress. The FDA website will make minutes of agency negotiations with the regulated industry and advocacy groups public. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 introduced user fees for device reviews, allowed third-party inspections, and imposed new regulations on reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority to collect user fees will expire soon. The FDA's authority to collect user fees for medical devices will expire on October 1, 2007, unless reauthorized by Congress through bills like S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. These bills also include provisions related to the regulation of medical devices. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization of FDA user fees for medical devices through FY2012. The bills include provisions to lower fee amounts for FY2008, with an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012, and introduce new types of fees. Government entities would be exempt from establishment fees, with H.R. 2900 extending this waiver to Indian tribes. The Secretary could increase the establishment fee in FY2010 by an additional 8.5% if fewer than 12,250 establishments paid the fee in FY2009. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose extending FDA user fees for medical devices through FY2012. The bills aim to ensure a certain level of medical device-related direct appropriations for the Secretary to assess fees and meet performance goals. They also suggest changes in how fees collected between FY2008 and FY2011 are considered, with a potential reduction in fees in the final year if collections exceed the authorized amount. H.R. 2900 proposes authorizing appropriations for postmarket safety information on medical devices and removing a provision for adjusting premarket notification fees annually. It also includes provisions for reducing fees for small businesses and maintaining a reference to the deleted provision in the Fee Amounts section. The bills propose changes to small business qualifications, refund policies for modular applications, and annual reporting requirements for the Secretary. H.R. 2900 focuses on postmarket safety activities, while S. 1082 includes information on previous cohorts of medical device applications. Both bills would require information on previous cohorts of medical device applications, make reports public, consult with various groups, publish recommendations, allow for public comments, hold public meetings, revise recommendations based on feedback, transmit recommendations to Congress, and specify consultation requirements in the FFDCA. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 would amend medical device regulations, with user fee provisions taking effect upon enactment. S. 1082's provisions start on October 1, 2007, and include a savings clause for fee collection continuity. H.R. 2900 mandates a study on nosocomial infections related to medical devices. Both bills extend third-party review authority for premarket notifications from FY2007 to FY2012. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 would extend third-party review authority for premarket notifications from FY2007 to FY2012. The bills also aim to revise requirements for inspections by accredited third parties, including reducing administrative burdens, expanding participation, and allowing device companies to submit reports by third parties assessing conformance with international quality standards. FDA would consider these reports in setting inspection priorities. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to extend third-party review authority for premarket notifications and revise requirements for inspections by accredited third parties. The bills would restrict the registration period for device producers and amend electronic registration regulations to require electronic filing as a default, with S. 1082 adding a feasibility requirement for electronic information receipt. Off-label prescribing of adult-approved drugs for children can lead to ineffective treatment or incorrect dosages due to unique side effects in children. Drug metabolism in children varies based on organ maturation and other factors, affecting drug effectiveness and safety. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivized drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies by adding six months to market exclusivity for patented products. For off-patent drugs, BPCA required the Secretary to identify products needing pediatric studies for safety and effectiveness. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) authorized NIH funding for pediatric studies and reauthorized exclusivity provisions for on-patent drugs. FDA's Pediatric Rule mandated manufacturers to submit pediatric testing data with new drug applications, but it was declared invalid in 2002. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) was enacted in 2003 to give FDA authority over pediatric drug testing. It covers drugs and biological products, includes provisions for deferrals and waivers, and requires pediatric assessment of approved products. PREA does not have a specific sunset date and remains in effect as long as BPCA is authorized. Bills like S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize BPCA for another five years and encourage research on off-patent products. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize BPCA for another five years and encourage research on off-patent products. They also seek to strengthen labeling requirements based on pediatric studies and expand FDA's authority under PREA for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. The key difference between the Senate and House bills is the period of exclusivity, with S. 1082 proposing a reduction to three months for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. sales. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize BPCA for another five years and encourage research on off-patent products. They also seek to strengthen labeling requirements based on pediatric studies and expand FDA's authority under PREA for pediatric assessments of new drugs and biologics. H.R. 2900 would eliminate the provision tying PREA's authorities to BPCA authorization, while S. 1082 would maintain that connection. Both bills incorporate legislation to encourage medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products. The legislation aims to amend the FFDCA by modifying the humanitarian device exemption (HDE) to encourage manufacturers to develop medical devices for small markets, assisting patients with rare diseases. Specifically, the legislation would exempt some manufacturers of pediatric devices for small populations from the general HDE prohibition on selling a device for an amount that exceeds its costs. The bills aim to extend the exemption for manufacturers of pediatric medical devices from the general prohibition on selling devices for more than their costs. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include inspection authorities, guidance, and reporting requirements for the exemption. Additionally, they require the NIH Director to designate a contact point for funding pediatric medical device research, and H.R. 2900 also mandates the FDA Commissioner to submit a plan for expanding pediatric medical device research. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand pediatric medical device research and development by establishing demonstration projects and connecting innovators with manufacturers. The bills require coordination with NIH and FDA, with S. 1082 also mandating grantees to report annually on their effectiveness and device development status. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 authorize funding for pediatric medical device research and development, with a focus on demonstration projects and collaboration with NIH and FDA. Grantees are required to report annually on their effectiveness and device development status. The bills also expand the authority of the Secretary to conduct postmarket surveillance measures. The bills authorize funding for pediatric medical device research and development, with a focus on collaboration with NIH and FDA. They expand the Secretary's authority to require postmarket studies for pediatric medical devices, including those indicated for pediatric populations and devices expected to have significant use in pediatric populations. Studies may exceed the general 36-month limitation if necessary to assess the impact on pediatric populations' growth and development. H.R. 2900 includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers. Since 1938, the FDA has required drug manufacturers to demonstrate safety before approval for marketing in the US. The 1962 Harris-Kefauver Amendments added product effectiveness to premarket requirements. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 continued the focus on premarket review. However, rare adverse effects may not be recognized until a large number of individuals have taken a drug. The FDA cannot guarantee the complete safety of any drug, but assesses if it is safe enough for specific individuals and conditions. Recent research has shown that some widely used drugs may be more dangerous than previously thought, raising concerns about industry transparency. The FDA's handling of drug safety was questioned due to industry's lack of transparency and concerns about the agency's authority and resources. In response, the Institute of Medicine conducted a 2006 report addressing organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aimed to enhance FDA's actions to protect the public. The proposed legislation (Title IX, Enhanced Authorities Regarding Postmarket Safety of Drugs) aims to give the FDA new authorities to address postmarket drug safety issues. Both Senate and House bills require the establishment of public-private partnerships for a postmarket risk identification system. FDA currently lacks the authority to mandate postmarket studies after initial drug approval. The proposed legislation aims to strengthen FDA's postmarket safety activities with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Both Senate and House bills would authorize the Secretary to require sponsors to submit a proposed REMS, with differences in criteria. The House and Senate bills authorize the Secretary to require a REMS for drugs if new safety information or serious risks are identified, with differences in criteria for when a REMS is necessary. Both House and Senate bills authorize the Secretary to require a REMS for drugs, covering new indications, generic products, and core elements like timeframes and monitoring. Waivers for certain medical countermeasures during public health emergencies are allowed. The Senate bill includes a mechanism for access to drugs with REMS for off-label use. The proposed REMS process by would ensure access to drugs for off-label use for serious conditions. Both Senate and House bills include structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement. They also establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board for reviews and assessments. The bills propose the creation of a Safety Oversight Board to resolve disputes between the Secretary and a product's sponsor. They require evaluation of REMS elements for drug safety and potential burdens on the healthcare system. The Secretary may require postapproval studies or trials, with criteria differing between the bills. The Senate bill requires the Secretary to assess serious risks with drug use and identify unexpected risks in a population. The House bill authorizes postapproval studies to assess known risks or signals of serious risk. Both bills require notification of new safety information between the sponsor and the Secretary. The House bill sets up a process for sponsors and the Secretary to address disagreements on labeling changes based on new safety information. If a sponsor continues to disagree, the Secretary may deem the drug misbranded. Time limits are included for both sponsor and Secretary in making labeling changes. Both the House and Senate bills propose time limits for sponsors and the Secretary to order labeling changes, along with a dispute resolution procedure. They also authorize the Secretary to review certain advertisements before dissemination, with different criteria for decision-making. The House bill focuses on television ads and allows the Secretary to recommend changes, while the Senate bill applies to all advertisements without media distinctions. Both bills require a clear presentation of side effects and contraindications, with the Secretary able to impose civil monetary penalties for violations. Both House and Senate bills propose civil monetary penalties for violations of certain requirements, with fines of up to $250,000 per violation and up to $1 million for violations in a single proceeding. The House bill includes additional penalties for ongoing violations, while the Secretary could fine sponsors up to $1 million per day for violations posing a substantial threat to public health. The House and Senate bills propose civil penalties for violations of drug safety requirements, with fines of up to $1 million per day for violations posing a substantial threat to public health. The House bill prohibits marketing products with REMS if not in compliance, while the Senate bill authorizes fines of up to $150,000 for a first violation. The Senate bill proposes lower fines for drug safety violations, with fines of up to $150,000 for a first violation and up to $300,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills would increase appropriations for drug safety provisions, with the Senate bill allocating $225 million over FYs 2008 through 2012 for drug safety activities. The House bill, on the other hand, would authorize appropriations of $125 million over a five-year period. The House bill proposes appropriations of $125 million over five years for clinical trials of antibiotic drugs and orphan drug development. The Senate bill includes provisions for antibiotics as orphan products, with $35 million authorized annually for grants and contracts. Additionally, the Senate bill offers incentives for the development of certain antibiotics. The Senate bill offers incentives for the development of certain antibiotics, including requiring standardized packaging with counterfeit-resistant technologies. The House bill focuses on securing the distribution system against counterfeit drugs and includes provisions for drug safety reports and studies. The House bill focuses on drug safety in direct-to-consumer ads, requiring reporting of adverse effects to the FDA. The Senate bill includes provisions for an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and extensive drug safety information on a website. The Senate bill includes provisions for state-legalized medical marijuana to be subject to FDA regulations, priority review vouchers for neglected or tropical disease products, and the creation of a list of authorized generic drugs on the FDA website. The FDA website lists authorized generic drugs and implements measures to prevent citizen petitions from delaying agency decisions. Clinical trial registration requirements were established by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 for drugs treating serious or life-threatening conditions. Expansion proposals are included in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose expanding clinical trial registration requirements to include all drugs, devices, and biologics, not just those for life-threatening conditions. H.R. 2900 delays public release of medical device information until FDA approval. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements to cover all drugs, devices, and biologics. H.R. 2900 delays the public release of medical device information until FDA approval. S. 1082 would exempt pediatric postmarket surveillance trials from registry requirements and allow voluntary registration of non-mandatory trials. Both bills link certain requirements to the trial completion date and mandate compliance from the responsible party. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements for drugs, devices, and biologics. H.R. 2900 specifically requires that a principal investigator have control over data and the right to publish trial results to serve as RP. Both bills mandate that the registry be searchable in specific ways and require submitted information to include elements of the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform data set. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 both aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements. H.R. 2900 requires disclosure of agreements restricting discussion of trial results, with updates every six months. S. 1082 specifies additional search criteria and a timeline for public registry information release. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to expand clinical trial registration requirements. H.R. 2900 provides specific instructions for creating a public database of clinical trial results, while S. 1082 requires the Secretary to establish a database based on NIH Director recommendations. H.R. 2900 specifies searchable categories, timing of submissions, and the need for truthful and regularly updated information. H.R. 2900 requires truthful and regularly updated information to be posted in a public database of clinical trial results. The bill also mandates that pre-approval study results, including NSE letters for medical devices, be made public within 30 days. The issuance of an NSE letter does not mark the conclusion of an FDA application for a device manufacturer; they may still apply for premarket approval. This could lead to the public disclosure of clinical trial information for a device with pending FDA action. A provision allows for a posting delay of up to two years for studies on new uses of drugs or devices already on the market if a filing for a new use is imminent. Both bills have provisions for coordination, compliance, and enforcement. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 have compliance and enforcement provisions related to registry and results database requirements. H.R. 2900 includes enforcement measures and coordination between registry and results database, while S. 1082 focuses on registry provisions. One dropped provision from H.R. 2900 specified that the act would not affect existing legal agreements. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 have enforcement provisions for registry requirements. H.R. 2900 specifies penalties of $10,000 per day, capping at $15,000 for individuals and nonprofits, while S. 1082 allows penalties of $10,000 for a first violation. The proposed amendments to the FFDCA would allow penalties of $10,000 for a first violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 contain provisions affecting FDA's handling of conflicts of interest in advisory committees, requiring committee members to disclose conflicts and refrain from voting if necessary. The law governing conflicts of interest in FDA advisory committees is primarily found in the Federal Advisory Committee Act, FDA advisory committee policy, and laws governing special government employees. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to the recruitment process for committee members and the granting of conflict-of-interest waivers. These changes would be effective from October 1, 2007. The new provisions in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would expand conflict-of-interest requirements to all advisory committees, not just drug and biologic ones. Financial interests are defined as current or future employment, trusteeship, or directorship, but not stock ownership or past employment. The new provisions in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 expand conflict-of-interest requirements to all advisory committees, not just drug and biologic ones. They focus on recruiting experts from academia, medical research institutions, and public interest groups while discouraging financial conflict waivers. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand conflict-of-interest requirements for all advisory committees, not just drug and biologic ones. They would require full financial disclosure from committee members and restrict voting by those with conflicts of interest, allowing waivers only in cases of essential expertise. H.R. 2900 limits waivers to one per meeting and mandates public disclosures. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand conflict-of-interest requirements for all advisory committees, requiring full financial disclosure and restricting voting by members with conflicts of interest. Waivers would be limited to one per meeting, with public disclosures mandated. Annual reports on conflict-of-interest determinations and waivers would be required, along with updates to FDA guidance every five years. Additionally, a nonprofit corporation would be established to advance FDA's mission on product development, innovation, and safety, with the initial Board of Directors selecting appointed members. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand conflict-of-interest requirements for advisory committees. A nonprofit corporation would be established to advance FDA's mission, with the initial Board of Directors selecting appointed members from a candidate list provided by the National Academy of Sciences. The ongoing board would include representatives from various organizations and agencies, and the Foundation would coordinate with federal programs to address unmet needs through grants, contracts, and agreements. The House and Senate bills would direct the Commissioner to transfer funds to the Foundation. The Senate and House bills aim to transfer funds to the Foundation and establish an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA. S. 1082 includes provisions for drug importation not present in H.R. 2900. The Senate bill includes provisions for drug importation, which would allow commercial and personal-use importation with detailed procedures addressing safety, effectiveness, cost savings, and program administration. The Senate added a second-degree amendment requiring certification from the HHS Secretary for the provision to take effect. Title VI of S. 1082 addresses food safety by establishing regulations for pet food processing and ingredient standards, nutrient information on labels, and an early warning system. H.R. 2900 does not include any food provisions. The Secretary would establish an early warning system to detect pet food adulteration and disease outbreaks. They would also coordinate recall information, alert the public, and improve food safety programs for produce. Title VI of S. 1082 proposes creating a registry for adulterated food, requiring the Secretary to validate information before listing it. Alerts would be issued for food linked to repeated outbreaks or reportable adulteration. The responsible party for adulterated food would be identified. The bill proposes regulations for reporting adulterated food, requiring responsible parties to maintain records and report to FDA. Deliberate adulteration incidents must also be reported to the Department of Homeland Security. The Secretary would establish standards for reporting suspected adulteration cases and notification procedures, with an annual report to Congress on food imports and enforcement. Certain provisions in S. 1082 Title V would require reports on food issues such as pesticide residue monitoring, health hazards from substances used to preserve fresh meat, and the performance of the color additive certification program. The curr_chunk discusses various food-related provisions in S. 1082, including the color additive certification program, environmental risks of genetically engineered seafood, marketing of crustaceans, detection of risks, and authorization of appropriations for inspection regimes. It also mentions the prohibition on importing from foreign food facilities that deny access to U.S. inspectors and the authorization for enhancing FDA inspection regimes through partnerships. S. 1082 includes provisions such as enabling the sale of pet turtles with sanitization requirements, reports on genetic test safety, FDA report on tanning device labeling and skin cancer link, and expressing the Senate's sense on FDA regulation of follow-on biologics. The Senate bill includes provisions on genetic test safety, tanning device labeling, and FDA regulation of follow-on biologics. The House bill addresses public-private partnerships for pharmaceutical intellectual property rights. The FDA Critical Path Initiative encourages partnerships with educational or tax-exempt organizations to foster medical product innovation, accelerate development, and enhance safety. $5 million is authorized for FY2008, with additional funding for FYs 2009 through 2012."
