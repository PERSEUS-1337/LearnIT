Congress funds programs to improve STEM skills and encourage students to pursue degrees in science and engineering. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to promote STEM education and make changes to immigration policies related to visas and residency to address the U.S. S&E workforce needs. Congress is also funding programs to support graduate and postgraduate research experiences at U.S. colleges and universities. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to promote STEM education and address the nation's needs for scientists and engineers. Key factors examined for evidence of labor shortages include employment growth, wage growth, and unemployment rates. The report provides employment, wage, and unemployment information for various S&E occupations in 2016. The report presents occupational employment, wage, and unemployment data for the S&E workforce in 2016. It includes recent trends in employment, wages, and unemployment from 2012-2016, employment projections for 2016-2026, and stakeholder perspectives for Congress to consider. \"Concluding Observations\" offers stakeholder perspectives for Congress to ensure an adequate S&E workforce for the 21st century. There is no definitive definition of the S&E workforce, with variations in occupations included in different analyses. The Bureau of Labor Statistics defined STEM occupations in 2011 for specific analyses. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines STEM occupations for analysis, noting variations in workforce size. The National Science Board (NSB) reported in 2016 that the S&E workforce ranges from 6 million to over 21 million depending on the definition used. When defined by occupation, the S&E workforce totals between 6.2 million and 6.3 million people. The U.S. S&E workforce totals between 6.2 million and 6.3 million people, focusing on computer, mathematical, engineering, and physical science occupations. Excluded are social scientists and S&E-related technicians. The S&E workforce in 2016 was approximately 6.9 million, categorized into six occupational groups including computer occupations. The S&E workforce in 2016 consisted of various occupational groups including computer occupations, mathematical occupations, and engineers in different specializations. The S&E workforce in 2016 included engineers in various specializations, life scientists, and physical scientists such as astronomers, physicists, chemists, and environmental scientists. The S&E workforce in 2016 included engineers, life scientists, and physical scientists. The report provides a description of detailed occupations and educational composition for various science and engineering managers. Data is sourced from federal government sources like the Occupational Employment Statistics survey. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment and wage data for the 2012-2016 period, covering over 800 occupations. The survey defines \"employees\" as part-time and full-time workers paid a wage or salary, excluding self-employed individuals. The wage statistic used is the occupational \"mean wage,\" calculated by averaging the wages of all employees in a given occupation. The Current Population Survey (CPS) by the Bureau of the Census is the source of unemployment data for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). BLS's Employment Projections provide occupational and industry employment data for 10-year periods. The Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey offers data on occupational staffing patterns in industries. The Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey provides data on occupational staffing patterns in industries, while Current Employment Statistics (CES) data offer information on total wage and salary employment in nonfarm industries. The employment projections also include agricultural industry employment and self-employed individuals to determine base year employment levels for each occupation. The \"Recent Trends in Employment, Wages, and Unemployment\" section highlights changes from 2012 to 2016, while the \"Employment Projections, 2016-2026\" section relies on Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The \"Employment Projections, 2016-2026\" section is based on the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics projections for the 2016-2026 timeframe. Various factors such as economic conditions, technology development, funding for research, and changes in labor force skills can impact the size and composition of the U.S. S&E workforce. The report discusses the factors influencing the size and skills of the foreign-born labor force in the United States and changes in business practices related to foreign-based science and engineering capabilities. The OES data methodology is detailed but may not be suitable for comparing data over time due to various challenges. The OES data faces challenges in using it as a time series due to changes in classification systems, data collection methods, survey reference periods, and wage estimation methodologies. To ensure comparability, CRS analyzed trends from 2012-2016. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses occupational categories based on the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification for employment projections. Estimates consider population size, labor force participation rates, economic growth, technological innovation, and other factors. The Bureau of Labor Statistics updated its methodology for estimating occupational separations in its 2016-2026 projections, replacing the previous method due to identified issues compromising accuracy and validity of estimates. The Bureau of Labor Statistics updated its methodology for estimating occupational separations in its 2016-2026 projections, replacing the previous method that compromised accuracy and validity. Factors affecting occupational projections include changes in immigration laws, trade laws, technology, and consumer tastes. The BLS evaluates projection accuracy regularly and provides a snapshot of the S&E workforce in 2016. In 2016, 6.9 million people in the United States were employed as scientists and engineers, accounting for 4.9% of total U.S. employment.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' occupational employment projections for 2016-2026 show that S&E occupations had comparable or higher unemployment rates than selected professional occupations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a growth in the science and engineering workforce from 7.3 million to 8.2 million jobs between 2016 and 2026, with an increase of 853,600 jobs. Additionally, 1.439 million scientists and engineers are expected to exit the workforce during this period. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a growth in the science and engineering workforce from 7.3 million to 8.2 million jobs between 2016 and 2026, with an increase of 853,600 jobs. There will be nearly 2.3 million S&E job openings created by job growth and workforce exits, with an additional 3.7 million openings from occupational transfers. The projections do not include data on new workers needed for these openings. According to BLS, science and engineering job openings will be filled by workers transferring from S&E and non-S&E occupations. The projections methodology allows for multiple occupational transfers during the 10-year period. Employment projections for S&E occupational groups are provided in Table 10. Table 10 shows employment projections for science and engineering (S&E) occupational groups, including actual and projected employment numbers, total job changes, annual growth rates, occupational separations, and job openings. Computer occupations are expected to have the largest increase in employed individuals, as well as the highest numbers of labor force exits and occupational transfers. Computer occupations are projected to account for 64.0% of the total growth in S&E occupations between 2016 and 2026, increasing their share to 58.6% in 2026. Mathematical occupations are expected to have the fastest employment growth, with their share rising slightly from 2.5% in 2016 to 2.8% in 2026. S&E Managers, Engineers, and Life Scientists are projected to have a smaller share of total job growth compared to their 2016 employment share. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a decrease in the share of total job growth for S&E Managers, Engineers, and Life Scientists compared to their 2016 employment share. Additionally, the number of new jobs created in S&E occupations is expected to be less than twice the number needed to replace those exiting the workforce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a decrease in job growth for S&E Managers, Engineers, and Life Scientists. The number of new jobs created in S&E occupations is expected to be less than twice the number needed to replace those exiting the workforce. Labor force exits exceed projected new jobs in most S&E occupational groups, except for mathematical occupations where job growth is expected to exceed exits. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects job growth, labor force exits, and occupational transfers for S&E occupations from 2016-2026. Table 11 shows the top 10 S&E occupations with the highest projected job growth, accounting for 71.5% of total growth. The top 10 S&E occupations with the highest projected job growth from 2016-2026 account for 71.5% of total growth. Seven of these occupations are in computer-related fields, with the remaining three in civil and mechanical engineering. The list of occupations with the smallest projected growth includes computer programmers, the only occupation expected to see a reduction in jobs. The fastest-growing S&E occupations include statisticians, software developers (applications), and mathematicians, with growth rates ranging from 2.6% to 2.9% CAGR. These occupations are projected to grow faster than the overall job growth rate for all occupations. The list also includes computer, physical sciences, and engineering occupations.

The 10 slowest-growing S&E occupations include engineering and life sciences roles, with growth rates ranging from -0.8% to 0.6% CAGR. Among the 10 occupations with the fewest projected job openings, five are computer occupations, three are engineering occupations, and one is a mathematical occupation. These 10 occupations account for less than 1% of all S&E job openings during the projection period. The U.S. science and engineering workforce is crucial for technological leadership, innovation, and national defense. Congress has implemented programs to support STEM education and improve skills for more students to pursue S&E degrees. Some policymakers aim to increase the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the US through visa and immigration policy changes. Views on the adequacy of the S&E workforce and related policy issues vary among policymakers, business leaders, academicians, and economists. There is a debate in the United States about a potential shortage of scientists and engineers, with differing views on whether the federal government should intervene or let market forces address the issue. The debate in the United States revolves around the potential shortage of scientists and engineers. Contrary to claims of a broad shortage, indicators like employment growth and wage growth do not support this. However, increasing the number of scientists and engineers is still necessary for U.S. innovation and economic growth. Increasing the number of U.S. scientists and engineers is crucial for innovation, economic performance, and job creation. S&E degrees provide valuable skills for various occupations, including problem-solving and critical thinking. Government interventions to address perceived shortages may lead to inefficiencies. Government efforts to increase scientists and engineers may lead to inefficiencies in the labor market, such as an oversupply of S&E graduates and lower salaries. Workforce projections are unreliable for predicting shortages, resulting in mismatches between education and market needs. Short-term projections for workforce shortages in certain industries or fields may be unreliable due to various factors such as technological changes, factor substitution, retirement behavior, and government policies. Shortages may occur in new and emerging S&E fields, cyclical industries, and fields where foreign scientists and engineers are not employed. The labor market will resolve workforce shortages in industries where foreign scientists are not employed or where only U.S. citizens can be hired. Government interventions are needed to address shortages, which can be resolved through market signals, increased supply, or alternative inputs. The curr_chunk discusses how government interventions are necessary to address shortages in the workforce, particularly in new and emerging fields. Industry claims of shortages are driven by a desire to lower costs and increase current knowledge through hiring younger, lower-cost workers. The real issue is a skills mismatch, not a shortage of workers. The difficulty employers face in meeting their workforce needs is due to a skills mismatch, not a shortage of workers. Expanding immigration can help address this issue by bringing in foreign scientists and engineers to work in the U.S. economy. Expanding immigration to bring in foreign scientists and engineers may depress wages, increase unemployment, and reduce career opportunities for U.S. scientists and engineers. This could also discourage American students from pursuing S&E degrees and careers. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education in the U.S. as American students lag behind their foreign counterparts in STEM knowledge. This disparity may lead to a shortage of skilled scientists and engineers, lower economic growth, and reduced competitiveness. Federal policies and programs can help strengthen K-12 STEM education in the country. International assessments do not accurately reflect the adequacy of U.S. student STEM knowledge. Tests comparing STEM knowledge of U.S. K-12 students to other nations may not accurately reflect their preparation for S&E degrees and future capabilities. Different perspectives on federal government's role in developing the S&E workforce include increasing students pursuing S&E degrees, admitting foreign scientists, and promoting diversity in science and engineering. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of improving diversity in science and engineering, enhancing K-12 STEM education, and providing better career counseling for high school students to bolster U.S. competitiveness. It also mentions the publication of data on the educational composition of occupations by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The curr_chunk uses ACS data to illustrate the occupational composition of S&E occupations. It aggregates educational levels below associate's degrees into a category called \"Less than an Associate's degree.\" A crosswalk of SOC codes to ACS codes is provided at the end of the appendix. The category includes educational levels such as \"less than high school diploma,\" \"high school diploma or equivalent,\" and \"some college, no degree.\""
