    "content": "The bill may be cited as the \"Freedom to Fish Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that recreational fishing is a popular outdoor sport with over 50 million participants nationwide, contributing $116 billion annually to the economy and supporting over 1.2 million jobs in the United States. Recreational anglers contribute over $500 million annually to State fisheries conservation programs, demonstrating a strong conservation ethic. Federal policies support public access to public lands and waters. The federal policy supports public access to public lands and waters for recreational purposes in line with conservation principles. Various management measures can maintain recreational fishery resources without limiting public access to fishing areas. A clear policy is needed to manage recreational fishing without unnecessary restrictions, including gear adaptations and closed seasons. Additionally, a comprehensive policy on marine protected areas is necessary to balance recreational fishing with sustaining fishery resources. The policy of the United States aims to promote conservation of fishery resources by ensuring access for recreational anglers, involving them in regulatory procedures, and imposing limitations only when scientifically necessary for conservation. SEC. 4. MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT AMENDMENTS. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to limit closures for recreational fishing areas unless there is clear evidence that recreational fishing is causing a specific conservation issue and no other conservation measures are effective. The management plan must include specific measurable criteria to assess conservation benefits and require a review every 3 years. The closure of areas to recreational fishing must be supported by scientific evidence and lifted as soon as possible. The prohibition on fishing is lifted when the condition for the prohibition no longer exists. Technical amendments are made to paragraphs 13 and 14 of the section. Amendment to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act is made. Amendment to Section 304(a)(5) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows Regional Fishery Management Council to draft fishing regulations for the exclusive economic zone. The Council can draft fishing regulations for a fishery within a State if approved by the Governor or determined by the Secretary after a hearing. The Secretary can regulate a fishery within a State if it substantially affects the goals of the Act, following notification and a hearing. The Secretary can regulate a fishery within a State if it substantially affects the goals of the Act, following notification and a hearing as per section 554 of title 5, United States Code. The Secretary can regulate a fishery within a State if it substantially affects the goals of the Act, following notification and a hearing. If the Secretary assumes responsibility for the regulation, the State can later apply for reinstatement of its authority over the fishery if the reasons for regulation no longer prevail. The Secretary can terminate a regulation if the reasons for regulation no longer prevail."
