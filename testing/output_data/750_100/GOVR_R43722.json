Offices of inspector general (OIGs) conduct audits, investigations, and may have law enforcement authority, including carrying firearms, making arrests without warrants, and executing warrants for arrest or search. Some OIGs have law enforcement authority to conduct investigations with potential safety risks. This report lists statutes and regulations granting OIGs law enforcement powers and resources supporting their need for such authority. Each federal agency, including OIGs, has a unique mission that justifies their law enforcement authority. The Social Security Administration's OIG has law enforcement authority and may release public statements to explain its need for weapons or ammunition. In August 2012, the OIG posted information on its blog regarding an ammunition purchase that drew public attention. Media reports raised concerns about the type of ammunition ordered, which is standard issue for many law enforcement agencies. OIG's special agents use this ammunition during their mandatory quarterly firearms training. The OIG's special agents use ammunition for mandatory firearms training to ensure safety. The procurement involved replacing automatic firearms with semi-automatic ones. The Inspector General Act of 1978 authorized OIG to pursue criminal activity, fraud, and abuses impairing USDA's program and operations. OIG investigations have resulted in over 2,000 indictments, 1,350 convictions, and over $460 million in monetary results. OIG Special Agents are authorized to make arrests, execute warrants, and carry firearms for conducting hundreds of criminal investigations each year. OIG special agents conduct criminal investigations involving fraud, theft, bribery, smuggling, and violence against USDA employees. They are authorized to make arrests, execute warrants, and carry firearms. An OIG can be granted law enforcement authority through the IG Act of 1978 or by the Attorney General. The IG Act directly provides law enforcement authority to 25 federal entities. The Attorney General can delegate law enforcement authority to OIGs in certain circumstances outlined in the IG Act. Law enforcement authority has been granted to OIGs in 10 federal agencies. The Attorney General can delegate law enforcement authority to OIGs in 10 federal agencies, including the National Archives, Amtrak, Peace Corps, Federal Reserve, and others. Guidelines were established by the Attorney General in 2003 to govern the use of law enforcement powers by these OIGs. In 2003, the Attorney General established guidelines for OIGs to govern their law enforcement authorities, including training requirements and adherence to DOJ's deadly force policy. The OIGs are trained in trial processes, legal updates, interviewing techniques, law of arrest, search, and seizure, as well as physical conditioning and defensive tactics. They must follow DOJ law enforcement policies, consult before using electronic surveillance, and obtain approval for undercover investigations. Five additional OIGs have law enforcement authority outside the IG Act. The Bureau of Justice Statistics maintains a Census on Federal Law Enforcement Officers. The most recent report on Enforcement Officers shows that 33 OIGs had 3,501 agents authorized to carry firearms in September 2008. No law enforcement officers within an OIG were assaulted or injured in 2008."
